Admission Date:  [**2179-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-10-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Lisinopril / Niacin / Meclizine / Ace Inhibitors / Paxil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: Black Tarry Stools   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Push enteroscopy- [**2179-10-1**] Placement of left nephrostomy tube- [**2179-10-1**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 38758**] is a 86 y/o woman with recent history of low crit who had swallow study today with GI at [**Hospital3 **] presenting for melena and weakness.
The patient reports she has been experiencing melena and weakness for the past 2 weeks in the setting of iron supplementation.
The patient also notes experiencing substernal discomfort similar to heartburn which has been occurring for the past week which was different in nature from her baseline heartburn symptoms.
She reports the pain occurred with laying down or on exertion, but states the pain was different in that it recurred intermittently in the past week which was different from baselien.
The day of presentation, the patient had undergone a capsule endoscopy and got home, noticed 2 episodes of black, tarry stool without any red blood.
She denies fevers, chills, vomiting, abd pain or SOB.
Of note she had a large diverticular bleed in [**Month (only) **] of this year which required 4 transfusions at [**Hospital6 **].
Colonocopy at the time showed diverticuli and EGD showed mild antral gastritis and duodenitis.
She had recently been undergoing an outpatient workup for worsening anemia and was due for initiation of aranesp shot tomorrow after having received IV Iron supplementation recently.
EKG showed new ST depressions in the inferolateral leads with Troponin of 0.06.
Cardiology evaluated the patient and felt that this was likely demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
CXR showed possible mild pulm edema, focal calcification R lower lung, likely scarring/atelectasis.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient denied symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, heartburn, or shortness of breath.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, or palpitations.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Normocytic Anemia: thought to be due to CKD/iron def Iron Deficiency: S/P Ferraheme X 2 in [**2179-8-9**] stage 4 CKD  thought to be due to hypertension and possibly diabetes.
Hypertension hyperlipidemia right knee arthritis gastroesophageal reflux disease mild aortic stenosis mild mitral regurgitation ?
mild type 2 diabetes (last A1C 6.2% not on any meds)   Social History: Lives alone with sons very supportive.
- Alcohol:  Denies   Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T: 96.7   BP: 122/66   P: 100   R: 22   PO2: 98% 2L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Pupils equal and round, sclera anicteric, MMM Neck: supple CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2, GIII crescendo-decrescendo murmer at RUSB radiating across the precordium, GII holosystolic murmer at the apex, no rubs or gallops Lungs: End inspiratory crackles at bases b/l, no wheezes or ronchi Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly Rectal: Guiac (+) with Black stool in ED Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
ECG [**9-22**]: Sinus tachycardia and occasional atrial ectopy.
There is new ST segment depression in leads I, aVL and V2-V6 consistent with active anterolateral ischemic process, in the context of the increase in rate.
TTE [**9-23**]: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Moderate calcific aortic stenosis.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6.8 cm abdominal mass, centered anterior/inferior to the aortic bifurcation, abutting small bowel loops anteriorly, and displacing the left ureter and left iliac vessels posteriorly.
Given the lack of associated bowel obstruction, this most likely represents small bowel lymphoma.
Moderate left hydronephrosis and hydroureter, secondary to compression from aforementioned small bowel mass.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Aortic atherosclerosis, with 2.3 cm infrarenal aortic ectasia.
Extensive lumbar degenerative change.
RENAL ULTRASOUND:FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 8.3 cm with no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses within it.
Moderate to severe hydronephrosis is detected in the left kidney with preservation of the left kidney cortex.
No stones or masses are seen within the left kidney.
A simple cyst is seen within the upper pole of the left kidney.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe hydronephrosis with hydroureter of the proximal and mid ureter.
Lungs are grossly clear except for minimal bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation is noted to suggest infectious process.
Minimal interstitial changes, most likely chronic cannot be ruled out.
A few small superficial nonbleeding ulcers at duodenal bulb.
There was slight oozing of blood and heme within the mass.
Multiple biopsies were taken from the mass with a cold biopsy forceps for histology.
H. PYLROI SEROLOGY: NEGATIVE  Brief Hospital Course: 86yoF with history of gastric polyp, recent diverticular bleed, progressive anemia, and CAD presenting for melena, anemia, and demand cardiac ischemia.
GI bleed: She presented with black tarry stool and negative [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric lavage in the ED.
She had recently had a capsule endoscopy that showed a possible necrotic bleeding mass in the small bowel.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was done that showed a 6.8cm small bowel tumor consistent with malignancy.
She remained stable in the MICU with plans to have push enteroscopy for biopsy after transfer to the medicine floor.
The patient underwent push enteroscopy [**2179-10-1**] which showed a malignant mass involving the entire circumference of the distal jejunum causing partially obstruction.
A biopsy was obtained; the final pathology report was pending on day of discharge, but prelim results showed poorly differentiated carcinoma, unclear if adenocarcinoma or lymphoid in origin.
NSTEMI:  She had ST depressions in the precordial and lateral leads on EKG and ruled in for NSTEMI.
It was felt this was likely demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and she was transfused to a hematocrit of 30.
Her ST depressions normalized with resolution of her anemia.
Serial EKGs were performed that showed stable Q waves in leads III and avF, with T wave inversion in leads V4-V6.
Cardiology was consulted to determine if the patient needed revascularization given the persistent T wave inversions on EKG.
Cardiology recommended no revascularization at the present time, given the presence of the mass in the patient's small bowel and that revascularization would delay work-up of the small bowel mass.
She had one episode of 9 beats of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Pt had no other significant events on telemetry.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  She had acute on chronic renal failure with Cr 3.2 and recently 3.4 on [**9-20**] from baseline of 2.4 on [**6-17**].
This was felt to be related to her recent GI bleed and renal hypoperfusion.
CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed left hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Urology was called, and they did not feel that stents were warrented in this patient as there is a high risk of stent-failure in patient's with an obstructive mass causing hydroureter/hydronephrosis.
Urine was negative for eosinophils and the creatinine was unresponsive to fluid bolus.
The patient's worsening kidney function was thought to be due to obstruction presumably from the small bowel mass.
Renal ultrasound showed moderate to severe left hydronephrosis with hydroureter of the proximal and mid ureter.
The patient's serum creatinine trended downward with placement of the nephrostomy tube on the left, which initially had bloody output that cleared to essentially normal urine with trace bloody streaks by discharge.
Given that the anemia is normocytic, it is more consistent with acute or subacute blood loss rather than slow, occult blood loss causing iron deficiency and microcytosis.
Aortic Stenosis:  History of mild AS (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2) in [**2170**], and Pt has 5/6 systolic murmur now.
She will only need a KUB if she develops obstructive symptoms.
- Follow-up with outpatient nephrologist regarding nephrostomy tube, continuation of aranesp and ferraheme, and chronic kidney disease.
- Follow-up with primary care physician regarding [**Name9 (PRE) 18290**] hydrochlorothiazide and losartan in light of Pt's recent acute renal insufficiency.

You were admitted with bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract and were found to have a mass in your small bowel.
The final results from these samples are still not available, but the preliminary results show that you do have a cancer in your small bowel.
During this hospitalization you also suffered a very small heart attack, known as an NSTEMI, because of anemia (low blood counts) caused by the bleeding abdominal mass.
You were found to have an obstruction in your left kidney preventing the flow of urine, which was causing worsening kidney function.
