Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] believes he hit his head on the freezer, but cannot recall w/ certainty the events, though he denies loss of conciousness.
He denies feeling ill, lightheaded, or experiencing change in vision or feelings of vertigo prior to episode.
He stopped bleeding without any sutures.
There he was found to have a 7mm frontal-parietal subdural hematoma, along with a 2mm midline shift.
As part of his ED workup, he was also noted to have an abnormal CXR, not further specified, but work-up was not pursued at the time, as Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] was transferred immediately to [**Hospital1 18**] to the neurosurgery team.
He was to be discharged today ([**11-29**]), when follow-up CXR to the OSH note was completed and revealed >30 discrete pulmonary nodules throughout the entire lungs, ranging in size from several millimeters to > 2.5cm.
At time of transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] is lying in his hospital bed comfortably, not SOB nor ill-appearing.
He denies any recent change in his overall health, any fevers, chills, syncope, or weight change.
Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] states that recently he has been in good health and denies any recent changes in physical or mental wellbeing.
His family, however, notes that that for the past several weeks, Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] has been increasingly fatigued and has napped with greater frequency than normal.
Ms. [**Known lastname 81483**] also notes that her husband has recently begun walking more slowly, taking small steps, and having some difficulty with balance.
His wife, however, notes Ms. [**Known lastname 81483**] has not noticed a change in her husband's memory or concentration, though she believes he has been a bit quicker to lose his temper as of late.
She is not certain if he has had fevers objectively, but has noted that he has recently been very sweaty in an comfortably cooled room.
Per his family, Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] has had a cough for the past several years, which may have inc. slightly in recent weeks.
Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**], a former Marine during the Korean War and subsequent IRS accountant, denies any exposure to asbestosis or silicosis, but his wife notes that he has always helped his children repair their houses and frequently uses paints and wallpaper removers.
CT imaging after transfer to the medical team was consistent with metastatic disease throughout the body, including lesions in the liver, retroperitoneum, lungs, and ascending colon.
R inguinal hernia s/p herniorrhaphy 3.
Hypercholesterolemia - on statin, pt does not recall exact name 5.
HTN - on felodipine  Social History: SH:  Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] currently is retired and lives in [**Location 81485**] with his wife, [**Name (NI) **].
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Global atrophy accommodates relatively minimal size with no midline shift or herniation noted.
Head CT [**11-28**]:IMPRESSION: Stable left frontal and left frontoparietal subdural hematomas.
No new hemorrhage.
CXR(PA/LAT): Multiple pulmonary nodules and masses are seen involving most of the lungs being more prominent in the mid and lower lungs although the entire lung parenchyma is involved.
Some of them have ill-defined borders but the others has some border irregularities.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is preserved with no clear evidence of lymphadenopathy.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Multiple radiopaque objects are projecting over the upper thorax and the right chest and are consistent with prior gunshot injury.
IMPRESSION: The above described picture is highly suspicious for advanced metastatic disease.
Differential diagnosis (which is less likely) would include septic emboli, vasculitis or nodular form of sarcoidosis.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Innumerable pulmonary nodules and masses are detected throughout the lungs, most predominant at the lung bases.
The largest mass within the left lower lobe abuts the posterior pleural surface and measures 3.1 x 2.4 cm.
No pleural effusions are present.
There is underlying mild-to-moderate emphysematous changes, most notably in the lung apices.
No axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes are present for CT size criteria; however, there is a prominent conglomerate of lymph nodes within the pretracheal region, the largest measuring 9 mm in short axis.
No dissection flap is present within the thoracic aorta.
The main, right and left pulmonary arteries are enlarged, the largest on the left measuring 2.9 cm and on the right measuring 3.1 cm, suggesting component of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Mild calcification of the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic significance.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Irregular calcified atherosclerotic plaque is present within the thoracic aorta which is mild.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver demonstrates numerous hypoattenuating whose appearances are most consistent with metastatic disease.
There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation involving the left lobe of the liver which is mild (series 3, image 63) and likely secondary to tumoral obstruction.
Enlarged periportal nodes are detected, the largest measuring 2.1 cm in short axis (series 3, image 75).
Paraaortic lymphadenopathy is detected the largest measuring 1.7 cm in short axis (series 3, image 82).
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Fatty infiltration of the pancreas without focal mass lesion identified.
The spleen demonstrates subtle heterogeneity within the inferior aspect without definitive focal lesion at this time.
Numerous hypoattenuating lesions are present within the kidneys, too small to adequately characterize.
Inflammatory stranding and irregular thickening is noted within the ascending colon from the level of the hepatic flexure to the cecum, concerning for malignant involvement.
No free air or free fluid is present within the abdomen.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon demonstrate fecal material within.
The prostate gland is mildly enlarged measuring 4.7 cm with focal calcification within.
The bladder and opacified loops of small bowel are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are present throughout the spine without definite evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion identified.
Intervertebral body disc space narrowing and degenerative disc disease is most notable at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels with vacuum phenomenon.
Widespread metastatic lesions throughout the lungs, with findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Numerous metastatic lesions also reside within the liver with retroperitoneal and periportal adenopathy.
Given significant stranding and wall thickening/irregularity involving the ascending colon, a primary colonic adenocarcinoma is suspected.
Degenerative changes within the spine.
Brief Hospital Course: # Subdural hematoma: The patient was admitted after a fall and found to have a subdrual hematoma.
The subdural hematoma was stable on repeat head CT.
The patient has noted increased gait instability over the past few months.
The etiolgy fall could be secondary to deconditioning and weakness from a systemic illness or brain/cerebellar involvement of metastatic cancer.
# Metastatic cancer, unknown primary:  The patient was found to have multiple bilat pulmonary nodules on CXR.
The patient did not have any repiratory compromise.
Theses nodules most likely represent metastatic colon cancer based on CT imaging.
The CT scan also revealed nodules in the liver and enlarged lymph nodes.
THe patient's CEA was elevated at 2319.
We recommend that the patient have a colonoscopy, possibly a liver biopsy and an MRI of the brain to further evaluate the origin and extent of this malignancy.
An infectious process is still on the differential but less likely due to lack of signs or symptoms.
# Diabetes Mellitus, type II - diet controlled .
# Hypertension - stable, chronic .
# Anemia - The patient's baseline Hct is unknown.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be secondary to occult blood loss from possible colon cancer.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient's creatinine was elevated at 1.3.
Patient was unaware of any kidney disease.
His Creatinine did not improve with fluid hydration.
Recommend oupatient evaluation of kidney function.
Left Frontoparietal Subdural Hematoma secondary to mechanical fall.
Secondary Diagnosis: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes Mellitus, Type II, well controlled Anemia Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine during admission was 1.3-1.4)  Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a bleed in your head which has not changed since you have been here.
Signs of a serious side effect of Dilatin include unsteady gait and rash.
While an inpatient, you had a chest x-ray which showed multiple nodules in your lungs.
A CT scan of your torso showed that there are also lesions in your liver and colon.
This is concerning for a cancer, but more tests will be needed to find out the type of cancer and what treatment is appropriate.
Aspirin can increase the risk of further bleeding in your head.
If you lose consciousness, fall again, have any signs of seizures, such as shaking or trembling, experience increased confusion, have blood in your stools, or cough up blood, please go to the ED or call your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2227**].
In addition, if you become incontinent of urine or have urinary retention, go to the emergency room immediately.
For further evaluation of your metastatic disease, you will need a colonoscopy with a biopsy or a liver biopsy of one of the lesions.
You should also have a CEA level checked.
