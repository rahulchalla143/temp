Admission Date:  [**2176-8-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-9-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-6-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was intubated to protect her airway, status post mediastinal exploration.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 73-year-old female with the below past medical history had lower extremity edema and visited her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
However, the patient had a resultant mediastinal hematoma with respiratory distress which was first noticed at home post procedure.
A CT scan showed that she had airway stenosis distal to the endotracheal tube, so she was sent to the operating room for mediastinal exploration.
However, after receiving blood and fluids, the patient had respiratory distress.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] times 25 years, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of hematology oncology:  Her baseline CBC included a white blood cell count of 40,000, hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 700,000.
Hip fracture with two arthroplasties.
Perioperative myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident at [**Hospital6 1129**], thought related to high hematocrit and leukocytes earlier this year at the time of her second hip arthroplasty.
Status post clipping of cerebral aneurysm in [**2174-1-17**].
The patient also has a son, who is an anesthesiologist.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to codeine, Demerol and possibly contrast, but she received a CT scan without difficulty at the other hospital.
Fine needle aspiration original results showed insufficient cellular material for analysis.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  A portable chest x-ray dated [**2176-8-21**] showed the nasogastric tube to be in good position with a left sided PICC line at the superior vena cava.
The heart size was stable with slight upper zone redistribution, right basilar atelectasis and the left costophrenic angle off the film.
The lungs were otherwise clear with mild congestive heart failure.
On [**2176-9-3**], a chest x-ray showed further improvement since [**2176-8-28**] in infiltrates with no new abnormalities, the nasogastric tube in place and the PICC at the right atrial and superior vena cava junction.
On [**2176-9-6**], the chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
A head CT scan dated [**2176-8-14**] showed an aneurysm to be present with a hypodense left frontal lobe, consistent with encephalomalacia, a low density of the right periventricular region and no acute processes or bleed.
A chest CT scan dated [**2176-8-14**] showed bilateral effusions with atelectasis, peripheral right upper lobe and lingular pulmonary embolisms, neck hematoma which was not compressive and mediastinal drains in place and interval enlargement of the hematoma.
CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram of [**2176-8-8**] showed marked left atrial enlargement, moderate right atrial enlargement, septum bowed to the right atrium, no atrioseptal defect, a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, normal size, right ventricular volume and pressure overload, moderate right dilation, mild aortic stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic regurgitation, trivial effusion; from the prior study, this noted new tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
A CT scan of the neck performed on [**2176-8-11**] showed a noncompressive hematoma.
A ventilation perfusion scan was performed on [**2176-8-12**] after the pulmonary hypertension noted on echocardiogram was evaluated and this showed moderate probability for pulmonary embolus, which was felt very suggestive, given her history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
A CT angiography was performed on [**2176-8-14**], which was positive for peripheral pulmonary embolus and the patient was then anticoagulated.
On [**2176-8-17**] or [**2176-8-18**], the last [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in the neck wound was removed.
She reported some shortness of breath when her oxygen briefly slipped off on [**2176-8-26**].
On [**2176-8-27**] and [**2176-8-28**], decreased subjective shortness of breath and fewer secretions were noted.
The patient felt that her shortness of breath might have just been anxiety.
She had a slight desaturation to the low 90s on [**2176-9-6**], but was mouth breathing at the time and not taking her nasal cannula oxygen.
A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema, thought to be related to fluids given at the time of her PEG placement and she was given 20 mg of Lasix.
Aspirin was held for a question of platelet dysfunction with the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2176-8-8**], which showed pulmonary hypertension with a gradient of greater than 66 and tricuspid regurgitation with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
Hypertension became an issue after earlier stable blood pressures, at some points even needing intravenous fluids for low blood pressures.
The cardiology service thought that her high blood pressure might be related to her pulmonary hypertension as well.
The patient had two episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia on [**2176-8-19**] and [**2176-8-20**] with lowering of her blood pressure with the first episode.
The cardiology service was reconsulted on [**2176-8-19**] and they felt that the problem was either atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia or atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was initiated at loading doses with caution, given her history of contrast allergy and thyroid issues.
No recurrence was noted by [**2176-8-27**] and telemetry was discontinued on [**2176-8-28**].
The patient had no further events.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl for 14 days for community-acquired pneumonia starting on [**2176-8-8**].
This was changed to vancomycin on [**2176-8-16**] for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum and positive blood cultures with gram positive cocci, originally to complete a ten day course.
On [**2176-8-22**], they added obtaining an herpes simplex virus culture of a forearm lesion, which they felt was vesicular and possibly consistent with herpes simplex virus; this was negative.
However, the patient was afebrile and had an uninterpretable white blood cell count, given that she had a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
Vancomycin was stopped on [**2176-8-26**] and the patient was afebrile thereafter.
The patient was originally thought to be having low grade temperatures, but it was later found out that these were rectal temperatures and were therefore one degree higher than the actual body temperature.
HEME:  The patient was initially treated with hydroxyurea and anagrelide for her polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
A hypercoagulability panel was sent for her pulmonary embolus history and heparin was started on [**2176-8-16**].
Coumadin was begun on [**2176-8-22**] for her pulmonary embolus.
The patient then required another unit of packed red blood cells and the hematology service was reconsulted and felt that she might be in the spent phase of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with myelofibrosis.
However, hemolysis laboratory studies were sent on [**2176-8-26**] in an effort to explain her low increase in hematocrit after transfusion and stool was guaiac tested repeatedly.
On [**2176-8-27**], her LDH was noted to be elevated, but was not significant given her history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
However, her haptoglobin was less than 20 and a delayed transfusion reaction workup was sent.
This was discussed with her hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who thought that the patient might have myelofibrosis and was therefore having a difficult time recovering from the marrow-suppressive effects of her polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] medications.
Further contact with the blood bank indicated that no transfusion reaction occurred and her schistocytes and her anemia were attributed solely to polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
On [**2176-8-29**], we considered getting a right upper quadrant ultrasound to explain asymmetric edema of the right upper extremity, but this was thought to be due mediastinal hematoma per the medical intensive care unit team and was improving and, further, would not have changed her management because she was already anticoagulated.
On [**2176-9-2**], a decision was made to hold the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] medications despite her increasing platelet count to 500,000 or greater because of her low hematocrit.
Intravenous fluids were stopped on [**2176-8-10**] because the patient had a large positive balance.
A subclavian central line was placed on [**2176-8-7**] and discontinued, as per the infectious disease section above, after she had positive blood cultures.
The patient was bolused for several liters on [**2176-8-26**] because she had a low urine output.
The patient was given Reglan as well to prove gastric motility.
The dysphagia team followed the patient until she was ready for repeat swallow with video study, which was done on [**2176-8-27**] and showed residual pharyngeal material which she later aspirated.
However, it might also have been because Flagyl was coincidentally started for pneumonia at the same time.
On [**2176-8-29**], the patient had persistent dysphagia and gastrointestinal was consulted for a PEG tube.
However, because the patient had a nasogastric tube, the interventional radiology service was consulted on [**9-17**] the PEG tube so that the patient could avoid endoscopy.
The PEG tube was completed on [**2176-9-4**] by the interventional radiology service without complications.
On [**2176-8-19**], the endocrine team saw her for a question of endocrine contribution to her paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
RENAL:  Mild acute renal failure at admission with a creatinine of 1.2 resolved.
She had decreased urine output noted on [**2176-8-25**] and she was bolused for a total of 500 cc of normal saline.
On [**2176-8-26**], the patient had decreased but acceptable urine output and a stable creatinine which had stayed stable since the Foley catheter was discontinued.
An improved neurological function was noticed by the time of discharge with increased mobility of the right lower extremity and good function of the right upper extremity.
NEUROLOGY:  The patient's old cerebrovascular accident, old aneurysm clipping and old polyneuropathy were stable.
Psychiatry saw the patient for depression and irritability and thought a frontal lobe syndrome might be active.
A repeat CT scan on [**2176-8-28**] showed no changes to the left frontal encephalomalacia and right periventricular low attenuation areas.
This was performed because the patient had a rather dense right hemiparesis which was out of proportion to her weakness before being sent to the medical intensive care unit.
However, the neurology service was consulted for their opinion whether a silent cerebrovascular accident versus exacerbated old cerebrovascular accident might be responsible.
The initial read showed no demyelinating.
However, they could not do a myelogram and the procedure was terminated early because of patient discomfort and her right side was not checked.
A nerve biopsy was considered, however, because it was unlikely that we would find a treatable cause of neuropathy and wanted to avoid the risk to the patient of the wound.
Coumadin was added for pulmonary embolus.
DRESSING CHANGES TO LEFT WRIST:  Cleanse with normal saline, apply a thin layer of DuoDerm, a moist dressing with normal saline, a dry sterile dressing and then Kling wrap without tape, as the patient had tape injuries in the past; perform dressing changes b.i.d.
Neck hematoma secondary to thyroid hemorrhage, requiring intubation.
Resultant pneumonia, possibly with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia while in the medical intensive care unit.
Exacerbation of chronic neuropathy.
