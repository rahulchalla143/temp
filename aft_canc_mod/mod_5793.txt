From the time of the last dictation until her transfer, she was continually treated for her DVT with a PTT of 60-80.
She completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for questionable UTI versus fecal contamination.
She was afebrile throughout her stay with little rise in her white blood cell count.
Her hypertension was under good control throughout admission with Atenolol 25 mg b.i.d.
She had no episodes of hypoglycemia.
Hematologically, she was anemic with iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and she was transfused a total of 3 units between the time of the last dictation and the time of transfer to Surgery.
