Admission Date:  [**2144-5-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-5-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2070-6-17**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a history of locally advanced anaplastic bladder cancer, status post XRT and chemotherapy; history of PE with left lower extremity DVT diagnosed three months ago, status post IVC filter, who patient presented with the complaints of diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.
Today, the patient had the sudden onset of nausea and vomiting reportedly without chest pain or dyspnea.
He presented to an outside hospital ED, where his ECG reveals 4-mm ST elevations in 2,3, and AVF and 2-mm ST elevations in V3 through V6 and 3-mm ST depressions in 1 and AVL.
Complete heart block was noted with a junctional escape of 50.
No significant improvement in the ST elevations were noted after the administration of thrombolytic.
The patient was transported to [**Hospital1 190**] for management of acute inferior MI with a complete heart block involving bradycardia cardiogenic shock.
Prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Cardiac catheterization here revealed left main with no obstruction.
The LAD showed tight mid stenosis, which was not intervened upon.
The RCA had a 90% proximal posterolateral, totally occluded distal posterolateral and 70% ostial RCA lesion.
The left circumflex had moderate diffuse disease.
Post intervention EKG showed normal sinus at a rate of 85 with Q waves in the inferior leads and improved 2-mm ST elevation in 2, 3, and F; resolution of anterior ST elevations was also noted and T-wave inversions were present in 2, 3, S, and V3 through V5.
Bladder cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy, anaplastic locally advanced.
Status post recent cystoscopy on [**2144-4-10**], which revealed response to chemotherapy, but bimanual examination under anesthesia confirmed a left immobile pelvic mass suggesting extravesicle invasive disease.
Left lower extremity DVT diagnosed three months ago status post IVC filter placement.
Coumadin recently discontinued for hematuria secondary to the patient's bladder carcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Iron sulfate.
Trachea midline.
ABDOMEN:  Benign, no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The left lower extremity has 2+ edema and there are 2+ pulses on both side.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for management of respiratory failure, recent heart block and recent cardiogenic shock.
The patient remained chest pain free throughout the rest of his admission.
He was started on aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and statin for his ischemic disease.
He did experience some hematuria in the immediate post procedure time thought secondary to the bladder cancer and use of Aggrastat.
On [**2144-5-11**], the patient reported positional dizziness with turning of the head to the left that was new in onset.
Given the fact that the patient has a known cancer and had received lytics at an outside hospital and also had focal neurological complaints with examination notable for left-sided dysmetria, head CT was obtained, which revealed left cerebellar infarction with increased pressure in the posterior fossa.
Repeat head CT twenty-four hours after the initial revealed no change in the findings.
The patient was never given Mannitol or any other therapeutic modalities to reduce the intracranial pressure.
On [**2144-5-12**], the patient was transferred to the floor for further neurological monitoring and optimization of his cardiac regimen.
Echocardiogram was also obtained on [**2144-5-12**], which revealed the following:  EF 25% to 30%; E to A ratio of 0.57 with estimated PA systolic pressure of 33; moderate [**Hospital1 **]-atrial dilatation noted as was moderate RV and LV dilation; mild MR noted; mild aortic root dilatation was also noted.
There were multiple areas of apical and posterior akinesis.
Given the patient suppressed EF and mild clinical heart failure necessitating nasal cannula oxygen, the patient was aggressively diuresed and appeared to tolerate this well.
Of note:  Urinalysis was sent of his chronic indwelling Foley, which was notable for large blood, greater than 10 white blood cell per high power field and nitrite positivity.
Status post inferior MI complicated by complete heart block and transient cardiogenic shock.
Left cerebellar infarction of subacute duration with radiographic evidence of increased posterior fossa intracranial pressure.
Depressed EF with multiple wall motion abnormalities.
Locally advanced anaplastic bladder carcinoma.
Left lower extremity DVT.
