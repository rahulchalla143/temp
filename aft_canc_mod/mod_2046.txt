She had an episode of hematemesis this morning and her family called EMS.
In ED, she was felt to have hemorrhagic shock and thought to be in acute distress though not actively vomiting.

Had a stable 1 cm hepatic dome nodule until [**3-/2150**] when nodule noted to be 3.8 cm on MRI with associated probable tumor thrombus of side branch L portal vein.
- Cirrhosis - liver bx showed mild portal predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate with minimal periportal extension (Grade 1).
No steatosis or necrotic hepatocytes.
Moderate to focally marked portal fibrosis on trichrome stain, with focal bridging and bile duct proliferation (Stage 2-3).
Complicated by portal HTN and extensive esophageal varices   Social History: No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.

Pertinent Results: EGD [**5-20**]: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade III varices were seen starting at 20 cm from the incisors in the lower third of the esophagus.
Impression: - Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation) - Varices at the fundus and cardia - Normal mucosa in the duodenum  CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, or mass effect.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
CXR: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Following extubation, lung volumes have decreased slightly.
A left retrocardiac opacity represents atelectasis.
There is no significant pleural effusion.
Radiodense material projecting over the right upper quadrant represents chemoembolization material.
The patient has known hepatocellular carcinoma seen in the right hepatic lobe, measuring 7.5 x 5.1 x 5.9 cm.
