Admission Date:  [**2197-12-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-12-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-10-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: 62 yoF w/ a h/o multiple sclerosis x 28 years now quadraplegic and bedbound who presented to [**Hospital3 **]Hospital with shortness of breath.
Patient began to notice shortness of breath beginning 4 days prior to presentation.
She denies any chest pain, subjective fevers, chills, or night sweats.
No worsening of her chronic lower extremity swelling and no lower extremity discomfort.
No prior history of heart disease.
On presentation, she did note a sensation of chest heaviness over the last 4 days.
Denies any nausea, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.
Of note, at baseline, she does have some difficulty breathing while laying flat and wears O2 at night but has never had a formal sleep study.
She noted steady progression of her symptoms over the 4 days PTA.
In the past she has required hospitalization for respiratory distress in the setting of URIs, however she had not been hospitalized for 3 years prior to this.
Exam was significant for moderate respiratory distress and decreased BS over R lung fields.
CXR was obtained showing what was thought to be a large R sided pleural effusion.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia.
D-dimer was mildly elevated at 524.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for potential thoracentesis and intensive care monitoring.
HRs remained tachycardic in 120s.
She was admitted to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her respiratory distress.
During her course there, she underwent TTE which showed preserved LVEF, no significant valvular dz and no intracardiac shunt.
A CTA chest was obtained out of concern for PE which was negative for PE, but did show extensive mucoid impaction in the distal trachea and the lower lobe bronchi with complete collapse of the right lower lobe and segmental collapse of the left lower lobe.
Thus, she underwent aggressive pulmonary toilet with chest vest and deep suctioning with significant improvement in her O2 sats so that she is maintaining O2 sats on 2.5L NC prior to transfer to the floor.
Past Medical History: # Multiple sclerosis x 28 years - functionally quadraplegic - bedbound with transfers to wheelchair - on 2L home O2 at night # h/o stage 1 breast cancer found on mammogram s/p biopsy, not pursued per patient preference (thinks was on Left) # chronic LE edema # chronic indwelling foley on suppressive antibiotics # s/p oopherectomy # s/p T+A as child   Social History: SH: Lives in [**Location **] with her husband.
Also had CAD s/p MI in 50s and CABG.
Died of MI in 70s.
No fam hx of cancer  Physical Exam: PE: T: 97.8 BP: 112/68 HR: 108 RR: 20 O2 sat 97% 2.5L Gen: Pleasant, laying in bed, no accessory muscle use or retractions, speaking in full sentences HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
No HSM EXT: WWP.
No spontaneous motor activity.
Pertinent Results: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old woman with quadriplegia secondary to multple sclerosis with poor peripheral IV access REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Pls place PICC for access PICC LINE PLACEMENT  INDICATION: IV access needed.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
There were no immediate complications.
------------------- CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: eval for PE, eval for anatomic cause of elevated R hemidiaph Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old woman with chronic multiple sclerosis, bedbound p/w 4 days increasing SOB REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for PE, eval for anatomic cause of elevated R hemidiaphragm  CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HISTORY: 62-year-old female with chronic multiple sclerosis, bed bound now presenting with 4 days of increasing shortness of breath to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
FINDINGS:  CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a 7 mm low-attenuation focus in the left lobe of the thyroid gland, this may be assessed further with a thyroid ultrasound.
There is atelectasis present at the lung bases with almost complete collapse of the right lower lobe and subsegmental collapse of the left lower lobe.
There are secretions also present in the collapsed segments of the left lower lobe as well as distal trachea.
There are ill-defined patchy opacities present in both lungs likely infectious or inflammatory.
There are scattered mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is no central pulmonary embolism, however, given the extent of lower lobe collapse, a subsegmental pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded in the lower lobes.
There are multiple hepatic hypodensities, these are too small to characterize and likely represent cysts and hemangiomas.
There are multiple bilateral renal hypodensities, again these are too small to characterize and likely represent cysts.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are multilevel degenerative changes present in the spine.
CONCLUSION:  1) Extensive mucoid impaction in the distal trachea and the lower lobe bronchi with complete collapse of the right lower lobe and segmental collapse of the left lower lobe.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No significant valvular disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yoF w/ h/o MS, untreated breast cancer who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for worsening SOB found to extensive mucous plugging and lobar collapse.
# Respiratory distress: Secondary to mucous plugging and lobar collapse.
Discharged to rehabilitation hospital for further optimization of aggressive pulmonary toilet.
# UTI: evidence of UTI on OSH U/A.
# Multiple Sclerosis: Quadriplegic.
Has baclofen pump with only minimal spasticity on exam.
# Stage 1 breast cancer: Patient did not pursue further treatment after biopsy.
Diazepam 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure  Multiple sclerosis  Discharge Condition: Stable, baseline oxygenation status  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with respiratory failure secondary to mucuc plugging.
You were treated for a lung and urine infection with antibiotics.
Return the the ER if any further worsening respiratory distress which does not respond to suctioning and oxygen, or any worrisome symptoms.
