Admission Date:  [**2123-4-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2061-3-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an unfortunate 62 year old female with a past medical history significant for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease.
History of left breast cancer.
B-cell lymphatic lymphoma.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Deep vein thrombosis and peripheral vascular disease.
She presented with a several week history of increased abdominal pain, mild nausea, decreased appetite and ultimately presented with painless jaundice.
She underwent a CT scan of the abdomen on [**2123-4-20**], after a failed attempt at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, secondary to a duodenal stenosis.
CT scan showed evidence of upstream dilatation of both the pancreatic duct and marked dilatation of the common bile duct, as well as a 3.3 by 3.3 cm mass in the head of the pancreas.
There were multiple small lymph nodes seen adjacent to the pancreatic head.
This procedure confirmed the CT findings of markedly dilated bilateral hepatic ducts and common bile duct, with a high grade obstruction at the level of the distal common bile duct.
They successfully placed an #8 French internal and external biliary drain across that common bile duct lesion and placed her bag to drainage.
Given her CT angiogram with pancreatic protocol, showing that there was no evidence of anatomic unresectability, it was felt that the patient would benefit from percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage and preoperative optimization for ultimate Whipple procedure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine between 1.5 and 2.
Coronary artery disease.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of left breast cancer.
History of an ovarian mass.
History of stage 3-B B-cell lymphoma.
History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Hospital course of peripheral vascular disease.
Negative for any hypertension or coronary artery disease.
There may have been a history of pancreatic disease in her husband; however, this was not a genetic relative.
She had a several week history of intermittent abdominal pain and jaundice.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for being afebrile; vital signs stable.
She was in mild distress and complaining of abdominal pain.
Chest was clear, decreased breath sounds with occasional expiratory wheezing.
heart was regular without murmur.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, slightly tender in the right upper quadrant and periumbilical region.
No peritoneal signs noted.
She had no hernia.
Previous incision of the midline abdomen was noted and well healed without evidence of herniation.
Admission stress test showed no evidence of anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
She underwent a Persantine MIBI scan on [**2123-4-22**] which showed no evidence of myocardial perfusion defects in the presence of diaphragmatic attenuation.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, after these initial diagnostic and therapeutic radiographic studies were performed, was notable for having a nutrition consult, getting supplemental nutrition enterally and parenterally.
She ultimately waxed and waned on the floor, to the point that on [**2123-5-4**], she precipitously worsened to the point of having severe abdominal pain, tachycardia and hypotension.
A pulmonary artery catheter was inserted showing very low filling pressures in the setting of hyperdynamic physiology, confirming the likely suspicion that the patient was now septic.
Her abdominal examination was notable for having some diffuse guarding and rebound.
Alkaline phosphatase was mildly elevated at 462, which was trending up.
Her initial alkaline phosphatase went higher; however, post PTC, her liver function tests improved until this acute decompensation.
She underwent a repeat CT scan of the abdomen, showing diffuse ascites and some thickening in the area of the porta.
The pancreatic mass looked unchanged.
She had Vasopressor dependent shock, necessitating augmentation with Vasopressin and Levophed to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 60.
She had a massive ongoing fluid requirement and, after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**], the patient's family decided to bring the patient to the operating room, with presumed diagnosis of possible bile peritonitis and cholangitis.
The patient was started on antifungal therapy for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans which grew out from her bio clusters from [**2123-5-3**].
She underwent a laparotomy which revealed several liters of gross bile within her peritoneal cavity.
After a wash-out and exploration, it was determined that the patient had a serial and proximal pyloric blow-out.
It was unclear if this was secondary to an ulcer or likely secondary to her malignancy.
A [**Doctor Last Name **]-hard mass was felt in the head of the pancreas.
With this insult added, the undue amount of morbidity and mortality to this patient's overall clinical outlook, and after direct conversation with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **], the patient's daughter, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] abided by their wishes to make the patient DNI/DNR and CMO.
