Admission Date:  [**2160-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-12-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**] Chief Complaint: Right parotid mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2160-7-10**]: Right parotidectomy with right supra-omohyoid modified neck dissection with nerve monitoring and right abdominal fat grafting.
[**2160-7-13**]: Evacuation of right neck hematoma.
[**2160-7-15**]: Re-exploration of right neck with evacuation of neck hematoma.
History of Present Illness: This is a 61 year-old Caucasian male who intially presented to clinic on [**2160-6-13**] because for the past 1-2 years he had noted a swelling in the right pre-auricular region.
A prior CT scan on [**2160-6-6**] revealed a 2.3 x 2.6 x 3 cm mass within the superficial portion of the parotid tail.
At that time, there were no characteristics of malignancy.
On [**2160-6-20**], a fine-needle aspiration biospy was performed showing malignant cells consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
On [**2160-6-24**] an MRI neck showed a T2 hypointense lesion in the right parotid gland at the junction of the superficial and deep lobes measuring approximately 3 x 2.7 cm-- appearance was concerning for malignant neoplasm versus adenopathy from overlying skin malignancy.
There was no enhancement in the mastoid segment of the facial nerve and the lesion did not appear to extend into the stylomastoid foramen.
In clinic, he denied history of chronic skin problems or skin malignancy.
Past Medical History: History of atrial fibrillation status post ablation five years ago, depression, asthma, arthritis.
Family History: Significant for cancer and heart disease.
OC/OP: Moist mucous membranes without evidence of lesions or exudates.
Right parotid incision is clean, dry and well-approximated with sutures and staples in place--bacitracin on incision line.
Improving ecchymosis at distal flap edge infra-auricular region with no evidence of erythema, infection.
No hematoma or collection.
No murmur, rub or gallop.
RESP: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, bilaterally with no adventitious sounds.
No wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
Right sided 3-4 cm abdominal fat graft incision is well-approximated, healing without evidence of erythema or infection.
EXTR: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
2+ peripheral pulses bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: [**2160-6-24**] MR IMAGING OF THE NECK  There is a heterogeneously-enhancing predominantly T2 hypointense lesion in the right parotid gland at the junction of the superficial and deep lobes measuring approximately 3 x 2.7 cm.
Appearance is concerning for malignant neoplasm versus adenopathy from overlying skin malignancy.
There is no enhancement in the mastoid segment of the facial nerve and the lesion does not appear to extend into the stylomastoid foramen.
[**2160-7-13**] CTA CHEST  There are numerous filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature, notably in the right upper pulmonary artery extending into the segmental branches.
A filling defect is also noted in the left lingular branches and subsegmental branches of the left lower and upper lobes.
There is flattening of the intraventricular septum and enlargement of the right ventricle relative to the left suggestive of right ventricular heart strain.
[**2160-7-13**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins.
Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged right perihilar lower lobe opacity.
The presence of minimal overhydration cannot be excluded.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour persists.
There appears to be some decrease in the perihilar lower lobe opacity on the right.
On the left, the hemidiaphragm is well seen with some continued retrocardiac and infrahilar opacification that most likely represents some atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion at this time.
Otherwise, lung fields, cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar silhouette, and pleural surfaces remain unchanged.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
His post-op pain was controlled initially with Acetaminophen and Percocet, then he was switched to PO Dilaudid with more adequate control achieved.
Unfortunately, he developed some hallucinations with his pain medication on HOD#8 requiring a switch to Propoxyphene, without issue.
His EKG was unchanged from [**2-/2160**], with some residual evidence of P-R interval elongation.
His beta-blocker was discontinued due to orthostatic hypotension.
He was encouraged to use incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis or PNA.
We also prescribed Albuterol nebs PRN given his mild asthma history.
A cardiac workup revealed a troponin of 0.07, his EKG showed some right heart strain, and a CTA was obtained showing multiple pulmonary arterial filling defects compatible with acute pulmonary embolus--with evidence of right heart strain and patchy consolidation at the lung bases.
The patient also had a CT head which showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhaging.
On HOD#3 the patient had rapid accumulation of a right neck hematoma attributed to leaky vasculature in the setting of heparinization for acute PE treatment.
The patient was again intubated in preparation for the OR on HOD#5, in preparation for a re-exploration of the right neck with hematoma evacuation.
He had no issues with nausea or vomiting.
On HOD#8 he experienced some epigastric disomfort most consistent with reflux esophagitis/GERD, and he was started Famotidine and TUMS/calcium carbonate.
There was no evidence of rash or abdominal discomfort which would suggest a more worrisome porphyria diagnosis.
HEME/ID: Two right neck [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were placed intra-operatively and maintained adequate drainage until heparinization on HOD#3 when he was heparinized for acute pulmonary emboli, at which time the output of the drains increased substantially (> 300 mL per day).
The patient's incision initially was with mild ecchymosis at the flap border, which increased minimally by HOD#3.
There was no evidence of hematoma, although the drains had substantial output during heparinization.
On [**2160-7-13**] (HOD#3), the patient was continued on 1400 U/hr of unfractionated heparin for acute pulmonary embolus.
It was noted that his drains had substantial sanguinous output, and that a right neck hematoma was rapidly collecting, without evidence of airway compromise.
The patient did well post-op, but was noted on HOD#5 ([**2160-7-15**]) to have increased output from both [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] necks drains once again.
He again returned to the OR on [**2160-7-15**] for re-exploration of the right neck with evacuation of the right neck hematoma.
He had no compressive respiratory compromise during either episode of hematoma, albeit the collection onset was rapid.
Intraoperatively, no identifiable source of bleeding was noted, but diffuse leaky vasculature in combination with heparinization was the likely etiology of the bleeding.
Post-op on (HOD#6) [**2160-7-16**], the patient appeared to have minimal residual serosanguinous output from both [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains, he remained intubated for 48 hours given some intraoperative supraglottic edema.
Upon floor transfer, the medicine team was consulted to assist in management of the acute PE and heparinization.
PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumatic compression boots were maintained in the post-op period to prevent DVT/PE initially.
