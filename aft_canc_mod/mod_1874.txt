On arrival to the ED, patient reported worsening dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain for several days prior to presenting to the outside hospital, as well as pleuritic left sided chest pain.
History was limited given the patient was intubated at the time of evaluation, but she denies chills, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, or abdominal pain.
She reports progressive dyspnea, worse with exertion, fever to 101, and cough productive of yellow sputum.
Patient was slightly hypotensive after intubation and improved when sedation was weaned.
During her last admission for pneumonia in [**2192-6-29**], she was initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, and later transitioned to Augmentin at the time of discharge.
She underwent thoracentesis, which revealed an exudative effusion with cells consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the lung and RUL lobectomy, with metastatic NSCLC with brain mets, status post stereotactic radiosurgery to a right cerebellar resection cavity and a right occipital metastasis, followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]; history of SVC syndrome; she is being treated with Tarceva for palliative control of tumor burden 2.
Also with history of Lymphoma after having axillary LAD.
Total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine cancer in [**2184**] 4.
Carotid artery aneurysm on L 5.
Family History: Her father is alive with CAD, mother is alive with CAD and history of CVA.

There is persistent complete opacification of the right hemithorax.
There is a persistent right lateral indentation on the trachea.
There is worsening opacity in the left lung with multiple nodules, which appear slightly larger, although this could be due to adjacent opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: 36 year-old woman with history of HIV/AIDS (CD4=56) on HAART and PCP/MAC prophylaxis), metastatic squamous and adenocarcinoma of the lung (on tarceva) with brain mets and chronic malignant effusion status post right bronchial stenting [**7-3**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for pneumonia who presents from outside hospital for acute onset shortness of breath.
She was intubated in ED for respiratory distress.
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The etiology of her acute respiratory distress was unclear on admission, but is likely related to a worsening left sided pneumonia.
Other possibilities for acute decompensation include pulmonary embolism since she is likely hypercoagulable or and increase in her tumor burden.
A chest CTA was not performed due to her iodine allergy.
Upper and lower extremity ultrasounds were significant for non-occlusive clots in axillary and subclavian veins bilaterally.
Therefore, the possibility of a pulmonary embolism could not be excluded; however, she was not started on heparin empirically due to the presence of brain metastasis.
She was started on empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and Bactrim) for community acquired pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, and PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] bronchoscopy showed a patent proximal stent in the right mainstem bronchus with tumor overgrowth as well as diffuse mucosal edema on the left with thin watery discharged.
On hospital day 2, she began to have continued increased oxygen requirement and a chest x-ray showed increased left lower lobe opacity.
Upon talking to the husband and family, it was decided to see if her respiratory status improved with the antibiotics.
Her respiratory status continued to decline as she became more hypoxic and more hypercarbic requiring increased ventilator adjustments.
2) HYPOTENSION: She had transient hypotension after intubation that was likely secondary to sedation.
However, her clinical picture was concerning for sepsis given her respiratory failure, reported fever, and tachycardia.
Her lactate was mildly elevated, but that may be from her HAART medications.
Her mean arterial blood pressure was maintained above 60 with fluid boluses.
Interventional Pulmonary also saw her and felt that there was no indication for further intervention.
5) CHRONIC PAIN: She was maintained on fentanyl and propofol drip for pain control.
Iron studies last admission, appears to be combination of iron deficiency and ACD.
She was not transfused since she does not have active coronary disease.
10) Code: On hospital day 2, she was made DNR with no pressors, no shocks, and no antiarrhythmics.
