Total laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy.
Right modified radical neck dissection.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 71-year-old female with 2 prior known squamous cell carcinomas involving the head and neck.
This was a T3 N2B M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil which was treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation.
In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year, she was found to have a microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma staged as T1 N0 M0 which was completely resected from the floor of mouth.
Several weeks after the surgery, she began to develop odynophagia and clinically was found to have a tumor involving the medial wall of the left piriform sinus.
She underwent an endoscopy and biopsy which revealed a poorly-differentiated carcinoma.
Given her prior radiation therapy and the unwillingness of the radiation oncologist to give her primary definitive radiation as the treatment, the only option was for a total laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy.
Neck: Flat - staple lines c/d/i, no erythema or induration.
Mild crusting around suture line, moist.

[**-9/2116**]  CARCINOMA IN SITU ANTERIOR FLOOR OF MOUTH, RIGHT FLOOR OF   [**Numeric Identifier 80013**]  R. LATERAL TONGUE LESION (1 JAR)  DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Lymph nodes, neck, right level 2A, excision: Four lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/4).
Lymph nodes, neck, right level 3, excision: Two lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/2).
Lymph nodes, neck, right level 4, excision: Two lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/2).
No carcinoma seen.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:     Poorly differentiated carcinoma.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor limited to one subsite of hypopharynx and is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Note:  Sections of the tumor demonstrate an ulcerated, poorly differentiated carcinoma composed of nests and sheets of atypical cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli.
Numerous mitotic figures and focal necrosis are identified.
A focus suspicious for a squamous precursor lesion (carcinoma in situ, slide L) with possible keratinization is noted.
Immunohistochemical staining shows that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3 and CAM 5.2), CK5/6, and p63.
These immunophenotypic findings are suggestive of both squamous and neuroendocrine differentiation.
Although a definite squamous carcinoma in situ component is not identified, the morphologic and immunophenotypic features are consistent with an invasive poorly differentiated carcinoma arising at this site.

She tolerated the procedures well and without complication.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
She was discharged on liquid dilaudid for pain that could be taken by mouth or via her feeding tube.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; she was on telemetry throughout her stay because of her new laryngectomy stoma and the concern for desaturations - she did not have any significant cardiovascular problems.
She was managed with q1-2 hour suctioning of her secretions and was noted to have several brief desaturations to the mid-80s while in the ICU - extending her stay there for close stoma care and frequent suctioning.
A chest x-ray on POD 5 showed right sided atelectasis and chest PT was initiated.
The patient was also encouraged to get out to bed to ambulate, she was seen by PT for the duration of her stay and did not have any further desaturations.
On POD 11 she had a barium swallow study which did not reveal a leak or fistula, and she was started on clear liquids, advancing to mechanical softs.
She did not experience any leak and was discharged on mechanical soft diet with TF supplementation 3x/day.
The redness around the stoma site decreased by the time of her d/c.
Throughout her stay she was afebrile, her temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge on POD#12, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a mechanical soft diet, supplemented with tube feeds, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Hydromorphone 1 mg/mL Liquid Sig: [**2-7**] mL PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 10 days.
Disp:*84 84* Refills:*0*  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 56223**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma left pyriform sinus, status post total laryngectomy   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital following a laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma, your inpatient stay was 12 days during which you had a steady recovery from your operation and you made significant progress in learning how to care for your new stoma.
You are being discharged to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehab facility in order to manage the more complicated aspects of your continuing care - the tube feeds and your stoma being most relevant.
You have received several print-outs which describe in detail how to care for your stoma and what you should expect over the next few months.
Care for your stoma includes keeping humidified air on it at ALL TIMES, periodic moistening of the opening with a small amount of saline and decrusting with forceps as needed to maintain the airway's diameter.
It is important for you and those around you to know that you cannot breathe from your mouth - you are a DEPENDENT NECK BREATHER.
This means that if anyone needs to place a breathing tube, it must be done through the neck, the CANNOT place one from your mouth or nose.
You should return to the ER if: * You have difficulty breathing through the stoma or cannot clear secretions at that site.
* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any narcotic pain medication.
You may have constipation when taking narcotic pain medications (oxycodone, percocet, vicodin, hydrocodone, dilaudid, etc.
