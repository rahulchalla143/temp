Echogenic kidneys consistent with medicorenal disease.
CXR: mild cardiomegaly, large hiatal hernia, no infiltrates, RIJ in SVC .
Echo [**2149-9-27**]: Left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with apical and anterior akinesis.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis.
The patient was transferred to the medical floor where she was afebrile with stable vital signs and continued to receive ceftriaxone and levofloxacin until final sensitivites returned, at which time she was changed to PO levofloxacin only.
Acute SOB: In the ICU, the patient became acutely hypoxic and tachy to 126 on the day after admission, and was put on a non-rebreather with improvement.
She was net positive 4L in the unit, and CXR showed fluid overload.
Bedside echo at that time showed EF of 20% and severe global LV hypokinesis.
We have no echos for comparison so it is unknown whether this is a new decrease in EF in setting of sepsis or whether this is secondary to some past insult, for example the patient's past doxorubicin treatment.
Her fluid status was monitored on the floor and she received Lasix once prn SOB with improvement and good output of urine.
This likely represents prerenal failure, as the patient appeared dry and responded to fluids by normalizing her creatinine.
After large diuresis in the unit, urine lytes were ordered, and patient did not have nephrotic-range proteinuria.
Multiple myeloma: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had extensive treatment in past w/ multiple recurrences - currently in remission, recent SPEP/UPEP wnl, beta2microglobulin has been stable.
There was a question of atypical cells seen on a blood smear here.
It was nontender, however given the patient's history of DVTs and the prior placement of IVs and blood draws in this arm during her stay, [**Doctor Last Name **] u/s was ordered and was negative for DVT.
