Admission Date:  [**2133-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-9-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per rectum.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year old male with medical history pertinent for hypertension, obesity and seasonal allergies who presents with 1 day of bright red blood per rectum.
The patient reports he was in his USOH until last night when he noted blood in his stool after a bowel movement.
He denies associated abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, pain with eating.
He denies epigastric discomfort or hematemesis, he does take an 81mg aspirin daily and has been doing so for months.
The patient now reports this a.m. that he noted stomach "gurgling" and irritability but again denies frank pain.
He passed blood 3 times this a.m. without stool that was described as bright red with some associated clots.
He reports one episode of feeling lightheaded and diaphoretic while passing blood but otherwise denies postural symptoms.
He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
He reports no history of prior bleeding, has never had endoscopy previously or GI imaging.
He has no personal or family history of GI malignancy, reports 1 cousin with [**Name (NI) 4522**] disease.
The patient reports last night increased bruising over his left forearm but otherwise denies any history of easy bruising or bleeding.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Seasonal Allergies  Social History: The patient is married with 3 children and lives in [**Hospital1 1474**].
Mild tenderness in LLQ to deep palpation without guarding or rebound.
STUDIES: GI BLEEDING STUDY   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 16282**] Reason: BRBPR, SIGNIFICANT DROP IN HCT, EVAL FOR SOURCE  Active intestinal bleeding within the first minute, with bleeding source located in ascending colon or cecum.
[**8-2**] A-gram Selective arteriograms of the SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and celiac artery were performed with no signs of active bleeding.
[**2133-8-4**] Colonoscopy Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyp in the sigmoid colon Fresh and clotted blood throughout the entire colon with evidence of active bleeding but without an identifiable source.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Proceed DIRECTLY to IR for angiography given active bleeding Reconsult surgery Repeat colonoscopy after bleeding controlled to assess/remove polyp .
[**8-4**] A-gram Selective initial arteriogram of the SMA demonstrated highly suggestive area of active bleeding in the mid right colon.
Multiple selective arteriograms of the right and middle colic arteries did not confirm the presence of active contrast extravasation.
Since a bleeding branch of the right colic artery could not be precisely identified on any of the selective arteriograms, safe superselective coil embolization could not be performed.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year old gentleman presents with bright red blood per rectum.
Patient is on aspirin and at risk for PUD, however, seems unlikely he is having BRBPR from UGI source given this would require brisk bleed and patient is otherwise quite hemodynamically stable - monitor hct tid for now, decrease to daily or [**Hospital1 **] if stable and no additional bleeding - hold aspirin - maintain 2 large bore PIV, active T+X - maintain NPO for today.
If clinically stable and bleeding decreases, may advance to clears over weekend - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] for now although as above less likely UGI bleed - plan for scope on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need prep Sunday night  Hypertension - at home antihypertensives initially held because of concern for ongoing bleed  Allergies - patient without allergy symptoms at present.
Pain: He had a PCA for pain control  GI/Abd: His abdomen was soft and appropriately tender.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Lower GI Bleed  Secondary: Hypertension, acute blood loss anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
