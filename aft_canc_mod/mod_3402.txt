Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 76463**] [**Known lastname **] delivered at 28 and 4/7 weeks gestation and was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit for management of respiratory distress and prematurity.
The mother presented to [**Hospital1 69**] from Bermuda for continued management of preterm labor on [**2146-11-24**] at 24 and 1/7 weeks gestation.
Preterm labor was managed by Terbutaline and vaginal progesterone suppositories.
The mother was stable on antepartum floor until day of delivery when her membranes spontaneously ruptured and she had a fever to 100.4.
The infant initially emerged with good activity and spontaneous respiratory effort.
He received routine dry and suctioning and stimulation but his respiratory effort became poor with poor color, requiring positive pressure ventilation and then intubation with slow but steady improvement.
Head sutures approximated.
Mild subcostal retracting.
Abdomen: Soft, no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses.
A 3.5 x 3.5 cm raised papillary hemangioma on back.
Skeletal:  Spine straight and intact, no dimple.
No clicks or clunks.
Received 2 doses of Surfactant, due to 100% oxygen requirement, was changed to high frequency oscillatory ventilation with a mean airway pressure of 13, Delta P of 28 with a good response.
His oxygen requirement slowly came down and he weaned back to conventional ventilation on day of life 4.
He started Lasix on day of life 57 for chronic lung disease.
His respiratory rates range in the 30's to 60's with mild subcostal retracting.
His last apnea and bradycardia episode, which was associated with a feed, was on day of life 86 ([**2147-3-21**]).
Cardiovascular:  He received normal saline on admission for hypotension.
A follow-up echocardiogram on day of life 8 showed no patent ductus arteriosus and a left peripheral pulmonic stenosis, mild.
Infectious disease:  He received 21 days of ampicillin and gentamycin for suspicion for sepsis and meningitis.
We were unable to rule out meningitis with a lumbar puncture secondary to the intraventricular hemorrhages.
He received 48 hour rule out of Vancomycin and gentamycin, due to increased apnea and bradycardia episodes on day of life 33.
Neurology:  He was followed closely with frequent ultrasounds due to the initial ultrasound showing bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage with mild ventriculomegaly.
The most recent head ultrasound was on [**2147-2-17**] on day of life 54 and it showed resolved intraventricular hemorrhages and a left caudal thalamic cyst.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
