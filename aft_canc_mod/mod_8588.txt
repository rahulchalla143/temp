Pertinent Results: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2138-6-27**] IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2138-6-27**]  FINDINGS: There is a horseshoe kidney, as seen on the CT from [**2134-10-9**].
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal masses, or renal calculi.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi involving the horseshoe kidney.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 year old diabetic man with related neuropathy, recent toe deep infection to the bone with underlying osteomyelitis (recent wound culture by his podiatrist grew Ecoli that was resistant to everything except aminoglycoside and one cephalosporin; he was empirically treated with few days of Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, and Augmentin), hypertension, hepatitis B/C, and monoclonal gammopathy, who presented with severe hyperkalemia and acute renal failure of unclear etiology (initially).
He had no EKG or symptoms of hyperkalemia.
He had an impressive acute renal failure with a GFR of  9.0.
He had no hydronephrosis on ultrasound and lack obstructive symptoms on history.
His Fe Na of 5.9% (Furea%) suggested more of an intrinsic renal process.
It was our preference to continue to monitor his renal function on the inpatient service, but he refused to remain in the hospital, and he requested discharge due to personal and financial obligations.
In regards to his RIGHT TOE INFECTION, we spoke to his podiatrist who confirmed deep wound and underlying osteomyelitis.
Purulence was noted on examination but he was afebrile without leukocytosis or systemic symptoms.
His   Lantus dose was reduced due to reduced renal clearance.
Patient was also placed on thiamine and folate for ALCOHOL ABUSE but he had no signs of withdrawal.
His gabapentin was discontinued as well, as he began having bizarre sensory abnormalities (he felt that he was lying on the ceiling), despite significant dose reduction in the setting of renal failure.
