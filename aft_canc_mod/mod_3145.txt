([**2165-9-3**]) MRI BRAIN - Since the previous MRI of [**2165-7-29**] there has been progression in metastatic disease with increase in size of several previously noted lesions.
Several new lesions are seen in the inferior left frontal lobe and both temporal lobes and left cerebellar hemisphere with new leptomeningeal enhancement along the cerebellar folia.
Edema surrounding previously noted lesion and some of the new lesions is noted but no midline shift or hydrocephalus is seen.
([**2165-9-3**]) CXR - Right lung base w/ opacity similar to prior, no consolidation   Brief Hospital Course: OMED course [**2165-9-5**]: 52F w/ PMH of metastatic melanoma with brain mets, no history of cardiac problems or arrythmias, admitted very early on [**2165-9-4**] for altered mental status.
Recent MRI, LP, and patient history and presentation were concerning for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
At 1:30pm, the patient was noted to have difficulty breathing by the family and became unresponsive.
When the OMED floor team arrived she was sating well, unresponsive with a good pulse and tachycardic palpable to 120s.
On monitors she was tachy to 200s and it appeared to be a wide complex tachycardic and possibly torsades so she recieved 1gm of magnesium and a code blue was called to get anesthesia for probable cardioversion.
MICU course [**2165-9-5**]: On arrival to the MICU she was afebrile and first set of vital signs showed BP of 80s/30s and she was mentating well.
The patient denied any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.
Cardiology recommended that she start on procainamide, this was attempted and initially there was no response.
Two more cardioversions were attempted at 300J without success.
Bedside TTE performed during her MICU brief stay showed moderate MR and no pleural effusion or ventricular dilation.
She was in polymorphic v tach with occasional sinus beats, but she was A+Ox3.
On [**9-6**] AM the VT caused HD instability with unresponsiveness and required cardioversion and amiodarone boluses.
While preparing for d/c to hospice facility, on the morning of [**9-10**], patient c/o worsening headache, nausea and vomiting.
She continued to have headache throughout the day and was started on a dilaudid gtt.
No audible Heart sounds, radial and carotid pulses absent.
