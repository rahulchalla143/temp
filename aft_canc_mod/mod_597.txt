She does not know if she hit her head but reports right buttock pain from the fall.
Since her discharge she has been feeling "tired" and has had a poor appetite but denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.
Patient initially presented with DOE and right flank pain and was evaluated by her PCP found to have cardiomegaly on CXR.
Subsequent [**First Name3 (LF) 113**] showed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Both sources are showing evidence of a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
CT of the abd/pelvis did not reveal a source but did reveal some bony lytic lesions in the right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic disease.
Of note, she also is known to have a large common femoral DVT.
Bedside [**Month/Day (4) 113**] showing large pericardial effusion.
- History of mild asthma, inhalers not used for several years.
- recent pericardial effusion/tamponade - right pleural effusion - adenocarcinoma of unclear primary   Social History: She works as a nursing assistant.
Family History: Her father died of stomach cancer at age 72.
Mother died of colon cancer at age 63.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
?rub with one component, pericardial drain in place Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
Skin: Dry, no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PERICARDIAL FLUID Other Body Fluid Hematology: WBC: 2488 RBC: [**Numeric Identifier 16981**] Polys: 75 Lymphs: 13 Monos: 9 Eos: 1 Macro: 2 Negative for malignant cells.
AP PELVIS: No fracture or dislocation is identified within the single view.
No pubic symphysis or SI joint diastasis is detected.
CXR [**5-30**]: Single AP chest radiograph demonstrate hazy opacity within the right lung base likely representing atelectasis vs air space disease.
Small right pleural effusion is present.
Compared to prior radiograph from [**2181-5-15**], there is moderate cardiac enlargement, concerning for pericardial effusion.
Opacity in right lung base concerning for atelectasis vs airspace disease.
Small right pleural effusion.
Compared to prior radiograph from [**2181-5-15**], there is moderate increase in cardiac size, concerning for pericardial effusion.
RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
A loculated pericardial effusion with constriction should be considered.
Endoscopy [**6-4**]:Gastro esophageal junction mucosal biopsy: Gastric type mucosa with chronic active inflammation.
Very focal intestinal metaplasia consistent with Barrett's esophagus in the appropriate clinical setting.
Squamous mucosa with focal active inflammation .
Colonoscopy [**6-5**]: No masses or polyps seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 54 y/o woman here with recurrent malignant pericardial effusion.
# Malignant Effusion.
Patient with known highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.
Fluid analysis suggested exudative fluid and cytology again pending.
An [**Month/Year (2) 113**] on [**6-1**] showed partial resolution of part of the pericardial effusion, but persistance of a loculated effusion.
It was felt that the drain should be pulled and an [**Month/Year (2) 113**] repeated on [**6-2**] showed no progression.
# Mucinous adenoca unknown primary: The heme/onc team was consulted during admission and workup to determine source was undertaken.
Endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed without evidence of malignancy.
# DVT - large VTE in common femoral artery extending to IVC found on CT scan.
This was stopped however given concerns for recurrence of pericardial effusion.
Shortly after the IVC filter placement, she experience right sided pleuritic chest pain.
Her oxygen requirement did not increase but she remained mildly tachycardic.
# Right buttock pain: patient with lytic lesions found on CT scan thought likely malignant.
AP pelvis negative for fracture.
# Syncope - likely due to large pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology .
# CAD: no known CAD .
