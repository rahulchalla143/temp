Admission Date:  [**2192-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-4-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Clindamycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: .
History of Present Illness: 88F h/o metastatic breast cancer c/b malignant pleural and pericardial effusion s/p window, currently on chemotherapy, initially presented on [**2192-4-18**] with SOB increased above chronic baseline.
+cough with minimal sputum.
CXR revealed reaccumulation of right pleural effusion with possible superimposed PNA.
IP consulted, drained 150cc and thought effusions unlikely etiology of increased dyspnea.
Portacath placed on [**4-19**] for long-term access.
Derm consulted for new rash at right pleurex site concerning for cutaneous metastases of her breast cancer (carcinoma erysiploides), a biopsy was performed.
Coarse breath sounds on exam bilaterally (?upper airway).
Past Medical History: POncH  # Metastatic breast CA (dx [**2153**])  - s/p mastectomy  - s/p malignant pleural effusion ([**5-/2190**])  - s/p pleurodesis, R pleurex catheter placement ([**6-/2190**])  - s/p fulvestran x4 cycles  - s/p malignant pericardial effusion ([**10/2190**]), d/c'd fulvestran   - pericardial window placed [**11-1**]  - s/p anastrozole, d/c'd [**2-/2192**] [**1-28**] progression  - s/p capecitabine, d/c'd [**1-28**] inability to swallow pills  - Current therapy: Navelbine x1 cycle ([**2192-4-5**])  .
PMH  # Hypothyroidism  # Hyperlipidemia  # Esophageal stenosis s/p dilation ([**2191-9-26**], [**2192-3-23**])  # R eye blindness [**1-28**] herpes keratitis  # s/p umbilical hernia repair ([**2191-8-8**])   Social History: Other: # Personal: Lives alone  # Tobacco: Prior, quit > 50 yr ago  # Alcohol: Social  # Recreational drugs: Not elicited   Family History: Non-contributory.
Overall progression of metastatic disease involving the pleura and lung interstitium (lymphangitic carcinomatosis) right greater than left.
New left renal pelvis prominence, concerning for possible hydronephrosis.
Consider ultrasound for confirmation/characterization, if warranted clinically.
Stable right 5th rib lesion, which could represent osseous metastasis.
Prior granulomatous disease.
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Metastatic breast cancer and recurrent pleural effusion, assessment of change in pleural effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right significantly more the left, are again demonstrated with increased right lower lobe opacity consistent with consolidation, consistent with aspiration versus developing pneumonia.
There is no significant change in bibasilar atelectasis.
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**] Approved: TUE [**2192-4-24**] 9:46 AM   Brief Hospital Course: 88F h/o metastatic breast cancer (malignant pleural effusion, pericardial effusion) on chemotherapy with acute on chronic dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension.
# Dyspnea, tachypnea: Acute worsening may be due to mucous plugging in patient with little pulmonary reserve (effusions, lobar collapse, extensive mets with lymphangitic spread), compounded by tachycardia leading to CHF [**1-28**] decreased diastolic filling and acute pulmonary edema.
Pneumonia (post-obstructive, aspiration pneumonitis) also possible especially given immunosuppression from malignancy, although less likely.
Recent negative LENIs and CTA chest make PE lower on differential.
Dyspnea and hypoxia likely due to enlarging malignant pleural effusion on CXR Given High-flow O2, nebs prn Treated atrial fibrillation per below Continued levo/flagyl, added vanco for possible post-obstructive PNA Blood, urine, sputum, pleurex catheter cultured Pleurex catheter for drainage of effusions.
# Atrial fibrillation: New onset in setting of acute illness, may have been related to hypoxia and possible underlying pneumonia.
# Hypotension: Likely volume depletion in the setting of poor filling and CO due to tachycardia.
Less likely sepsis, cardiogenic, or adrenal etiology.
No evidence bleeding or tamponade (normal pulsus, JVP, and no effusion on recent echo).
No evidence for ACS.
-NPO in setting of AMS  # Metastatic breast CA: Last navelbine [**2192-4-5**].
# Hypothyroidism: Outpatient levothyroxine.
In setting of worsening respiratory failure and poor overall prognosis decision was made to make patient DNR/DNI and ultimately comfort measures only in family meeting.
