Admission Date:  [**2172-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-1-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: AML,Shortness of breath, hematuria  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Placement of a PICC line Placement of a central venous line   History of Present Illness: 78 year old woman who was in in her usual state of excellent health unti she was admitted to [**Location (un) 62562**] Hospital with substernal chest pain, shortness of breath and upper mid back pain on [**2172-11-18**].
She was also noted to have gross hematuria.
PTT normal at 29.8 and PT was elevated at 18.6.
Uric acid was normal  Electrolytes were normal and w/o evidence of tumor lysis.
On [**11-18**] CXR w/ increase vasc congestion and small left effusion and ill-defined desity at right lung base ?
CT [**11-17**] showed diverticulosis and precarinal LAD w/ likely RUL opacity c/w scar.
Also showed left adnexal cystic structure.
haptoglobin-127 * Total bilirubin elevated up to 2.3, but declined to 1.9 the following day ([**11-20**]) * Bone marrow aspirate by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and on her review, she had increased luekemic blasts, without obvious auer rods.
* On ER presentation [**11-18**] her BP was elevated to 204/92 and she complained of urine discoloration since starting nitrofurantoin for urinary frequency x 1 week.
A bone marrow biopsy revealed acute myeloid leukemia best classified as monoblastic M5a (FAB classification) with >90% cells in her bone marrow being blasts.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No weight loss, fever or lymphadenopathy.
No other bleeding other than hematuria.
No nausea, vomitting.
chest and back pain now resolved.
No shortness of breath  Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1) Kidney stone 3 years ago 2) GERD 3) MIBI/stress test [**6-26**] -- reportedly unremarkable w/o reversible ischemic changes.
4) Diverticulosis 5) ?tonsillectomy as a child   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: No smoking.
NO cancers or blood disorders.
She had a slow decline in respiratory function in the setting of DIC and initiation of chemotherapy, and was transferred to the ICU for noninvasive ventilation and diuresis.
This resolved and she was transferred back to the floor where her course was complicated by mucositis as she became neutropenic and her counts declined.
Her hct and platelets were supplemented as needed with transfusions to keep her hct > 25 and platelets > 10.
The mucositis was treated with gelclear, viscous lidocaine and eventually liquid roxicet, and she was placed on TPN.
She also suffered hearing loss, which was initially thought to be secondary to vancomycin.
A head CT was negative, but a head MRI ordered [**12-22**] showed a possible infiltration in the right and left frontal lobes and left cerebellum as well as a small CVA in the left frontal lobe.
She had small vessel disease.
Her counts began to return on [**12-24**] and normalized, requiring no further transfusions.
Her last CBC showed WBC 13.6 (elevation thought to be due to steroids), Hct 33.1 and Platelets differential showed Her mucositis resolved, and her TPN was weaned off and eventually d/c'ed.
* Respiratory Distress: Patient was admitted with respiratory distress that was likely multifactorial.
The inciting processes likely include pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction, as echo [**11-25**] with EF 60-70%, [**1-26**]+ MR) and pneumonia.
There, she was treated for her pneumonia with vancomycin, flagyl and levofloxacin, placed on noninvasive ventilation to decrease her afterload and preload, and she was diuresed gently given her ARF with lasix.
She was ruled out for an MI with cardiac enzymes x 5 with a baseline troponin of 0.05.
The increased fluid worsened her volume status and her respiratory status declined with sats at 93%.
Her respiratory status improved with sats at 99% RA with resolution of her LE edema at time of discharge.
Over the course of her admission, she did have a PICC line attempt on her left arm which resulted in an UE DVT.
She then developed a second UE DVT due to a PICC line in her right arm, which was also not treated due to low platelets.
As her platelets improved, the decision was made not to treat her DVTs given resolution of her erythema, tenderness and edema in her upper extremities and the risk of bleeding from her leukemic infiltrates.
She had no evidence of pulmonary embolus secondary to these DVTs during her admission.
She had a low FENA, no glomerular hematuria on sediment, just red cells and very rare muddy browns (3 total).
Etiology of arf was thought to initially be due to contrast-induced nephropathy.
Her bilirubin began to elevate again and a follow-up RUQ U/S [**12-24**] showed sludge in gallbladder with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or gallstones seen or biliary ductal dilatation.
She also developed a mild transaminitis at this point.
Coagulase negative staph line infection - She developed an infection of her PICC line during her hospital course.
As she had hearing loss with vancomycin previously, she was treated with daptomycin.
Hypertension - currently on atenolol.
HCTZ d/c'ed today due to overdiuresis and normalized BP.
Bowel and bladder incontinence - During her hospital course, she developed bowel and bladder incontinence.
The initial concern was that patient may have leukemic infiltration in cauda equina as well.
She stated that she could not tell when she needed to have a BM or to urinate.
