Admission Date:  [**2199-11-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-11-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-1-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Simvastatin / Nitrofurantoin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 66 yo M with DM, HTN, HCV, PVD with chronic heel ulcers, h/o prostate cancer in [**2194**] s/p XRT and Lupron, chronic foley presents with altered mental status.
He was found at his nursing home to be altered and minimally responsive.
he was also noted to have a fever to 101.
They drew labs and they were significant for leukocytosis of 14.2, Cr 1.6, Calcium 12.1 and glucose 270.
The patient underwent CT-head that showed 2x2cm hypodensity that showed hemorrhage with surrounding edema vs. focal ischemia vs infection.
He was continued on IVF x 2L   Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Diagnosed with prostate cancer in [**2194**].
He had a biopsy at that time with 12 out of 12 cores, positive for 4 +4 with no other evidence of metastatic disease other than some right pelvic iliac lymph nodes.
Family History: Diabetes in both mother and father  Physical Exam: VS: afebrile, 156/80 GEN: Alert, oriented to place, disoriented to time, mildly agitated HEENT: PERRLA.
Extremities: wwp, no edema Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII grossly intact, able to move all extremities, followed simple commands.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Prominent right hilum which could be a small lung lesion or enlarged hilus.
FOOT XRAYS [**2199-11-8**] IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy with a centrally located lung nodule is concerning for primary carcinoma of the lung.
Multiple lytic osseous metastases as described above.
An MR of the spine may be obtained for further evaluation if central canal encroachment or involvement is a clinical concern.
Left-sided pyelonephritis with delayed excretion and a dilated ureter with significant stranding around it.
An ureteroscopy may be obtained following resolution of the infectious symptoms to evaluate the ureter in this location if clinically [**Year (4 digits) 9304**].
Small linear metallic densities in anterior neck and overlying angle of mandible.
EEG [**2199-11-11**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to diffuse mild to moderate slowing with superimposed occasional bifrontal triphasic waves.
The record is most consistent with a diffuse mild to moderate encephalopathy with superimposed elements suggestive of a metabolic encephalopathy.
No frank epileptiform discharges were seen.
CT HEAD [**2199-11-11**] IMPRESSION: Stable round hypodensity in the left frontoparietal white matter with a central focus of hyperdensity is relatively unchanged in size since the prior scan.
Differential diagnosis includes isolated brain metastases, (in a patient with known prostate cancer and recent lung lesion on CT torso, primary tumor, focus of hemorrhage with edema, focal ischemia with central blood products, although the location is unusual for this; or very early focal septic embolism).
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, although hemorrhagic infarction or metastatics prostate carcinoma appear unlikely.
BONE BIOPSY [**2199-11-13**] PENDING  VENOUS DUPLEX [**2199-11-15**] IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower extremity.
Limited visualization of left calf veins.
Brief Hospital Course: #Altered Mental Status: Patient was brought to MICU for altered mental status, initially thought to be multifactorial d/t combination of new met vs. infection in frontal lobe, hypercalcemia, urosepsis.
continued to fluctuate during ICU stay, though overall trend was improvent mainly upon correction of electrolyte abnormalities (patient defervesced earlier than any substantial mental status improvement).
Prostate mets thought unlikely d/t location of new lesions and PSA not high enough for diffuse disease.
Upon consultation with onc team and famuily, decision was made to biopsy bony mets first to see if mets are indeed from new cancer type.
Bone biopsy from hip mass revealed a non-small cell malignancy that was like metastatic from the lung.
Pt was transfered to OMED for further evaluation of NSCLC, but was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening respiratory distress.
#hypercalcemia: thought to be related to patient's neoplasm (diffuse new spinal/pelvic mets on CT, lung mass, brain mass), whether PTHrp or just bone mets.
#hypernatremia: patient became hypernatremic during ICU course and was given hypotonic IV fluid therapy and free water flushes which resolved the hypernatremia.
#UTI: culture showed CTX sensitive klebsiella without, so patient was treated with ceftriaxone without recurrence of fever.
#tachypnea: was tachypneic during much of ICU stay without hypoxia and with reassuring ABGs.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  Patient presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with respiratory distress of unknown etiology.
His course on the ventilator continued to be tenuous, with episodes of sporadic tachypnea not associated with desaturations.
