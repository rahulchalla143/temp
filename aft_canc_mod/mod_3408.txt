Of note, the pt had a cardiac cath [**3-19**] which showed 80% LAD and bifurcated diag with >70% stenosis in both poles.
At that time, US showed no flow into pseudoanaerysm which was thought to be thrombosed.
When he wiped, there was some blood on the toilet paper.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt had a streaky brown marroon stool.
Of note, pt had cauderization of cecal AV malformation at an OSH in [**2141**].
In the ED, the pt became hypotensive from BP 130/37 on arrival to a low of SBP 86.
In the ED, the pt refused NGT and when this was brought up, he began to c/o chest pain.
EKG at that time showed ST depressions in V2 and V4-6 which were worse from earlier in the day, new STE in AVR and the pt was thought to be in an irregular rhythm ?
multifocal atrial tachycardia.
On the floor, pt is c/o [**4-8**] left sided chest tightness with out lightheadedness, SOB or palpitations.
Pt states he has had similar chest pain for several months.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-3-20**], pulmonary artery pressures can be assessed on the current study and are mildly elevated.
Aortic stenosis remains crtical.
Brief Hospital Course: 87-year-old male with history of CAD, critical AS planned for CABG, AVR presented with BRBPR and demand ischemia.
# Bright red blood per rectum: The patient had a 3 point Hct drop in 2 days and 1 maroon stool by report.
Stool guaiac was trace positive in the ICU.
They found evidence of hemorrhoids and diverticula and one rectal polyp without evidence of active bleeding.
# Chest pain: The patient developed chest pain.
The patient had a slight cardiac enzyme elevation which is likely secondary to demand ischemia.
# Severe AS: The patient also has significant CAD.
He was scheduled for a CABG/AVR however developed the GI bleed.
He remained chest pain free while he was an inpatient in the hospital.
# Hypertension: Antihypertensives were held in setting of GI bleed.
# Dyslipidemia: Continued statin.
Hemorrhoids  Secondary Diagnosis: 1.
CAD 2.
HTN 3. critical AS 4.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with lower GI bleed.
You also developed chest pain as well.
You were transfused blood and your hematocrit (red blood cell count) remained stable.
You had a slight increase in your cardiac enzymes suggesting a small heart attack.
Your chest pain has now resolved.
They found hemorrhoids and no other obvious bleed.
You were discharged with a plan to return Thrusday for cardiac surgery.
