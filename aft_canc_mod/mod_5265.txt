Husband states that pt respiratory distress occured acutely and did not improve with new O2 tanks.
He states that she did not complain of any chest pain but he states that she did have fevers and cough earlier that day.

Chest CT [**5-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Extensive tumor involving the mid and distal esophagus invading into the right hilum and intimately associated with the left atrium.
This tumor narrows and encases the right-sided pulmonary arteries and occludes the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi.
3) Interval placement of an esophageal stent as well as an apparent right- sided bronchial stent which is now located within the fistulous tract connecting the residual esophageal lumen and the right lower lobe bronchi.
4) Persisting total collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
5) Persisting fluid-filled cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe, which may be superinfected.
6) Persisting ground glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right upper and left lower lobes, likely infectious.
7) Lytic lesion in the T12 vertebral body, likely metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 40 y/o F with PMHx significant for metastatic esophageal CA, ?
NSCLC s/p R bronchus and esophageal stents who presents from OSH with fever and respiratory distress.
Respiratory Distress: The intial suspicion was that the patient had developed a pneumonia which led to a decompensation on the backgroudn of her poor baseline with R lung atelectasis from her tumor.
This unfortunately showed very severe anatomical defects caused by the urdelying cancer.
There was obstruction noted of both L and R mainstem bronchus.
The patient returned for another bronch by interventional pulmonary with a plan to make an aggressive attempt to treat the lesions as best as possible.
It was explained to the patient and the family that she would never be able to be safely extubated given the severity of the disease and that her prognosis from the aggressive cancer was one of terminal progression likely over weeks to a few months.
