She had dyspnea and tachypnea.
CXR showed markedly worsened bilateral opacities.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  [**Known firstname 57315**] Bezabhe was diagnosed with T3, N2, stage IIIC colon cancer in [**11/2188**] by colonoscopy.
She underwent right hemicolectomy on [**2188-11-25**] with resection of a 4.5cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion.
MRI of the abdomen at the time of diagnosis showed two hepatic hemangiomas; no metastasis.
She then completed six months of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU/Leucovorin after having failed oxaliplatin due to severe nausea.
Cancer recurred with Krukenberg tumor resected by left salpingoophorectomy and right salpingectomy in [**11/2189**], and again in right ovary status post right salpingoophorectomy in 8/[**2190**].
CEA rose and she was found to have pulmonary metastasis and then treated with irinotecan/Erbitux, completed in 4/[**2191**].
PMH: - colon cancer as above - bilateral oophorectomies - now on HRT   Social History: Originally from [**Country 4812**], now living with her siblings in [**Location (un) 3146**], MA, denies etoh, tobacco, or ivdu.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Bronchial breath sounds at LUL with coarsened breath sounds throughout.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.

No PTX or effusions.
[**11-27**] CT CHEST IMPRESSION: Marked interval progression of extensive pulmonary and left hilar nodal metastases with new bronchial compromise, left upper lobe.
Mild increase in the left frontal enhancing lesion, which now measures 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.3 cm in the transverse, AP, and CC dimensions compared to the prior of 0.8 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm in similar dimensions.
Post-surgical changes noted in the left posterior fossa, with enhancement of the dura and mild enhancement in the surgical bed, with the area of blood products, in the surgical bed being smaller compared to the prior study.
Thrombosis/post-surgical changes in the left transverse sinus, unchanged.
New FLAIR hyperintense focus in the left side of the splenium of the corpus callosum without enhancement and questionable decreased diffusion raising the possibility of subacute infarct or cystic change.
Mildly low-lying cerebellar tonsils 0.8 cm below the margins of the foramen magnum, not significantly changed allowing for the technical differences.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 57314**] is a 37-year old Ethiopian lady with widely metastatic colon cancer to the brain and lungs who was admitted from the emergency department, where she was intubated for respiratory distress.
Her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course was complicated by hypotension/sepsis and sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- The patient was intubated for respiratory distress in the ED.
Prior to intubation, the patient understood that there is a high chance that she may not be able to get extubated if her respiratory failure is largely secondary to metastatic disease.
Despite a course of empiric treatment for HAP with Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levaquin and Flagyl for 10 days, the patient's lung compliance remained extremely poor.
Decrease in PEEP resulted to volume loss and collapse.
Bronchoscopy was performed which revealed no mucous plugging, but showed extensive extrinsic compression by the tumor.
There was no further evidence of infecion, as the patient was afebrile, normotensive, with normal WBC count.
METASTATIC COLON CANCER- The patient was seen by Oncology, who concluded that there are no further pallaiative treatments available at this point.
HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS- On presentation, the patient was hypotensive likely secondary to sepsis and was maintained on Levophed in order to keep MAPs>65.
The patient was pan-cultured and immediate empiric treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn was initiated.
Over the next several days, hypotension has resolved and the patient remained afebrile with normal WBC counts.
Sputum culture was negative for PCP.
SUSTAINED POLYMORPHIC VT- On [**2193-12-13**], the patient had sustained 41-beat run of polymorphic VT. Etiology was believed to be likely metabolic.
