Admission Date:  [**2121-4-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-5-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-11-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**] Chief Complaint: intramucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2121-4-30**] minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who had a workup for anemia, which included an upper endoscopy with biopsies, which showed at least high-grade dysplasia.
Endomucosal resection was attempted, demonstrating intramucosal carcinoma without invasion into the submucosa.
He has had no dysphagia and otherwise feels well.
A second line along the nasogastric tube appears to be exterior to the patient.
The small right pleural effusion and the postoperative opacities in the right lung have not increased in size.
Unchanged small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis.
No evidence of leak or obstruction.
Small amount of oral contrast material is seen tracking into the airway, consistent with aspiration.
[**2121-5-6**] video oropharyngeal swallow: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There is no gross aspiration or penetration.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted [**2121-4-30**] for a minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy.
Pain was well-controlled on PCA.
Since his surgery, patient maintained a persistent oxygen requirement, likely related to his chronic lung disease, and would desaturate to the mid-80s, though as low as 60s-70s, on room air.
Chest xrays were checked daily and showed L>R atelectasis and no evidence of pneumothorax.
On [**5-5**] patient underwent esophogram, which showed no evidence of leak but a question of aspiration, which in retrospect appear to have been artifactual.
Patient was continued on NPO status until [**5-6**] when video oropharyngeal swallow study was performed, which showed no evidence of aspiration or penetration.
