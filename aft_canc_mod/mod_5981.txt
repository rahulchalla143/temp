Admission Date:  [**2201-2-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2201-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2145-11-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of a traumatic brain injury and seizure disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as reported coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the hospital yesterday from the nursing home, where he was noted to be hypoxic to 76% on room air with decreased responsiveness.
In the emergency department, he was noted to have diffuse rhonchi on examination and chest x-ray revealing right and left lobar pneumonia.
The patient was transferred to the floor and started on antibiotics for treatment of a possible aspiration pneumonia.
He was lethargic and essentially unresponsive to even a deep sternal rub, although did show some mild withdrawal this painful stimuli.
He had been discharged earlier this month for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation on Prednisone, Levaquin, and Flagyl.
Also of note, the patient had not received his phenobarbital, which he takes chronically for history of seizures for the past two days.
Traumatic brain injury in [**2190**] complicated by a seizure disorder status post right temporal lobe lobectomy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, not on home oxygen.
History of congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately 45% by recent echocardiogram, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and global RV free-wall hypokinesis.
History of obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic aspiration pneumonia.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
History or Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus by report.
Chronic urinary tract infections.
Chronic hypothermia with baseline temperature of 93 to 94.
Chronic bradycardia and hypotension, baseline heart rate in the 50s and 60s, both of which have been attributed to a central process, status post brain injury.
History of mild dysplastic syndrome.
History of chronic thrombocytopenia attributed to myelodysplastic syndrome.
The patient most recently developed a rash to MEROPENEM on a prior hospitalization and it was promptly discontinued.
GENERAL:  The patient is nontoxic, but chronically ill-appearing in no acute distress.
Oropharynx was clear without lesions.
NECK:  No JVD, supple.
No appreciable lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS:  Lungs revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and distended.
EXTREMITIES:  1+ edema in the lower extremities at the ankle bilaterally.
The patient was nonresponsive to verbal stimuli with mild response to sternal rub.
The patient does make some spontaneous movements of his extremities with no obvious focal neurological deficit.
Chest x-ray showed a right middle lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia, no evidence of congestive heart failure.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient presented to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with acute mental status change.
The patient was found be essentially unresponsive with no obvious focal neurologic deficit on the floor.
They felt that the patient may have seized secondary to having had his phenobarbital held for the past two days.
However, EEG done on the day of admission showed no acute process and actually was somewhat improved from his baseline generalized slowing.
The patient had no suggestion of active seizure activity during this hospitalization.
We felt that CO2 narcosis could be contributing, given that the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with overlying pneumonia.
The PCO2 were running higher than his baseline, although the patient had had an equally high pCO2 on admission without associated mental status depression.
We felt that he was unable to protect his airway with his heavy secretions given his depressed mental status.
There had been no acute decompensation from a respiratory standpoint.
From previous admissions, the patient was noted to have a baseline core-body temperature of approximately 93 to 94, which had been attributed to a central process, status post a traumatic brain injury.
We asked the Endocrine Service to evaluate him for possible panhypopituitarism versus secondary hypothyroidism in the setting of his traumatic brain injury.
Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were sent to rule out Hashimoto's thyroiditis and these were normal.
The patient was ultimately given a trial of thyroxine IV given consideration that hypothyroidism might be contributing to his depressed mental status as well as to the other hemodynamic abnormalities, which were more chronic.
We also considered poor oxygenation secondary to congestive heart failure as a possible etiology.
Although the patient's oxygenation remained relatively good, he showed some evidence of congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and responded to Lasix.
The patient had head CT, which showed no acute change.
He ultimately underwent a lumbar puncture, which showed no infectious process.
Regarding his history of seizure disorder, phenobarbital level was checked on admission to the Medical ICU and found to be within normal limits.
PULMONARY:  The patient presented with evidence of right and left basilar pneumonia thought to be aspiration given history of recurrent aspiration.
The patient did develop a rash on his chest and upper arms later in his MICU course, which looked consistent with a drug rash.
Given his history of reaction to betalactams and Imipenem, it was thought that the Ceftriaxone might be the culprit.
Base on the results of his preliminary sputum cultures, we did not have a alternative choice of treatment.
His rash subsequently resolved on its own, despite continued treatment with Ceftriaxone.
The patient had thick and copious, often blood tinged secretions throughout his hospitalization.
Sputum cultures were consistently contaminated samples, but did grow moderate Klebsiella and Citrobacter, both of which were multi-drug resistant.
Regarding his history of congestive heart failure, the patient was noted to have a mild failure by chest x-ray with some small bilateral effusions.
We did evaluate his right- sided effusion during this hospitalization by ultrasound with the expectation to perform a thoracentesis for possible septic source contributing to his depressed mental status.
There were no significant tapable effusion noted by ultrasound and that procedure was deferred.
Congestive heart failure did not appear to be a major contributor to the patient's deterioration during his hospitalization.
Regarding the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he was maintained on bronchodilators and steroids.
We ultimately transitioned him to PO Prednisone for better anti-inflammatory coverage of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, which is not documented by recent catheterization or treadmill test on our computer system.
He would likely not tolerated beta blockade given his chronic bradycardia.
The patient was noted to experience approximately six hours rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the setting of IV Levoxyl therapy.
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction at this time.
Other possible etiologies of his atrial fibrillation included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and underlying infection.
The patient subsequently reconverted to normal sinus rhythm within approximately six hours and had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
When the patient was initially admitted to the floor, he was aggressively diuresed for thought that his heart failure might be contributing to his depressed mental status and difficulty breathing.
HEMATOLOGICAL:  The patient has chronically low platelets and white blood count, which had been attributed to a myelodysplastic syndrome.
He has had a single trace guaiac-positive stool on this admission.
We will plan to recheck the hematocrit and initiate a full anemia workup and consider transfusion given his coronary artery disease history.
The patient was evaluated by the Endocrine Service and through to have either secondary hypothyroidism versus sick euthyroid syndrome.
The endocrine team felt that neither of these diagnoses likely explain his acute deterioration in his mental status.
It was difficult to interpret his thyroid function tests given that all current prior tests had been done in the setting of acute illness.
