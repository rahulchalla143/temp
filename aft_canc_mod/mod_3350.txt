There is a right-sided pleural effusion.
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
Right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, no radiographic evidence of pneumonia or CHF  Liver US [**2-28**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Patent portal vein and hepatic veins with no signs of thrombosis.
Normal main hepatic artery with normal systolic upstroke and no signs of proximal obstruction.
RUE US [**3-3**] No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right arm.
There was delay in oral transit.
There was incomplete epiglottic deflection during most swallows and marked residual contrast which could not be cleared after multiple swallows with nectar- thick contrast, and more significant with pudding- thick and barium-coated cookie.
Attempts to clear the residue with nectar resulted in silent aspiration which could not be cleared.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2140-2-27**] he was taken to the OR for cadaveric liver transplant and repair of chronic diaphragmatic hernia.
Due to increasing peak airway pressures further attempts at closing the abdomen would lead to abdominal compartment syndrome a piece of Vicryl mesh was incorporated into the abdominal closure.
He was extubated on [**3-3**] with some residual hoarseness and ENT was consulted.
Exam showed edema bilat, vocal cord crisp with VC mobile bilaterally with 2mm central glottic gap.
Duplex U/S was done to evaluate noting patent hepatic and portal veins with slow flow in portal vein as on prior study.
There were normal arterial and hepatic venous waveforms.
No biliary dilatation was noted.
He continued to cough and raise thick secretions using suction due to weak cough.
A Video swallow was performed on [**3-7**] showing aspiration of multiple consistencies.
On [**3-8**], a videostroboscopy was done that revealed evidence of significantglottic gap and lack of vocal fold tension, suspected secondary to fatigue, as well as glottic hyperfunction and posterior glottic changes consistent with chronic reflux.
No discrete lesions or restriction in movement of the arytenoids were noted.
PT evaluated and found his activity to be limited due to tubings and edematous state, recommending inpatient rehabilitation.
Scrotal and pedal edema decreasing with diuresis.
CVL kept due to poor venous access.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Hospital **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed: for constipation.
