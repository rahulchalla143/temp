History of Present Illness: 64M with a history of Hep C and hemachromatosis who was transferred from [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital this evening for UGI bleed.
He reports that he has been experiencing vague central abdominal pain for approximately 2 weeks.
In the last 5 days, the pain has gotten progressively worse.
Two nights ago he developed nausea and had one episode of vomiting of primarily previously ingested food.
His pain and nausea led him to present to [**Hospital3 85745**] Hospital this evening where he was administered oral contrast for a CT scan.
The contrast caused him to become nauseous again and he developed vomiting of coffee ground emesis.
He does report feeling some dizziness/lightheadedness when he stands and it was noted at the OSH that he had orthostatic hypotension.
He was given a total of 1800cc of crystalloid and no blood products before being transferred here.
The patient reports that he has had vague abdominal pains on and off for several years but these episodes were typically mild and resolved spontaneously.
He also endorses a 100lb weight loss over the last 4 years ever since his stroke, not all of which was intentional.
At that time, he remembers that he was told that he had enlarged bile ducts and a liver masses.
He underwent a biopsy of this liver mass and the pathology was reportedly negative.
Family History: mother had gastric cancer in her 80's, father had prostate cancer.
No other malignancy or hemachromatosis that he knows about.
Coccyx: Stage I pressure ulcer - healing Extr: Warm, thin, +1 pitted edema b/l   Pertinent Results: [**2104-3-3**]: EGD: Food in the stomach body Ulcer in the second part of the duodenum EUS: Changes of Chronic pancreatitis in the body and tail of pancreas.
Large pancreatic mass 7.85cm x 5.3cm in the pancreatic head.
DDx: Pancreatic mass that is possibly malignancy (adenoCA), degenerated IPMN, MCN, cystic NET and inflammatory mass.
[**2104-3-3**]: Cytology Panc head mass:         POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,         Consistent with adenocarcinoma.
[**2104-3-3**]: Cytology Celiac LN:         POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,         Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma  [**2104-3-8**]: CT chest: 1.
Small amount of free fluid in the partially visualized upper abdomen.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, new since [**2104-3-1**].
Small pericardial effusion, new since [**2104-3-1**].
No evidence of metastatic disease to the chest.
No evidence of PE, as clinically questioned.
Stable bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Small hypodense foci within the atelectasis at the right base could represent small loculation of fluid versus infection.
Large heterogeneous enhancing pancreatic mass replacing the pancreatic head, neck, and uncinate process, not significantly changed in size or appearance since the prior outside hospital study, given differences in technique.
Likely invasion of the pancreatic mass into the duodenum, with findings concerning for ulceration of these structures, which if perforated may explain the tiny foci of pneumoperitoneum with the right upper quadrant.
Dilated pancreatic duct containing a focal defect anteriorly which empties into a 2.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm walled-off fluid collection, consistent with a pseudocyst, anterior to the pancreas.
Distal pancreatic duct is not dilated, but contains calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
4.1 x 3.3 x 3.7 cm left hemipelvic fluid collection, likely abscess.
Small abdominal and pelvic ascites with peritoneal enhancement, suggesting inflammation.
Fluid is thought to be secondary to either leakage from pancreatic duct versus contents from the stomach and/or duodenum due to ulceration by the pancreatic head mass.
Abnormal small bowel mucosal enhancement and diffuse dilatation of both the large and small bowel with no definite transition point.
Given the evidence of peritoneal inflammation, this likely represents an ileus secondary to a chemical peritonitis rather than a bowel obstruction.
Fibrinopurulent exudate and granulation tissue, consistent with abscess.
No malignancy identified.
No microorganisms are seen on GMS or PAS stains.
B.  Liver, wedge biopsy: Atypical bile duct proliferation with associated acute and chronic inflammation, favor bile duct hamartoma.

He underwent an EUS/EGD which demonstrated an ulcer in the second part of the duodenum.
The EUS also demonstrated a large pancreatic mass 7.85cm x 5.3cm in the pancreatic head.
Large celiac lymph nodes were also seen and biopsied.
Chest xray showed a large gastric bubble.
The patient was unable to tolerate POs likely secondary to gastric outlet obstruction so a PICC line was placed and TPN was started on [**3-7**].
On [**3-8**] the patient became hypoxic, hypotensive and CT demonstrated a perforated duodenum.
There were multiple suspicious lesions on the liver which were biopsied.
He was taken back to the OR on [**3-11**] for a washout.
The perforated area of the duodenum was still difficult to access and he was left with a drain in place and an open abdomen and VAC placement.
The patient was made DNR and they decided to ultimately get the patient through his acute illness with the goal to discharge to hospice.
He remained afebrile and hymodynamically stable.
Before discharge on [**3-25**], the VAC dressing was removed and changed to a wet to dry for transport.
Patient was having intermittent diarrhea during his admission and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency should be considered if this persists.
Medications on Admission: verapamil 480mg daily, metformin 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], actos 45mg daily, lisinopril 40mg daily, humulin N 30units QAM and QPM, HCTZ (dose unknown)  Discharge Medications: 1. glucagon (human recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) mg Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.

Duodenal ulcer 3.
Duodenal perforation   Discharge Condition: A&O x3, ambulating with assistance, VAC dressing over abdomen (whitefoam sponge), pain well controlled, tolerated 1000cc/day full liquids in addition to his TPN.
