Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum   Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/o female with HTN, DM, CHF with EF 25-30%, mesenteric vein thrombosis (on coumadin), Ulcerative colitis and recent C. diff colitis presenting with melanotic stools, coffee ground emesis in setting of coagulopathy with INR 4.5 on admission.
A central line was placed for access and blood draws due to poor peripheral access.
Serial hematocrits were followed and showed no evidence of active bleeding.
An EGD performed on [**9-3**] showed increased granularity, friability, erythema and congestion in the lower third of the esophagus from 25cm to 35cm but no evidence active bleeding.
Polypectomy was deferred to outpatient setting secondary to recent active GI bleed.
A repeat EGD was also performed for biopsy of erosive gastritis.
#2 Anticoagulation for history of mesenteric vein thrombosis in [**2146**]: Patient presented with acute GI bleed in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
Upon discharge the patient was not restarted on her coumadin as her colonic polyp was felt to be a significant risk for chronic gastrointestinal bleed.
Patients' with IBD are at 3x higher risk for developping pulmonary embolism/ deep venous thrombosis compared to the normal population.
Most associated thromboembolic events occur within the portal, mesenteric and retinal veins.
80% of patient's who present with newly diagnosed thromboses have active IBD at the time of diagnosis.
#3 Heart Failure: Systolic (EF55%):  The patient presented with mild symptoms of volume overload consistent with CHF exaccerbation post transfusion.
Upon discharge, patient was euvolemic with no crackles in her lungs and only mild edema in extremities.
She remained asymptomatic with no symptoms of end organ ischemia.
#5 Ulcerative Colitis: Patient has history of ulcerative colitis.
She was maintained on her home dose of azathioprine and asacol and had no evidence of active disease as confirmed by colonoscopy report.
As per colonoscopy report, the patient did not have severe disease and no psuedomembranous colitis or evidence of toxic megacolone was visible.
