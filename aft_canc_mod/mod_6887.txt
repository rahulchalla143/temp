SPINE: New since [**11/2148**]: 2.9 cm AP x 2.8 cm TV x 2.6 cm SI L3 lytic/soft tissue metastasis with cotrtical breakthrough into inferior endplate and spinal canal.
Compression of R ventral/lateral thecal sac (traversing L4 ventral nerve root) with complete obliteration of R subarticular recess and neural foramen (exiting L3 nerve root).Diffuse disc bulges, lig flavum thickening, and facet hypertrophy throughout L-spine with mod-severe canal stenoses.
CHEST: Moderate emphysema and LUL soft tissue mass, at least 8.6 cm AP x 5 cm TV x 7cm SI, with spiculations, dystrophic calcifications, and broad based pleural tag.
LLL varicoid bronchiectasis suggests recurrent aspiration or inflammation.
ABDOMEN: Mildly fatty liver.
7-mm R renal interpolar nonobstructing stone.
Atherosclerosis with 2.1- cm infrarenal ectasia.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION 63 year old man w/ known metastatic stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer w/ known new L3 mass w/ cord compression.
ACTIVE ISSUES # L3 Cord compression:  Patient presented with progressive back and hip pain.
He was referred to the hospital after OSH MRI was found to be concerning for spinal cord compression.
Sensory exam findings and pain were consistent with L3 lesion but there was minimal evidence of neurological compromise on exam.
STABLE ISSUES # Stage IV Small cell lung cancer: Last imaging in [**11-28**] demonstrated progressive intra-thoracic disease and increased in nodal burden.
# Pain control: Patient's pain was initially managed with NSAIDs and IV morphine prn.
