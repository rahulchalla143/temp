History of Present Illness: 65 yo M with h/o AML D+119 s/p allo-SCT presents with febrile neutropenia and fatigue.
His peripheral blood showed 19% atypicals which later were read by pathology as blasts.
There was concern for relapse.
Then two days prior to admission he began to feel weak and have chills.
He still complains of fatigue and weakness.
He felt some lightheadedness, but no fainting or LOC.
He denies CP, SOB, cough, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, no rectal pain.
In the clinic, he appeared weak and fatigued and given his temperature at home, it was decided that he should be admitted to the hospital.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99.9, BP 128/92, HR 80, RR 18 General: fatigued appearing male lying in bed; right chest port site is clean without erythema or edema HEENT: NCAT, anicteric, mildly injected conjunctiva, MMM, oral pharynx clear without erythema or exudate.
No ulcers or lesions.
CV: RRR, nl S1 S2, no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB no w/r/r Abd: +BS, soft, NTND Extremities: + 1 pitting edema bilaterally lower extremities with R slightly greater than left.
No calf tenderness.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
Pertinent Results: Studies: [**2125-6-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to radiograph from [**2125-4-6**].
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Small peripheral basilar consolidation of the left lower lobe which is nonspecific and may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
Three-mm nodule in the right lower lobe and a 4-mm nodule in the right upper lobe for which attention should be paid on followup examinations.
Sub-cm exophytic hyperdense lesion within the upper pole of the right kidney which is nonspecific and may represent a hemorrhagic cyst, however MRI is indicated on a non-emergent basis for further characterization.
Leukemia Relapse.
Febrile Neutropenia On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 22571**] had fever and neutropenia.
There was no obvious source for infection given lack of localizing signs or symptoms initially.
He did have a portacath which looked clean and intact.
The patient had recurrent bouts of fever/hypothermia and hypotension requiring MICU treatment, but was able to be stabilized with fluids and never required pressors.
3. rash- He developed maculopapular rash on legs on [**2125-6-13**]- nickel size erythematous raised lesions, which were initially non pruritic but became pruritic.
There was concern over sweet's syndrome vs. leukemia cutis.
The biopsy showed superficial to mid-dermal perivascular mixed lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate with atypical mononuclear cells consistent with blasts and red blood cell extravasation.
No vasculitis or neutrophilic infiltrate is seen.
A hypersensitivity reaction with infiltration by circulating leukemic cells is favored, however if the eruption becomes more prominent, re-biopsy to exclude the development of leukemia cutis should be considered, as clinically appropriate.
