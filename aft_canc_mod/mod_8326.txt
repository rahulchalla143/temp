Catheterization of the celiac trunk [**2127-1-24**]   History of Present Illness: 71 year old female with arthritis, osteoporosis, history of duodenal ulcer and recently diagnosed gastric cancer initially treated with chemotherapy c/b nausea/vomiting/lower GI bleed, now presenting with melanotic stool and ten point hematocrit drop.
Per the patient, she had been in her usual state of health (limited energy, but independent in ADLs at home) until this morning, when she had three bowel movements with black stool.
She may have felt some dizziness with ambulation for the last couple of days, but denied falls, lightheadedness, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, or hematuria.
Per ED history, patient endorsed an episode of bloody emesis, but she denied this after arriving to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Exam was notable for pale sclera and skin, and black stool on rectal exam.
ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 88 bpm, and no ischemic changes.
GI was consulted, and recommended keeping patient NPO for EGD in AM, and transfusing RBCs for goal Hct > 25. .
Per recent radiation oncology notes, the patient has also had significant short-term memory problems and a 40 lb weight loss since starting chemo.
The decision was made to defer raditation treatment or further chemo, since the patient was feeling generally well and her PET scan showed general decrease in size of tumor burden.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Carcinoma of GE junction, likely gastric   - Presented in [**6-10**] with dysphagia, initial EGD showed ulcer in cardia and gastritis but no mass and biopsies then negative for malignancy.
CT showed showed 5 mm RLL nodule and ulcerated gastric mass at GE junction.
There was a 5 mm lung nodule noted as well as an ulcerated gastric mass within the fundus near the GE junction extending outside the lumen of the stomach measuring 4.5 x 2.8, without adenopathy.
EUS revealed hypoechoic ill-defined mass and biopsy and cytology was suspicious for signet cell tumor.
A repeat PET scan was performed, which revealed decreased bilateral hilar and precarinal lymph node FDG uptake.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss surgical options, but thought to be a poor surgical candidate.
She also has significant short-term memory loss since initiating chemotherapy.
She was having some nausea related to mucus production; however, her husband has placed her on a complimentary alternative medicine, which is derived from the mushroom growing on the bark of the white [**Doctor Last Name **], which is obtained from [**Country 532**].
Other Past Medical History: - Arthritis - per OMR, but patient denies - Osteoporosis - diagnosed many years ago, was on Fosamax, but discontinued this >1yr ago for unclear reasons - Hypercholesterolemia - per OMR, but patient denies, never been on a statin or other medication - Anxiety - Duodenal ulcer - Gastritis - Palpitations   Social History: Married, originally from [**Location (un) 3156**].
Family History: Mother died of Leukemia many years ago.
Physical Exam: On admission: VS: Temp:97.7 BP:99/59 HR:83 RR:11 O2sat:100% 3L NC GEN: pleasant elderly Russian woman, appears chronically ill and weakened, comfortable, NAD HEENT: + conjunctival pallor, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RRR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: Flat, NT/ND, +b/s, soft, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: Awake, alert, interactive, oriented to name, place, year, month, but cannot name the date.
No sensory deficits to light touch appreciated RECTAL:  Deferred .
Studies: Imaging: CXR [**2127-1-23**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
EGD [**2127-1-24**]: A large ulcerated friable mass of malignant appearance was found at the gastroesophageal junction.
The mass caused a partial obstruction, but the scope traversed the lesion.
Normal duodenum, normal stomach   Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o F with gastric adenocarcinoma and history of duodenal ulcers, presenting with one day of black stools and dizziness, found to have ten point hematocrit drop from most recent lab work.
# Melena/anemia: Thought to be upper GIB secondary to gastric malignancy versus possible ulcer.
She underwent bedside EGD in the ICU which demonstrated a tumor in the GE junction with no signs of active bleeding and was otherwise unremarkable.
Per the high risk of rebleeding from the tumor she was taken to the IR suite for attempted embolization which was unsuccessful d/t a common origin of the left gastric artery and inferior diaphragmatic arteries off the celiac trunk thus the former could not be embolized in isolation.
She had a small guaiac positive stool on [**1-26**], but was asymptomatic without a significant drop in hematocrit.
Surgery notes indicate that she may have metastatic disease which would preclude her from having curative surgical options.
Although percutaneous feeding tubes may be of some palliative benefit, if within goals of care.
She had a PET scan to assess size of gastroesphogeal mass and whether there were metatastases to determine further treatment - palliative radiation in setting of gastric mass bleeding vs. surgery or other treatment.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to stress in setting of GIB.
Remained afebrile without localizing symptoms.
There were no labs pending on the day of discharge.
Gastric Cancer 2.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of blood loss from your gastrointestinal tract which was thought to be caused by bleeding from your gastric cancer.
You also underwent catheterization with the aim of stopping blood flow to the gastric tumor but this was unfortunately not achieved.
START Sucralfate 1mg by mouth four times daily START Acetaminophen 325mg 1-2 tablets every 4-6hours as needed for pain START Ondansetron 8mg tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea  **It is important that you not take Ibuprofen, Aleve, or Aspirin, as these can cause bleeding.
