Admission Date:  [**2144-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-8-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-12-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Weakness and Fatigue.
History of Present Illness: This is a 46-year-old woman with glioblastoma multiforme (diagnosed [**2144-4-24**]) presented with two weeks of increasing weakness and fatigue.
He reported several witnessed episodes of shaking in her left hand, lasting less than a minute.
She did not lose her bladder or bowel function.
There was no tongue biting, eye rolling back, or loss of consciousness.
He reported several episodes of decreased responsiveness.
She has not had any episodes of diaphoresis or tremulousness.
She denied any dysuria or decrease in urine output.
She reported weight gain, leg swelling, increase in facial size, and increased tissue mass in neck as a result of Cushingnoid features.
Family History: Family History:  Her mother died of colon cancer at age 32.
General: Patient drowsy although responsive to commands intermittently HEENT: neck supple, flat neck veins Heart: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: Clear to auscultation Abdomen: soft/non-tender/non-distended, +BS Extremities: She has 2+ pedal edema Neurologic Examination: Her eyes are closed most of the time but arousable.
It is unclear if this is secondary to the volume loss or infiltrate.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-8-14**] FINDINGS: Again, seen is a 1.7 x 1.5 cm rim-enhancing lesion within the left temporal lobe medially abutting the basal ganglia.
There is also no change in surrounding hypoattenuation consistent with edema.
There is no hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures or new areas of abnormal enhancement.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There is some mass effect on the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, unchanged from the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of rim-enhancing mass within the medial left temporal lobe.
No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
The visualized bowel via bowel wall enhances normally and there is bowel dilatation.
Low-density changes surrounding the pancreas.
Weakness/Fatigue: Patient presented to ED [**2144-8-14**] with 2 weeks of increasing weakness and fatigue.
Differential diagnoses included dehydration, seizures, hyperglycemia, worsened malignancy, or infection.
Patient and husband reported improvement since admission with hydration and insulin, making dehydration and hyperglycemia more likely.
She did not have witnessed seizures and her EEG was negative.
Head CT showed no change from prior scans, making worsening of malignancy less likely.
Patient was intially on Keppra out-patient with a dose of 500 mg daily without evidence of overt seizure activity.
Anion Gap Acidosis with Elevated Lactate:  Patient intially had anion gap of 20, lactate 8.6, and elevated blood glucose.
Thought the anion gap acidosis likely secondary to high lactate, as the anion gap closed when the lactate came down.
Elevated Lactate:  Patient with elevated lactate to 6 upon admission, decreased to 1 then increased again to 8.6 day after admission with elevated anion gap to 20.
Differential diagnosis includes seizures (although seizures that could cause a lactate of 8.6 would likely need to be tonic clonic seizures that would not be subtle and none such events have been witnessed).
Also infection was on differential but workup was negative (as mentioned above) and patient did not look septic clinically.
Increased Urine Output:  Patient with increased urine output beginning around midnight on [**2144-8-18**] with up to 200-300cc/hr.
Urine electrolytes checked to r/o diabetes insipidus and they were normal (as was serum sodium).
History of DVT and PE: Patient with supratherapeutic INR to 3.1 on admission.
Patient was then subtherapeutic INR, and was started on Heparin gtt with subsequent supratherapeutic PTT - therefore this was discontinued.
Most likely due to vaginal bleeding.
Diabetes Mellitus:  Patient with elevated BS to 300's on day after admission on floor - transferred to ICU for better glycemic control.
PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Change in mental status Lactic Acidosis  Secondary: Gliobastoma Multiforme Diabetes Mellitus Anemia Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: All vitals are stable.
Please report to the ED or to you physician if you have any chest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or any other concerns at all.
