He was brought to the ED where he was found to have a R cerebellar lesion and a cervical fracture.
He also had rib fractures and a R pneumothorax.
He was intubated and taken to MRI which showed a R cerebellar mass with edema and mass effect on the peduncle, however no compression of the lateral ventricle.

Rule out CVA based on prior CT.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior CT, there is evidence of vasogenic edema involving the right cerebellar hemisphere, In addition, there is a rounded heterogeneously enhancing mass at the level of the right cerebellar tonsil and posterior to the right flocculus, the inferior limit of this lesion is adjacent to the right side of the medulla oblongata, in the axial view, this mass measures approximately 16 x 19 mm x 20 x 21 mm in the coronal view by 18 x 20 mm in the sagittal projection.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The pattern of enhancement in this lesion is slightly heterogeneous with areas of low signal.
There is mild deviation of the right tonsil to the left.
Therefore, this lesion possibly is extra-axial, however, there is no evidence of large dural attachment.
No diffusion abnormalities are noted.
The supratentorial structures demonstrate an area of cystic encephalomalacia posterior to the left caudate nucleus as well as multiple lacunar ischemic events involving the basal ganglia bilaterally.
No other areas with abnormal enhancement are visualized.
Significant mucosal thickening is observed on the right side of the ethmoidal air cells, with possible medial wall deformity on the right.
Lamina papyracea fluid level is identified on the left maxillary sinus, associated with significant mucosal thickening, there is also mucosal thickening on the right maxillary sinus and in the medial aspect of the frontal sinus, significant amount of secretion is identified in the nasopharynx.
Evidence of neoplastic process located on the inferior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, producing mass effect on the right cerebellar tonsil, this lesion possibly is extra-axial, however, is not completely clear given the pattern of edema and enhancement.
The differential diagnosis includes meningioma versus metastatic lesion producing significant edema seen on the right cerebellar hemisphere as described above.
There is no evidence of acute ischemic changes.
Multiple lacunar ischemic events are noted on the basal ganglia and posterior to the left caudate nucleus.
Maxillary sinusitis and ethmoidal mucosal thickening.
Small lacunar ischemic event is noted on the left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids as well as the vertebrobasilar system.
There is evidence of mild atherosclerotic changes on the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery vs mass effect.
The anterior and middle cerebral arteries appears patent without evidence of stenosis, there is no evidence of aneurysms.
IMPRESSION: Mild narrowing of the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery, likely representing atherosclerotic changes vs mass effect, there is no evidence of other areas of stenosis in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] or aneurysm formation.
FINDINGS: There is evidence of vascular flow in both common carotids, mild- to-moderate stenosis is identified at the origin of both internal carotids, correlation with ultrasound is recommended if clinically warranted, both proximal vertebral arteries are patent.
IMPRESSION: There is possible moderate stenosis at the origin of both internal carotids in the cervical bifurcations, correlation with carotid Doppler ultrasound is recommended if clinically warranted.
Field of view: 34 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 78 year old man s/p fall with cerebellar tumor REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Primary tumor?
Findings concerning for cerebellar tumor.
Within the lung in the right upper lobe, there is a 1.7 x 3.0 cm mass which extends along the bronchial tree towards the hilum.
There are also small prevascular lymph nodes which have the same appearance.
There is a small amount of pericardial fluid.
There is extensive aortic valve calcification as well as coronary artery and mitral annular calcification.
There is a right-sided chest tube in place, which terminates in the posterior region of the hemithorax.
A small hydropneumothorax remains on the right.
Several minimally displaced rib fractures on the right are also noted with subcutaneous emphysema.
There is a hypoattenuating 15 mm left adrenal lesion.
Loops of small and large bowel demonstrate no evidence of obstruction.
There is no extraluminal air.
There is no ascites.
There is heavy calcification of the abdominal aorta without aneurysmal dilation.
There is no free fluid.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
Lung mass in the right upper lobe with several other pulmonary nodules bilaterally as above.
All these findings are highly suspicious for metastatic lung cancer.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures with small right hydropneumothorax.
An MRI revealed a cerebellar mass and the patient was transferred to the NSU service.
Subsequently a CT of the torso was obtained which showed a lung mass.
This was biopsied by interventional pulmonology and the pathology was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
A cardiology consult was obtained due to his severe AS and they stated he would be very high risk for surgery with AVR.
This was discussed with the family and the decision was made to not biopsy his cerebellar mass and instead focus on his traumatic injuries.
On the evening of [**3-5**] he became hypotensive (40/P), hypothermic and mottled on maximum dose of neo.
