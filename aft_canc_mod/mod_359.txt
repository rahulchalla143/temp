Patient states that her breathing is getting worse, and that her oxygen requirement at home has increased from 2.5lpm to 3lpm.
She has also had a worsening cough productive of thick, yellow sputum.
Patient denies fevers, chest pain, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or BRBPR.
One day prior to admission patient  called into the Pulmonary clinic to report worsening eye and leg edema and was instructed to taper her prednisone over 2 weeks.
She says she now comes to the ED to seek help with shortness of breath, as well as to receive further treatment for her cancer.
Patient received Levofloxacin 750mg/Vanc 1gram for questionable pneumonia due to worsening LUL CXR findings.
Patient complains of shortness of breath but denies any pain.

Interval patchy opacities noted at the left lung apex could represent pneumonia versus progression of metastatic disease.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Mildly increased echogenicity of the liver is a nonspecific finding.
This is most likely due to fatty infiltration, although more advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded.
New ascites.
Multiple lobulated pleural-based masses on the left, which are unchanged in size and appearance compared to the prior study.
Consolidation and bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe in addition to diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, ground-glass opacities, and more focal nodules within the right lung, all of which are highly concerning for an infectious process.
However, malignancy cannot entirely be excluded and clinical correlation is recommended, as well as follow-up imaging surveillance.
The appearance includes a new right basilar consolidation with bronchiectasis, and apparently superimposed on nearly confluent pleural masses in the left hemithorax are patchy consolidations, most confluent at the left apex, with bronchiectasis, probably due to infection, or potentially radiation if such therapy has been recently performed.
No focal liver lesions or intrahepatic biliary dilatation to explain the patient's LFT abnormalities.
Marked intra-abdominal ascites.
Stable-appearing deep pleural metastases noted extending into the deep pleural surfaces on the left.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-12-5**], no major change is evident.
Heterogeneous, predominantly subcapsular delayed hepatic enhancement, most consistent with hepatitis.
There are no focal mass-like areas of enhancement to suggest metastatic disease.
There is no biliary dilatation.
Moderate ascites and enhancement along the right peritoneum.
Numerous enhancing soft tissue masses in the left pleura and peritoneum, unchanged from recent CT and increased in size from the remote prior MRI.
Moderate portal and periportal mixed inflammation including lymphocytes and neutrophils, with predominantly centrivenular and bridging necrosis and parenchymal collapse involving 20-30% of the core biopsy, confirmed by reticulin stain.
No malignancy identified in this sample.
Bile ductular proliferation with associated neutrophils.
Moderate canalicular and intracellular cholestasis with focal bile plug formation.
Trichrome stain shows no increase in fibrosis.
Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Note: The findings are consistent with an active hepatitis with parenchymal collapse, bile ductular proliferation, and cholestasis.
Brief Hospital Course: # bacteremia - BCx grew out listeria.
The patient was known to consume homemade and potentially unrefrigerated food products which could have been a potential source.
Pt presented with significant leukocytosis with WBC > 30K.
As patient is allergic to PCN, was started on IV Bactrim [**2-15**].
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis and blood cultures promptly cleared after initiation of treatment.
Patient tolerated IV bactrim poorly several days into her course, developing SOB and flushing.
She developed a mild arm/leg rash to this antibiotic, but the decision was made to treat through the possible allergy given that it was felt that this was the last good option to treat listeria.
# PNA/bronchiectasis - Completed 5 day course of levofloxacin.
# edema - Patient developed asymmetric LUE edema and BLE edema intermittently throughout hospitalization.
Preference of LUE > RUE edema likely partly due to decreased hydrostatic pressure as seen on ultrasound (dampened subclavian waveform), possibly from extrinsic compression from thyroid cyst, coupled with low oncotic pressure from depressed albumin.
Was effectively treated with lasix/aldactone to improve edema but this was limited by the patient developing hyponatremia.
The patient was discharged on a short supply of lasix/aldactone as she was c/o some edema at time of discharge.
# hyperbilirubinemia - The Liver consult service followed this patient during her time in-house, during which her workup included a liver MRI, which showed diffuse hepatitis with no nodules, a tap, which suggested hepatic ascites.
Cytology showed possible atypical cells that could have been worked up with more fluid (>1L) but there was not enough left to tap.
An IR-guided liver biopsy was performed, which demonstrated zone 3 necrosis consistent with a toxic hepatitis.
# malignant thymoma - Per Onc team, pt's current sx not directly attributable to malignancy at this time, no role for chemotherapeutic intervention.
No evidence of tumor progression on imaging.

You were also found to have jaundice and liver dysfunction when you came to the hospital.
The preliminary report from this biopsy shows no evidence of cancer.
The biopsy results suggests that the liver injury was from a toxic ingestion; we suspect an herbal medication you were taking may have caused this.
The following medications were changed during your hospitalization: ADDED benadryl and sarna lotion, medications that can help prevent itching from rash ADDED ursodiol, a medication to try to improve your liver function ADDED benzonatate to help with cough ADDED furosemide (lasix) to help with swelling ADDED spironolactone to be taken with lasix to help with swelling ADDED cepacol lozenges to help with cough ADDED docusate to help with constipation ADDED bisacodyl to help with constipation  Followup Instructions: You have an appointment scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], the liver specialist, at 8AM on [**3-13**] (this coming Friday) at the [**Hospital Unit Name **], on the [**Location (un) **].
