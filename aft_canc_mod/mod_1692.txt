Pt was recently receiving chemotherapy whose treatment was halted due to progressive fatigue/weakness.
2d prior to [**Hospital1 18**] admission she presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital for hematemesis where an EGD demonstrated the CBD stent had slipped distally into the duodenum and was causing erosion against the duodenal wall.
Past Medical History: pancreatic carcinoma, locally advanced, s/p chemo and XRT renal cell carcinoma ulcerative colitis hypercholesterolemia depression diverticulosis  Social History: no Tob or EtOH lives on [**Hospital3 635**], married, many close children  Family History: Mother died of cholangiocarcinoma at 80yo Maternal aunt died of pancreatic carcinoma at 60's yo Maternal grandfather died of pancreatic carcinoma  Physical Exam: on presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: 100.5, HR 148, BP 130/67, R 23, sat 98% on 4L NC lethargic but oriented x3 and responsive dry mucous membranes supple tachy, regular, no M/R/G CTAB soft, NT, slightly distended.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was initially admitted to the floor but subsequently had an episode of large melena associated with hypotension and non-responsiveness.
That afternoon, respiratory distress ensued with hypoxia, and the patient was intubated in the ERCP-PACU.
The abdomen was distended and tympanitic, a KUB was concerning for localized air but no free air.
Surgical consult from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Gold (hepatobiliary) service was obtained and, after extensive discussion with the family, decision was reached for exploratory laparotomy for duodenal perforatoin from wall stent erosion, which was performed on [**3-22**] with a biliary bypass, repair of duodenal perforation.
The evening of POD 1 ([**2-14**]) was notable for an acute desaturation into the 30's associated with hypotension into the 50's.
Max'd pressors with large-scale IVF resuscitation.
ABG showed worsening acidosis.
SVT into 200's ensued which converted into sinus tachycardia in 120's.
Clinical picture highly suspicious and consistent with massive pulmonary embolus, but was too unstable for radiographic confirmation.
No further events ensued that evening as pressors remained at high levels, broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued, and net positive IVF resuscitation was required.
Thrombocytopenia ensued, a HIT was negative and heparin maintained throughout.
An echocardiogram on [**2-15**] demonstrated no pericardial effusion.
With rising bilirubin, ultrasound revealed complete thrombosis of the portal vein.
On the morning on POD 9, she became hypotensive with falling hematocrit and worsening pressor and IVF requirement.
Some mucosal bleeding was noted.
