He was found to have an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with apparent involvement down to the level of the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts with possible extrinsic compression or extension into the bile ducts.
The cytology from his ERCP was positive for malignant cells.
CA19-9 was markedly elevated at 35,188.
A triphasic CT scan demonstrated a 7 mm lung nodule in the right upper lobe and ground-glass nodules left lower lobe that will require interval follow-up but do not appear to represent metastatic disease at this time.
He does have intrahepatic biliary dilatation on both the right and the left.
He underwent preoperative placement of bilateral transhepatic catheter for decompression of the bile duct and to facilitate surgical resection should that be necessary.
He is now brought to the operating room for right hepatic lobectomy, possible common bile duct excision and possible Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
