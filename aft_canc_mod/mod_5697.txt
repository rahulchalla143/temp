Admission Date:  [**2133-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-11-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-3-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**] Chief Complaint: postmenopausal vaginal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exam under anesthesia, cervical biopsy   History of Present Illness: This is a 67 yo G4P3104 who presents from the [**Location (un) 620**] ED with heavy vaginal bleeding.
The patient reports no abdominal or pelvic pain.
She denies dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope or presyncope, CP, SOB, n/v/d, fevers or chills.
She does endorse a recent weight loss of 20 pounds since [**Month (only) 404**] without trying to lose weight or changing her dietary habits (reports attributing this to a "very active job," but also notes she has been doing it for 10 years).
She reports going through menopause at age 55, and having no bleeding until labor day weekend, when she had one day of bleeding saturating one pad, which then spontaneously resolved.
Past Medical History: GynHx: patient does not remember if she has ever had a Pap, but does not remember ever having an abnormal Pap.
ObHx: SVD x3, C/S via vertical midline at 7 months GA for placenta previa.
PMH: none (report no history of mammogram, colonoscopy ever, no Pap within recent memory, possibly during reproductive years) .
active bright red bleeding from the os.
Cervix appears grossly abnormal, papillary and caulliflower-like, without easily discernable edges, os able to be identified as source of bleeding.
Adnexa without palpable mass appreciated.
Findings concerning for cervical carcinoma.
Please note that the mass is not separable from the rectum and the sigmoid colon and direct extension into these structures is of concern.
No evidence for metastatic disease in the pelvis.
The mass causes cervical stenosis with fluid accumulating in the uterine cavity.
Incidental note is made of a uterine fibroid and a left renal cyst.
[**11-19**]: MRI pelvis Large cervical tumor with superior vaginal and parametrial extension, at least MRI stage FIGO IIb.
A 8.5 x 5.5 cm FDG-avid cervical mass extending into endometrial cavity and closely abutting vesicular and recto-sigmoid wall.
There is no FDG-avid pelvic, inguinal, mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of distant disease involvement.
Multiple non-FDG avid hypodense hepatic lesions, as described above, likely hepatic cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 94806**] initially presented to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED secondary very heavy postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.
At [**Location (un) 620**], she had a CBC drawn which was significant for HCT of 30 and heavy/persistent bleeding on exam.
On arrival, she was initially mildly tachycardic which resolved.
On exam, she was noted to have a markedly abnormal appearing cervix with what felt to be a 8cm mass.
She had bleeding from the cervix thus the vagina was packed.
She was transferred to the ICU given ongoing bleeding and potential for hemodynamic instability.
She was monitored closely over night and transferred to the floor the following day as her bleeding significantly improved.
On HD 2 she had a CT scan and MRI of her abdomen/ pelvis which confirmed a large cervical mass with extension into the parametria but without clear invasion of bladder or rectum.
She was taken to the operating room for an exam under anesthesia and biopsy of the cervical mass.
This returned as c/w squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.
She had a PET scan w/out evidence of metastasis.
