Cardiac issues:  After patient was transferred to the MICU for rapid AFib that could not be controlled, the patient had several complications from his AFib including a MCA CVA as well as a splenic infarct.
Patient had a known LV thrombus for which he was being anticoagulated prior to this admission, but in the setting of chemotherapy as well as nosebleeds, the patient had not been anticoagulated.
While on Heparin, patient had at least one episode of hemoptysis of bright red blood, but remained hemodynamically stable and without evidence of more bleeding.
Patient also had not been receiving his outpatient dose Lasix and after receiving fluids for several weeks, was in slightly worsening failure and prior to discharge was diuresed Lasix, to which he responded well and with improvement in his O2 saturations.
Infectious disease issues:  Patient on transfer to the unit remained on double antibiotic coverage with Levaquin and ceftriaxone as well as double fungal coverage with AmBisome and caspofungin.
His respiratory status improved to the point, where he required no oxygen and in consultation with the Infectious Disease service, who closely followed the patient, patient was eventually tapered to only Voriconazole and Levaquin, and by the time of discharge, patient was only on Voriconazole and will continue this on discharge until followup with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 3115**] of Infectious Disease service.
Patient remained afebrile during this time.
The VATS also did not show evidence of infection and only showed an organizing pneumonitis.
They were continued, and the patient will likely undergo at least one month total of Voriconazole treatment and more if he becomes neutropenic.
Splenic infarct:  Patient had pain from his infarct and initially was on Dilaudid PCA.
Neurologic:  Patient had occasional changes in mental status while in the hospital that were mostly attributed to problems stemming from his CVA as well as a possible hospital-acquired delirium and ICU delirium.
Renal:  The patient had an insult to his kidneys during this hospital course thought to be from contrast dye as well as multiple antibiotics.
At this time the patient is not having any complications from his renal insufficiency, but this will need to be followed while the patient is an outpatient.
Lymphoma:  Patient did not receive further hyper-CVAD while in the hospital due to instability.
The patient is afebrile without worsening lymphadenopathy, and his blood count appeared to be relatively stable.
Patient has required occasional blood transfusions to keep his hematocrit above 30 secondary to his coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Splenic infarct.
OxyContin 10 mg q.d., hold if patient not having further abdominal pain.
