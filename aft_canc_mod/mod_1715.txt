No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Relatively well-inflated lungs with no evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no evidence of vertebral compression fracture.
MICROBIOLOGY: UCx ([**2187-8-31**] + [**2187-9-2**]) negative Fecal CX ([**2187-8-31**]) negative for salmonella, shigella and campylobacter BCx ([**2187-8-30**] + [**2187-9-2**]) NGTD .
PATHOLOGY: Biopsy from flex sig ([**2187-9-3**]): pending  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 52 yo with long stand hx of crohn's s/p total colectomy and splenectomy who presents with hypotension and Acute on chronic renal failure, thought to be [**3-7**] to hypovolemia from diarrhea.
GI was consulted and flex sig was done, which showed changes c/w crohns flare.
# Hypotension: likely due to hypovolemia, possible infection although not convinced pt has pna.
Elevated WBC which can also happen on crohns flare.
He denies having fever, and has non-productive cough which he states is chronic and relates to smoking.
Infectious work up was negative (UCx negative, BCx NGTD by time of discharge), fecal Cx negative for salmonella, shigella and campylobacter.
# Crohns flare: Pt presented with increased diarrhea and pain, consistent with his prior presentation.
He had diarrhea up to [**11-22**] small BM/day (baseline [**8-10**] BM/day) and pain is unchanged from prior flares.
No blood in stool.
No apparent perianal fistula.
GI was consulted and flex sig was done, showing changes c/w crohn's flare.
Per GI recommendation, patient was started on mesalamine suppository and enema, as he had failed or was intolerant of multiple other regimen in the past.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt's creatine had an increase in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year at [**2187**] which increased to to 1.7.
This was thought to be [**3-7**] hypovolemia and continuation of his HCTZ and ACE-I in setting of increased diarrhea.
# hyponatremia: likely due to hypovolemia and increase in free water intake in the setting of diarrhea.
# Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia: Possibly due to worsening in renal function.
Patient's hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia resolved with volume resuscitation.
# HTN: His lisinopril and HCTZ were held during this hospitalization given his hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] from hypovolemia upon admission.
He developed couple of episodes of hypoxia with diffuse wheezing, requiring albuterol neb and supplemental O2 (2-4L by NC) for a day.
Ipratropium was ordered to see if its additive effect with albuterol would be beneficial for the patient, however, patient's respiratory status improved and he did not require any more prn nebulizer treatments.
Anemia w/u was sent due to concern for poor absorption given his Crohn's disease, however the result was more consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Reactive arthritis: on vicodin at home.
Disp:*30 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0* 9. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze.
