She underwent excisional biopsy of a 2.1-mm thick melanoma from her right ankle in the spring of [**2105**].
She underwent wide local excision, skin flap and right inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy without residual melanoma at the primary site.
Two sentinel lymph nodes showed evidence of microscopic involvement with melanoma.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a right superficial inguinal femoral lymphadenectomy with right sartorius rotation flap on [**2106-7-16**] with pathology showing microscopic melanoma in [**12-22**] residual lymph nodes.
She began adjuvant interferon in [**2106-10-12**], undergoing 2 dose reductions due to peripheral neuropathy and persistent back pain.
She underwent skin biopsy of a left posterior thigh lesion in [**2107-1-12**] revealing a 0.62-mm thick superficial spreading melanoma, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV without ulceration for which she underwent re-excision on [**2107-2-2**] without residual melanoma noted.
She developed worsening right lower extremity edema in late [**2109-10-12**] with abdominal pelvic CT revealing retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with significant other, smokes, currently on disability, no EtOH.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing female in no acute distress.
Abdomen: Palpable lower abdominal masses.
Extremities:  3+ right lower extremity edema.
During this week she received [**11-24**] doses with 2 doses held related to shortness of breath on treatment day #5.
She stabilized on treatment day #6 but that evening developed increasing shortness of breath associated with hypoxia requiring 100% non-rebreather with O2 sats in the mid 90s consistent with acute pulmonary edema.
Other side effects during IL-2 therapy included rigors improved with Demerol; development of an erythematous pruritic skin rash; mild nausea improved with antiemetic therapy; and diarrhea improved with Lomotil therapy.
During this week she had no acute renal failure noted.
She developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 87 and peak AST of 99, both improved at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with peak bilirubin of 4 improved to 1 at the time of discharge.
She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of 11,000, improved to 111,000 at the time of discharge.
She had no coagulopathy or myocarditis noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1 week on high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by acute pulmonary edema.
