Story starts in late [**Month (only) 216**], when she began devloping cough and dysphagia for solids associated with intermittent sharp pains radiating to the back as well as belching; she also notes having anorexia.
The cough was worked-up by her PCP with concerns for a pulmonary infectious process; she underwent a course of levofloxacin, a CXR, cardiac ECHO, and CT-Chest on [**10-7**] which showed, among other findings, extensive mediastinal LAD and ground glass opacities.
Through this interval, her symptoms have worsened and as a result of her dysphagia and anorexia she has had an involuntary 20lbs weight loss.
Previous EGDs: [**2103-8-3**] Large hiatal hernia Polyps in the fundus Small nodular raised lesion with possible erosion on top, no stigmata or visible vessel noted in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Multiple gastric polyps seen in the fundus and body A small nodular submucosal lesion was seen in the duodenal bulb with a small central raised area.
A 0.6cm X 0.4cm sub-mucosal lesion was seen in the duodenal bulb, originating from the muscular layer.
Differential diagnosis includes GIST, Leiomyoma, Sarcoma .
[**2104-10-16**] Tubular sub-epithelial mass / buldge in the upper third of the esophagus.
Food impaction in the mid and lower esophagus - this was pushed into stomach.
Assessment of esophageal wall could not be made due to debris coating esophageal wall.
(foreign body removal) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
[**2104-10-16**] Food in the lower third of the esophagus Mass in the middle third of the esophagus The food bolus was unable to be removed due to patient poor tolerance of procedure with desaturation of O2.
Widespread new compared to prior radiograph areas of peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities.
Differential diagnosis would include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, vasculitis, infection (less likely).
Given the lack of those abnormalities on the recent chest radiograph, neoplasm is unlikely.
Huge hiatal hernia containing most of the stomach.
Most likely loculated peritoneal effusion at the level of the hiatus as described.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy including right upper paratracheal area, most likely reactive to the parenchymal process.
Evidence of air trapping especially on the left that might be related to narrowing of the left main bronchus by the large hernia.
Tracheomalacia is also suspected.
Bilateral pleural effusions, most likely secondary to the parenchymal process.
Small liver hypodense lesion, most likely cysts.

Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.

Extensive esophageal mass abutting the pulmonary artery, left atrium and aortic arch with circumferential thickening of the esophagus and proximal air-fluid levels.
Left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Right lower lobe pulmonary embolus 5.
Metastatic retroperitoneal adenopathy.
7. extensive subcutaneous edema and gas formation within the anterior abdominal wall on left side in the region of the J-tube (series 301B image 59) concerning for gas-forming infection vs tube leakage.
[**11-18**] abdominal tissue bx Left abdominal wall: Skin and subcutaneous tissue with focal fat necrosis and acute and chronic inflammation.
[**11-23**] Head CT No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Partial opacification of the mastoid air cells, which is new since the prior study and may be related to recent intubation.
MR can be considered for better assessment of parenchymal abnormalities related to metastases/infarction, if not CI.

# Respiratory distress - Etiology includes post-procedural laryngospam vs. paradoxical contraction of vocal cords vs. mass compression by the esophageal mass.
rhonchi which could indicate extrinsic compression by the esophageal mass on her airways.
Had been on bipap intermittently alternating with Heliox, however needed to be intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory distress and the need for a CT scan to assess for necrotizing faciitis (was unable to lay down due to her resp.
An element of agitation/anxiety /delirium intermittently contributed to her respiratory distress, and was treated with benzo's PRN initally which was later transitioned to standing Haldol.
Trach was discussed with the family, though not pursued, especially given grave prognosis with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
She was not able to be weaned from the vent, likely related to her esophageal mass and ?
# Necrotizing Fasciitis: Pt had necrotizing faciitis at J-tube site that needed surgical debridement.
A wound vac was placed.
Probable causes include ICU delirium and anxiety related to her diagnosis.
Following transfer from SICU, unclear what her neurological status was, though neuro workup was not pursued given extremely poor prognosis and no predicted change in management based on outcome.
Large component of altered mental status likely delirium (patient not reliably following commands or responsive even when off sedation).
#Hypotension: Pt febrile with elevated WBC in setting of hypotension to systolic 80s.
Fistulogram showed patent J-tube track.
Treated for cellulitis with daptomycin, tigecycline, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin initially, then finished course of tigecycline for necrotizing fasciitis.
Patient remained on maximal levophed throughout her ICU stay and through the end of her life, though no other pressors were started/no escalation of care after discussion w/ family.
Of note, patient also had CVL infection with bacteremia (MRSA) on [**12-10**], but not treated given no escalation of care per goals of care discussion at that point.
#Esophageal Adeniocarcinoma: Known esophageal/tracheal mass s/p EGD and bronch with Bx respectively.
Biopsies have come back as adenocarcinoma, however stains are not fitting consistent picture for clear diagnosis.
Underwent a CT torso for the question of necrotizing faciitis but also staged her neoplasm as well.
# Pulmonary embolism: Patient noted to have PE during course, she was initially on anticoagulation, but was stopped given BRBPR.
