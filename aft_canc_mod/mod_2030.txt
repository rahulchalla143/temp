INDICATION: S/P allo BMT with fever, hypotension and diarrhea.
The lungs demonstrate no areas of focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no mass or vegetation detected on the tricuspid valve.
There is no abscess of the tricuspid valve.
Mild tricuspid [1+] regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.
No  vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
PERICARDIUM: There is a small pericardial effusion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no abscess of the tricuspid valve.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess identified (if clincally indicated transesophageal echocardiography is a more sensitive test for endocarditis   Brief Hospital Course: # ID: The patient came in with hypotension was found to have klebsiella sepsis.
His Hickman was removed and he underwent an echo to look for an endocardial source of his sepsis.
The TTE was negative for endocarditis.
# Rhythm: The patient developed Mobitz type I block during this admission.
There was also concern for endocarditis and abscess as a cause.
TTE showed no veg and no TEE was done since he was neutropenic.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that there was no need for a pacer.
