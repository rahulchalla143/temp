Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially admitted with a transaminitis with very elevated alkaline phosphatase.
Abdominal CT did not show any evidence of ductal dilatation.
It was initially thought that his transaminitis was most likely due to infiltration of his lymphoma in the patient's liver.
The patient's stool studies were checked for C. difficile and ova and parasites.
He was also started on Flagyl and Levaquin for empiric coverage of any possible abdominal infection.
It was also thought that possibly the patient's increased transaminitis could be secondary to a reinfection with CMV.
The patient's liver function tests remained elevated until the patient received his first pentostatin dose on [**2188-9-10**].
It is now thought that his transaminitis was most likely due to infiltration of lymphoma in his liver and may have been improved with therapy with pentostatin.
The patient currently has no real complaints of abdominal pain and his diarrhea has resolved.
The patient also had new splenic masses on CT initially.
This was also thought to have been due to infiltration of his lymphoma.
Pulmonary:  Upon admission the patient had complaints of a chronic cough productive with yellow sputum, shortness of breath, and increased oxygen requirement.
The chest CT performed on admission showed scattered small nodules throughout.
It was unclear whether this may be due to his lymphoma or a new infection.
The patient's Bactrim dose was temporarily held secondary to his decreased counts, but was restarted the next day after admission for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
The pulmonary team was consulted to perform a bronchoscopy if indicated to rule out whether the patient's pulmonary status was most likely due to lymphoma or whether his pulmonary issues could be secondary to an opportunistic infection.
Overnight on [**2188-9-10**] the patient had desaturated to the 80s and had an increased oxygen requirement from 1.5 liters of oxygen to 2-3 liters.
On [**2188-9-12**] bronchoscopy was completed which showed inflamed airways with thin white/clear secretions throughout.
Specimens were sent for micro and cytology.
However, post procedure, the patient had decreased saturation, hypoventilating, and was dyspneic with diffuse rhonchi.
He received albuterol nebulizers and was suctioned nasally, with only partial improvement in his respiratory status.
On [**2188-9-16**] the patient's bronchoalveolar lavage results returned showing positive Aspergillus infection in his respiratory and fungal cultures.
The patient has been doing well with his AmBisome therapy.
He continues to have a productive cough with yellow sputum.
Recurrent DIC:  The patient had a significantly decreased fibrinogen and platelet count on admission.
Infectious disease:  Infectious disease was consulted with regard to whether the patient may have a reinfection with CMV.
They suggested performing liver and colon biopsies to truly rule out whether this is a recurrence of the CMV and also suggested starting valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis.
An ophthalmologist was consulted to perform a CMV retinal examination to rule out CMV retinitis and this was negative for CMV retinitis.
There are no other therapies for CMV that would be less nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic than valganciclovir.
In addition, the patient should be continued on Levaquin for a 14-day course for proper antibiotic coverage for his pulmonary infection.
The patient should also be continued on AmBisome 5 mg per kg per day for treatment of his Aspergillus infection.
History of coronary artery disease:  The patient had new Q waves on EKG suggestive of a new infarct, and was cycles for cardiac enzymes x 3.
An echocardiogram was performed that showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% but evidence of mild diastolic dysfunction.
The patient remained asymptomatic and free of chest pain throughout his hospital course.
He remained in sinus rhythm even though he had this history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
When the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, the thought was that maybe the patient had suffered a mild cardiac event as well, and he was watched closely on telemetry and was put on a low-dose beta blocker as well as diuresed with Lasix to help with his diastolic dysfunction.
The patient improved with the Lasix but the metoprolol was subsequently discontinued secondary to his poor pulmonary status.
His cardiac issues have remained stable and it is questionable whether the patient did have a new infarct upon admission, however this has not changed through his hospital course.
The patient had also complained of  dysphagia in the first week of his hospital stay and with an oropharyngeal examination that was not very highly suggestive of thrush, but with patient's complaints of dysphagia, the patient was started on IV Diflucan.
He seemed to improve with this since he had less complaints of painful swallowing.
The patient now has improved swallowing so it might be possible that the patient had some level of thrush in his esophagus.
Immunoblastic lymphoma disease.
History of CMV viremia.
Aspergillus infection.
Coronary artery disease.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
