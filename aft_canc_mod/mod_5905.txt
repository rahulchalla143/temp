Admission Date:  [**2131-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-3-31**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for a cardiac catheterization.
The patient initially complained of acute onset of substernal chest pain associated with shortness of breath while in the shower on the morning of admission.
Her initial EKG showed ST elevations in V4 and the lateral leads.
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated 10% occlusion of the right coronary artery, 20% occlusion of proximal LAD, 60% occlusion of mid LAD with possible dissection and residual unstable plaque, and a small fistula between the left circumflex and left atrium.
A cipher stent was placed in the mid LAD without residual stenosis.
An echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25-30%, moderately dilated left atrium, severe mitral annular calcification with 1+ MR, 1+ TR, left ventricular hypertrophy to akinesis with some basal preservation of function, trace AR, and small pericardial effusion.
Her last bone marrow biopsy in [**2130-6-27**] showed 13% plasma cells.
Diabetic gastroparesis.
General:  The patient was an elderly female in no acute distress.
Crackles inferiorly.
There was a I/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities:  Warm, dry, no edema.
There was 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.
No groin hematoma.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The EKG pre catheterization revealed normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads I and aVL, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression inferiorly with poor R wave progression.
Post catheterization EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 86, left axis deviation, QRS at 126, left anterior fascicular block, T wave inversion in V1 through V5, II, and aVL, resolution of ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and multiple myeloma who presents with an acute MI, who was found to have a low ejection fraction.
The patient had a cholesterol panel, triglyceride elevated at 160, HDL 41, LDL 57, and cholesterol of 130.
In addition, the patient had baseline LFTs prior to starting statin that showed an ALT of 32, AST 53 (likely elevated from cardiac injury), alkaline phosphatase 103, and total bilirubin 0.6, within normal limits except for the elevated AST.
Although she had a low EF and global hypokinesis, she was not anticoagulated because she has low platelets at baseline.
In the setting of multiple myeloma, the diagnosis of cardiac amyloid was entertained, however, multiple myeloma is extremely indolent according to her oncologist, unlikely to be associated with amyloid.
In addition, her echocardiogram did not show evidence of amyloid infiltrate.
She was not anticoagulated for this low EF secondary to her thrombocytopenia.
DIABETES:  The patient was maintained on Reglan for gastroparesis and insulin.
Prior to discharge, she was restarted on her Avandia and her normal dose of NPH and regular insulin.
INCREASED CREATININE ON ADMISSION:  The patient received Mucomyst and post catheterization hydration for renal protection.
She was slightly volume overloaded on examination and, therefore, was diuresed.
The etiology for the increased creatinine is most likely mild CHF and not related to the ACE inhibitor.
Acute myocardial infarction.
Systolic heart failure.
Renal insufficiency.
