She states he is alert and oriented at baseline but over the past 5-7 days has had poor oral intake and has been less verbal than usual.

Initial presentation sinus congestion --> found to have rapidly growing mass in left paranasal sinus --> ENT endoscopic biopsy [**10/2120**] --> plasmocytoma --> BMBx [**11/2120**] --> myeloma.
No lytic lesions on skeletal survey.
Hypertension 4.
Essential tremor 6.
Hypothyroidism: History of Grave's disease.
Was rx'd with radioactive iodine.
Hyperparathyroidism: Borderline hypercalcemia.
Increased parathyroid uptake c/w adenoma seen on parathyroid scan in 3/[**2116**].

Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions, with bibasilar airspace opacifications, likely atelectasis; however, superinfection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
Suggestion of wall thickening at the rectum and sigmoid, with no significant fat stranding, this finding could suggest colitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
Bilateral inguinal hernia, with fluid on the right.
-[**2121-9-16**] EEG: These findings suggest a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
No hydronephrosis of left or right kidney.
A few small cysts are seen in both kidneys.
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the upper abdomen.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and cerebral atrophy.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Left cerebellopontine angle isointense lesion measuring less than 1 cm, may represent extension of the left cerebellar flocculus or soft tissue lesion.
[**2121-9-16**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small posterior pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, worse than before with associated compressive atelectasis, diffuse soft tissue anasarca, and trace perihepatic free fluid, may reflect third spacing.
Multiple bilateral renal cysts, largest in the superior pole of the right kidney, incompletely characterized in the non-contrast setting.
T11 and T8 compression fractures may relate to underlying multiple myeloma, unchanged since the recent prior.
Brief Hospital Course: This was a 75-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented with altered mental status and subsequently developed A. fib w/ RVR, ARF, thrombocytopenia, anemia, C.diff, and MRSA in his sputum.
He passed away on [**10-12**] due to complications from these multiple medical conditions.
#CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  Unclear etiology for altered mental status but possibilities include infection or neurologic catastrophe such as hypoxic brain injury or multiple old strokes.
MRI, LP, and EEG were all negative for causative pathology.
Neurology was consulted and had no additional work-up or treatment to recommend.
The patient was started on carbidopa/levidopa for ridigity and presumed Parkinson's.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR: The patient developed A. fib with RVR and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initation of rate control.
He was stabilized and extubated without complication.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and echo showed mildly enlarged left atrium with hyperdynamic LV function.
Likely secondary to ATN from hypervolemia or worsening multiple myeloma.
His renal function improved with multiple myeloma treatment.
The patient has a baseline Cr 0.9-1.1.
Renal was following the patient during this admission and had no further recommendations.
Bactrim was discontinued to account for false elevation of creatinine.
#ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Thought to be due to multiple myeloma and other chronic disease states.
His Creatinine, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and other markers of multiple myeloma all improved after treatment.
He also developed C. diff after being treated for a UTI.
On [**10-8**] a CT of his torso demonstrated evidence of pneumonia.
#SECRETIONS:  Toward the end of his life, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] had difficulty clearing his secretions; most likely due to weak musculature, poor cough effort, and central nervous system issues.
His family was informed of his dire prognosis, and the decision was made to make patient DNR/DNI and not to pursue further cancer treatment.
