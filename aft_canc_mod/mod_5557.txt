Severe multilevel degenerative disc disease is evident, most notably at L3-L4 and L5-S1.
Extensive facet arthropathy is noted at the lumbosacral junction.
No suspicious osteolytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Incidental note is made of an indwelling left-sided nephrostomy.
IMPRESSION: Extensive multilevel degenerative disease with no suspicious osseous lesions evident.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the veins interrogated above.
Mild degenerative changes are noted at the knee.
There is diffuse soft tissue swelling throughout the lower extremity particularly at the ankle and anterior to the proximal tibia.
Extensive vascular calcification is incidentally noted.
IMPRESSION: No underlying fracture.
Mild degenerative change in the knee.

.. .. MRI hips: FINDINGS: The ilia are not completely imaged in coronal STIR or axial sequences.
There is abnormal bone marrow signal within the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], extending to the articular surface at the left sacroiliac joint and to the medial acetabular wall and roof.
The marrow signal within the sacrum is within normal limits, so is in the right ilium except for a small focus of T1 low signal and T2 high signal in the medial acetabulum, which likely represents a subchondral cyst.
The heterogeneous marrow signal within the proximal femoral shafts likely represents hematopoietic marrow.
The bone marrow signal within the visualized vertebrae is unremarkable except for mild endplate changes.
There is increased T2 signal within the adductor and obturator internus muscles, left greater than right, and within left gluteus medius and minimus muscles.
The urinary bladder is contracted, and shows nodular thickening, which is concordant with the patient's history of bladder carcinoma.
There is also dilatation of the visualized distal ureters bilaterally.
There are multiple shotty and mildly enlarged perirectal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 11 mm in the right iliac chain.
Abnormal left ilium, which likely represents a non-displaced fracture; however, metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
We will be happy to complete the MRI of the pelvis at no additional charge; however, followup CT would be better to assess for fracture.
Findings in the bladder are concordant with the patient's history of bladder carcinoma.
There is distal bilateral hydroureters.
Multiple shotty and mildly enlarged lymph nodes, the largest measuring 11 mm in the right iliac region.
[**Numeric Identifier 94656**]  BLADDER TUMOR (1).
[**Numeric Identifier 94657**]  LT/RT DISTAL URETER (and more) DIAGNOSIS: Left iliac bone lesion: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-1-15**] 5:33 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Assess for CVA/bleed  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with h/o Afib and metastastic bladder CA, p/w lethargy and acute change MS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Assess for CVA/bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: A 75-year-old man with history of atrial fibrillation, metastatic bladder carcinoma, presenting with lethargy and acute mental status change.
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
Minimal mucosal thickening is noted in the right maxillary sinus.
The ventricles, sulci and extra-axial spaces are prominent, consistent with age-related involutional change.
There are periventricular white matter hypodensities, mild, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No CT evidence of major vascular territorial infarction, but MRI remains most sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
PORT  Reason: re-evaluate for hydronephrosis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with acute on chronic renal failure and nephrostomy tube in place REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: re-evaluate for hydronephrosis INDICATION: Acute and chronic renal failure, nephrostomy tube in place.
There is no hydronephrosis.
The right kidney is not well identified due to habitus and inability to position.
[**2163-1-17**] ECHO:The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral wall.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-1-14**], mild mitral regurgitation is not seen on the current study.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo man h/o bladder CA (s/p multiple TURBTs & s/p urostomy tube), CAD s/p CABG, OA presents with severe pain of left buttock, radiation into hamstring found to have metastatic bladder cancer in the bone, lung, and liver.
Patient had a complicated medical admission resulting in transfer to the medical ICU after mental status change post IR guided bone biopsy.
After progressive deterioration including multi-system organ failure requiring triple pressor therapy, mechanical ventilation, and CVVHD, goals of care were changed to comfort measures only and the patient quickly died minutes after removal of care from respiratory failure.
Initial concern for septic shock v. possible cardiogenic.
ECHO shows LVEF>35% Concern for urosepsis vs question new aspiration pna (may have aspirated while intubated for IR procedure).
Empiric treatment for aspiration pneumonia and candiduria initiated.
Repeat RUQ US was negative for cholelithiasis.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient requiring intubation in setting of altered mental status and hypotension for adequate airway management and management of acidosis.
Patient not hyperventilating to compensate for metabolic acidosis appropriately.
Patient verified that he wanted to be intubated on [**1-21**] via interpretor, given multi-system organ failure and multiple pressor requirement, will keep intubated and sedated.
CT of the head is without acute hemorrhage or stroke (although MR is more sensitive).
Differential included narcotics vs. sepsis vs. hypercarbia v hyperkalemia.
# Candiduria: persistent yeast in urine, with no other culture data to support infectious etiology of hypotension.
# Elevated LFTs/RUQ pain: Shock liver vs. metastatic disease in liver.
#Acute on CKD: likely prerenal due to hypotension; concern for ATN s/p multiple insults.
No muddy brown casts seen in sediment on initial examination.
Renal US on [**1-7**] did not show any evidence of hydro.
# Bladder Cancer s/p multiple TURBT w/ urostomy tube: #1, pathologic fracture, metastasis as above.
fracture of left ilium, concern for pathologic fracture.
Patient denied trauma before admit.
CT scan performed [**1-7**] for better definition of lesion, concern for pathologic fracture.
[**Date range (1) 68760**] patient non weight bearing, pain management, see by orthopoedics but ortho/onc, rad/onc unavailable.
Pt underwent CT guided biopsy of the bone lesion on [**1-14**] which showed metastatic bladder cancer.
In staging, bone scan had no further lesions, CT torso showed lesions in liver and nodules in lung.
Urine culture returned klebsiella and enterococcus (though only low grade).
Antihypertensives held in setting of hypotension.
#HTN - Held meds in setting of hypotension.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient not anti-coagulated because of severe hematuria in the past.
