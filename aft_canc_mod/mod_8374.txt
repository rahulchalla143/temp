History of Present Illness: This is an 80 year old male with a past medical history of colitis and diverticulosis with history of bleeds, who was recently admitted at [**Location (un) 620**] with a diverticular bleed (discharged day before admission here), represented to the OSH today with sudden onset dyspnea and acute on chronic epigastric discomfort and was found to have ST changes consistent with acute MI (not stemi criteria).
EKG with old RBBB, but clear new lateral ST depressions and ST elevation in III.
He was guaiac negative, but given his recent history of LGIB and relative hypotension, he was unable to be anticoagulated or beta blocked.
Given his recent LGIB and initial hypotension, however, he is admitted to the MICU for further management and monitoring.
On ROS, the patient says that he feels much better and denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
He denies dizziness, abdominal pain or palpitations.
Past Medical History: Diverticulosis s/p recent bleed (treated at [**Location (un) 620**]), and a prior bleed in [**2188**] Ulcerative colitis Hypertension Dementia Osteoarthritis Status post hip replacement in [**2188-2-20**] Anxiety   Social History: Lives at home alone.
However, he is somewhat forgetful.
CV: Distant heart sounds: RRR, no m/r/g appreciated.
JVP appears mildly elevated, unchaged at 8-10cm.

He was managed medically because of the recent bleeding with aspirin, low dose beta blocker, low dose ace inhibitor and simvastatin.
Echo demonstrated EF of 25-30% with severe global LV hypokinesis.
He developed volume overload from blood transfusions and volume resuscitation for his hypotension at admission and was gently diuresed.
# LGIB: Presented to outside hospital with bright red blood per rectum.
Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis and incidental tiny polyp, otherwise, it was normal with no evidence of active colitis or bleeding.
He then underwent an EGD which revealed Barrett's esophagus, but no evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
Upon this presentation, with a HCT of 27 and active cardiac ischemia he was transfused 2 units of blood and subsequetly maintained stable blood counts.
# HTN - Systolic blood pressure after the MI ranged 90-110s.
# Fluid overload/ Hyponatremia - Pulmonary edema present on admission improved with gentle diuresis (Lasix 10mg IV bolus prn).
Appeared vol overloaded on exam based on peripheral edema, elevated JVP, and cephalization/ small pleural effusions from CXR on [**5-27**].
Received 10mg IV lasix but diuresis persistently difficult to quantify given urine spills and incontinence.
Urine electrolytes showed he is salt avid (FeNa = 0.1%); likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from CHF and possibly SIADH from stress of hospitalization.
Appeared euvolemic despite persistent LE edema on day of discharge.
# Upper respiratory infection: Cough accompanied by [**Last Name (un) 1993**] production and upper respiratory congestion.
Pt remained afebile without an oxygen requirement throughout stay.
# Depression - continued celexa  #CODE: FULL   Medications on Admission: Celexa 40 mg daily Asacol 400 mg two tablets three times a day lisinopril 20 mg daily hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily (stopped on [**2190-5-21**]) Prilosec 20 mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
