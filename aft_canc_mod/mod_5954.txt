Admission Date:  [**2175-12-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-7-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis, ?pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid Bronchoscopy Attempted bronchial artery embolization Stereotactic Brain Biopsy  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 66 yo male with h/o htn, glucose intolerance, recent dx of NSCLC who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for rigid bronchoscopy and possible embolization for hemoptysis.
He started noticing streaks of blood in his sputum which progressed to about nickel-sized bits of blood.
He was then referred for a CAT scan of his chest which revealed a large right upper lobe spiculated mass suspicious for malignancy.
Subsequent bronch on [**2175-12-15**] at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed path consistent with NSCLC.
He decided to drive himself to the [**Hospital3 **] ED, where he presented in respiratory distress and was promptly intubated for airway protection.
He became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and sedation, and was started on Neosynephrine.
He was awaiting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], and had imaging that showed the mass and a RLL consolidation.
He spiked a fever on [**2175-12-21**], and was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
There was a question of adrenal insufficiency, and he was on decadron.
Review of Systems: Significant weight loss per records.
He has no history of asbestos exposure.
He has a sister who is 66 years old and has ovarian cancer and he has another brother who is living and otherwise healthy.
Neck- supple, no LAD appreciated.
Cor- Regular, brady, no murmur appreciated Chest- Decreased BS right base, ronchi left side, no wheeze Abd- Obese, midline surgical scar well-healed, decreased bowel sounds Ext- mild clubbing, trace edema bilaterally Neuro- sedated, spontaneously moving all extremities, not responding to commands Skin- No rashes  Pertinent Results: RADIOLOGY: CT Chest ([**12-23**]): FINDINGS: The right upper lobe mass has grown from 2.8 x 4.2 cm to 4.3 x 5.7 cm, 2:14, with progressive invasion of mediastinal fat, up to the trachea, esophagus, and normal calibre, superior vena cava, and new occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus, 2:18, 22.
The right upper lobe pulmonary artery is more severely encased by the tumor and significantly narrowed but not occluded.
New right upper lobe posterior segment consolidation and extensive ground glass involving most of the anterior segment of right upper lobe might represent post-obstruction pneumonia.
Lingular atelectasis has significantly progressed, although no endobronchial lesion is demonstrated, 3:33.
New bilateral moderate nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusion is accompanied by considerable bilateral relaxation atelectasis.
Heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Significant interval progression of the right upper lobe tumor size, mediastinal, occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus obstruction and most likely obstructive pneumonia, conceivably hemorrhage.
New moderate, bibasilar pleural effusion and severe relaxation atelectasis.
This area did not demonstrate FDG avidity on the recent PET CT. On the current study, although it is difficult to fully evaluate, there may be an 8-mm ring-enhancing nodule in the central portion of this larger lesion.
No other areas concerning for enhancing lesions are identified within the brain.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is no definite mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
The major vascular structures appear unremarkable.
Note is made of calcifications within the cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally.
No osseous lesions are identified.
0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with some perilesional edema, mild mass effect on the adjacent portion of the fourth ventricle, representing metastatic focus.
Increased signal in the internal auditory canals especially the left internal auditory canal on the post-contrast sequence (series 9, image 8) may partly be related to enhancement.
Significant amount of fluid versus mucosal thickening involving bilateral mastoid air cells.
Bronchial Artery Embolization ([**12-25**]): IMPRESSION: Thoracic aortogram demonstrates a diffusely enlarged and tortuous aorta.
A selective right bronchial-intercostal arteriogram showed no abnormal blush or extravasation.
Several attempts were made to advance a microcatheter into this artery, but were unsuccessful  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] was a 66-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of NSCLC with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, who presented with hemoptysis and respiratory failure, underwent bronchoscopy with cauterization, was successfully extubated, and underwent unsuccessful attempt at bronchial artery embolization [**2175-12-25**] due to tortuous aorta.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient was previously intubated for airwary protection at OSH in setting of hemoptysis assumed to be from his known large lung mass.
[**Last Name (un) **] showed significant amounts of clot in R bronchial tree, and he underwent removal of some clots and cauterization of bleeding areas.
He was found to have a RUL PNA on CT scan [**12-23**], which was thought to be post-obstructive, and he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn).
He continued to have quarter size amount of hemoptysis with subjective SOB requiring a NRB.
On [**12-25**], IR tried bronchial artery embolization which was unsuccessful secondary to his tortuous aorta.
# NSCLC/Hemoptysis: CT Chest showed that the right upper lobe mass has grown from 2.8 x 4.2 cm on [**2175-11-1**] to 4.3 x 5.7.
Rigid [**Last Name (un) 1066**] showed significant amounts of clot in R bronchial tree, and he underwent removal of some clots and cauterization of bleeding areas.
IR attempted bronchial artery embolization which was unsuccessful secondary to his tortuous aorta.
The patient underwent palliative XRT initially but after his brain biopsy came back negative for malignancy by preliminary report, he had definitive XRT.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia: CT chest showed RUL PNA, which was likely post-obstructive.
# Mental status changes, likely brain metastasis: Patient was awake, alert, oriented, but initially complained of visual hallucinations and had R eye ptosis with increased lacrimation.
CT head on [**12-23**] showed 2.2 x 2.0 cm area of hypodensity in the right medial cerebellum which did not demonstrate FDG avidity on the recent PET CT.  A follow up Brain MRI showed 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, representing a metastatic focus.
Leptomeningeal enhancement of L internal auditory canal could not be excluded.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and the patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy on [**12-27**] which was negative for malignancy by preliminary report.
# Hypotension->Hypertension:  Patient was hypotensive at time of transfer, requiring levophed, however his blood pressure improved with cessation of sedation and extubation.
It was felt less likely that the patient had a sepsis from his pneumonia, and blood Cx showed NGTD.
Since extubation, patient has become hypertensive with SBP 190-200.
He was started on captopril for tighter blood pressure control, but by discharge he was restarted on lisinopril.
Allergies: NKDA  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: non-small-cell lung cancer  Secondary diagnoses: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from an outside hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2175-12-22**] with hemoptysis (coughing up blood).
The hemoptysis was most likely due to your recently diagnosed lung cancer.
You were intubated for airway protection but was extubated shortly after after your symptoms improved.
You also underwent a biopsy of a mass in a part of your brain called cerebellum.
The biopsy did not show any cancer involvement, by preliminary report.
If you cough up blood again, develop shortness of breathness, fevers, chills, chest pain, or any other symptom that concerns you, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Room.
