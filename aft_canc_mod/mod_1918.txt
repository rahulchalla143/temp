He had an EGD at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with biopsy which showed adeno CA at 32cm.
EUS here on [**9-26**] showed T [**1-28**] disease without nodal enlargement.

No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs,  rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Soft, NT, ND EXTREMITIES: LE edema 1+ SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
Laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy.
Buttressing of esophagogastric anastomosis with thymic     fat pad.
FIRST ASSISTANT:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD  SECOND ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], RES  OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 62-year-old gentleman with a distal esophageal adenocarcinoma.
He was brought to the operating room today for esophageal resection.
We specifically discussed the risk of anastomotic leak, bleeding, need for reoperation, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction and death.
We noted the esophageal tumor at 37 cm.
We observed no evidence of metastatic disease on this laparoscopic survey.
We then placed 4 additional ports in the usual configuration for laparoscopic esophageal surgery.
There was a small hernia and we entered the dissection plane between the hernia sac and the peritoneum over the right crus.
There were some small collaterals within the omentum between the right and left gastroepiploic artery that we also preserved.
We also divided some adhesions between the posterior surface of the stomach and the pancreas.
We then turned our attention to insertion of the laparoscopic feeding tube.
We also noted good distension of the small bowel when air was insufflated into the jejunostomy catheter, indicating intraluminal positioning of the feeding tube.
This was done to prevent obstruction of the gastric conduit at the level of the diaphragm.
We noted some dense adhesions between the lower lobe of the lung and the chest wall.
We divided the inferior pulmonary ligament and carried our pleural incision up toward the carina.
There was an extremely large bronchial artery in this area that there was divided between clips.
We skeletonized both the right and left mainstem bronchi and swept all of the subcarinal lymph nodes onto the esophagus.
There was some bleeding in this area from the large bronchial artery that was controlled with clips.
We took care to ensure that the plane of fat overlying the thoracic duct was maintained during this portion of the dissection.
We sent margins for frozen section which returned negative for malignancy.
We then enlarged the posterior incision to about 3 cm to allow access of the stapler into the chest through the small thoracotomy.
We then penetrated the greater curve of the gastric conduit with the spike of the stapler.
We noted no evidence of bleeding at this time.
The addendum is as follows:  Please note that during placement of the pursestring suture in the proximal thoracic esophagus, an Endostitch device was used.
[**MD Number(2) 32450**]  Pathology examination ([**2135-10-28**]) SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: gastroesophageal resection, level 9 lymph node, level 7 lymph node, gastric donut, fundus of stomach, esophageal donut.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
CXR ([**2135-11-4**]) The right chest drain has been removed with no new pneumothorax.
Moderate distention of the neo esophagus has slightly decreased and the right lower lobe atelectasis and small right pleural effusion are unchanged.
The left lung consolidation and left lower lobe atelectasis have improved.
No new consolidation or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Improving left lung consolidation and atelectasis   OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION [**2135-11-4**] SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presents with mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by tongue pumping, increased oral transit times, prespill with thin liquids, reduced epiglottic deflection, and oral and mild pharyngeal residue.
Two episodes of penetration occurred during the swallow and cleared spontaneously upon laryngeal valve closure.
No aspiration was observed.
His pain was well controlled via a thoracic epidural catheter and i.v.
His NGT was removed [**2135-11-1**], epidural catheter and chest tubes were removed on POD6 after the patient passed his swallow exam.
