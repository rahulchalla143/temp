HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old female with pancreatic carcinoma originally admitted to the hospital on [**2112-2-28**], with complaints of nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
She had been started on Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Flagyl for Klebsiella urosepsis versus cholangitis on [**2-29**].
During her Intensive Care Unit course, the patient had four out of four blood cultures positive for Klebsiella and had a percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve left hydronephrosis and an Emergency Room CT scan which was negative for cholangitis.
The patient was treated for Klebsiella bacteremia in the Intensive Care Unit and had a left lower lobe pneumonia, and was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.
She received aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizers to allow for this but had a persistent O2 requirement upon transfer back to the floor on [**3-6**].
Her oxygen requirement there increased daily as well as her white blood cell count.
Her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**] saw her on the floor and was reluctant to start palliative chemotherapy until her infection issues were resolved.
Urinary tract infection.
Pancreatic cancer with liver metastases.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies dyspnea, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other pain.
She wishes to have all possible medical interventions.
Dry mucosal membranes.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Back with no costovertebral angle tenderness; left nephrostomy in place.
Pulmonary:  Bronchial breath sounds in left base with egophony and dullness to percussion in the left base; otherwise clear to auscultation.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm, well perfused.
[**2-29**] dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Repeat chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe consolidation, patchy bilateral infiltrates versus pulmonary edema.
CT scan of the abdomen on [**3-8**] revealed left lower lobe atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions and numerable liver metastases and spleen metastases and interval resolution of left hydronephrosis.
Initial impression was a 62 year old female with pancreatic cancer metastatic to liver, left hydronephrosis, status post left nephrostomy, status post recent Klebsiella pneumonia bacteremia with worsening hypoxia and infiltrate on chest x-ray; slightly elevated total bilirubin and leukocytosis.
ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was initially hypoxemic believed to be secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation with sepsis.
The patient's initial lactates were in the 2 range and she was given one unit of packed red blood cells for her low hematocrit.
The patient initially had AmBisome started, however, this was discontinued after she was afebrile for 24 hours.
She had a persistent O2 requirement in the Intensive Care Unit and was on a nonrebreather mask for two days, however, with diuresis and antibiotics she was able to avoid intubation and in fact be weaned on her high flow face mask very slowly.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with impair left atrial relaxation and so it was assumed that the diastolic congestive heart failure could be related to her respiratory failure.
Her bilirubin was rising in the unit to a high of 2.4, however, it had started to fall after this and no other interventions were done.
LEFT PICC LINE AND A-LINE:  Right IJ triple lumen catheter was pulled once a left PICC line was placed and tip sent for culture which never grew out anything.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:   Urine culture positive for yeast on [**3-9**]; the Foley catheter was replaced and a recheck of urinalysis was negative.
However, she did have a positive yeast infection by clinical examination and was on three days of miconazole intravaginal suppositories.
DEPRESSION / ANXIETY:  The patient was actively going through the acceptance stages for dying as she had been told that she has a very grave prognosis; angry at house staff at times, refusing to participate in getting out of bed or chest Physical Therapy at times, however, does it with encouragement.
The patient was started on Ritalin empirically to treat depression and fatigue and malaise while in the Intensive Care Unit.
