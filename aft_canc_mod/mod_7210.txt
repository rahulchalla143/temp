Admission Date:  [**2196-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2148-11-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**] Chief Complaint: Tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p Pericardial window for recurrent malignant pericardial effusion and drainage of large right pleural effusion.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 47 yo man with h/o epilepsy s/p vagal nerve stimulator, AFib, recent diagnosis of stage IV lung CA and PE on Lovenox and Coumadin, and a recent pericardial effusion who presents with one-week of worsening SOB, chest pain, and abdominal pain.
Bedside TTE demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade and pulsus was difficult to obtain secondary to tachycardia.
CXR demonstrated a right-sided pleural effusion.
The patient d/c'd his own chest tube.
Past Medical History: - epilepsy and nonelectrographic seizures (petite mal with rare secondary generalization) - s/p right temporal lobectomy - s/p VNS placement - Mood disorder and likely borderline personality organization - Multiple suicide attempts in past (largely overdose) - DM due to medication, now apparently resolved - cervical strain - Rosacea - [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus - Polysubstance abuse: EtOH, MJ, cocaine/crack binges with resultant unsafe sexual practices - h/o atrial fibrillation (not on medication)  Social History: Unemployed, lives alone.
Family History: States has FH of diabetes and 'cancer in everyone' but no FH of CAD, HTN, sudden death or cardiac dysrhythmias  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam Vitals: BP: 115/73 P: 150's R: 20 O2:86% General: Unresponsive HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Diffuse expiratory wheezes, R sided crackles CV: distant heart sounds.
pulsus of 16 Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2-17**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized, organized circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Tachycardia with beat-to-beat variation in left ventricular systolic function.
Atrial tachyarrhythmia is present.
ECHO [**2-18**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Suboptimal quality.
Moderate-sized circumferential pericardial effusion containing echo dense material consistent with blood, inflammation, or other cellular elements.
No echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Left pleural effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-2-17**], the size of the pericardial effusion remains moderate, but has decreased minimally in size from 1.5 centimeters to 1.4 centimeters in greatest dimension.

?s family decided to make patient CMO, patient when lucid yesterday evening also said that he did not want any further procedures and just wanted his pain to be controlled.
Tachycardia: AFib with RVR likely in the setting of pericardial effusion and multiple PEs.
Based on old records, has a history of Afib with RVR, a flutter, was treated with diltiazem and flecainide, and was supposed to be on Metoprolol.
Pericardial Effusion: moderate size on echo in ED but no evidence of tamponade.
Prior pericardial effusion about one month ago showed adenocarcinoma of lung, consistent with his lung cancer diagnosis.
Current effusion likely a malignant effusion or blood.
h/o seizure disorder: VNS placed during last admission.
