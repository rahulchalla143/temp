Pain poorly controlled at home with tramadol, Tylenol with codeine.
He is being admitted to OMED from clinic via ED for pain control and expedited evaluation of his NSCLC and questionable pathologic cervical fracture.
The patient received 10 mg morphine in ED with pain relief.

No cervical LAD RESPIRATORY:  Coarse rhonchi bilaterally, no wheezing.
5cm right anterior chest wall mass present, tender to touch.
CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR, nl S1/S2 w/o m/r/g ABDOMEN:  Soft, NT/ND, no HS, BS+ EXTREMITIES: WWP, no edema, diminished periperal pulses.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No spinal tenderness.
NEUROLOGIC: CN II-XII grossly intact, sensation to LT intact throughout, no hyper-reflexia noted.
SKIN:  No evidence of active rashes.
Additionally, erosion of the transverse process at this level is present.
Asymmetry of the paraspinal muscles on the right could indicate additional metastatic disease and/or intramuscular hematoma.
Multiple additional lucencies in the cervical spine concerning for metastatic disease, most notable in the C7 vertebral body.
Metastatic involvement at multiple cervical levels, centered around a C5 vertebral body which demonstrates compression deformity, and retropulsion due to complete invasion by metastatic tumor.
There is associated central canal stenosis, with spinal cord compression, though there is no intrinsic cord abnormality at present.
Mass in the soft tissues of the posterior neck most consistent with hematoma, which should be correlated linically .
LENIs [**2175-10-1**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 M w/recently diagnosed NSCLC p/w severe neck pain [**9-19**] s/p anterior C4-6 diskectomy with anterior fusion on [**9-20**] and posterior fusion [**9-21**], admitted to SICU for difficult airway s/p extubation [**9-25**] transferred back to oncology floor [**9-30**] for pain control.
#Agitation: Delirium was initially thought to be due to large amount of narcotics that patient was recieving in ICU and patient was started on haldol.
On the oncology floor, the haldol was initially stopped and the pain regimen was modified but the patient continued to have agitation and restlessness.
It was felt that the agitation was most likely secondary to either pain or dyspnea associated with mucus/secretion accumulation.
He was started on prn olanzapine for agitation as well.
Our recommendation is to avoid restraints, hold vitals overnight, provide a bed next to a window if at all possible, use pain medications and suctioning as first line treatment for agitation and to use olanzapine as back-up.
#Neck Pain: Secondary to cancer mets as well as post-op pain.
Neck pain difficult to assess give patient's mental status and language barriers.
Patient was NPO after failing speech and swallow several times including video swallow evaluation.
His pain was managed with a fentanyl patch and SL morphine.
He failed repeat speech and swallow including video swallow study, which was attributed more to post-op changes/neck swelling rather than mental status.
#NSCLC: Biopsy proven on [**2175-7-6**], initially presenting with neck pain and ?pathologic C5 fracture evaluated by orthopedic surgery.
Patient had previously communicated wishes to family that he would not want chemotherapy or radiation.
Family meeting was held and the family again stated that they are not interested in chemotherapy or radiation, and would like patient to go to [**Hospital1 **] with hospice with primary focus on his comfort and pain control.
He remained afebrile throughout hospital course.
CBC showed new leukocytosis.
CXR showed: "As compared to [**2175-9-30**], there is interval improvement of bibasilar aeration but still present bilateral right more than left pleural effusion and right basal opacity, findings that might be representing interval development of new right lower lobe process, but residual findings reflecting the prior process cannot be entirely excluded.
No new abnormalities have been demonstrated as compared to multiple prior studies.
Bilateral pleural effusion is present, most likely subpulmonic on the right."
#Tachycardia: He became tachycardic in the SICU and was started on IV metoprolol.
#Incontinence: likely related to mental status.
Has some urinary retention for which he has a foley.
