Admission Date:  [**2149-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-5-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83931**] is a 69 YOM with metastatic melanoma to brain, liver, lung, pancreas, and spine with chronic pain in his right lower quadrant and low back secondary to metastases of the T12 vertebral body.
He presents with increased agitation for one day.
Of note, he recently was hospitalized in the begining of [**2149-6-26**] for pain, altered mental status, and depression with SI.
MRI of his head at that time revealed progression of his disease and he was discharged on [**Hospital1 **] Decadron as well as a percutaneous epidural catheter, gabapentin, and multiple narcotics for pain control.
Since his discharge he has been complaining of lethargy, dizziness, and exhaustion so his Gabapentin was recently decreased with plans to taper seroids as well.
Initial labs showed mildly elevated lipase 62 and AST 46, hyponatremia to 126, and hyperkalemia 5.4 with lactate 2.4.
Redraw of the labs 4 hrs later showed resolution in abnormalities of LFTs, K, and sodium to 129.
There was no elevated WBC count and the Hct was stable at 39.8.
CT head was limited due to motion and showed progression of extensive numerous hyperdense lesions bilaterally consistent with known metastatic melanoma.
In addition, there was a tiny focus of hyperdense material over the left parietal lobe concerning for small amount of subarachnoid blood.
CXR showed small right pleural effusion and persistent right middle lobe lung mass.
The patient then developed emesis that was brown with ?
This showed no acute intra-abd or pelvic process, but overall progression of his metestatic disease.
During the patient's time in the ED he became progressively more agitated and self destructive, wripping out lines and not cooperating.
He was transferred to the MICU given his agitation and high nursing requirement.
He then had wide excision, and he did not have evidence of disease in the subsequent years.
-- [**9-/2148**], he developed abdominal pain from a pulled muscles.
A CT of the abdomen on [**2148-10-31**] showed right lower lobe pleura-based nodule, that on further CT of the chest showed otehr pleura-based lesions.
-- He underwent a fine-needle biopsy on the largest lesion on [**2149-1-2**] showing metastatic melanoma.
-- gadolinium-enhanced head MRI that showed a small enhancing lesion in the right insula.
There was no associated cerebral edema and he does not have any neurological symptoms.
-- stereotactic radiosurgery to a small right temporal brain metastasis on [**2149-3-31**] to 2,200 cGy at 77% isodose line, and --- status post 2 monthly temozolomide from [**2149-4-16**] to [**2149-5-13**], --- status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2149-5-6**] to a right medial parietal and left cerebellar brain metastases, both to 2200 cGy at 79% isodose line, and -- started ipilimumab on [**2149-6-3**].
His father is alive at age [**Age over 90 **]; he has obesity, cataracts, and macular degeneration.

Increased right pleural effusion w/ associated compressive atelectasis.
Progression of diseaes with new metastatses and progression of others.
At least 3 new hypodense liver lesions.
Increased size of pancreatic head lesion.
CT HEAD [**2149-7-29**] Limited study secondary to patient motion artifact redemonstrating progression of extensive numerous hyperdense lesions bilaterally consistent with known metastatic melanoma.
In addition, there is a tiny focus of hyperdense material over the left parietal lobe concerning for small amount of subarachnoid blood.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83931**] is a 69 YOM with metestatic melenoma with known mets to his head and multiple other organs, on IV steroids who presents with rapidly declining function over the past few weeks and acute altered mental status for the past day and is found to have hyponatremia and new left parietal finding concerning for subarachnoid bleed.
However the altered mental status did not resolve.Patient expired on [**8-9**] likely secondary to aspiration.
# Altered mental status: Likely caused by end stage metestatic melenoma with known brain mets and progression seen thoughout body on CT scan.
Hyponatremia also in the differential, however, unlikely to be the sole cause given improving and hyponatremia seems minimal in comparison to the pt's severity of AMS.
Other DDX include evolving infection, meningitis, hepatic encephalopathy, polypharmacy or toxic metabolic process.
However, inital labs do not support infection or hepatic cause.
During the hospital course, he had intermittant agitation, fairly well controlled on Zyprexa 5 mg qam and Zyprexa 10 mg qHS standing doses.
Final diagnosis is altered mental status due to worsening of metastatic melanoma.
At 4pm vitals were taken and he was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic, he also sounded congested (and likely aspirated).
Hyponatremia resolved prior to discharge with Na in high 130s for several days with fluid restriction.
# Metastatic Melanoma: End stage.
# Ulcer on back: Ulcer remains unstageable but is improving in size.
