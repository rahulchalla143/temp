He notes orthopnea x several months.
No PND/leg swelling.
In the ED, the CTA was negative for PE, but notable for resolving pna and stable tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance.
His ECG was sinus 94, old q in avF, LAD, LVH and new TWI in V4-V6.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post allo-bone marrow transplant 10 years ago at [**Hospital1 336**].
No tob or etoh.
Family History: Mother had lung cancer due to tobacco abuse, his father died at [**Age over 90 **] years of age, his sister died of Asthma at age 51.
Sclera anicteric.
chronic GVH scleritic type lesions but no ulcers, vesicles, lesions suggestive of thrush NECK: supple, no JVD, no LAD CV: RR, normal S1, S2.
Lungs: decreased BS throughout, no wheeze/crackle/rhonci, no egophony Abd: SNTND.
Derm: Skin thick, firm, pale.Extensive chronic GVHD of the scleroderma type.
Resolution of left lower lobe consolidation with mild scarring or atelectasis remaining.
Small 2 cm and 1 cm areas of patchy opacity of the anterior base of the left lower lobe and peripheral right upper lobe are nonspecific but unchanged.
No change in 7 mm soft tissue density in the rightchest wallt, which may represent a sebaceous cyst.
No evidence of fracture or malalignment within the cervical spine.
Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
[**8-23**] CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**8-23**] EKG: NSR 97, lat TWI, no ST changes .
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-7-30**], no change.
No obvious right proximal femur fracture identified.
[**2200-8-30**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Possible right atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2200-8-29**] sinus tachycardia is now present.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 52yo M w/ CLL s/p alloBMT in [**2188**] with chronic skin GVHD admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology with GI bleed, leukopenia.
Respiratory failure-This patient developed apneic hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
DDx for acute cause of respiratory failure include hypophosphatemia (0.3), increase in sedation, mucus plug, CVA, or acute head injury.
Pt was intubated and doing well but had poor negative inspiratory force with moderately reduced combined lung and chest wall compliance secondary to chronic GVHD changes.
Though he had a favorable RSBI when he was extubated on [**8-28**] he required reintubation after approx 2 hrs of extubation for increased work of breathing, likely related to mechanical muscle weakness.
He had a tracheostomy tube and PEG tube surgically placed on [**9-4**] for for more slow weaning off the vent via sprint-rest trach mask trials and was awaiting placement in a respiratory rehabilitation center, however throughout the week prior to his death, he was requiring higher vent settings and continued to desaturate.
Repeat bronchoscopy did not alleviate his respiratory failure and it was felt that he was continuing to mucous plug secondary to VAP and his inability to clear his own secretions.
VAP-While awaiting tracheostomy tube placement he developed increased FIO2 requirement, low-grade fever, and leukopenia with bandemia in the setting of new LLL and RUL opacity, so [**9-3**] was started on cefipime, vanco, levofloxacin for VAP.
He also was found to have gram + rods and cocci on sputum culture.
Leukopenia-he developed leukopenia [**9-2**], with WBC count trending down during his hospital course, possibly myelosupression from medication vs infection vs myleodysplastic syndrome, differential showed bandemia suggestive of infection.
Chest pain- Around the time of extubation he developed chest pain with ST-T wave changes on ECG and elevated troponin thought to be stress induced tropinism.
DDx includes cardiac ischemia vs noncardiac causes including pleuritis due to resolving pneumonia/fibrosis, esophagitis, ulcer, or myopathy.
Blood per rectum-he developed BRBPR on [**8-30**] and continued to have melenotic stools, most likely lower GI source due to rapid onset, DDx includes diverticulosis, AVM, hemmroids, ulcer, gastritis, DIC labs neg.
GI was consulted but preferred not to scope emergently as hct stabilized and he was high risk given recent cardiac changes.
Thrombocytopenia: He developed relative thrombocytopenia [**8-30**] that was likely consumptive (GI bleed) vs drug induced cellcept/pentamidine) that stablized.
DIC labs neg, heparin dependent antibody neg, cellcept decreased per BMT rec due to potencial cause of thrombocytopenia .
HTN-He had quite labile blood pressures ranging from 80's to 200's systolic with tachycardia that were controlled ultimately with metoprolol, captopril and PRN hydralazine.
Chronic renal insufficiency - cyclosporine induced renal toxicity, baseline creat 1, creatinine stable during this hospital course.
