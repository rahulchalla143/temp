Admission Date:  [**2181-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-6-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-2-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath,hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 77 year old male with multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**Month (only) 116**] s/p recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 17333**]) for a T10 mass, treated with XRT on [**5-22**] and [**5-29**] and recent chemotherapy who presents with one day of intermittent pleuritic chest pain.
The pain began on [**2181-6-15**] when the patient was at rest and was accompanied by shortness of breath.
The pain was localized to the lower left chest near the costal margin.
He thinks that the shortness of breath started first, followed by the pain.
He denies any fevers or chills, but did have a cough productive of clear sputum, which is new for him.
The pain returned today with increased intensity, and he decided to call EMS.
He had already been given a NS bolus in the ambulance for hypotension (to SBP 90) and tachycardia (to 120).
He triggered for hypoxia (to 80% when decreased to 4L NC), tachypnea, and tachycardia.
Exam showed no evidence of peripheral edema or DVT.
He was placed on 100% non-rebreather, satting 100%, and his tachycardia and tachypnea resolved.
Differential diagnosis included pneumonia vs. PE vs. ACS.
EKG showed no acute ischemic changes, initial Troponin was negative, and CXR showed chronic interstitial opacities with no evidence of superimposed pneumonia.
There was significant concern for PE given his cancer history and presentation.
No evidence of DVT was seen on physical exam.
CTA was not performed due to increased risk of contrast nephropathy in patients with active multiple myeloma.
His chest pain had resolved and his breathing was less labored, but still significantly worse than his baseline.
He has not had any fevers or chills.

**FINAL REPORT [**2181-6-19**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2181-6-19**]):    No MRSA isolated.
There is a large filling defect in the right main, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries of the right lower lobe suggestive of a massive pulmonary artery embolism.
On the left side pulmonary emboli are in the segmental pulmonary arteries of the left lower lobe, however, the left main pulmonary artery is devoid of any filling defects.
However, there is no evidence of any septal bulge or cardiac strain.
There is minimal left pleural effusion and adjacent basal atelectasis.
Bilateral lungs showing moderate-to-severe emphysema changes with diffuse subpleural interstitial thickening and fibrosis, which is lower lobe prominence.
Diffuse heterogeneity of the lungs is attributed to the air trapping.
The features are suggestive of emphysema with chronic interstitial lung disease.
There are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes at all stations, for example, the right upper paratracheal lymph node measures 1.6 x 1.4 cm.
No pathologic enlargement of supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes.
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly without pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN: Study is not tailored for evaluation of the abdomen; however, limited views revealed non-calcified plaque measuring 1.7 x 0.9 cm in the abdominal aorta (3:75) along the posterior wall causing less than 50% narrowing of the aortic lumen.
BONES: Bones are of diffusely low density with multiple small osteolytic lesions involving multiple ribs bilaterally.
There is reduction in the height of T10 vertebral (< 30%) body with a large osteolytic lesion involving the posterior body and left pedicle and soft tissue component causing narrowing of the spinal canal.
All these changes were previously seen and better characterized on the MR imaging of spine dated [**2181-5-7**] and are consistent with known underlying clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
IMPRESSION: Massive right main pulmonary artery embolism extending into the lobar and segmental branches of the right lower lobe and emboli involving the left lower lobe segmental arteries.
Dilated main pulmonary artery and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema Diffuse subpleural interstitial thickening with fibrosis is suggestive of diffuse interstitial disease.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Osteolytic lesions involving the T10 vertebral body and multiple ribs.
The extent of the lytic vertebral lesions with soft tissue component was better characterized in the previous MR of spine dated [**5-7**], [**2180**].
[**6-18**] LENIS FINDINGS: Doppler and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale son[**Name (NI) 1417**] performed of the bilateral lower extremities.
Normal compressibility, flow and augmentation is seen throughout the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for deep vein thrombosis bilaterally.
[**6-16**] CXR There are coarsened interstitial markings again noted within the lungs, most notable in the right upper lobe, left lower lung, which likely represent scarring related to interstitial lung disease.
Compared with the prior exams, there has been no change in the pattern of interstitial opacity, though there may be mild left basilar atelectasis.
No evidence of superimposed pneumonia.
There is slightly increased prominence of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery as compared to [**2181-4-9**].
The findings might represent lymphadenopathy or potentially increase in the pulmonary artery due to interval development of pulmonary embolism.
Note is made that this study neither exclude nor confirm the presence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse interstitial process seen on the multiple prior radiographs dating back to [**2181-4-10**] appears to be unchanged and most likely reflects chronic interstitial changes.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
[**6-18**] CXR The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities.
A slightly more confluent opacity in the left lower lobe has recently developed.
No definite pleural effusion is present.
IMPRESSION: A more confluent opacity in the left base could represent atelectasis or pneumonia superimposed on interstitial lung disease.
Both hila are prominent likely related to pulmonary hypertension.
* PENDING ONCOLOGY STUDIES* -SPEP, immunoglobulins, B2 microglobulin and serum free light chains .
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2181-3-25**] who is now status post  recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 17333**]) for a T10 mass attributed to myeloma and treated with XRT on [**5-22**] and [**5-29**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 101667**] also underwent recent chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
On this admission he presented from home with one day of intermittent pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath with severe hypotension noted in the emergency room.
Patient ultimately diagnosed with new massive pulmonary embolism which worsened his already baseline dyspnea from known COPD, interstitial lung disease.
ACUTE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Pulmonary Embolus: His history and presentation with acute onset pleuritic chest pain were very concerning for PE.
He did not undergo CTA on admission due to risk of contrast nephropathy with his underlying multiple myeloma and renal disease, but subsequently CTA showed large PE after aggressive pre-treatment for iodine contrast load.
Initial ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with 7.48/20/53, improved at 7.42/34/162 with supplemental oxygen.
# Hypoxia.
On admission, patient's lungs were diffusely wheezy with poor air movement, suggesting an additional process such as asthma, atypical pneumonia.
As above, pulmonary emboli related dyspnea was felt to be major contributing cause of his worse hypoxia status and CTA confirmed massive pulmonary emboli over right side lung (minimal left sided involvement).
He does have a long smoking history with known severe COPD and interstitial lung disease which created a very poor baseline pulmonary reserve making his recuperation especially challenging.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM .
Low Plt count initially thought to be related to his multiple myeloma and recent chemotherapy, but primary oncologist suggested it may also be secondary to bactrim, which was recently stopped as outpatient prophylactic therapy.
For now, he will plan to continue Atovaquone instead of bactrim for ongoing prophylaxis.
No sign of active bleeding.
No signs of bleeding on the floor.
# Multiple Myeloma:  He was recently treated with chemotherapy and XRT for his multiple myeloma and a T10 mass, but this is not an active issue on this admision.
He will continue to receive atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, allopurinol for gout ppx, and acyclovir for viral ppx.
# Hypertension: Patient with recored history of hypertension with lisinopril and HCTZ listed as daily medications.
However, given his extreme hypotension from recent massive pulmonary emboli and normotensive pressures off of these medications he was discharged without need for ongoing HCTZ or ACE-I but he can plan to discuss restart with his PCP if BP changes emerge.
# Type II Diabetes: Patient with history of borderline diabetes not on any outpatient medications.
His blood glucose became elevated after he was started on prednisone.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: -Pulmonary embolism -Hypotension -Multiple Myeloma -Severe COPD -Interstitial lung disease -Diabetes mellitus .
Secondary Diagnoses: -Hyperlipidemia -BPH -Abdominal aortic aneurysm -Mild CKD (baseline Cr 1.2-1.3)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were seen in the emergency room for chest pain and subsequently admitted into the intensive care unit for low blood oxygen levels and low blood pressure.
You were admitted into the intensive care unit because of your low oxygenation and concerns for pulmonary embolism, an illness involving a blood clot in the lungs that causes the heart to work harder and prevents the body from getting enough oxygen.
You received a chest CT which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
You began to receive anticoagulation medications to treat and prevent pulmonary embolism.
These blood clots often come from veins in the legs, so you received an ultrasound of both legs to look for them.
Ultrasound revealed no clots in either leg.
You continued to improve on the floor without chest pain or trouble breathing at rest.
