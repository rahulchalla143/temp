The patient states that over the last few weeks, he has had occasional lower extremity weakness which only occurs at night.
However, on the day of admission, the patient states he felt weak during the day, and in fact required use of his wife's walker.
At the OSH, the patient was found to have a K of 8.9, other labs as below.
ECGs with improvement from prior, no peaking of T waves here.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
He does report 3 days of loose stools prior to admission, up in frequency from once daily to 3 times daily.
Followed by regular bone scans and CT scans without evidence of metastatic disease.
Of note, in [**Month (only) 205**] the patient was hospitalized with urosepsis presumably from a urethral stricture, in [**2180-7-21**] he had an acute bladder outlet obstruction which resulted in an increase in his creatinine, though this has since resolved.
Last PSA in [**10-28**] was 75  -Spinal stenosis - recent lumbar spinal steroid injection on [**2180-12-28**], no complications -Hypertension -Bowel obstruction during childhood, s/p resection   Social History: Lives at home with his wife.

No mass, stone or hydronephrosis detected within the kidneys.
The bladder is moderately distended with fluid without focal lesion detected within.
IMPRESSION: Mildly limited study.
There is a slightly tortuous thoracic aortic contour.
The lungs are clear bilaterally without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There are mild degenerative changes in the underlying osseous structures.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who presented with lower extremity weakness and was admitted from OSH with severe hyperkalemia to 8.9.
No new medications other than vitamin D. Patient denied any high potassium food intake.
The patient had been having frequent loose stools so he should have been wasting K from the GI tract.
The patient was evaluated by the renal service and diagnosed with underlying hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism with a significant metabolic acidosis in the setting of his profuse diarrhea thta may have precipitated transcellular shift of potassium out of the cells causing his hyperkalemia.
He has had frequent surveillance PET scans and CT scans, last in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, without evidence of metastatic disease.
Acute exacerbation of his symptoms was likely secondary to his severe hyperkalemia.
With improvement in his hyperkalemia, his lower extremity weakness resolved and he was able to ambulate well independently.
# Prostate cancer: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Location (un) 620**].
No evidence of metastatic disease at this time, though PSA has been increasing over time, most recently 75.
# Atrial fibrillation: Was subtherapeutic on admission and was bridged on a heparin gtt and continued on home coumadin.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe Hyperkalemia Bilateral Lower Extremity Weakness Metabolic Acidosis secondary to Diarrhea and renal dysfunction Hyporeninemic Hypoaldosteronism Stage 3 CKD Prostate Ca s/p XRT  Discharge Condition: Vital Signs Stable  Potassium of 5.3   Discharge Instructions: Patient to return to ED if he has recurrent leg weakness, heart palpitations, chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe diarrhea, fevers, chills.
