male who had a fall to the ground while making his bed this afternoon.
Pt was brought to [**Hospital 11694**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 2251**], MA and found to have an acute LEFT temporal mass and ICH on CT. Pt was transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
Per his mother, wife, and sister, he has been more irritable over the past few weeks and has also had some recent memory loss.
No known family h/o of intracranial hemorrhages or cancers.
Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils are 1-2 mm and minimally reactive to light.

The differential includes hypertensive and amyloid related intraparenchymal hemorrhage, though other underlying pathologies (i.e.
Large left-sided temporal lobe hematoma with surrounding edema and mass effect with subfalcine and uncal herniation with midline shift.
Displacement of the vascular structures secondary to hematoma without intrinsic vascular abnormality such as an aneurysm, stenosis or occlusion.
No abnormal vascular structure seen to suggest arteriovenous malformation.
Mass effect and midline shift is identified.
No distinct enhancement seen within the hematoma or in the other parts of the brain to indicate an underlying lesion.
Patchy enhancement at the margin posteriorly appear to be due to vascular enhancement.
Left temporal dura (A, B): Dura and mildly hypercellular cortex with scattered atypical cells.
Left temporal lobe tissue (C-E): Oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II.
New areas of enhancement in the periphery of the hematoma with irregular and nodular appearance as well as a few vague areas of enhancement in the right basal ganglia, in the right thalamus, in the left parasagittal brain parenchyma adjacent to the thalamus.
The cause of enhancement is unclear and this may relate to postsurgical changes at the site of the surgery.
However, given the vague areas of enhancement in the right thalamus and superior to the left thalamus, associated inflammatory or infective etiology cannot be excluded.
Mild increase in the size of the left subdural fluid collection as well as the subcutaneous fluid collection in the left frontotemporal region.
No significant change in the significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, subfalcine and uncal herniation with mass effect on the left posterior cerebral artery and the posterior communicating artery.
MRI Head ([**11-18**]): IMPRESSION: Left-sided temporal and subinsular rim-enhancing mass with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, midline shift, and uncal herniation with deformity of the brainstem.
Increased T2 signal, slow diffusion and increased fractional anisotropy within the left posterior temporal lobe is suggestive of new infarct in the left posterior cerebral artery distribution.
Persistent shift of midline structures and left uncal herniation with compression of midbrain and pons.
Post-operative changes as described above.
Head CT([**11-22**]): No evidence of new hemorrhage or mass effect.
Persistent, significant rightward shift of midline structures and left uncal herniation.
Further evolution of left posterior cerebral artery distribution infarct.
Head CT ([**11-23**]): Unchanged mass effect, postsurgical changes and evolving left posterior cerebral artery distribution infarct.
He was found to have an intracranial hemorrhage vs mass, which was determined to be a surgical emergency.
The patient underwent serial physical exams and radiographic imaging for progressive assessment.
Pathology taken from the intracerebral mass was consistent with Oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II and the patient was taken back to the OR on [**2147-11-18**] for resection of this mass and temporal lobectomy.
Throughout his post-surgical hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had several incidents of low grade temperature elevations(101.3) which are atelactic in nature as his CBC has been stable, and not evidence of infection was noted at the incision site.
On his day of discharge, he had complained of mild "numbness" in the right hand.
Upon examination, he was full in strength, and it was secondary to ulnar nerve compression based on how he was sitting, or likely residual from perioperative positioning.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
