HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems including a history of COPD and recent craniotomy with resection of a glioblastoma multiforme in [**2110-1-20**], with initial XRT in [**2110-2-20**], who presented to the ED last evening following XRT treatment with increased shortness of breath and hypoxia.
The patient states that shortness of breath has been times one month since starting chemo and XRT, which has gradually been worsening.
He was seen in clinic on [**2110-3-9**] with fatigue, decreased p.o., and increased shortness of breath.
No cough, no orthopnea, no chest pain, no nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or dysuria, no abdominal pain, no fevers or chills.
No sick contacts, and no recent travel.
CTA was negative for PE and nonspecific ground-glass opacities.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **], ABGs with continued hypoxia with increasing lactates, he was transferred to the unit for closer monitoring.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD status post CABG in [**2093**].
Right upper lobe resection secondary to abscess in [**2094**] later found to be Aspergillus  Prostate cancer in [**2106**] status post XRT.
Left hip fracture.
Hyperlipidemia  Hypertension.
Basal cell carcinoma on nose.
Right frontal glioblastoma multiforme status post resection [**1-23**] with XRT on steroids.
ALLERGIES:  MORPHINE AND CODEINE CAUSE NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
General:  Mild shortness of breath, but is able to speak in full sentences.
Pulmonary:  Crackles left greater than right.
Bronchial breath sounds throughout.
CTA from [**3-27**] shows no PA emphysematous changes, nonspecific ground-glass opacity to both lungs consistent with infectious or inflammatory disease or pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram shows EF of 35 percent with akinesis and thinning of anterior septal, inferior septum, inferior wall.
Normal PA pressures, no effusion, dilated left and right atrium.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  The patient is admitted to SICU for further evaluation of his hypoxia/respiratory failure.
Given his history of malignancy and steroids, he was felt to be at increased risk for PCP.
Meanwhile, he was also treated for possible bacterial process with broad spectrum antibiotics including Levaquin and Ceftaz.
By [**4-1**], he was placed on BiPAP for increased respiratory distress.
When he was not continuing to improve and had an increased hypoxia, he was emergently intubated on the evening of [**2110-4-3**].
His sputum ultimately grew out staph aureus and the patient was later changed to oxacillin.
There were also some thoughts that possibly CHF could be an etiology of the patient's hypoxia.
He was gently diuresed, but did not respond well, resulted in hypotension and increased renal insufficiency.
Secondary to the patient's response with hypotension and increased renal insufficiency, CHF was not felt to be a large component of his respiratory demise.
Later during end of hospital course, the patient has spiked fever and since sputum grew out staph, oxacillin was added for possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
After multiple discussions with family during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, it was ultimately decided that the patient's prognosis was extremely poor, especially given his unclear etiology of respiratory demise in the setting of a known CNS malignancy.
There were some concern that CHF may have been playing a role.
However, the patient had less than adequate response to diuresis involving hypotension and renal insufficiency.
Given the patient's persistent hypotension with diuresis, it was felt that CHF was not the etiology for his respiratory failure.
His ACE was given cautiously secondary to hypotension and renal failure.
It was felt that some of the hypotension may have been diuresed induced.
Ultimately, his poor prognosis involving his respiratory failure and his glioblastoma multiforme was the key factor in the patient's family deciding to withdraw care.
Acute renal insufficiency:  The patient developed mild renal insufficiency with creatinines up to 1.5 and 1.6.
Glioblastoma multiforme.
Acute renal insufficiency.
