Admission Date:  [**2196-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-4-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Cefepime / Zosyn  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**] Chief Complaint: fevers, SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TLC placement left thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old woman with CLL/SLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia-small lymphocytic lymphoma), recently progressive (with lymphadenopathy and anemia), s/p treatment with fludarabine, Cytoxan and Rituxan (last cycle starting on [**2195-12-9**], completed [**2196-1-5**]) presenting with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension.
On Sunday, she awoke with mild abdominal cramping and had [**12-20**] loose stools.
Later that afternoon, she developed chills, followed by a temperature spike as high as 103.6.
Other than the above, she denies URI symptoms, sore throat, N/V, CP, SOB, cough, dysuria.
She had a mild headache today which has now resolved.
CXR showed b/l pleural effusions, but no definite infiltrate.
Stool was sent for C. diff.
She was given about 2500 cc IVF initially, and then became SOB, felt to be flash pulmonary edema.
L IJ CVL placed was placed, CVP 9-10.
They recommended CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which showed pleural effusions but no consolidation and no abdominal process.
Echocardiogram was performed which ruled out pericardial effusion.
- [**2195-12-18**]: chest tightness, CXR with b/l pl effusions, treated with cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] given baseline ureteral obstruction and concern for predisposition to UTI - [**2195-12-19**]: ongoing fevers, admitted for febrile neutropenia.
B/L pleural effusions.
R VATS [**1-1**] with transudative fluid.
Both times cytology showed small mature lymphocytes and reactive mesothelial cells.
No growth from pleural fluid cx.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (small lymphocytic lymphoma).
In [**2191**], she had excisional biopsy of a rapidly enlarging submental mass that showed small lymphocytic lymphoma without evidence of transformation.
Biopsies were obtained showing "palisading granulomatous dermatitis" c/w "granuloma annulare or annular elastocytic granuloma."
However, additional asymptomatic disc-shaped erythematous lesions appeared in crops on both thighs.
Torso CT scan [**2195-11-26**] showed extensive thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic lymphadenopathy consistent with progression of her known lymphoma; left ureteral obstruction by a retroperitoneal lymphomatous mass with hydronephrosis of the left kidney; massive retroperitoneal adenopathy encasing the aorta and part of the IVC; and multiple pulmonary nodules, the majority of which were unchanged from the prior study of 10/00, with at least two new pulmonary nodules up to 7 mm in diameter.
These findings were felt to be consistent with progressive systemic adenopathy.
In view of this, alongside development of moderate anemia, systemic chemotherapy was initiated last month as noted above.
2. reactive airways disease 3. osteoarthritis 4. vitamin B12 deficiency 5. right breast nodular opacity on [**10-23**] mammogram that was not seen on [**11-24**] ultrasound 6. anxiety  Social History: She lives at home with her husband and her adult daughter.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at bases L>R (1/2 up on L), no wheezes or rhonchi.
CV: RRR, II/VI systolic murmur at LSB.
ABDOMEN: +BS, soft, ND, very mild TTP at RLQ with no rebound or guarding.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2196-1-25**]):    NO GROWTH.

Cytology from pleural fluid: Pleural fluid (left pleural space):    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
60 year old woman CLL recently admitted with fever and pleural effusions s/p VATs p/w recurrent fever, hypotenion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o infection, worsening pleural effusions CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL INDICATION: 60-year-old woman with CLL admitted for fever and pleural effusion status post VATS.
Rule out infection or worsening pleural effusion.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is extensive axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy, unchanged since [**2196-1-1**].
There are numerous enlarged lymph nodes in the paratracheal area, the largest measuring 1.3 cm in short axis, and the largest subcarinal node measures 1 cm in short axis, unchanged since [**2196-1-1**].
The left pleural effusion has increased in size since [**2196-1-1**], now large, with a significant subpulmonic component and associated relaxation atelectasis.
The right pleural effusion has significantly decreased in size, now moderate with moderate amount of associated relaxation atelectasis and subpulmonic effusion.
Both pleural effusions measure between 16 and 20 Hounsfield units, without evidence of loculation.
The proximal left ureteral obstruction caused by this nodal mass causes moderate left hydroureteronephrosis, unchanged since [**2195-11-26**].
Numerous mesenteric lymph nodes have moderately decreased in size, the largest of which now measures 1.2 cm in short axis.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, free fluid or free air.
The visualized arterial and venous vessels are patent including the renal arteries and veins, IVC, portal vein, splenic veins and SMV, though there is extensive portocaval adenopathy surrounding these vessels.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are large bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes measuring up to 2.4 cm in short axis, the largest inguinal lymph node measuring 1.9 cm in short axis on the left.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Extensive thoraco-abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy has decreased in size since [**2195-11-26**], particularly the retroperitoneal conglomerate nodal mass.
Left ureteral obstruction by retroperitoneal lymphomatous mass is unchanged since [**2195-11-26**].
Interval worsening of left pleural effusion with subpulmonic component since [**2196-1-1**] with decreased size of right pleural effusion and its subpulmonic component, now moderate.
No inflammatory process in the abdomen or pelvis.
No evidence of consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: This 60 yo female with CLL and prior hospitalization for fever work up was admitted for recurrent fevers, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the ER after developing hypotension, shortness of breath and requiring transient pressor support.
Fevers:  the combination of fevers and hypotension was initially concerning for sepsis so the patient was placed on broad-spectrum abx and monitored in the unit.
She was pan-cultured and a c. diff was obtained as the patient had reported loose stools prior to admission.
The patient had no evidence of colitis on CT scan and no PNA on CXR.
There was concern that a possible source for her infection could be the known left ureteral obstruction.
She was subsequently evaluated by the urology consult service who felt that this was not a likey source of infection given repeated negative cultures and UAs.
It was felt that this was not likely a complete obstruction and no aggressive intervention was warranted at this time.
This was felt to also be a possible source of her fevers.
No complications were observed and the patient's respiratory status improved markedly with no further supplemental oxygen requirement.
