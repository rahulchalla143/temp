Admission Date:  [**2143-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-7-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-10-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Reglan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11291**] Chief Complaint: headache, dysarthria, stiffness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Attempted VP shunt tap External Ventricular Drain Placed  History of Present Illness: This is a 48 year old man with hx Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, Areterio-Venous Malformation status post surgical resection, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, status post temporal lobe resection and vagus nerve stimulator placement for intractable epilepsy, s/p recent admission to neurology service for increased seizure frequency, who presents after a headache followed by dysarthria, then stiffness.
According to the patient's sister [**Name (NI) 1258**], who provides hx, pt had been in USOH until Friday ([**6-28**]) when he had grand mal seizure and went to ED at [**Hospital **] Hospital - last grand mal sz was [**5-3**], which is slightly more frequent than usual.
Following the cookout, he complained of a frontal headache ("middle of forehead") that was described as "crushing" at about 7:30 PM.
He has mild dysarthria at baseline, but this was much worse than usual.
His sister described his speech like "novacaine was in his mouth," and although the correct words were produced, his speech became increasingly unintelligible.
He was also complaining of his arms and legs feeling "stiff" and "numb" as well as having trouble swallowing.
He was taken first to [**Hospital **] hospital, where his sister also noticed that his cough sounded weak, and he was snorting a lot when he was breathing.
He also became weaker and stiffer, with posturing of the left arm "more than usual" (the left arm is weaker than the right).
He has had no nausea or vomiting recently; though he takes compazine as needed, his sister is not sure if he has required this medication in the past few days.
He has had no sick contacts; prior to admission he complained of no fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain anywhere.
He had said at [**Hospital **] Hospital that he had a cough.
At baseline he is apparently conversant, has good sense of humor, is independent (makes his own lunch, goes to work, walks with a walker, meds provided for him by grp home), speech is slightly impaired and left hemiparesis from cerebral palsy.
The patient was seen in the ED initially and this hx/exam was obtained; trial of benadryl given for possibility that this was dystonic reaction to Compazine, with no effect; pt received 1 mg ativan for coverage, as he is missing his AEDs secondary to inability to swallow.
Past Medical History: - seizure d/o - both partial complex (staring spells with head going back, left arm raised) and secondarily generalized (GTC); history of status epilepticus including sz>20 min, and episode of "unresponsiveness" when at [**Hospital **] Hospital 2 yrs ago suspicious for prolonged seizure.
- baseline sz frequency is usually 2 grand mal sz per year with LOC and vomiting/fatigue postictally; 2-3x/wk "smaller" sz with head extension back, left arm elevation lasting seconds at a time - s/p vagus nerve stimulator - mental retardation - cerebral palsy - dandy walker syndrome - chronic right eye exotropia - s/p  ventriculoperitoneal shunt - s/p AVM removal [**2127**] - s/p R temporal lobectomy - left hemiparesis and hemihypoplasia -agenesis of left cerebellum - depression -Hx left knee and hip fractures with a rod in his leg -Hx (possible) GI bleed - also periodically has coffee-grounds emesis following grand-mal sz -HTN -Prostate cancer, undergoing daily XRT 5 days/week, started on [**2143-4-3**].
No surgery or chemotherapy.
Family History: no seizures or strokes in the family.
Physical Exam: T 101.2  HR 103  BP 156/95  RR 15  100%RA General appearance: sweaty wh male HEENT: mildly dry MM Neck: rigidity (below) Heart: regular rhythm, tachycardic Lungs: coarse, slightly rhonchorous RU lung field Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs Extremities: warm, well-perfused  Mental Status: The patient is alert and attentive but cannot speak at all except for "mommm" sounds.
Motor System: There is marked rigidity in the arms, trunk, neck and legs, with hyperextension of both the arms and legs.
Neck is not deviated to one side or the other, but often writhes back and forth, and there is rigidity on passive movement of the neck.
There is no tremor or myoclonus.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
---- EEG:: Abnormal portable EEG due to the focal diminution of background voltages in the right posterior quadrant and due to the generalized slowing with absence of a normal background.
The first finding suggests an area of cortical dysfunction in the right posterior quadrant or fluid or other material interposed between the cortical surface and recording electrodes.
The rest of the record suggests an encephalopathy with a major component from medication effect.
There were no signs of ongoing seizures during this recording.
---- Please see OMR for remainder of studies  Brief Hospital Course: 48 year old man with hx Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt apparently not working per last admission (though no intervention, per NS, as shunt apparently not needed), Areterio-Venous Malformation status post surgical resection, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, status post temporal lobe resection and vagus nerve stimulator placement for intractable epilepsy, and s/p recent admission to neurology service for increased seizure frequency, who presents after a "crushing" frontal headache followed by progressive dysarthria, numbness and sensation of stiffness of the limbs, followed by progressive rigidity of all four extremities and trunk.
Finally, he lost consciousness at with increased rigidity, less spontaneous movement, and suspected seizure, treated with ativan x 6 mg and dilantin load 1.5 g.  Several aspects of his history and exam were concerning, including his fever of 101, the dysarthria and the rigidity and immobility of his limbs.
As he has a seizure history, the most likely initial explanation was a prolonged seizure, although he had never had a seizure resembling this.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome was considered, but the CPK is normal.
The fever is concerning for possible occult infectious source (as in meningitis or encephalitis)  or hemorrhage, or NMS.
There, he remained stable, but did not have any movement of his extremities or mouth.
He had LP which showed essentially normal values, including negative HSV, but did have a possibly elevated opening pressure.
At this point, the concern was for possible shunt malfunction causing increased ICP which could account for his symptoms of brainstem deficits/possible herniation.
The possibility of an isolated posterior fossa elevated presure given his abnormal anatomy was raised, but unlikely.
He then had an attempt to tap his shunt, but there was no CSF in the reservoir since it is not functional.
An EEG was done initially which showed no evidence for ongoing seizure.
He then had an MRI which showed a left sided pontine stroke with extension into the right pons as well.
This appeared to be small vessel in origin as opposed to embolic.
This was the cause of his new symptoms and fit well with his presentation.
The MRI took 1-2 days to obtain due to complication of needing to deactivate VNS before scanning him.
At this point, we continued care, but he was having some autonomic dysfunction, including tachycardia and fluctuating fevers.
It was felt the fever was either related to dilantin use or it was of central origin.
The dilantin was started in addition to all of his standing AEDs due to an episode that was either seizure or brief autonomic dysfunction.
He had no additional events here until the night of his death, when he had a seizure that was treated with ativan after he was extubated.
They were stopped after this discovery as he was afebrile then and had no WBC count.
He was seen by the stroke service who recommended aspirin and TTE, but also felt that his likelihood of recovery of function was very low, especially given his prior deficits involving the less affected left side of his body.
He initially had stridor and was given racemic epi.
It was felt that the stroke had likely caused laxity in the pharygeal muscles and this was causing relative airway collapse.
He was continued on dilantin and ativna for seizure prevention.
During this time, he had developed a fever to >105 and was tachycardic.
He was no longer tachypneic however.
Cause of death was respiratory arrest due to brainstem stroke.
