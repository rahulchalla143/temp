History of Present Illness: 77M with h/o CVA, trigeminal neuralgia, admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2157-5-15**] with weight loss and cranial nerve palsies, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2157-7-30**] with two days of malaise, fatigue, loss of appetite, gait unsteadiness, LLE rash.
The patient also reported a syncopal episode 2 weeks prior to admission.
Exam at that time showed him to be fully oriented, with no focal neuro deficits or jaundice.
Bilirubin (mostly direct) began to rise and abdominal ultrasound and CT were done [**8-2**], showing small ascites and pericholecystic fluid and no cholecystitis, which was confirmed with negative HIDA.
As part of fever workup, chest CT done which showed abnormal enlarged R axillary LN with adjacent inflammatory changes and small b/l pleural effusions.
Given pancytopenia, heme/onc consulted and were concerned for lymphoma so underwent bone marrow biopsy [**8-11**], results pending.
GI was consulted given rising LFTs and concern for autoimmune hepatitis and he underwent EGD which showed [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] dysplasia, esophageal ulcer, hemorrhagic gastritis and flex sig which was unremarkable.
Anti-mitochondrial antibiody negative.
On evening prior to transfer, rapid response was called due to expressive aphasia and RUE weakness.
STAT MRI brains howed acute/subacute infarct in R centrum semiovale area with some mild atrophy and otherwise unremarkable, which did not fit with neuro exam at the time.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] floor, he was immediately triggered for AMS and tachycardia to the 140s and was transferred to the ICU.
EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] showed rectal ulcers and Barrett's mucosa.
CT torso showed no evidence of malignancy at that time.
Past Medical History: h/o CVA [**2139**] with no residual deficits trigeminal neuralgia rectal ulcer Barrett's esophagus bilateral cataract surgery [**2152**] squamous cell skin CA (ear) BPH- PSA 2.04 in [**2157-1-13**] hypercholesterolemia Recent DVT/pulmonary embolism ([**3-27**]), on coumadin left schwannoma/meningioma ?heterozygous Factor V  Social History: Lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 8545**].
Family History: Sister has [**Last Name **] problem Sister with Bell's palsy Brother is 83 and healthy Mother had heart disease Father died from pneumonia No family history of malignancy   Physical Exam: Upon admission: General: Somnolent but arousable, oriented to person and [**Hospital 86**] hospital, no acute distress HEENT: Sclerae icteric, MM very dry, dried blood in posterior OP, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Fast but regular, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops  Lungs: Diminished BS at R base, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-distended, hypoactive bowel sounds present, +hepatomegaly, +RUQ TTP, no rebound/guarding GU: foley with dark amber urine Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: R sided facial droop, tongue midline, PERRL, EOMI, unable to further test CN.
No clear asterixis.
There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotid arteries with mild narrowing of the distal branches intracranially, possibly related with atherosclerotic disease and more significant on the right middle cerebral artery.
The neck vessels demonstrate mild bilateral narrowing of the cervical carotid bifurcations, correlation with carotid ultrasound is recommended if clinically warranted.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, more significant from C2-C3 through C5-C6 levels.
No focal or diffuse lesions are noted throughout the cervical spinal cord to indicate spinal cord edema or cord expansion.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are partially layering on this semi-upright radiograph and are accompanied basilar atelectasis, worse on the left than the right.
Small abdominal ascites and right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male with previous CVA, recent admission for CN palsy and weight loss with unrevealing initial workup who was transferred from OSH after presenting with fever and malaise found to now have rising bilirubin, [**Last Name (un) **], and recent CVA with residual neurologic deficits.
During his time at [**Hospital1 18**], he was found to have right sided weakness and a right facial droop.
His neurologic status progressively declined over his course to a severe clinical encephalopathy.
His liver failure also progressed during his stay.
His acute renal failure followed his liver failure and was thought to be secondary to this process.
Based on the pattern of his LFT's, his pancytopenia, his lymphadenopathy, and hiw weight loss, this was thought to be most likely be a malignant infiltrative process with rapid progression.
