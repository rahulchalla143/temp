Argon Laser GI study  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 67387**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for MDS, prostate CA s/p XRT complicated by radiation proctitis and repeated LGIB, and CAD s/p PCI with [**Hospital 18692**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BRBPR and hypotension.
Of note, the patient has a history of prior LGIB secondary to radiation proctitis, most recently in 11/[**2153**].
He was also admitted at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**11/2151**] for BRBPR and was transfused and also received a colonscopy.
Currently, he denies any pain with defecation, CP, worsened SOB above baseline, dysuria, hematuria, emesis, HA, palpitations.
Patient endorses having felt orthostatic this morning.
ROS: + nausea, dyspnea on exertion.
Sycopal epsidoe 2 weeks ago, found to have low hct requiring 7 units PRBCs.
Past Medical History: - Prostate CA s/p lupron and XRT complicated by radiation proctitis - LGIB: [**11/2152**], [**11/2151**] requiring transfusions secondary to radiation proctitis - MDS: 2 units PRBC transfusion requirement weekly.
Bone marrow bx confirmed in [**9-2**] - CAD s/p PCI with BMS in [**11/2152**]   Social History: EtOH - 2 glasses of wine/night.
CV: Nl S1+S2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTAB Abd: S/NT/ND +bs Ext: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally Neuro: AOx3.
Low limb lead voltage.
Imaging  CXR ([**2153-8-6**]): Interstitial pulmonary abnormality largely localized to the right lung base.
Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable and left pleural effusion is small.
Left infrahilar opacification could be atelectasis.
There is a suggestion of a small hiatus hernia.
Configuration of the trachea and absent vasculature in the upper lungs could be due to emphysema.
Whether the basal lung abnormalities are due to edema in the setting of emphysema will require subsequent followup.
It revealed a large clot in the rectum adjacent to diffuse ulcerated mucosa in the distal rectum with several areas of mild oozing of blood from the surface and one area that is spurting blood, 2 cm above the anorectal junction.
Attempts to clip this x 3 were unsuccessful because of the stiffness of the rectal wall and friability of the mucosa.
On [**2153-8-8**], GI conducted argon coagulation of known bleeding lesions from radiation proctitis (a 2 cm lesion in the distal rectum consistent with radiation injury).
However, he remained asymptomatic and he had 2 brown bowel movements without further bleeding.
[**Name (NI) **] understood the risk for leaving.
He has transfusion dependent MDS and he will get transfusion tomorrow at his local hospital.
Discharge Instructions: You had severe acute blood loss anemia related to radiation proctitis.
You had blood transfusions and sigmoidoscopy with [**Doctor Last Name 67388**] coagulation of the rectal ulcer ( site of bleeding from radiation proctitis).
