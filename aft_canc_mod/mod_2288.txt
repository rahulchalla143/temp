While in hospital patient with pericardial effusion s/p pericardiacentesis [**2158-10-27**], plueral effusions s/p thoracentesis x 2 most recent on [**2157-11-16**], MRSA bacteremia, GI bleed, increased LFTs.
Most recenlty patient noted to have increased tacypnea on [**11-15**] and episode of choking/vomiting while drinking.
Patient was started on cefepime/flagyl to cover for possible aspiration PNA.
CXR showed increase pleural effusion and patient underwent thoracentesis on [**2158-11-16**].
On day of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] patient was found to be in respiratory distress O2 sat low 80s and intubated.
The ddx for his worsening respiratory status was worsening PNA, new aspiration PNA, or PE.
Post-thoracentesis CT showed remaining large effusion and infiltrates.
Consideration given to bedside pericardiocentesis due to recent evidence of pericardial effusion on TTE; however, pt remained in VF and asystole, and was deferred.
CCU Course: On DOA, patient was found to have a pericardial effusion on CT scan and a TTE was suggestive of tamponade.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION - Etiology likely underlying Malignancy - On acceptance to the CCU, patient had pulsus [**2-28**] mmHg; JVP elevated at 9 cm .
- On HOD#2, patient was taken to cath lab and thre was no evidence of tamponade physiology -> hence a pericardiocentesis was not done.
- HR had been in sinus rhythm with occasional tachycardia on Tele.
- Since patient had no other urgent cardiac issues, he was transferred back to the [**Month/Day (1) 3242**] team.
# DYSPNEA - Etioplogy thought to be combination of bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion/echocardiographic tamponade - post procedure, no complaints of dyspnea - considered thoracentesis for diagnostic/therapeutic purposes .
# DIARRHEA - Etiology unclear; was investigated by [**Month/Day (1) 3242**] service.
# FEVERS: - Concerning for infection - CXR without evidence of PNA, with B/L effusions - f/u stool cultures and blood cultures - F/u UA/UCx - PICC without clinical signs of infection .
# AML - [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] followed - Continude Acyclovir/Levoquin/Ursodiol/Cyclosporine/ Diflucan/Prednisone - Monitored lytes - Allogenic transplant precautions - Monitored fever curve and CIS .
[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] course: 31y/o man w/ AML s/p his second allo-SCT who presented w/ one week of diarrhea and fevers.
Pt subsequently had new oxygen requirement, was found to have signs of tamponade by echo, and was transferred to the CCU.
Pt subsequently had episode of hypotension, accompanied by fever and continued R leg pain.
Pt then had acute episode of SOB of unclear etiology, and was intubated and transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation.
#) Episode of hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis, given positive blood cx's and fever.
Possible sources included PICC, R leg, or GI tract.
Pt subsequently grew MRSA from blood, which was treated with daptomycin.
Ortho was consulted, and leg pain improved with brace and ROM exercises.
- cefepime and daptomycin were started (pt has PCN and Vanc allergy), given new fevers and decreased BP - stat portable CXR shows increased size of R pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax that could be causing hypotension - repeat echo did not show endocarditis or signs of tamponade .
#) Diarrhea: Pt presented with voluminous diarrhea, thought likely due to GVH.
Pt had hx significant for GVH.
- abd CT scan showed edema/inflammation of the entire colon, and involvement of [**11-27**] of the ileum.
Likely consistent with infection (per radiology, would be atypical for GVH).
- crypto and microsporidia were negative - stool O&P was negative - C.dif toxin B was negative - C.diff negative x 3 - pt had one day of levo/flagyl on admission, subsequently d/c'd as pt was afebrile.
flagyl re-started for 2 wk course of empiric therapy for C.dif, given radiologic findings and GI recommendations.
- pt was also treated with solumedrol and cyclosporine for presumed GVH - weekly CMV viral loads were negative - pt tolerated clear liquids with occasional toast, with only minimal diarrhea.
#) Fevers: Pt was afebrile during most of the admission,then spiked a fever accompanied by episode of hypotension.
- cxr demonstrated BL effusions w/o evidence of infection, L pleural fluid from prior thoracentesis demonstrates transudative process.
- picc site was tender, and PICC was subsequently pulled .
- acyclovir/CSA were continued - continude ursodiol (was being held [**12-28**] difficulty taking pills) - allogenic x-plant precautions - monitored fever curve .
#) SOB: Pt had been having increasing oxygen requirement, and had acute episode of SOB prior to transfer to CCU.
Chest CT showed large pericardial effusion, and BL pleural effusions.
Subsequent CT's showed decreasing size of pericardial effusions.
- pt underwent multiple thoracenteses during the admission, and 1 L serosanguinous fluid was removed each time - per pulm recs, both pleurodesis and pleurex were considered - CXR showed rapid reaccumulation of pleural effusions - pericardial effusion decreased in size according to last chest CT .
#) HTN: pt had been hypertensive during the admission (with BP 140's/110's).
Unclear if pt has hx of htn (he says he was on metoprolol for "irregular heart rhythm.").
Also unclear etiology of decreased pulse pressure (?
HTN possibly secondary to cyclosporine.
- metoprolol 25mg tid was given, with increased dose to 50 tid - nifedipine 10mg tid switched to nifedipine 30mg CR qd, and nifedipine then held in setting of hypotension .
#) Thrombocytopenia: Pt had decreased platelets from 100 to 50 overnight during stay in CCU (he had been started on Hep SC for ppx).
Several schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
- HIT Ab was negative - decreased platelets also might be secondary to flagyl (however continued flagyl given possible infectious colitis, and pt's intolerance of vanco) - towards the end of the admission, there was more concern for TTP given pt's rising LDH, decreasing platelets, and worsening mental status.
Stopping the pt's cyclosporine was considered, however the CSA was continued because pt was believed to be at risk for worsening GVH.
#) Elevated LFT's/bili/LDH: Concerning for liver GVH vs. VOD.
Possibly due to liver GVH vs. pulmonary process (pt had known pleural and pericardial effusions).
TTP also a possibility given decreased platelets.
- pleural fluid LDH much less than serum LDH, suggesting liver or hemolytic source of elevated serum LDH - RUQ u/s was negative for clot - bili peaked at about 4.3, then began to stabilize around 3 - fluconazole was held secondary to rising bili .
#) Edema: Pt had significant LE edema, likely secondary to low albumin, GVH, and high volume needed for antibiotics and TPN.
- avoided aggressive diuresis given concern for tamponade and sepsis .
This was subsequently switched back to NPO as pt's mental status deteriorated, given concern for aspiration.
