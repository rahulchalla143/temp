[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1569**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11006**] Approved: TUE [**2196-2-16**] 5:52 PM  Provisional Findings Impression: JXRl TUE [**2196-2-9**] 6:02 PM Findings concerning for right frontal infarct with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation (2:24-25).
FINDINGS: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation associated with a subtle region of hypodensity within the right frontal lobe near the vertex (2:24-25), new in comparison to CT [**2196-2-2**], is concerning for relatively acute infarction.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Post-operative changes of the right temporal lobe, with apparent right temporal resection and overlying right temporal bone craniotomy are unchanged.
Bones are otherwise unremarkable without lesions suspicious for metastases.
Findings concerning for relavtively acute right frontovertex infarct.
Unchanged findings of right temporal lobe resection.
Findings can be further evaluated with MRI if clinically indicated.
She was taken directly to the operating room where she underwent a redo-sternotomy with an aortic valve replacement as well as an ascending aorta and hemi-arch replacement.
She was noted to be in complete heart block and was paced with epicardial pacing.
She was quite slow to wean from sedation and focal facial seizures were noted.
The CT scan was inconclusive and an MRI was recommended but unable due to epicardial wires.
An EEG was performed which was abnormal suggesting a widespread encephalopathy or a metabolic anoxic or postictal etiology.
A video EEG was performed which did not show any seizure activity but did show a markedly encephalopathic background.
Keppra was continued for control of seizure activity.
The cardiology service was consulted for her complete heart block.
The neurology service felt that all her symptoms were consistent with a brainstem infarct.
She continued with left sided weakness however physical and occupational therapy were consulted to work with her for range of motion activity.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 97236**] developed a fever and was pancultured.
Her sputum culture revealed serratia marcescens and ceftriaxone was started.
She continued to improve from a neurological standpoint however remained with no spontaneous left sided movement.
She underwent repeat CT scan that had findings concerning for relavtively acute right frontovertex infarct.
A permanent pacemaker insertion and cardioversion on post operative day fourteen.
She was started on coumadin and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
