No evidence of right middle lobe torsion.
Postoperative changes in the right hemithorax, including nonhemorrhagic layering pleural fluid, additional fluid interposed between the superior segments of the right lower lobe and the mediastinum, and a small right apical pneumothorax.
Moderate emphysema.
The right mid lung opacity representing an unresolved collapsed right middle lobe is unchanged.
There are no new opacities which are of concern.
Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
[**2172-11-15**] CXR : Overall appearance of the chest is stable with minimal residual subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral soft tissues.
A tiny amount of residual air within the surgical bed at the right apex in this patient status post right upper lobectomy.
No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.
No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.
Slight nodularity of the right lateral pleura particularly at the base is likely postoperative in etiology.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient had an epidural with good effect but with some hypotension and adequate pain control.
Pulmonary: The patient was initially stable from a pulmonary point of view post-op.
His post-op CXR showed RML collapse but aerated RLL.
A CXR was obtained and showed RML as well as RLL collapse.
He was transferred to the SICU on [**2172-11-8**] to undergo a bronchoscopy with BAL, which was sent for studies.
He was switched to PO augmentin once tolerating PO and due to a rising Cr.
Cultures only showed respiratory flora but a 10d course of antibiotics was planned.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge on [**2172-11-16**] , he was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
