He notes increased fatigue and shortness of breath this am.
Since [**5-5**] pt has had an increased WBC count and bilateral pleural effusions.
He was treated in [**Month (only) 205**]-[**Month (only) 216**]-[**Month (only) 359**] with Pentostatin which initially controlled his wbc count, however, recently his WBC count has increased to over 600K requiring 3 sessions of leukophoresis to date.
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt noted to be SOB with RA O2 sat of 75%, improved to 95% on a NRB.
CT Chest revealed large right-sided pleural effusion with near total collapse of RLL and partial collapse of RML, Smaller left-sided pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
Past Medical History: - T cell leukemia with flow cytometry compatible with a pro lymphocytic leukemia; morphology and performance looks more like chronic lymphocytic leukemia - h/o left sided chest wall melanoma recently resected w/out apparent metastases (Nodal dissections not carried out; Metastatic work up negative to date) - diabetes - h/o right knee arthritis   Social History: Denies current tob or illicit drug use.

[**10-25**] FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT: INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by:  A T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, CD4 positive, with aberrant loss of pan-T marker CD3.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Large right-sided pleural effusion with near total collapse of the RLL and partial collapse of the RML.
Smaller left-sided pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
Tiny hypodense lesion in the liver is incompletely evaluated.
CXR [**2137-10-26**]: Cardiomegaly, Bilateral pleural effusions (R>L) with hazy parenchymal opacity over the right mid lung zone.
Development of small amount of ascites seen adjacent to the liver and spleen.
There is some fascia plane thickening present surrounding the sigmoid colon.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction present.
CXR (s/p first thoracentesis) [**2137-10-24**]:  No PTX, improvement in right pleural fluid .
ECG:  NSR, rate 98, nl intervals, nl axis, no ST-T changes .
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion is reaccumulating.
Small left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis are stable.
No pneumothorax.
[**11-1**] CXR (s/p second thoracentesis): IMPRESSION: Decrease in right pleural effusion following thoracentesis with no evidence of pneumothorax.
**FINAL REPORT [**2137-10-30**]**     AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2137-10-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2137-10-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2137-10-24**] 11:00 pm PLEURAL FLUID     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2137-10-25**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2137-10-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2137-10-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2137-10-25**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with T-cell positive CLL s/p leukophoresis x3 at NEBH, h/o melenoma, and DM who presented with WBC count of 678 requiring emergent leukophoresis, and hypoxia secondary to pleural effusions.
#) Leukocytosis (600K) secondary to T-cell positive CLL:  Pt had a leukophoresis catheter placed in his right groin by surgery.
His WBC count decreased to 216.6 on the day of discharge, and he did not have any signs of tumor lysis syndrome.
Pt's pleural fluid was negative for infection, fluid WBC count was elevated, and cytology was c/w low grade lymphoma.
Pt was continued on allopurinol, although at a lower dose given elevated creatinine on admission.
Pt was instructed to follow up with his oncologist immediatley after discharge to discuss the possible administration of neupogen or nulasta.
#)  Hypoxia: Pt was satting in 70's upon arrival to the ED, likely secondary to large right sided pleural effusion and leukostasis.
Pt underwent a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis in the ED (fluid non-infectious, but malignant), and then had reaccumulation of the R sided fluid seen on CXR over the next several days.
CXR the day before d/c did not show a pneumothorax s/p thoracentesis.
#)  Acute Renal Failure, Cr 1.7 on admission (baseline Creat 0.9): Was likely secondary to leukostasis.
#)  Anemia/Thrombocytopenia related to CLL and chemo:  Pt has received procrit with Pentostatin in the past.
You had chemotherapy with cytoxan and fludarabine during the admission, and you might need a shot of Neupogen or Neulasta on Monday.
