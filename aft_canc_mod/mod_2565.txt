BOOP but never had a biopsy, who was innitially admitted to the OSH for presumed PNA with symptoms of right sided pleuritic chest pain of several days duration.
The patient was r/o for PE with chest CTA.
Then on HD #7 developed tonic-clonic seizure.
Head CT was subsequently done and revealed left chronic subdural hematoma with 5 mm left to right shift.
The patient was loaded with dilantin and then transferred to the BIBMC for further management of her subdural hematoma.
The patient declined to undergo evacuation of her subdural hematoma.
She had had no further seiuzure activity.
She developed respiratory distress RR in 30-40's with new increased oxygen requirements (requiring 50-70% VM).
Follicular lymphoma diagnosed [**2164**], s/p BMT [**2168**], has been in remission since    Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (oncologist) 2.
BOOP but never had biopsy    Was started on Prednisone 20 mg po qd but it was d/c'd after      2 weeks b/o hyperglycemia 3.
DM (diagnosed in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year) 4.

Head CT: Moderate to left chronic left subdural hematoma with mild mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere, with no appreciable shift of the midline structures.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yr old female with complicated PMH including follicular lymphoma s/p BMT, BOOP?/recurrent pneumonias, chronic thrombocytopenia admitted with PNA and found to have subdural hematoma.
Pulmonary opacities/ pleural effusions - PNA vs. BOOP (no biopsy or bronchospcopy in the past), effusion differential was broad with h/o malignancy, pneumonia (.
Pt intubated electively after much discussion and informed consent, in order to investigate by bronchoscopy for a reversible cause of her SOB with the understanding that if nothing was discovered that she would  be comfort measures only and extubated.
While preparing for elective intubation, pt became progressively more short of breath and became distressed.
Bronchoscopy did not demonstrate a pneumonia nor mass.
Thrombocytopenia - History of TCP since bone marrow transplant for lymphoma treatment many years ago per primary physcian.
Seizure - no further seizures during hospitalization here at [**Hospital1 18**].
Prior seizure likely secondary to SDH (although appears chronic) or electrolyte imbalances.
Subdural Hematoma:  pt transferred her for further managment of SDH discovered at OSH after seizure, however after discussion with neurosurgery pt decided to decline any intervention.
