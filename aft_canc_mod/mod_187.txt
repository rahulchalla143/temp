She has been having so much trouble breathing that she has been unable to eat or drink for the past few days to a week; this prompted her to call 911 this am.
They were unaware of any weight loss.
In the ED, she was found to be in respiratory distress and quite hypoxic.
She was found to have a large breast mass and decreased breath sounds on the right on exam.
In the setting of intubation, she became hypotensive to the 60s.
They did not recommend any heparin or cardiac catheritization, but recommended cycling CE, EKGs and an ECHO if she remains unstable.
CT torso shows a complex, likely malignant effusion, lung mass and breast mass;  In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] urgent femoral line was placed, which was not done under completely sterile conditions.
For hyperkalemia she was given Insulin D50, Calcium chloride.

ADDENDUM: FISH assay for HER-2/neu gene amplification was performed by US LABS, [**Street Address(2) 7630**], [**Location (un) 7631**], [**Numeric Identifier 7632**]: Result:  NOT AMPLIFIED Estrogen Receptor: Interpretation:  Positive (>1% of tumor cells positive) Progesterone Receptor: Interpretation:  Positive (>1% of tumor cells positive)  CXR [**2160-3-22**]: Right middle and lower lobe consolidation with associated moderate effusion.
Mild interstitial edema.
CT head w/o contrast [**2160-3-22**]: Multiple areas of small hypodensities in the brain could represent small intracranial metastases.
Findings consistent with right sided advanced breast cancer with metastases to both axillae, lung, bilateral adrenal glands and possibly liver.
Moderately large right pleural effusion is intermediate in density.
CT findings suggest right heart strain with enlargement of the right ventricle with obliteration of the right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
This examination was not intended for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is at least mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pulmonary embolism or evidence for extrinsic pulmonary artery compression.
The main pulmonary artery; however, is top normal in size, suggestive of mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Decreased right-sided pleural effusion.
Enlarged left pleural effusion.
Progression of right lower, and right middle lobe pneumonia.
Both these findings should be re-evaluated when patient improves to evaluate for potential metastatic disease to the bronchi and lungs.
7mm focus of enhancement over the right frontal extra-axial convexity may represent artefactual venous enhancement.
Tiny meningioma or a dural based metastasis is not ruled out.
No evidence of intra-axial metastatic disease.
Microangiopathic small vessel disease  KUB [**2160-4-1**]: IMPRESSION: Non-specific air-filled loops of large bowel.
No definitive signs of obstruction.
Right shoulder x-ray [**2160-4-7**]: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the right shoulder demonstrates no gross abnormality.
CXR [**2160-4-17**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural effusions have minimally increased in extent.
The subsequent areas of mild retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.
Minimal interstitial fluid overload.
No other abnormalities have appeared in the interval.
Pleural fluid [**2160-4-9**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**2159-3-23**] 7:23 - NSR 64, RAD resolution of STE in V3 & V5, still present in V4, and slight elevation in III & ?

Brief Hospital Course: 52 y/o F with history of DM on insulin and HTN who presented with SOB and developed respiratory failure thought [**3-5**] pleural effusion and widely metastatic breast malignancy.
# Respiratory failure, hypercarbic: Pt required intubation upon arrival to ED given hypoxia and tachypnea.
Respiratory failure was most likely [**3-5**] to large effusions and extensive malignant involvment of lungs.
She had no culture growth.
IP was consulted and 800cc of transudative pleural fluid were drained from the right chest, fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells, pleurex catheter was left in place.
She was extubated briefly but then re-intubated for worsening hypercapnea and increased work of breathing, likely due to increased dead space and mucus plugging.
It was felt that fluid retention was contributing to the patient's poor repsiratory status and inability to wean off ventilation.
She had weakness that led to hypercarbia and severely elevated bicarbonate, which could have been [**3-5**] contraction alkalosis and hypoventilation 2/2 pleural effusions.
Pleural effusion reaccumulated in the interim, requiring another pigtail catheter that drained initially 2L daily.
Repeat chest xray showed minimal reaccumulation of pleural effusion by time of discharge and IP inserted pleurex catheter on day prior to discharge for further drainage.
Her pleural effusions and LE edema were attributed largely to CHF and improved with diuresis.
Hypercarbia resolved by time of discharge and bicarb levels were normal.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Records from OSH showed that right breast biopsy showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor grade II/III, in 5 of 6 biopsies.
She was found to be estrogen/progesterone receptor positive at that time.
# Blood pressure instability: Pt became hyoptensive to systolic 60s following intubation, requiring pressors in the ICU.
Cause not entirely clear, likely pre-load dependent d/t right sided failure [**3-5**] to malignancy related pulmonary hypertension.
Echo and CTA chest shows mild RV dilation and hypokinesis and mild to moderate PAH (likely [**3-5**] to malignant infiltration), but no indication to stent PA.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with normal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test.
Patient had episodes of bradycardia followed by hypertension with SBPs in low 200s, thought to be response to Levophed, so it was DC?????
Of note, pt does have history of HTN and was on diovan-HCTZ and diltiazem prior to admission.
# Cardiac ischemia (resolving)/1st degree AV block: On [**3-25**] pt had episode of rapidly reversing ST elevations in course of 5 mins that were consistent with possibly thrombo-embolic phenomenon.
Resolved quickly with tx of hypotension and hypoxia.
On [**3-25**], had episode of chest discomfort with 4.7sec pause on telemetry.
Agreed that patient has 1st degree heart block, but thought the pause was unrelated to chest pain and was result of PVC causing reset.
She had another episode of chest pain on [**2160-4-14**].
Described the pain as right sided, near her breast mass, and was tender on palpation of epigastrium towards the right.
EKG showed ST elevation in V2 and nonspecific TWIs; trop was 0.03 and downtrended to 0.02.
She reported no further chest discomfort for remainder of hospital stay.
BiPAP), became frustrated at blood draws and other procedures, and refused discharge to rehab as recommended by PT.
