Denies abdominal pain, fever, chills, N/V, cough, rash, dysuria, sick contacts, or recent travel.
No recent medication changes, no antibiotics recently.
H/o similar diarrhea in the past which he says was due to chemo.
In the ED, patient's lactate was initially 4.0 and he was tachycardic at 110.
Rectal metastatic adenocarcinoma with A lytic lesion in T11 dx in [**2120-3-22**], CEA was elevated at 329--->1207 ([**2120-8-20**]).

Since his admission, the patient's diarrhea and fevers had progressively improved on cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole as well as Lomotil.
On [**10-12**], he was noted to be hypoxemic and had chest x-ray showing only a distended stomach and a CTA with no PE (but also a distended stomach and known liver mets).
His hypoxemia persisted and the patient became increasingly tired, confused, and tachypneic.
In this setting, he denied pain (including abdominal) as well as dyspnea despite obvious tachypnea and mild accessory muscle use.
In the ICU he was found to have guiaic positive NGT secretions.
He was transfused PRBCs for a dropping HCT.
In addition he was noted to have an elevated INR for which he was treated with FFP.
He was evaluated by surgery who felt him to be a poor surgical candidate.
For his confusion a CT of his head was performed which was negative for bleed or other change.
His hypoxia resolved and was felt to be due to aspiration initially.
He was treated with TPN given his poor nutritional status.
He was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with no improvement.
# GI: Diarrhea was believed to be chemo-induced diarrhea.
The patient was covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl given neutropenic fever.
However, patient became acidotic and CT abdomen was repeated and revealed SBO.
Patient denied any abdominal pain.
However, while in the ICU he developed bloody stools in the setting of coagulopathy.
This was felt to be likely secondary to his rectal cancer.
After several bloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel movements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit was stable.
Coagulopathy: Likely DIC secondary to cancer.
# NEUTROPENIC FEVER: The patient was started on cefepime, vanco, and flagyl on admission.
He had some fevers early in his hospitalization but remained afebrile for the rest of his admission.
By the 11th day of his antibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic.
# AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: concerning for lactic acidosis [**1-24**] to hypovolemia.
Then the patient continued to have non-anion gap acidosis [**1-24**] to diarrhea.
In the ICU it was discoved that he had an extremely dilated stomach and SBO.
It was felt that the lactic acidosis ,may have been secondary to the extreme distension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactate on decompression with NGT.
He also developed what is believed to be lower GI bleed, SBO and DIC during admission all which were thaough to be related to his metastatic disease.
Due to his poor prognosis and worsening medical condition a family meeting was held and the family and patient agreed that comfort was the most important goal at this point.
He was continued on IVF and the NGGT was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his SBO.
FEN: Patient was actively hydrated in the setting of diarrhea and acidosis.
Given his poor prognosis and that comfort was the goal, he was not started on TPN, but rather hydrated with IVF in the setting of SBO.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic rectal cancer.
