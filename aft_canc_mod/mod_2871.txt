Admission Date: [**2179-4-13**]        Discharge Date: [**2179-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-1-2**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY:  The patient is a 78-year-old male who on admission looked younger than his stated age and presented for surgical evaluation of a sigmoid polyp.
The patient had been previously seen in the office by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] who counseled the patient that he had a sigmoid polyp with adenocarcinoma arising in an adenoma growing on a stalk.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] recommended that he had a 12 percent possibility of having nodal metastases from this adenocarcinoma.
He also recounted that he had a history of a number of months, including several admissions to [**Hospital3 1196**] for GI bleeding at which time at one point he required 6 units of packed red blood cells which finally became quiescent.
The  colonoscopy was finally done on [**2179-2-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who found several polyps which he resected and 1 mid sigmoid which was clipped at 40 cm appeared to have a cancer in the stalk and a pathological examination did prove this to be the case.
He had, had obstructive symptoms previously and diverticulosis of the colon.
The descending, transverse, and ascending colon, and the 3 cm polyp, the one that was deemed to have malignancy in it by pathology was deemed suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Therefore the patient was counseled to have a colectomy.
The patient had no known drug allergies.
His past medical history also as above included, besides his gastrointestinal history, included a history of C. Difficile.
The patient has had no previous operations.
The patient denied a history of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease, asthma, or radiation therapy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] did not recount hearing bruits and he did feel the thyroid slightly, but no abnormal nodules were noted.
A2 was greater than P2, but there were no murmurs appreciated.
IMPRESSION:  Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] impression at the time of his office evaluation was carcinoma of the sigmoid colon, residual carcinoma, following polypectomy with a return, he would be admitted to hospital for sigmoid resection.
On [**4-13**], the patient was in the preoperative holding area and was identified and he had also recently been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He was awake, no acute distress, His abdomen was soft and nontender.
On postoperative day #2, there was no untoward events.
He was in no acute distress.
Their assessment was that the patient was a 78-year-old status post sigmoid colectomy who presented, that he was doing well, was ambulating, and needed follow up for transfer training and functional mobility and improved endurance.
On [**4-15**], the urologic team came by because the patient had hematuria that had been noted in the operating room, but had not resolved.
The patient was without urinary symptoms.
His abdomen was described as soft with a clean dressing and there was no suprapubic tenderness.
His lower extremities were warm and no edema.
CT from [**4-9**] was reviewed by them which showed multiple simple renal cysts.
Nontender abdominal examination.
He was having difficulty breathing.
The events that were encountered on [**4-18**], was that approximately at 3:00 p.m. the patient had a large loose stool times two, was complaining of increased abdominal pain and cramping.
His heart rate had gone up to 110 and at 5:00 p.m. he had another large loose stool and had reported increased weakness, increased shortness of breath, and his respiratory rate increased to approximately 40 and his heart rate to the 120s.
The patient was afebrile at the time of the event 97.1,  heart rate 120 though.
The patient was assessed by the chief resident and due to respiratory distress the patient was intubated with the help of anesthesia staff.
There was no pneumothorax.
There was concern for sepsis versus a potential pulmonary emboli, also vascular surgery was notified and an ultrasound was performed because there was a known history of a AAA.
There was concern for potential rupture, as for Vascular Surgery was notified and discussion undertaken about the possibility.
Vascular Surgery consult was attained and their assessment was low likelihood for ruptured AAA given stable hematocrit, acidosis, and septic etiology.
There was concern for ischemia or infarction or another possible intra-abdominal process abscess such as leak.
Cardiology came and saw the patient, because the patient had acutely developed tachycardia, respiratory distress, and had continued to be hypotensive despite Levophed with blood pressure 73/88 in the ICU on pressor medications.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**], the attending surgery staff, evaluated the patient, gathered all the appropriate information and realized the patient was on pressors and his abdomen was distended and he had guarding and rebound and he wrote that barring some other septic foci which is not apparent at this time, it was likely that an anastomotic leak was the cause and recommended emergent exploration.
On [**2179-4-19**], the patient was taken to the operating room for an acute abdomen and sepsis.
Postoperative diagnosis was anastomotic disruption and fecal peritonitis.
The patient is making minimal urine output.
Assessment was that the patient was in septic shock and was being aggressively volume resuscitated.
A right subclavian Cordis catheter was placed with Seldinger technique without difficulty.
No pneumothorax after chest x-ray.
Preoperative diagnosis and anastomotic leakage with sepsis an open abdomen.
Postoperative diagnosis was  anastomotic lesion, with sepsis, open abdomen with a necrotic ascending colon and patchy ischemia of the small bowel.
On [**2179-4-20**], at 3:00 p.m. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] had a discussion with family about DNR/DNI status and it was agreed upon that the patient would not be shocked or have chest compressions.
He described him as oliguric, renal failure, and increasingly having a need for fluid requirement with a lactic acidosis.
The patient continued to deteriorate from a septic shock due  to the leak from his anastomosis characterized by overwhelming sepsis, metabolic lactic acidosis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and the patient's metabolic acidosis could no longer be compensated despite bicarb drips and boluses.
