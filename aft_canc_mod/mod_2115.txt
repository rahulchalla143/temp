), CHF (?diastolic v. right sided from PAH/pulm stenosis), moderate pulm artery HTN based on echo, pulmonic stenosis, A-fib who was recently diagnosed with CML, not started on treatment yet, who was transferred to [**Hospital 18**] medical floor on evening of [**5-28**] for further managment of osteomylitis.
He was noted to be volume overloaded and given his respiratory distress he was given lasix.

[**Name2 (NI) **] dyscrasia Heart disease in unspecificed family members.
Evidence of cortical destruction and loss at the fifth metatarsal head and neck on the right, either due to osteomyelitis or prior debridement.
Faint lucency through navicular on the right of uncertain significance.
Some loss of morphology of the right calcaneus is seen, but no frank cortical destruction.
Probable left fifth metatarsal base fracture.
Area of relative lucency and cortical ill definition at the medial aspect of the left fifth metatarsal head may represent an area of cortical destruction due to osteomyelitis, although the appearance is nonspecific.
PATHOLOGY BONE BIOPSY 5th METATARSAL HEAD: Bone, right fifth metatarsal head (A):Regenerative bone and fibrous tissue with focal acute inflammation, consistent with ulcer bed; no acute osteomyelitis seen.
Small juxta-trabecular lymphoid aggregate.
Large left and small right pleural effusions with question of loculation superiorly, as before, though this come be from chronic pleural scar.
Interstitial thickening consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Mild-to-moderate ascites around the liver and tracking into the pelvis.
Diffuse anasarca, consistent with third spacing.
No evidence of acute bowel abnormality.
No hemoperitoneum or pneumoperitoneum to suggest splenic rupture or bowel perforation.
Extensive coronary artery atherosclerotic calcification.
Enteric tube sideport situated above GE junction; advance for standard positioning.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The anterior septum appears hypokinetic.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is moderate pulmonic valve stenosis.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-5-30**], no obvious change but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
56 yo M with PMH of CHF, PVD, recent dx osteomyelitis on linezolid and irtepenem, newly dx'ed CML, pulmonic stenosis, CAD and DM was transferred from an OSH for further management of CML.
He was initially admitted to the floor and found to have a white [**Date range (3) **] cell count of 280,000.
He triggered for hypoxia and delirium several hours after admission and was transfered to the ICU.
He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and delirium both thought to be [**12-31**] leukostasis.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary leukostasis.
Also ulitmately from pulmonary edema and ventilator associated pneumonia.
Also received significant hydration in setting of uric acid of 14 and systemic chemotherapy.
Became massively fluid overloaded requiring ultrafiltration intermittently.
Spiked fevers and was bronched which showed LLL PNA.
Stenotrophomonas grew from his sputum but thought to be a colonizer as was clinially improving not on bactrim.
With initiation of dialysis / ultrafiltration and aggressive fluid removal he was able to be weaned to trach mask.
# Leukemia:  Had been newly diagnosed CML prior to admission.
Bone marrow biopsy was not adeuate for further cytogenetics but was also bcr-abl positive, consistent with accelerated CML, and he was continued on above treatment.
Plan would be to restart if platelet counts become >150,000 or if white cell count increases.
# Acute Renal Failure:  The acute on chronic renal insufficiency was thought to be secondary to uric acid nephropathy.
He underwent ultrafiltration with volume removal.
The renal failure was initially non-oliguric and he was started on diuretics.
He underwent placement of a tunneled line and was started on alternating hemodialysis and ultrafiltration for fluid removal.
# Ventilator acquired Pneumonia:  Spiked fever and was bronched showing LLL PNA.
# Hypotension:  Was intermittently hypotensive requiring pressor suppor which correlated to need for sedation and pain control as had siginficant pain.
# Fever: Patient developed fever while intubated and was treated with abx as above.
Also treated with micafungin for several days given he had significnat skin breakdown from anasarca and concern for fungal infection.
This was stopped once bronch showed LLL PNA thought to be source of fever.
# Osteomyelitis:  Diagnosed as OSH several days prior to transfer with culture growing MRSA, VRE, and multiply resistant Proteus.
Podiatry was consulted and took a bone swab which grew out nothing.
Ultimately treated with daptomycin (changed from linezolid due to concern for marrow suppression) and cefepime (also covering for VAP in presence of purulent sputum on bronch) for a total of 6 weeks, last dose planned for [**2177-7-8**].
#Ventricular tachycardia: He developed asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
This was most likely due to ketamine, which he was on for pain control.
# Anemia:  Initially thought to be secondary to chronic illness, chemotherapy.
Developed acute [**Month/Day/Year **] loss anemia with melanotic stool and hct drop to 19.
GI scoped and saw esophagitis and gastritis.
# Acute Pain:  Was in [**9-7**] pain on admission to ICU likely from bony pain from his leukemia.
Required significant amounts of fenanyl while intubated to keep pain at [**2177-4-3**].
He developed ventricular tachycardia on ketamine so this was stopped.
The fentanyl was weaned down and he was transitioned to a fentanyl patch with dilaudid PO PRN, which kept his pain at 5-7 which he deamed tolerable.
#Atrial fibrillation: He has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
This was held in the setting of his hematocrit drop.
HCT should be monitored in the setting of anticoagulation given his GI Bleed.
# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:  Initial concern for component of cardiogenic shock given hypotension and renal failure.
Echo showed normal EF though had poor windows.
Developed pulmonary edema in setting of massive fulid hydration with chemo.
# Rash: Pt with new erythematous, scaling rash on forehead.
He was started on a steroid cream with significant improvement.
# Ileus: Imaging showed no SBO.

You were soon transferred to the ICU for  respiratory distress which was likely due to fluid overload and pneumonia.
You required intubation with subsequent chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.
You were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for the osteomyelitis and pneumonia with a plan to continue a course until [**2177-7-2**].
You developed acute renal failure and were evaluated by the nephrology service.
You developed a heart arrhythmia called ventricular tachycardia and were evaluted by the electrophysiology service.
Bone marrow biopsy was suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemia.
You received plasmapharesis and were started on a medication called gleevac.
