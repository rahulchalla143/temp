Admission Date:  [**2152-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-8-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Lipitor / Zocor / Fosamax / Dicloxacillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Meningioma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2152-5-4**]: Occipital craniotomy for Meningioma resection   History of Present Illness: 70yo woman that was recently traveling in [**State 8842**] for 1 month.
She describes these as mechanical and denies losing her balance, LOC, dizziness or other cause.
Shortly thereafter she developed a headache which was quite significant especially on the plane ride home [**2152-3-24**].
She contact[**Name (NI) **] her PCP who requested [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT scan which revealed a extra-axial midline mass.
Family History: Family history is remarkable for colon carcinoma in her mother who died of other causes in her 80s.
Her maternal grandfather also had a possible colon cancer.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch, propioception  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements   Pertinent Results: MRI WAND Enhancing mass posterior to the corpus callosum, most likely a meningioma, measuring approximately 3.5 cm in size.
Post-pineal region meningioma resection with residual rim of calcified material in the post-surgical bed.
Hyperdense material within the post-surgical bed could reflect a small amount of blood product, or Surgicel.
Extensive pneumocephalus, but without significant midline shift.
Postoperative changes in the surgical bed include a small amount of blood and possible residual calcification along the tentorium.
There is no hydrocephalus or ischemia.
Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification  [**5-9**] CTA-Head:IMPRESSION: 1.
Postoperative changes as described above.
There continues to be a fluid collection within the posterior extra-axial space mildly displacing the major sinuses anteriorly without stenosis.
The pneumocephalus has significantly decreased with minimal residual pneumocephalus within the extraaxial collection.
The residual tumor, which demonstrates calcification and is inferior within the surgical bed and is stable.
There is minimal hyperdensity along the catheter tract near the right frontal cortex and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction which was likely present on the prior MRI [**2152-5-5**] and may represent minimal hemorrhage within and along the catheter tract.
There may be subtle diminished hypodensity of the white matter surrounding this hemorrhage, suggesting minimal edema without significant mass effect.The ventricles are unchanged in size compared to the prior study and are not enlarged.
The non-contrast CT of the head does not demonstrate new intracranial hemorrhage, new mass effect, or territorial infarction.
The CTV demonstrates patent internal cerebral veins, vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**] and the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses.
She underwent occipital craniotomy for resection of her lesion and was transported to the ICU intubated following her procedure.
There was no drift or facial droop.
There was scant drainage from occipital incision.
Then, she continued to have difficulty with urinary retention and required several voiding trials which required straight cath on [**5-8**] and [**5-9**].
Neuro opthamology was consulted for intermittent episodes of visual changes.
CTA demostrated no stenosis or aneurysm.
CTV demostrated no obtruction.
Her symptoms were managed with PRN Seroquel and haldol with limited effect.
Her Coumadin was restarted at 5mg on [**5-10**] without load or heparin bridge due to risk of intracranial bleeding.
Now on [**5-12**], the day of discharge, she is afebrile with stable vital signs, pain is well controlled on current regimen.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
14. haloperidol 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4hrs PRN as needed for agitation.
Daily Wound Check.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
