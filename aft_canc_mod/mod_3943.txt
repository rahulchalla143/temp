[**Name (NI) 7792**], pt had troponin leak in setting of demand ischemia secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix 40mg qd (she puts out 700cc-1L with this dose), and given additional doses depending on physical exam findings and oxygen requirement on nasal cannula.
Acute Pulmonary Edema in setting of AFib with RVR:  Most likely flash pulmonary edema given her high systolic blood pressure when she initially presented.
Also developed flash pulmonary edema when going into rapid ventricular response on the medical floor.
The pt likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction, echo was completed and found to have EF 55%, mod dilated left atrium.
Also, if she starts to require oxygen, or develops increasing oxygen requirement with crackles bilateral lungs and elev JVP, may need to adjust lasix dosing.
Plan is to continue diltiazem po qid and amiodarone 400mg po bid X 2 more days, then taper to 400mg po qd for maintenance rhythm control.
She became neutropenic in the CCU the following day and was started on Cefepime [**2170-2-16**] for febrile neutropenia/LLL PNA.
She was given ipratropium nebs q6h with no albuterol b/c of her Atrial fibrillation.
Pt developed severe nausea, vomiting, decr stool output 3 days prior to discharge concerning for incarcerated hernia or bowel obstruction, given her colostomy.
Abd CT showed a parastomal hernia, no evid obstruction.
KUB showed nonobstructive gas pattern.
No abdominal pain.
No nausea or vomiting.
New DX of Diabetes Mellitus:  Elevated blood sugars at OSH to 440, with no prior h/o DM.
She has a follow up appt with [**Last Name (un) **] DM for ?
Myelodysplastic syndrome- pt with OSH labs on [**2-8**] not far from pancytopenia seen on CBC on admission.
However, pt's WBC and Hct trended down, required 1 unit PRBC while in CCU.
The oncologist stated her prognosis from Myelodysplastic Syndrome was poor.
