On POD3 the apical CT was dc'd with camll residual ptx and bowel regimen initiated.
Patient had complained of some hoarseness and dysphagia since his surgery that did not improve, so ENT consult was obtained on POD5.
After fiberoptic scope and later video stroboscopy on POD8, it was determined that his R vocal cord was out, and he would need f/u as outpt.
