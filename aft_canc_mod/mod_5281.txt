Admission Date:  [**2188-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left Brachial Plexus Radiation (2 sessions)   History of Present Illness: 63 YO F with metastatic adenocarcinoma, likely from a NSCLC primary, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**3-29**] with her wife after experiencing increasing somnolence for two days and difficult breathing since the evening prior to admission.
As her mental status was depressed at the time of initial interview, most of the following history was obtained from the chart and from the pt's wife.
She then went on to develop the mental status changes and difficulty breathing described above.
The pt has not had any recent change in her medications.
She has not complained of any urinary symptoms.
No focal abnormal movements or weakness have been noted.
Her pain has remained under fair control.
Due to her pain and limited weight bearing, the pt has limited mobility at home, spending much time in bed or in a wheelchair.
ABG analysis was offered to the patient her spouse in the [**Name (NI) **] and declined.
As she remained confused and intermittently agitated, she was also given Haldol, to which she had a good response.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old white woman with a prior 25-pack-year history of smoking who presented in [**11/2187**] with evidence of bone and musculoskeletal discomfort.
Further progression of her symptoms led to imaging studies in early [**1-/2188**] that confirmed evidence of widespread disseminated bone metastasis.
Most of the lesions predominated in her hip bones and her cervical and thoracic spine.
The patient was significantly symptomatic from these lesions with pain and mild neurological impairment.
It seems based on all imaging studies that she did not have evidence of overt spinal cord compression.
The remaining of her radiographic imaging studies also showed a left upper lobe and left hilar lesion in the lung.
Due to the patient's symptoms, she was started on palliative radiation without a diagnosis.
She received and completed [**2178**] cGy of radiation to her right hemipelvis, sacrum, and L5 with concurrent dexamethasone steroid therapy.
Unfortunately, shortly after completing the initial palliative radiation, the patient developed upper left extremity neurologic complaints that prompted initiation of palliative radiation therapy to the C6 to T5 spine.
The patient completed [**2178**] cGy, but contiues to have pain and left arm/hand weakness.
Based on all the available radiographic and pathologic data, it is suspected that the patient has a stage IV carcinoma that likely represents nonsmall cell lung cancer.
The mammoglobin positive stain (that can he highly specific for breast cancer), the very high CEA and CA [**05**],29 have been viewed as perplexing, and are thought to suggest that any therapy for her carcinoma should at least use some active agents against breast cancer.
PMH: *extensive skeletal metastises with resultant left upper and lower extremity weakness, pathologic fracture of right acetabulum, presumed spinal instability *s/p XRT to sacrum and pelvis, C6 and T5 *osteoporosis *prior premalignant oral lesions in both her buccal mucosa and the floor of the mouth, treated with topical ablations >10 years ago depression *GERD *allergic rhitis *prior laparotomy for lysis of adhesions after IUD associated pelvic inflammatory disease   Social History: Smoked 1.5 ppd x 21 years.
No significant exposures.
Family History: The patient's mother died from gastric cancer at age 38.
The patient has a first cousin that had a history of breast cancer before age 60.
Physical Exam: On admission: VS: 97.6, BP 111/49, HR 124, RR 18, O2sat 91% Gen: Moderately ill appearing adult female, no acute distress.
Neck: Supple, without adenopathy or JVD.
No tenderness with palpation.
Chest: Few crackles at bases bilaterally.
No murmurs appreciated.
Extremity: Warm, 2+ pitting edema over entire LE bilaterally.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There appears to be a left pleural effusion.
Interval development of congestive heart failure with associated moderate left pleural effusion.
Known left upper lobe airspace consolidation compatible with known lung cancer.
[**2188-3-30**] CXR: Again seen is enlargement of the mediastinum consistent with known left-sided mass; upper zone redistribution and vascular blurring, suggesting superimposed CHF; increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and elevated left hemidiaphragm; and patchy opacity at the right base.
No gross effusions are identified.
No pneumothorax is detected.
[**2188-4-1**] CXR: Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**3-30**].
Left suprahilar mass is unchanged since mid [**Month (only) 547**].
Left lower lobe consolidation has worsened since [**3-12**] probably atelectasis.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion remain, small left pleural effusion decreased since [**3-29**].
Brief Hospital Course: 63 YO F with recent diagnosis of metastatic adenocarinoma, likely NSCLC primary, who presented on [**3-29**] with altered mental status, dyspnea, and hypoxia.
The patient's wife strongly expressed a desire for care to be directed to patient comfort with minimal testing for diagnostic purposes.
# Dyspnea, Hypoxia.
Given limited testing ability, the patient was treated for hypervolemia with diuresis as well as aspiration/post-obstructive pneumonia given her depressed mental status and lung mass.
Alternative diagnoses that were not ruled out given the patient's wishes were pulmonary embolism and progression of lung based tumor burden.
Given that a recent echo showed a normal EF without signs of diastolic dysfunction, it was thought that her recent chemo (which included avastin) could have created a leaky-capillary syndrome that resulted in pulmonary edema.
The day prior to her discharge, she again developed dyspnea and hypoxia to the high 80s on room air with diffuse crackles on exam.
Again, given normal EF, it was not clear if this was in fact related to recent chemo, bronchospasm, or worsening tumor burden.
She was also given a total course of 10 days of levofloxacin and flagyl for possible aspiration or post-obstructive pneumonia.
# Mental status changes.
Prior to her improvement, her alteration seemed to be most consistent with acute delirium with profoundly reduced attention and concentration.
Much of this cleared with treatment of her hypoxia, however, she remained somewhat altered with concern that she experienced permanent mental status changes during her several days of hypoxia or, alternatively, may have had a thromboembolic event or CNS spread of her malignancy.
Also possible was altered mental status as a result of zometa or neulasta given during recent chemo.
# Sinus Tachycardia.
Appropriate in the setting of possible infection, hypoxia and malignancy however, with a [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] score 7/moderate, concern for a PE was raised.
Given limited testing ability and with improvement in hypoxia, no Q1S3T3 on EKG, and patient having been on prophylactic lovenox as an outpatient, a decision was made to not empirically treat for PE.
# Adenocarcinoma w/ brachial plexus invasion, pain.
Her pain was controlled with up titration of fentanyl patch and prn morphine IR.
On [**4-2**], the patient's mental status had signficantly improved.
She was hemodynamically stable and no longer hypoxic.
