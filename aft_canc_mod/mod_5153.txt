There was concern for expanding intraabdominal infection, so Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl were started.
The patient declines any major intervention, but in case there was a percutaneously accessible fluid collection that could be drained and offer pain relief, a CT was obtained.
It appears that the mass is composed of necrotic tissue and that no such collection is visualized.
There has been progression of disease, and possible enterocolonic fistulalization to the necrotic tissues.
Doxycycline was added to added [**9-12**] for some concern of LLE cellulitus near this mass.
CT scan also revealed some hydronephrosis.
She has multiple abdominal masses, and was in [**Hospital 68721**] hospice care.
She is known to palliative care, is DNR/DNI, does not wish to have central line.

You came for further evaluation of abdominal pain and mass, and decreased kidney function.
Further tests showed that the mass in your abdomen is related to your ovarian cancer, and surgery would not be a good option at this time.
Your decrease in kidney function was most likely due to dehydration, and has recovered with intravenous fluids.
