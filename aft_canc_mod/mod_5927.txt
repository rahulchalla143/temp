The pain is consant and accompanied by nausea.
Multiple episodes of small-volume emesis today.
No flatus or bowel movement since.
She was found to have disease progression by CT and CA-125 in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
She is currently enrolled in a clinical trial for ciplatin vs. olaparib in advanced solid tumors.
No abnormal PAPs prior to procedure.
Family History: Mother- ovarian cancer  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: T: 99   HR: 85 RR: 18  BP: 110/86  O2sat: 95%RA General: No acute distress, alert, awake, oriented x 3 HEENT: Healing oral mucosa lesion Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Heart: Regular rate and rhythm Abdomen: soft, mildly distended, tenderness to palpation in upper quadrants and periumbilically, hypoactive bowel sounds.
No rebound/ guarding.
Discharge Physical Exam: Vital signs stable General: No acute distress, alert, awake, oriented x 3 Chest: Fine crackles at right base, otherwise clear to auscultation Heart: Regular rate and rhythm Abdomen: soft, non distended, no tenderness to palpation, + bowel sounds.
No rebound/ guarding.
The lung bases have minimal bilateral atelectasis.
There are no pleural effusions, focal consolidation, or nodules.
There are no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation.
The small bowel is also distended from the proximal duodenum through to a transition point best seen in image 2, 43.
There were no masses seen adjacent to the transition point.
This is consistent with an early complete small bowel obstruction.
There is fecalization of the small bowel contents directly proximal to the obstruction.
There is no free air or ascites in the abdomen.
This could mean that the obstruction is either early or partial, but given the severity of the distal small bowel collapse, it likely is an early complete obstruction.
There is minimal stranding in the mesentery.
There are small periaortic lymph nodes, none of which meet criteria for pathological enlargement.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
SOFT TISSUES: The patient is status post left mastectomy with breast implant.
There are no soft tissue nodules or hernias.
Early complete small bowel obstruction with transition point in the left upper quadrant.
There is a paucity of small bowel gas consistent with the finding of a small-bowel obstruction.
There is no free air or pneumotosis identified in this film.
Bowel gas pattern consistent with small-bowel obstruction.
Portable chest radiograph ([**7-19**]): The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral lower lobe opacities.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities could represent sequelae of aspiration or atelectasis   CT Chest/Abdomen ([**7-19**]): CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The imaged portion of the thyroid gland is normal in appearance.
There is no axillary, hilar, mediastinal or supraclavicular pathologic lymphadenopathy with scattered nonenlarged nodes seen.
Central venous catheter is seen terminating in the superior cavoatrial junction with no acute aortic pathology identified.
No pulmonary embolism is seen.
Trace right pleural effusion with resultant atelectasis is seen.
Hypoenhancing consolidative process is seen in the left base concerning for aspiration.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver is normal in appearance without focal lesion or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis or focal lesion.
Stomach is not as distended as on the prior study after decompression with nasogastric tube.
Proximal small bowel loops are dilated, slightly less so than on the prior study with likely transition point within the left upper quadrant and decompressed distal loops compatible with small-bowel obstruction.
Compared to the prior study, there is some passage of oral contrast administered at that time one day prior with contrast seen within loops of distal ileum as well as in large bowel.
There is a decrease degree of intraperitoneal fluid since the prior study.
No free air is seen.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal pathologic lymphadenopathy is identified with scattered nonenlarged likely are reactive in nature.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta is seen with patent appearing vessels.
A small fat containing ventral hernia is again seen.
Post surgical appearance from bowel resections and likely omentectomy noted.
No free pelvic fluid is seen.
There is no pelvic or inguinal pathologic lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No lytic or sclerotic bony lesions seen concerning for osseous malignant process.
Patient is status post left mastectomy with breast implant.
No pulmonary embolism.
Left base opacification is new and concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
Trace right effusion is seen.
Small-bowel obstruction with decompressed distal loops and transition point in the left mid abdomen as before with slight apparent interval improvement with a small amount of contrast passing into the distal ileum and large bowel.
Bibasilar opacities are noted associated with small amount of bilateral pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The increased opacity in the left lower lobe might represent aspiration process and should be closely monitored.

On hospital day #2, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] developed acute onset tachycardia, desaturation to 86%, temperature of 102, and altered mental status.
A chest radiograph and CT chest were consistent with what was likely an aspiration pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
Upon transfer to the floor, she was noted to have minimal nasogastric output and improved nausea with evidence of good bowel function.
An EKG performed during the acute episode on hospital day #2 showed non-specific ST changes which was likely secondary to her tachycardia at that point.
As outlined above, a CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Findings on this CT and a chest radiograph were suspicious for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
As she was steroid dependent on admission and given her acute medical status, she was initially given 2 doses of stress steroids intravenously ( IV dexamethasone 10' [**7-18**] -> [**7-19**] IV hydrocortisone 100).
She had no adrenal symptoms while inpatient.
*) Oncology: Per Ms. [**Known lastname **] primary medical oncology team, she is still eligible for the current clinical trial she is enrolled in for cisplatin vs. olaparib in advanced solid tumors.
*) Prophylaxis: Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was given subcutaneous heparin and pneumatic boots.
Medications on Admission: albuterol prn, senna, colace, oxycodone, Prilosec, lisinopril 5', ativan 0.5 prn, nystatin, prednisone 15'   Discharge Medications: 1. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for oral discomfort.
Dulcolax 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) suppository Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Small Bowel Obstruction, Possible aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
