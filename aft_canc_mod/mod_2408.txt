Admission Date:  [**2122-1-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2122-1-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-2-6**]     Sex:  F  Service:  GYNECOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old G0 with an last menstrual period of [**2121-11-3**] who presented initially at an outside hospital [**Hospital6 3872**] with bilateral complex adnexal masses and abnormal uterine bleeding.
She recently was admitted at that hospital with acute renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy and a positive troponin.
Her admission was complicated by several days of malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
She had also been bleeding heavily per the vagina and was found to have an elevated white count of 36,000 with pandemia.
She had acute renal failure and positive CK and troponin.
Work-up at [**Hospital3 1280**] was significant for a CT which showed bilateral complex adnexal masses.
She also had an elevated CA125.
Blood cultures were positive for E. Coli and she was placed on antibiotics.
She had an abnormal echocardiogram and positive hepatitis A.
During her hospital admission, all of her medical problems improved.
Cardiac evaluation including a stress thallium was within normal limits and she was placed on Lopressor and aspirin.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable after transfusion and vaginal bleeding subsided.
Her abnormal liver functions also resolved during that hospitalization.
With this history, she was sent to the Gynecologic Oncology Service for further evaluation of the bilateral adnexal masses.
There was concern at this time for endometrial and/or ovarian cancer with these symptoms.
Patient underwent a consultation with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1022**] on [**2121-12-4**] and the plan at that time was to undergo a exploratory laparotomy and potentially tumor debulking depending on the findings.
She was consented for a total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and possible surgical staging.
After the second unit, the presumed source of bleeding was the ovarian cyst and with bleeding into her pelvic mass.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for inferior intramural cardiac myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5, severe hypothyroidism and anemia.
Also a recent history of hepatitis A.
GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY:  Irregular menses, no sexually transmitted disease, no history of fibroids or carcinoma.
She was in no acute distress.
Neck had no masses or lymphadenopathy.
Extremities showed 2+ edema on her right and 1+ edema on her left and some eczematous lesions.
IN SUMMARY:  She is a 46-year-old G0 with large adnexal masses ongoing anemia and bleeding, hemodynamically stable with hematocrit that was pending.
There was a notable elevated white blood count of 15, no signs of infection were noted.
She was afebrile and a urinalysis and a culture were checked.
Renal:  Etiology of the renal insufficiency was not known from the patient's record.
A repeat creatinine was sent to further monitor her renal function.
There was a consideration of worsening renal function at that time and the possible causes including volume depletion, vascular disease, acute glomerulonephritis obstruction and acute tubular necrosis were considered.
Sediment, BUN and creatinine, urine osmolality were run, as well as a renal ultrasound.
Ultrasound obtained at that time showed a left ovarian mass, 10.9 x 11.3 x 11.3 which was septated, right ovarian mass which was 15.5 x 11.9 x 9.9.
There was bilateral hydronephrosis, left greater than right and no calculi were visualized.
The consideration was likely that the renal function was secondary to a obstructive pathology and a Renal Consult was obtained.
Please see full operative dictation and pathology for further results of this operative report.
The operative findings included large tubo-ovarian abscesses bilaterally.
The Renal Consult was obtained and recommended following her creatinine and re-imaging via ultrasound if the creatinine was falling and hydronephrosis resolved for evaluation of her elevated creatinine, as well as monitoring her ins and outs closely.
They recommended renal dosing for all medications.
Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit overnight after her operation for closer monitoring and management of her complicated medical problems postoperatively.
That evening, her pain was controlled with Demerol and Vistaril and her diet was advanced slowly.
Cardiovascularly:  A troponin level was sent at that time as she had a previous history of myocardial infarction.
Postoperative day two, she was noted to have decreased pain, out of bed, ambulating and tolerated fluids and with good pain control.
Postoperative day three, she had a mild episode of chest discomfort which appeared most consistent with gastritis although with a history of a myocardial infarction, an electrocardiogram was monitored and CKs were drawn.
She was noted to have adequate urine output and her Foley catheter was removed.
She was continued on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl and was noted to be afebrile with her white count improving.
She was thought to have a resolution of her obstructive symptomatology.
A renal ultrasound was scheduled for further evaluation of her potential obstruction hydronephrosis.
Her wound incision had also noted to have a little erythema around the base of the incision.
Cardiovascularly, her chest pain resolved.
Oxacillin was begun for treatment of her cellulitis.
She was maintained in house for monitoring of her wound infection.
The evening of postoperative day four, she underwent a renal ultrasound which showed a resolution of her hydronephrosis on her right and a near resolution on the left.
She was evaluated by the Renal Team who believed that this was most consistent with a obstructive picture.
Bilateral tubo-ovarian abscess.
Renal insufficiency.
