She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-4-1**] for hypotension and hypoxia, found to have pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia and dehydration.
CTA of the chest ruled out a PE but did show a possible narrowing of the previously stented left main bronchus concerning for endobronchial mass, LAD, or esophageal mass impinging on the airways.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended thin liquids and soft solids and suggested GI workup of esophageal dysfunction which was deferred to o/p workup.
Her son emailed her PCP [**4-11**] and reported that since leaving the hospital she had had poor po intake, coughing non-stop, and poor uop.
Tachycardic in 110s, temp 100.1.
Mentating ok but ABG abnormalities persisted so intubated.
Peri-intubation was hypotensive and receiving 3rd Liter NS now.
Had abdominal pain prior to intubation and with lactate elevation they wanted to do abd CT but did not get to it.
In addition they wanted a chest CT to eval for PE and re-eval the esophagus and LAD seen previously but did not get to that either.
They did place an NGT at [**Location (un) **] with lots of resistence and unclear if in right place per the attending at the OSH.
She was not completely sedated and with palpation of the abdomen had grimacing but did not answer questions or follow commands.
Review of systems: Unable given intubated but per son no diarrhea, fevers, abdominal pain.
Positive for [**Location (un) **] and profound weakness (able to walk with walker normally and yesterday could not at all).
Past Medical History: large B-cell lymphoma in [**2133**] with significant lymphadenopathy causing compression to the left main bronchus s/p stent in the left bronchus, and chemotherapy and XRT to the chest area.
The lymphoma has been in remission since mid [**2134**] and endobronchial stent was removed in [**2135**].
Pseudomonas PNA in [**2133**] C Diff colitis diastolic CHF Hypothyroidism HTN Rheumatic heart disease as a child Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Prior to recent hospitalizations lived with son and daughter.
No recent travel.
No tobacco, ETOH or drugs   Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: [**Year (4 digits) **]: BP: 114/53 P:97 R:16 O2:98% on 350X16 50% and 5 peep General: Intubated sedated awake but not following commands HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dryMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Rhochorous BS bilaterally.

Consolidation in the basilar segments of both lower lobes, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Ascites and generalized mural thickening of the small and large bowel, most prominent in the ileocecal region.
This is most likely due to third spacing of extracellular fluid.
The celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are patent, with known obstructive calcified plaque at the origin of the celiac artery.
Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as seen on CT [**2138-4-3**], which is probably related to known history of lymphoma.
Lymphadenopathy in the upper abdomen has increased in comparison to CT [**2137-7-8**].
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-4-2**], regional left ventricular systolic function is now normal and the severity of aortic regurgitation is reduced ?impact of lower systolic blood pressure).
Brief Hospital Course: 80yo F with h/o NHL s/p XRT to lung with left main bronchus narrowing s/o stent and recent admission for PNA treated with azithro now re-admitted in respiratory failure.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology of this as patient's CXR did not initially overloaded or with any focal infiltrate, she was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
With her history of pseudomonal pneumonias and recent hospital admissions was broadly covered for HCAP.
She also underwent LENI's and a CTA torso that were both negative for thrombus.
Her respiratory status stabilized, however given her multiple other comorbidities she was unable to be weaned from the ventilator.
# Hypotension: initially thought to be likely secondary to sepsis, given the elevated lactate and abdominal pain there was concern for bowel ischemia or infection.
CT scans were negative for ischemia and she was treatedly broadly with vancomycin and cefepime.
Despite the initial improvement in her lactate, it again began to rise and was not responsive to fluids, concerning for a type 2 lactic acidosis that was not reversible, which given her rising LDH was likely related to an underlying malignancy especially given her lymphadenopathy seen on CT and h/o diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
This decline was presumed to be due to an aggressive malignancy, however given her poor clinical status and uncertain diagnosis the only treatment offered was high dose steroids, which did help her overall clinical picture.
