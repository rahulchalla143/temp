The pt states that he stopped taking his Lasix 1 week ago due to excessive urination at that time.
He has had progressive SOB now over the past 3 days, to now feeling SOB even at rest.
He states that the swelling in his legs has actually improved over the past 2 weeks.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
He admits to no bowel movement in several days.

9. left upper lobectomy for an asymptomatic newly defined left upper lobe pulmonary nodule seen at the time of revision of lower extremity bypass graft back in [**2111-9-27**].
His postoperative course was complicated by urinary retention and a subsequent readmission with urosepsis.
Diastolic Heart Dysfunction: Echo [**1-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Klebsiella bacteremia, UTI and sepsis [**2-3**]   Social History: Smoked cigarettes until [**2083**].
Family History: Significant for lung cancer in the patient's father who developed this at age 75, but subsequently died of a stroke.
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 136/37 HR 95 RR 26 Sat 100% NRB-->ABG: 7.41/37/112 GEN: obese caucasian male sitting at 60 degrees in bed with respiratory accessory muscle use and paradoxical abdominal wall movements with breathing HEENT: pupils constricted, conjunctivae anicteric/noninjected but pale, MMM NECK: JVP at mandible with +HJR CV: distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, no m/r/g LUNGS: rales at bilateral lung bases R>L, poor air movement AB: soft, nontender, mildly distended and protuberant, paradoxical abdominal wall movements with breathing EXTREM: 2+ pitting edema in BL LE up to the knees, BL toe amputations (all 10 toes amputated), 1+ radial pulses bilaterally SKIN: chronic venous insufficiency changes in the BL LE NEURO: alert and oriented, moving all 4 extremities   Pertinent Results: Studies: [**2112-3-21**] EKG: EKG: sinus tachnycardia, nl axis, TWI and 1mm ST depressions in V5-6, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V2, TWI in lateral and inferior leads-->all old from [**1-3**] .
[**2112-3-21**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pulmonary edema, with more focal consolidative process involving the right lower lobe, likely representing areas of alveolar pulmonary edema.
Cardiogenic versus renal etiology is not completely clear; recommend correlation with clinical history and labs to clarify the etiology.
[**2112-3-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: A portable upright chest radiograph shows diffuse alveolar edema, right greater than left, with some sparing of the left upper lobe.
Top normal heart size and mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.
Compared to yesterday's study, there may be slightly more focal consolidation at the right base.
[**2112-3-23**] CXR: PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison to a day prior reveals persistent alveolar edema again with some sparing of the left upper lobe.
Heart size and pulmonary vascular congestion appears unchanged.
Although more focal consolidation at the right base is less evident on today's film, this may simply be due to patient rotation.
Worsening of small pleural effusions is noted bilaterally.
[**2112-3-24**] CXR:  Compared to prior studies from [**3-22**] and 28th, there has been interval improvement in now mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Right lower lobe consolidation has also improved.
There is blunting of the posterior CP angles likely small pleural effusions.
[**2112-3-22**] ECHO: LVEF 60% Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-1-27**], tissue Doppler analysis was included in the current study with evidence of elevated LV filling pressure.
EGD: Grade 1 esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus .
Polyp in the descending colon (polypectomy)  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 72 year old male with DMI, HTN, h/o MI, ESRD s/p LURT [**9-/2105**] from wife, recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of lungs Stage 1A T1NO (with left upper lobectomy) who presented with SOB most consistent with pulmonary edema.
#Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia: The patient had pulmonary edema likely in the setting of diastolic dysfunction exacerbated by self-discontinuation of lasix (pt.
Additionally, he was tachycardic on admission and has known diastolic dysfunction which likely also played a role.
There were no signs of PNA clinically, and serial CXR showed improvement of pulmonary edema.
He had an ECHO which showed grade II diastolic dysfunction and a LVEF of >60%.
He is s/p living related donor renal transplant in [**2105**] and is on sirolimus, cellcept, and prednisone.
This was likely multifactorial in the setting of decompensated CHF and worsening anemia.
FeUrea was consistent w/ pre-renal cause.
Renal transplant US was normal without evidence of obstruction.
Given his acute on chronic renal failure and anemia (discussed further below), an SPEP and UPEP were sent, both of which were negative.
His prophylactic bactrim was held during his stay secondary to his worsened renal function, but should be reinitiated upon follow up as long as his renal function remains stable.
His chronic anemia likely from CKD and chronic inflammation, but acute exacerbation was not initially clear.
He was consistently guaiac negative although reports several weeks prior to admission he had a large grossly bloody BM, but none since.
GI recommended small bowel follow through prior to pill endoscopy, but patient could not tolerate original study due to hip pain and then refused repeat prior to discharge.
Iron studies revealed significantly low iron and he was repleted with IV iron.
A serum TTG was sent to rule out celiac disease.
Hemolysis labs were not suggestive of active hemolysis.
# UTI: Urine cultures on admission grew Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
He has a history of BPH and high PVRs as well as a history of recurrent UTIs and bacteremia.
His foley was removed here and he has been voiding without difficulty without elevated PVRs.
allergic to PCN), nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in pt's w/ crcl <60).
He is to complete his course of ciprofloxacin for klebsiella on [**2112-4-4**].
Cardiac enzymes were felt to be secondary to tachycardia in the setting of severe anemia.
He had no EKG changes consistent with acute ischemia nor symptoms of chest pain.
