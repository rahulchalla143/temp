He reports it is mildly painful over his temple as well as over his jaw while chewing.
The scan revealed adenopathy extending from the left ear into the mediastinum and right axilla and the patient was asked to return to the ED for further work up.
He received a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis which revealed a mediastinal mass with multiple enlarged nodes in the mediastinum, right axilla, subclavicular and aortocaval nodes near the level of the kidneys.
He was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], where he underwent VATS and mediastinal mass biopsy, which was nondiagnostic.
It was felt that his lymph nodes could represent reactive lymphadenopathy from his SVC syndrome, but also that a mediastinal mass biopsy could be unrevealing as this was the case in his last VATS.
Therefore he had PET CT to identify FDG-avid lymph nodes most appropriate for biopsy which revealed diffuse disease.
On extubation, he wasn't ventilating well with elevated end tidal CO2 despite 30-45 min of Ambu ventilation and was reintubated with difficulty.
He had no documented episodes of hypotension throughout.
Past Medical History: h/o recent lymphadenopathy and a mediastinal mass polysubstance abuse morbid obesity previously difficult intubation s/p VATS   Social History: From [**Location (un) 86**], currently living in [**Location (un) 3146**].
Graduated high school, was previously working as a security guard but has not been working recently.
Family History: No history of known malignancy.

Path: [**2122-11-27**] Anterior mediastinal mass: ATYPICAL LYMPHOID PROLIFERATION HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF LYMPHOMA (SEE NOTE).
A significant proportion of the biopsy is composed of dense fibrous tissue with scant lymphoid infiltrate, but prominent focal fibroblastic proliferation.
More cellular areas in the biopsy contain a polymorphous cell infiltrate comprised of a spectrum of lymphoid cells, from small to large atypical cells, and inflammatory cells.
Admixed are histiocytes, occasional Langerhans cells, eosinophils and macrophages.
In small areas of the biopsy clusters of atypical large cells are present, which resemble those seen in primary mediastinal lymphoma, yet they are negative for B cell markers (see below).
Yet in another site in the biopsy, there are numerous epithelioid cells with abundant pink cytoplasm which are positive for cytokeratin and suggestive of reactive mesothelial cells.
However, a small subset of large cells within an area of crush artifact appears positive for PAX5 and are definitively positive for CD30.
Overall the findings are highly atypical and suggestive of a lymphoma.
However, given the various histological patterns and the atypical immunohistochemistry results, it is not possible to render a definitive diagnosis in this biopsy.
complete nodal excision, needs to be attempted to maximize that chances of procuring tissue sufficient for a definitive diagnosis.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systoilc dysfunction (most c/w diffuse process, such as toxic, metabolic, post-cardiac arrest stunning, etc.).
No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
[**12-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with epicardial and bronchovascular encasement.
Increased bilateral pulmonary opacities, likely representing post-obstructive pneumonitis/aspiration, atelectasis, infection, and/or hemorrhage.
Increased right and new left pleural effusions.
Right axillary/subpectoral lymphadenopathy and postoperative changes.
Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since [**2122-11-28**].
Worsened bilateral moderate pulmonary edema.
[**12-5**] PET CT: Extensive FDG-avid disease in the left cervical nodes, mediastinum, right axilla, abdomen, pelvis and bony skeleton.
[**12-13**] ECHO: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Unchanged moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and bilateral enlargement of the mediastinum without evidence of pathologic mediastinal contours.
No pleural effusions.
No pathologic parenchymal processes.
Brief Hospital Course: 27M with recently discovered diffuse lymphadenopathy/Hodgkin's lymphoma and polysubstance abuse, who presented for elective R axillary LN dissection and subsequently developed respiratory failure and VF and PEA arrests, now with return of spontaneous circulation.
The patient had bilateral diffuse infiltrates on CXR.
RLL pleural effusion was tapped [**12-12**] evening and drained over 1 liter and pigtail catheter was able to be removed [**12-14**].
Pleural effusion had LDH of 325 (serum LDH 271) -> exudative likely from pneumonia vs. malignancy.
# VT/PEA ARREST: Unclear trigger but could have been compression from large mediastinal mass, aspiration, or from hypercarbia and hypoxia while being bag masked.
There was no evidence of PE on CTA.
There was very mild troponin elevation that is now resolved with normal CK-MB consistent with cardiac arrest but not ACS.
The patients ejection fraction was noted to be depressed to 40% consistent with myocardial stunning from cardiac arrest but later normalized to 55% on repeat echocardiography.
Pt was seen by electrophysiology who felt there was no current indication for ICD placement or further investigation.
# Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Pathology consistent with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, but final pathology will need to be followed-up on.
He started modified ABVD (no bleomycin given his recent pulmonary issues) on [**12-13**].
# PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pleural fluid had LDH of 325 (serum LDH 271) -> exudative likely from pneumonia vs. malignancy.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Likely to have been stress response vs aspiration/infection vs malignancy-related.
# ABNORMAL LFTs: Were initially elevated but later normalized.
