Admission Date:  [**2146-1-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-7-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: transfer for evaluation of pancreatic pseudocyst  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2146-1-14**]: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY ERCP [**1-13**] - stent placed in CBD   History of Present Illness: 73 y/o M PMH CHF, CKD, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH after prolonged stay [**Date range (2) 89630**] for evaluation of pancreatic mass and pseudocyst.
Patient was admitted to the surgical floor and underwent ERCP [**2146-1-13**] which demonstrated CBD obstruction and stent was placed.
Brushings during ERCP returned as malignant and patient diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver (see imaging below).
Patient was transferred to the TICU [**2146-1-16**] due to hypotension and required pressor support until [**2146-1-19**].
Swab from chol fluid grew MRSA and patient was covered with Vanc/Cipro but etiology of hypotension unclear and not felt to be septic shock.
Palliative care was consulted and adjusted pain medication.
Patient was on a lasix drip from [**Date range (1) 5553**] due to volume overload (pleural effusions).
Today his heparin was stopped due to thrombocytopenia.
From surgical admission note review of OSH course: Admitted to OSH [**12-16**] with complaint of shortness of breath and found to have a hemoglobin of 5.2 with guaiac positive stool.
While undergoing anemia workup on [**12-19**], patient suffered spontaneous R pneumothorax requiring management with surgical chest tube and eventual resolution per serial imaging.
Pulmonary function was further compromised by RLL/RML consolidative pneumonia that was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Admission was also notable for onset of RUQ pain on [**12-26**].
RUQ U/S and subsequent CT scans were notable for cholecystitis though no cholelithiasis was appreciated.
Imaging also revealed a 6cm peripancreatic cystic mass with fluid that was noted to change in character on interval imaging suggesting evolving hematoma/hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst.
Given medical comorbidities, unasyn was started on [**1-9**] for presumptive cholecystitis and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Marked intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation, increased compared to [**2145-12-20**], consistent with biliary obstruction.
Etiology not clearly identified, though changes of acute or chronic pancreatitis are considered as a possibility given the apparent pseudocyst in the pancreatic neck.
Markedly dilated gallbladder, as seen on OSH CT [**2146-6-19**], with minimal wall edema.
There are small stones and sludge seen within the gallbladder.
Slight increase in size of avascular pancreatic cystic lesion with internal debris, centered at the pancreatic neck.
Small ascites.
Ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass in the superior pancreas and mid-distal common bile duct.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, despite distal migration of the biliary stent below the mass.
The lack of dilation could mean that the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is draining the biliary system, however this is uncertain as the cystic duct did not fill with contrast on ERCP and could be occluded and the intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatic duct have not dilated because the stent jsut recently migrated.
Interval increase in size and formation of two additional pseudocysts with surrounding and pancreatitis, mass effect on the superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein as well as the stomach.
No thromboses.
Multiple liver lesions concerning for metastases; early liver abscesses considered less likely.
Increased amount of mural thrombus in the large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, which remains widely patent.
Recommend continued hydration and close monitoring of renal function.
Abnormal appearance of the left elbow.
Suggest correlation with clinical symptoms.
Small residual pneumothorax and chest wall emphysema.
Splenomegaly, and small ascites.
Mild gas inclusion in the right chest wall.
Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Unchanged right pleural effusion with right basal atelectasis.
Status post old left humeral fracture.
ERCP [**1-13**]: The distal pancreatic duct was opacified with contrast and appeared unremarkable.
There was moderate pre-obstructive dilation.
There was severe intrahepatic biliary dilation.
ERCP brushings: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS .
[**2146-1-14**]: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY   Brief Hospital Course: Overview of medical course: 73 y/o M PMH CHF, CKD, COPD presented to OSH for anemia (EGD demonstrated mild gastritis, refused colonoscopy) and hospital course complicated by PNA, pneumothorax and acute chol.
RUQ U/S demonstrated pancreatic mass and pseudocyst consequently patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
He underwent ERCP [**2146-1-13**] which demonstrated CBD stricture with obstruction and stent was placed.
CT scan demonstrated likely metastasis to the liver (multiple lesions).
Patient was transferred to the TICU [**2146-1-16**] due to hypotension and required pressor support until [**2146-1-19**].
Etiology of hypotension was unclear and not felt to be septic shock.
His urine output mildly improved with holding diuretics, [**Last Name (un) **] and giving gentle fluid but his creatinine continued to rise.
Pancytopenia most likely secondary to spleenomegaly and underlying disease but heparin stopped due to possibility of HIT.
Oncology was consulted who explained to the family patient is not a candidate for first line chemotherapy due to thrombocytopenia/renal failure and unfortunately no curable therapies.
Prior to OSH admission patient and family report deterioration in health over the past year and poor baseline functional status.
Following discussion with patient and both health care proxys explaining poor prognosis of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma the patient and HCP decided [**Name2 (NI) **] and being close to home was the most important things for him.
Speech and Swallow demonstrated patient to be aspiration risk and recommended sips.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to our hospital for evaluation of a pancreatic cyst.
You were found to have cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the biliary tree) that has spread to the liver.
Unfortunately this is an aggressive cancer and at your stage not curable by surgery or chemotherapy.
Follow medications as listed in your discharge paperwork - these can be adjusted by your hospice to provide optimal pain control.
