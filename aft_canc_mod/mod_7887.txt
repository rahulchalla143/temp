HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old African American female who presented to the Emergency Department in early [**Month (only) **] due to cough and some shortness of breath.
She had previously been admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath in [**2189**], at which time a chest x-ray was done and said to be normal, and the patient was discharged home on an Albuterol inhaler.
She had remained asymptomatic until the aforementioned visit to the Emergency Department, at which time a repeat chest x-ray showed the presence of a large right hilar mass which was associated with volume loss in the right hemithorax, and suggestive of a neoplasm of the lung.
She denied having any history of fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea.
She also denied any history of lower extremity edema.
She stated that her appetite had been good, however, she had experienced an approximately ten pound weight loss over the previous two months.
A biopsy was performed of her hilar mass which was consistent with a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.
She also underwent a bone scan in a workup for metastases but this did not reveal any such disease.
She underwent further imaging with CAT scan of the hilar mass and it was staged as a T3, NO, MO lesion, and was believed to be amenable to primary resection.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for breast cancer and diabetes mellitus in her mother.
There is no family history of coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, she was found to be afebrile with a heart rate of 90 and sinus rhythm and a blood pressure of 110/70.
She was a pleasant 73 year old woman in no acute distress.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
Her carotid arteries were 2+ palpable with no audible bruits.
She had no lymphadenopathy.
Her heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and no murmurs.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air entry and movement, however, she did have bilateral expiratory wheezing which was quite significant.
Examination of her breasts revealed no masses on palpation with no nipple discharge or tenderness.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.
She was also found to have a slightly elevated cortisol level at 24.
Preadmission radiologic studies of significance was a chest x-ray performed on [**2191-11-1**], which showed a new right hilar mass.
This was further confirmed by CAT scan which showed a large [**Location (un) 21851**] in the right hilum resulting in obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus and severe compression of the intermediate bronchus.
It also showed multiple ill-defined areas of opacity within the right upper lobe.
The patient further underwent a bone scan which showed no evidence of bony metastases and a CAT scan of the head which showed no abnormalities.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating room on [**2191-12-20**], where she underwent a pneumonectomy of the right lung as well as bronchoscopy and a pericardial flap.
She was at this time on continuous epidural at 4 cc/hour for pain control.
She was encouraged to perform aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry with which her oxygen saturations and level of pain improved.
Her pain was excellently controlled with her epidural running at a rate of 5 cc/hour.
Her relative hypoxia and respiratory acidosis were slowly being corrected through aggressive pulmonary toilet.
One of her chest tubes was removed at this time which she tolerated without difficulty.
During the mid afternoon on postoperative day number two, the patient went from a sinus rhythm into rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 140s and a systolic blood pressure between 80 and 90.
She was given a slow 500 cc bolus of normal saline, and proceeded to convert in and out of atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm throughout much of the afternoon.
She then went into a sustained rapid atrial fibrillation, and an Amiodarone intravenous bolus of 150 mg was given over ten minutes and then infusion of Amiodarone at 1 mg/minute was started.
She continued to improve remaining in sinus rhythm, and due to her improving blood pressure was restarted on her Diltiazem which she had been on prior to admission.
She had excellent pain control and her epidural was quickly weaned.
Her heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs.
Her extremities were warm and well perfused with no evidence of pedal edema.
ACTIVITY:  Her activity was also as tolerated with probable benefit from some additional skilled care to increase strength and mobility particularly in climbing stairs.
