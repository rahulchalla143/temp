New soft tissue calcifications in the region of the right scapula.
CXR [**2173-11-4**]: IMPRESSION: Regression of previously identified left lower lobe infiltrates suspected to be of inflammatory origin in this patient with history of advanced right-sided pulmonary carcinoma.

# Respiratory distress- History of NSCLC stage IV EGFR, ALK, and KRAS with osseous mets.
Acute respiratory decompensation attributed to mucus plug, aspiration, perhaps with contributing atalectasis.
# NSCLC: Was undergoing palliative second line therapy on day 21 of premetrexed prior to admission.
# Hyponatremia: Chronic hyponatremia in setting of pulmonary disease.
Likely underlying SIADH.
# Goals of care: Patient presented with acute decompensation.
# Transitional issues- - Oncology nurse will contact him at home for scheduling.
