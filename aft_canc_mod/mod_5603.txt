Admission Date:  [**2107-10-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-10-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis and Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line placement R internal jugular venous catheter  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 81 y.o.
female with a h/o transfusion dependent CLL who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Neeham where she presented with hypotension SBP = 60s in EMS (SBP = 50s earlier by home VNA) lightheadedness, and dizziness.
She also c/o n/v/ denied melena or BRBPR.
At [**Location (un) 620**] placement of a subclavian was attempted without success with ensuing hemoptysis.
(The amount of hemoptysis was not quantified- but was reported to be significant.)
Her ECG demonstrated NSR @ 73, Q in F,ST depression in lateral leads with TropI =21, CK = 424, and CK MIB = 13.6.
The patient was then intubated for airway protection, a R femoral cordis was placed and she was started on dopamine.
Her X ray demonstrated bibasilar infiltrates vs consolidation.
Past Medical History: - Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia dx by BM bx in [**8-/2106**] @ [**Hospital1 18**] - H/o myocardial infarction-[**2107-6-1**]- h/o cardiac caths in late 90s but records could not be accessed.
Heart failure- EF = 25-30% on [**5-/2107**] with severe hypokinesis of the apical and antro-septal walls., mod- severe TR, nml RV function, mod AV stenosis, moderate pulmonary artery htn.
- Iron deficiency anemia.
- Chronic left leg pain secondary to a motor vehicle accident.
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/Severe chronic bronchitis - in [**5-/2107**] FEV1, and FEV1/FVC reduced on PFTs at [**Location (un) 620**] - Osteoporosis.
CV: nml S1, S2, ?SEM at R base Lungs: coarse breath sounds throughout.
Abd: nabs, soft nontender Extremities: 3+ non-pitting edema with pain upon compression of legs.
Pertinent Results: Data: ECGs at [**Location (un) 620**]: SR 73, LAD, Q in III, TWI in F and ST depressions in leads V3, V4 and ?V5 but no old to compare.
ECG@ [**Hospital1 **]: Rate=103, Qs in III and F, ST depressions in V3, V4 V5 and V6.
CXRay RUL consolidation with bilateral lower lobe consolidation- much worse than CXR @ [**Location (un) 620**].
* Chest CT: RUL and bilateral LL consolidation.
Small R pleural effusion.
No interstitial edema.
No blood/air in mediaststinum.
C/w PNA/pulmonary hemorrhage.
female p/w hypotension initially requiring pressor who course was complicated by the development of hemoptysis after a failed atempt at placing a subclavian line  OSH.
<br> Shock: Ddx includes cardiogenic, distributive/sepsis and hyovolemia, adrenal insufficiency Cardiogenic The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes were concerning for cardiac ischemia.
Cardiology was consulted and the patient was placed on a heparin drip to treat both a possible pulmonary embolism and ACS.
* Sepsis: The pulmonary consolidations were concerning for possible PNA and thus she was started on vancomycin and zosyn.
* Hypovolemia We wondered whether her hypotenstion was secondary to bleeding or decreased po intake secondary to nausea and vomiting.
The source of bleeding was unclear at this point since her NG lavage was clear, FAS scanning was negative for blood or pericardial effusion.
The patient was hypotensive prior to the development of bilateral infiltrates on chest Xray thus DAH unlikely to be cause.
We thought that her respiratory distress was multifactorial in etiology probably secondary to  severe COPD/bronchitis with restrictive and obstructive defect noted on recent PFTS along with new diffuse consolidations/infiltrates * Acute Renal insufficiency: This was thought to be pre-renal in etiology given her current hypotension.
* GERD: PPI * Osteoporosis - calcium and vit D * Disposition: Given the patient's grave prognosis, a family meeting was held and the patient's family decided that she would not have wanted to be ventilator dependent and thus she was made CMO and terminally extubated and pressors were held.
