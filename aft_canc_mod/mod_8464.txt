This was severe enough so that he was not able to tolerate any PO intake without vomiting despite vigorous encouragement from his partner.

No fevers, chills, night sweats and other review of systems negative.

There is no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a complicated 40 year old man with metastatic gastric cancer presenting with nausea/vomiting likely due to gastric outlet obstruction from metastatic disease.
1) Nausea/ Vomiting/Gastric outlet obstruction: Upon presentation the patient was initially admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for management of his volume depletion and presumed gastric outlet obstruction.
He was fluid resuscitated and called out to the floor where he continued to have persistent refractory nausea.
On [**2123-8-3**] a percutaneous G-J tube was placed beyond the site of gastric outlet obstruction but was not able to transverse a distal jejunal obstruction.
He was not able to tolerate feeds through this tube and due to pain at the site and no clear utility it was exchanged on [**8-5**] for a simple venting gastrotomy tube.
Given multiple sites of bowel wall involvement and peritoneal carcinomatosis intolerance of PO's thought most likely to severe functional impairment as well as likely multiple sites of mechanical obstruction.
Therefore, decision was made to medically manage nausea with ondansetron, lorazepam, and prochlorperazine while patient remained on TPN feeds and attempts were made to address his total body disease burden.
On the noted anti-emetics the patient did intermittently complain of nausea but generally was without emesis and managed to tolerate small amounts of liquids by mouth.
2) Metastatic Gastric Cancer: The patient had peritoneal carcinomatosis and a large burden of intra-abdominal disease leading to significant symptom burden.
He tolerated the initiation of chemotherapy without initial ill effects and was discharged on continuous infusion chemo to follow up with his primary oncologist.
His TPN was adjusted with the nutrition services recommendations and he evidenced no major electrolyte abnormalities or worsening hepatitis.
4)Pain: The patient initially presented primarily with nausea but then developed rather significant abdominal pain.
Initial attempts to control this led to significant oversedation but eventually was able to tolerate fentanyl patch and oral hydromorphone regimen with minimal pain unless abdomen was pushed on or other provocative events occured.
Patient would often moan in pain and be very resistant to exam making full evaluation difficult but no signs/ symptoms of acute intra-abdominal process.
The patient was discharged on oral hydromorphone and a fentanyl patch as his standing pain regimen.
5) Depression/ Psychosocial: Throughout his hospitalization the patient had a great deal of difficulty engaging in discussions of his care and was often in significant emotional and or physical distress, moaning in pain and/or refusing to respond to providers or other questions.
He did acknowledge great difficulty coping with his recurrent cancer diagnosis and the extremely burdensome symptoms that came with this.
4) Goals of Care:  Despite multiple well cited conversations with the family where providers explained the patient had incurable disease with goals aiming at comfort and palliation the patient and particularly his wife expressed sentiments relating to his cancer being "cured."
5) Chronic biliary obstructions: The patient was continued on his standing levofloxacin and ursodiol, there were never any signs of current, active infection so antibiotics started in the ED were stopped on [**7-27**].
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety, nausea.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check weekly CBC with differential, ALT, AST, ALK Phos, Total Bilirubin, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, HCO3, BUN, Cr, and glucose, Calcium, Magnesium, and Phosphate and fax results to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], RN and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], MD at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18738**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic gastric cancer with gastric outlet obstruction   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The surgeons evaluated you and placed a tube to decompress your stomach as well as starting you on TPN.
You then came to the oncology service to receive chemotherapy in hopes of shrinking your tumor and allowing you to eat.
