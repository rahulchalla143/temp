Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema.
Status post right upper lobe wedge resection.
History of small cell lung cancer - status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old male who was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in [**2135**], and at that time was found to have disease in the lymph nodes which was deemed to be inoperable.
He had been doing well since then but was found to have a pulmonary nodule in late [**2143-9-21**] on follow-up imaging.
His repeat computer tomography at that time suggested possible enlargement of the nodule.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He was afebrile at 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, his pulse was 113, his blood pressure was 146/85, and he was otherwise saturating 97 percent on room air.
He was in no acute distress.
He had no scleral icterus.
He had no cervical adenopathy.
He had no crackles or wheezes.
There was no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.
He had no inguinal adenopathy, and otherwise no peripheral edema.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2144-5-29**] and on that day underwent a right video-assisted thoracic surgery with wedge resection without note of intraoperative complications or excessive blood loss.
It was noted that he was somewhat hypotensive intraoperatively, but this was felt by the Anesthesia Department to be secondary to his anesthesia.
Shortly after he was extubated, the patient became acutely tachycardic and somewhat hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure in the 50s and with a decreasing oxygen saturation.
Therefore, he was re-intubated and an echocardiogram was performed in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit to rule out any sort of cardiac dysfunction.
No significant valvular disease, and no evidence of a hyperdynamic stated indicating that there was poor filling.
It was felt that the hypotension was again secondary to anesthesia.
Notably, on postoperative day two he did have collapse of his right lower lobe on chest x-ray; but with aggressive chest physical therapy, coughing, and deep breathing exercises he was re- expanded.
He did remain slightly tachycardic, but this was felt to be close to his baseline; as per his preoperative numbers.
His chest tubes came out on postoperative day two, and he had no evidence of a significant pneumothorax, and his chest x-ray otherwise looked fine.
DISCHARGE CONDITION/DISPOSITION:  It was felt that by postoperative day four - as the patient was up and ambulating, had excellent pain control with oral pain medications, and was taking adequate oral intake, and was otherwise saturating well with a minimal oxygen requirement - that he could be discharged home in good condition.
