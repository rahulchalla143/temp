Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis with window Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old female with recently diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer (T4, N3 disease which is consistent with stage III B) treated with Tarceva.
For the past 3 days pt had cough with nausea.
As for her cancer diagnosis, CT of the chest in [**Month (only) 958**] revealed pulmonary embolus but also findings consistent with locally advanced lung cancer.
She had a 4.5 x 2.5 cm right lower lobe mass and two 5 cm satellite nodules abutting the major fissure in the right lateral chest wall.
She also had bulky right hilar, subcarinal, precarinal adenopathy and also abnormal soft tissue involving the pericardium extending into the anterior mediastinal along the anterior ascending thoracic aorta.
She also had a right hilar node and abnormal left hilar node as well.
It was CK 7 positive, TTF-1 positive, and CK 20 and S 100 negative consistent with primary lung cancer with elements of large cell lung cancer with some squamous features.
There were foci of lymphatic and vascular invasion noted.
She is getting treated with Tarceva for her stage III B tumor which was started 5 weeks ago.
In the ED, a CT revealed a large pericardial effusion and ECHO revealed tamponade.
She had immediate improvement of her BP and a pericardial drain was left in place.
History of DVT and PE in [**3-/2110**], status post IVC filter placement.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Peripheral neuropathy secondary to Navelbine treatment 5.
History of pubic ramus fracture.
Physical Exam:  PE: 96.1 106 144/91 14 95% O2 Sats RA HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXT: No edema.
Interval increase in size of right lower lobe lung mass with possible lymphangitic spread of tumor into the right upper lobe.
Interval development of moderate right-sided and small left-sided pleural effusion.
Large high-attenuation pericardial effusion as described above.
Possible cardiac tamponade.
Pericardial Fluid Exam [**5-9**]: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with metastatic   non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (patient's slide of lung cancer [S06-[**Numeric Identifier 96473**]] reviewed).
Pericardial tamponade.
Successful draininage of pericardial effusion.
The right  ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is no significant pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is an 82-year-old female with recently diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer who underwent pericardiocentesis and window for large pericardial effusion seen on CT and ECHO and tamponade now stable in the CCU.
She did quite well with no chest pain and repeat ECHO revealed no further fluid accumulation.
The fluid showed malignant cells, hence was secondary to her underlying stage III lung cancer.
A repeat ECHO showed resolved effusion around the heart.
# Pleural Effusions: She was breathless at times with effusions on CXR and CTA.
Onc saw her and recommended thoracentesis for pericardial effusions which she underwent on [**5-13**].
She had improved symptoms and oxygenation post procedure.
Thought secondary to fevers, malignancy and hypoxia.
# Fevers: Cx sent several times from multiple sources with no growth.
Thought secondary to pericardial effusions and malignancy.
# Lung CA:  As outlined above, this is (T4, N3 disease which is consistent with stage III B) treated with Tarceva for now.
Heparin gtt was continued given past history of DVT and hypercoagulable state given tumor and eventually switched to Lovenox.
