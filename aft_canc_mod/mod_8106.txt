Her GCS was 15 upon arrival; she was also complaining of pain in the back of her head and neck, but denies weakness and numbness/tingling, though she does have severe pain from her orthopaedic injuries, including a left wrist fracture.
Past Medical History: ONC HISTORY (per OMR, previous discharge summaries): Ms. [**Known lastname 103705**] was diagnosed with her lymphoma following preop workup in preparation for Nissen fundiplication mid-[**Month (only) 404**] [**2116**].
During her pre-operative workup, a CXR showed a R mediastinal mass.
Since then, she has had multiple CT/MRIs for further workup.
Noted to have extensive lymphadenopathy both above and below the diaphragm.
Restaging PET scans ([**2117-2-8**] and [**2117-3-24**]) revealed further reduction in her disease burden.
Course has been complicated by peripheral neuropathy that was present prior to initiation of chemotherapy but has been exacerbated by vincristine toxicity.
Complicated by some dyspnea during course that responded to d/c of standing fluids and 10 IV lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Diastolic CHF - EF 60-70% in [**2-23**]; >60% with LVH in [**4-/2117**] - atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal - HTN - Hypercholesterolemia - Angina - Asthma - Palindromic Rheumatism - Pancreatitis [**12-19**] Imuran - GERD - h/o of DVT [**8-24**] in Left leg, on lovenox .
Family History:  Mom - no cancer.
Dad - cerebellar hemorrhage; leg amputation due to "poor circulation."

Hyperostosis frontalis is and a subcentimeter left frontal sinus osteoma are incidentally noted.
There is no evidence of calvarial injury.
Comminuted odontoid fracture is better evaluated on concurrent CT C- spine performed at outside hospital.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
The known fractures at C2 is not well seen on this study.
Prevertebral soft tissues appear slightly prominent.
IMPRESSION:  Known C2 fracture is not well seen on this radiograph due to technique and collar.
Please refer to prior outside imaging for additional reporting.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Initial discussions took place between team and family regarding Halo placement; after much discussions the decision was to manage the fracture non operatively with a cervical collar that includes a thoracic extension.
She has experienced considerable pain as a result of this injury.
An antispasmodic was also added for the neck spasms that she was experiencing which seemed to help.
Her oral beta blocker was increased as well as her calcium channel blocker.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3-4H () as needed for breakthrough pain.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO EVERY OTHER DAY (Every Other Day) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motor vehicle crash Injuries: Bilateral C2 vertebral foramina fracture (Hangman's fracture)/C2 body fracture Manubrium fracture Right rib fractures [**4-25**] Left distal radial/ulnar styloid fracture Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular die, pain fairly controlled and is requiring ongoing adjustment of her medications.
The cervical collar with thoracic extension MUST be worn at all times and cannot be removed unless authorized by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], Neurosurgery [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**].
Inform the office that you will need a repeat CT scan of your cervical spine for this appointment.
