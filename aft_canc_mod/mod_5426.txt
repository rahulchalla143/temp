HPI: This is a 56 yo male with a past history significant for hep C cirrhosis, history of MVA with hardware in LE, chronic LE ulcerations with cellulitis, and history of group A strep bacteremia, who presented to OSH with fevers and chills.
He was found to have a Tmax of 99 and his left lower extremity had a large ulcer with necrosis.
He had several plain films and a CT scan of the leg to evaluate for necrotizing fasciitis, which were negative per report.
His course was complicated by worsening encepalopathy and olguria despite IVF with an acute rise of creatinine to 2.1.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further work-up of his encephalopathy as well as for concern of impending sepsis given his positive blood cultures, altered mental status, poor urine output and oxygen requirement.
Genotype 1, treated with Peg-IFN and ribavirin several times in the past, no response in disease after treatment from [**1-25**] to [**1-26**].
Cirrhosis w/u included abdominal ultrasound in [**2121-6-30**] that revealed no focal liver lesions or ductal dilation.
He has three Grade II varices with portal gastropathy.
-Chronic thrombocytopenia -Hypersplenism -Cellulitis [**2119**] -h/o group A strep bacteremia -MVA [**2101**], surgery to R leg, multiple fractures to left leg  Social History: Social History: Denies IVDU or cocaine.
His may have had a polyposis syndrome.
There is no family history of hemochromatosis or diabetes.
Physical Exam: (on admit) VS: Temp: 97.7 ax BP: 139/78 HR: 87 RR: 17 O2sat 95% 2L NC GEN: Ill-appearing, cachectic, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, icteric sclerae, MM very dry, OP without lesions NECK: No supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, soft I/VI SEM at LLSB, nonradiating.
ABD: Distended, soft, +b/s, nt, + fluid wave.
LLE with large circumferential ulcer with areas of necrosis and purulent drainage.
Tender to palpation, no crepitus.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: @OSH: By report only (have not reviewed images on CD at this time) [**2123-11-26**]: LENI: No evidence of DVT .
[**2123-11-26**]: Two views of the left lower leg show no definite bony abnormality.
No destructive lesions are seen.
[**2123-11-25**]: CT LLE: extensive soft tissue edema with fluid seen between fascial planes and the soft tissues.
No well defined abscess is noted.
There is a joint effusion in the knee with a [**Hospital Ward Name **] cyst.
Minimal residual left retrocardiac atelectasis.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Liver U/S ([**12-28**]): CONCLUSION: Normal-appearing liver transplant Doppler study  Brief Hospital Course: #Sepsis - Patient was initially transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of his group A sepsis in the setting of severe liver disease.
#Leg Wound: On transfer, the patient was noted to have severe cellulitis and necrosis on his lower left leg.
Vascular believed the leg would eventually heal.
In addition, the patient was evaluated by transplant surgery and transplant ID who did not believe that the wound was a contraindication for transplant.
Following the transplant, plastic surgery recommendations included: accuzyme and wet-to-dry gauze dressing changes twice daily.
#ARF - Patient developed acute renal failure that presumably resulted from a combination of contrast nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
#Anemia - Likely from chronic disease, although stools were guiac positive with small amounts of bright red blood observable.
Previous EGD with known varices s/p banding and portal gastropathy in [**5-29**], colonoscopy in [**2120**] with diverticulosis.
Iron studies consistent with acute inflammatory state.
He was treated with lactulose and his mental status improved with resolution of his acute infection.
#Hep C cirrhosis/decompensated liver failure - Patient was followed at [**Hospital1 18**] for his liver disease.
The acute infection was treated and his liver function stabilized.
The work up for transplant was expedited in this patient because of the severe disease.
While in the hospital, he was listed for transplant.
At the time of the transplant he had approximately 5 to 6 liters of straw-colored/greenish ascites.
He had marked portal hypertension.
There has been no leakage from the site.
*Dressing changes to leg wound as directed (accuzyme, wet-to-dry gauze, covered by Kerlex and ACE wrap) twice daily.
*Monitor wound for increased necrotic tissue, foul odor or drainage.
*Monitor abdominal incision for redness, drainage or bleeding.
*Avoid showering until leg wound more well healed *PICC line care per protocol *Continue Ertapenem (for leg wound) through [**2-9**]  Followup Instructions: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 156**] TRANSPLANT SOCIAL WORK Date/Time:[**2124-1-12**] 9:00 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 707**], MD, PHD[**MD Number(3) 708**]:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2124-1-12**] 9:40 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 707**], MD, PHD[**MD Number(3) 708**]:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2124-1-19**] 10:40                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 707**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 709**]
