Admission Date:  [**2180-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-8-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10682**] Chief Complaint: Acute renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10528**] is an 81yo male with history of prostate cancer , s/p TURP [**3-/2180**], paroxysmal afib, and HTN who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for further evaluation of his ARF, poor urine output and ongoing atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Mr. [**Known lastname 10528**] was initially seen at OSH ED at [**Hospital3 **] where he presented complaining of poor urine output x 1 week and shortness of breath.
At OSH, noted to have Cr elevation to 15 and acute renal failure felt to be secondary to possible obstruction so foley catheter placed and he produced a generous amount of hematuria.
He also had hyperkalemia which was treated with 10 Units insulin w/ dextrose.
Also given lasix 20mg for crackles on lung exam and fluid overload on CXR.
Got diltiazem 20mg IV x 2 for atrial fibrillation with good effect for while until his Afib flared again soon after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He soon went back into rapid Afib with RVR with rates to 150s and drop in systolic blood pressures to 90s.
Of note, patient's prostate issues date back to [**8-/2179**] after p/w ARF and admission for pelvic pain and constipation.
At that time he had a CT abd/pelvis witout contrast revealed a massively dilated bladder and enlarged prostate (5.2cm) and bilateral hydronephrosis.
Pathology revealed invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma in 11 out of 12 locations, all of which  were either [**Doctor Last Name **] 4+4 or [**Doctor Last Name **] 4+5.
On arrival to the ICU, he appeared to be in no apparent distress.
Denies chest pain, dizziness, flank pain and states still some mild abdominal pain but nausea better.

Neck: supple, JVP elevated to 10cm, no LAD, skin over neck very stiff and prominent neck veins superficially as well Lungs: Bibasilar crackles.

No CVA or flank TTP.

The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, due the presence of a large hiatal hernia.
There is bilateral atelectasis.
There is a small posterior pleural effusion, possibly with some nearby patchy opacity, seen on the lateral view.
IMPRESSION: 1) COPD 2) Large hiatal hernia 3) No chf 4) Small posterior effusion.
5) Equivocal small infiltrate posteriorly, seen only on the lateral view - vs atelectasis.
There is mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
No renal stone seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
Collapsed urinary bladder with a Foley.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion most prominent around the right atrium, and without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-8-27**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and mild mitral regurgitation is no longer seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10528**] was transferred from OSH to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for acute renal failure (Cr=14) and afib with RVR, found to have urinary retention, and his creatinine improved steadily after urinary catheter placement.
# Acute renal failure, postobstructive:  After Foley was placed, a large quantity of urine drained.
Renal U/S revealed mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
# Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  Pt has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with RVR.
A. Fib was thought to be instigated by urinary obstruction and electrolyte abnormalities from acute renal failure.
# Dyspnea: Small pleural effusions were found on CXR explaining his dyspnea, likely secondary to fluid overload (obstruction) and renal failure.
He had no complaints of SOB by discharge and he was satting well on room air.
Likely dilutional effects.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, HA .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute renal faliure .
Secondary: Urinary retention Atrial fibrillation Prostate cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with kidney failure due to inability to urinate and bladder distention.
