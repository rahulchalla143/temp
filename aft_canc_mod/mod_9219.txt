Name:  [**Known lastname 10565**],[**Known firstname 194**]               Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 10566**]  Admission Date:  [**2182-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-1-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MED  Allergies: Danazol / Cefepime / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8956**] Chief Complaint: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, admitted for chemotherapy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of Hickman Catheter  History of Present Illness: This is a 68-year old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome transformed into acute myelogenous leukemia (type M6A) diagnosed one month ago who was initially admitted for treatment with low-dose Ara-C and Hydroxyurea.
Her disease was initially diagnosed secondary to pancytopenia with circulating blast forms and a bone marrow in [**2182-5-9**].
She was initially treated with Procrit and weekly transfusions with packed red blood cells and Danazol from which she developed an allergic reaction.
Over the last week prior to admission, she developed increased fatigue.
Past Medical History: As above, history of myelodysplastic syndrome transformed into acute myelogenous leukemia.
No prior surgeries or prior hospitalizations.
HEENT: no scleral icterus, MMM, no evidence of sores CV: RRR, no murmur, no rub.
Decreased BS bilateral bases with mild fine crackles.
3+ edema B/L LE to the thighs.
Mild erythema over abd.
the patient did not show any signs of tumor lysis by laboratories.
FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA ISSUES:  The patient had fevers up to 103 as well as neutropenia.
The cefepime was discontinued and switched to aztreonam because of a diffuse rash.
AmBisome was eventually started for continued fevers, but then discontinued secondary to acute renal failure and switched to voriconazole.
Vancomycin levels have been very elevated and was being dosed by levels.
Urine cultures from [**7-28**] grew 10:100,000 enterococcus with sensitivities pending.
In addition, patient later developed a respiratory infection of unclear etiology as sputum gram stain and cultures were negative.
Cipro and aztreonam were added for double coverage of nosomial organisms, and flagyl as added for concern of anaerobic organisms associated with aspiration.
However, near the end of her hospital course, patient continued to have intermittent episodes of fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  In the setting of thrombocytopenia, the patient developed melanotic stools on the Bone Marrow Transplant floor.
She continued to have a slow gastrointestinal bleed.
She requires HLA typed and matched platelets secondary to antibodies.
However, upon return to the bone marrow transplant unit, patient passed a large melanotic stool (although it is unclear whether or not this was old blood from initial GI bleed, since patient had been constipated for quite a few days), and patient was re-admitted to the intensive care unit.
Abdominal CT scan without contrast revealed no peritoneal fluid, no free air, and no signs of bowel ischemia.
In addition, it was felt that due to the patient?????
?s profound thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that she would not survive surgical intervention.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient developed hypotension with mean arterial pressures in the 40s; asymptomatic.
The differential diagnoses included sepsis, gastrointestinal bleed, excessive losses from fever and rash as well as capillary leak syndrome.
Upon restarting dopamine, patient had episodes of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias without hemodynamic compromise, however, it was felt that since patient was assymptomatic with hypotension and renal function was not restored with dopamine (see below), that the pressor was more likely to cause harm than benefit the patient.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of up to 3.2.
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts.
The likely insult was hypotension in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed.
Urine also showed eosinophils - possible acute interstitial nephritis from multiple drugs.
?s urinary output did improve at one point, suggesting a post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis, and prednisone was stopped.
Patient gradually became fluid overloaded, and with FeNa<1%, it was felt that this was due to a pre-renal cause, likely congestive heart failure.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seen on computerized axial tomography with a longstanding history of smoking.
In addition, as stated above, patient began to undergo congestive heart failure, with pulmondary edema initially responsive to lasix diuresis.
During latter part of hospital course, patient also developed a respiratory infection of unknown etiology despite continuous broad-spectrum antibiotics.
RASH ISSUES:  The patient developed a diffuse erythematous blanching rash which was likely secondary to drug effect - cefepime versus vancomycin.
The Dermatology Service was consulted, and a biopsy was consistent with hypersensitivity reaction.
Approximately a week after vancomycin was discontinued, rash began to slowly improve, starting in the face and trunk.
