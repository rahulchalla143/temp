Admission Date:  [**2184-11-10**]       Discharge Date: [**2184-11-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2145-4-2**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with a long history of left temporal anaplastic oligodendroglioma, presenting with a questionable onset of new type of seizure.
The patient was diagnosed with this tumor in [**2170**], at which time she had debulking of the tumor with irradiation.
Over the past few years, the patient has had a characteristic seizure disorder associated with the tumor.
Her atypical seizures consisted of drooling and fine arm and hand shaking for 1 minute bilaterally.
When her head imaging showed decreased edema after the decadron was lowered, the patient started to have language difficulties, with diminished comprehension and verbal output, and although she was totally ambulatory 1 month prior to admission, she had a fall 4 weeks prior to the day of admission with head trauma, and afterwards had increasing right-sided weakness.
Her decadron was then increased shortly after these deficits were realized.
On the day prior to admission, the patient had a 15 minute episode of a staring spell with glassy eyes and unresponsiveness after a near-fall.
The staring spell was considered by her caretakers to be a new seizure type, and she was brought to the Emergency Room for further evaluation.
According to the patient's father, the patient attempted to get out of the wheelchair and her father was helping her transfer from the wheelchair to the bed when he noticed that she had a staring spell, and there was a questionable loss of consciousness as she went to the floor.
In the ED, emergent imaging showed large left temporal left mass with swelling and hemorrhage with a 2 cm midline shift to the left.
Subsequent MRI did show the left lobe tumor with substantial edema and midline shift associated with subfalcine herniation.
The patient then was reimaged on MRI, and a new imaging showed a new large necrotic mass in the left frontal lobe with significant worsening of surrounding vasogenic edema with a midline shift to the right.
She also demonstrated mass effect in the left lateral ventricle.
Her cardiac rhythm was regular rate with S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities showed no edema.
The patient was intermittently able to follow simple midline commands, but could not follow complex commands.
However, the patient did have a dense right hemiplegia.
The patient also was thrombocytopenic on admission with a platelet count of 41.
The patient's UA did show evidence of a urinary tract infection which was confirmed by urine culture positive for E. coli.
The patient's latest head CT on [**2184-11-12**] showed a slightly decreased degree of edema and mass effect, and a slight decrease in the size of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, but showed unchanged mass effect and substantial edema with surrounding hemorrhage.
The patient was kept NPO for 3 days because of her mental status and received a PEG tube on Friday, [**11-12**], while on the floor to help her with her nutritional intake.
The patient's neurologic exam remained unchanged while the patient was on the general medical floors, with a dense right-sided hemiplegia and full power on the left side.
The patient's disposition was decided by the family, deciding that hospice was the best option for this patient with an extremely poor prognosis of her recurrent brain tumor.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient and her family have agreed to follow hospice rules regarding aggressiveness of treatment and the level of supportive treatment they will receive in the case that [**Known firstname 3551**] does decompensate from her left recurrent brain tumor.
The patient's family was in agreement that the patient's prognosis was poor, and that supportive measures, although helpful, would eventually not change her diagnosis, or her prognosis.
The patient also had oral thrush throughout the admission which was treated with nystatin and was continued in the hospice medications.
