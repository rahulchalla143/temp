He has been handling his own secretions and ENT evaluation confirmed that there was no vocal cord edema.
There was some concern for Ludwig's angina, with his concomitant neck pain and location of his inflammation (submandibular), but his presentation was most consistent with post-operative swelling.
# Pain control: We tried to control his pain with fentanyl boluses, as he felt this was most helpful for him.
We would advise to continue at home with his as-needed regimen of oxycodone, and to contact ENT for further pain options if this is not adequately controlling his pain.
We monitored you closely to make sure that your breathing was not compromised and felt that you were safe to return home since your symptoms have improved and you have not had any respiratory distress.
