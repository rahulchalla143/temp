Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a chronically ill 67 yo female with CAD s/p CABG complicated by sternal wound infection, diastolic CHF admitted after JP drains fell out, found to have fever to 102 in ED and BCx + for enteroccocus and Coag neg staph, hospital course complicated by hypotension and pulmonary edema requiring MICU transfers with goals of care now focusing on comfort.
# Bacteremia: [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures grew enterococcus faecalis and coag neg staphyloccus both sensitiv to daptomycin.
She was afebrile without leukocytosis.
TTE did not show valve vegatations.
# Normocytic Anemia: Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
HCT dropped with daily survillience [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures and improved when [**Month/Day/Year **] draws were limited.
# Chronic sternal wound infection: Sternal wound is clean, dry, intact.
# Diabetes II: FS at goal, she did not require insulin and insulin sliding scale was stopped.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Stable on discharge.
# [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure: Patient was hypotensive for much of her admission, thought secondary to poor po intake and hypovolemia.
# Mental Status: Patient is AAOx person and place.
She has baseline low cognitive function likely secondary to chronic illness, frontal menigioma, depression, possible dementia.
Given patient's decline in functional status without evidence of improvement on aggressive medical care over the last several months, decision was made by the family to transition goals of care to comfort based care.
