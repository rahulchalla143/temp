# Infection: There was initially concern for a worsening pneumonia, but Infectious Disease did not feel this was the case.
The patient was diagnosed with a resistant Pseudomonal UTI, and was treated for this initally with ceftazadime, and then fosfomycin.
He will receive fosfomycin chronically, every 10 days, to prevent future UTIs given that he requires a Foley for urinary retention.
# Diarrhea with hypokalemia: The patient's diarrhea was significant, and was initially thought to be antibiotic-associated.
He required significant IV repletion of his potassium.
C. diff testing was negative, and a repeat stool culture (prior from 12d prior to admission was negative) and ova & parasites were no growth to date at the time of discharge.
Because of persistent diarrhea despite loperamide, GI was consulted.
On discharge he was having only [**1-30**] stools a day, and his hypokalemia had stabilized, and required only oral repletion.
He should be re-evaluated for this in a few weeks (see follow-up appointments) and if his diarrhea has slowed (as his bowel recovers from broad spectrum antibiotics), his anti-diarrheals may be able to be tapered or stopped, and his oral potassium may be able to be stopped.
# Atrial fibrillation -- continued home aspirin and metoprolol.
He has been deemed a poor candidate for anticoagulation given his fluctuating platelet counts with CLL and high risk for fall.
# Urinary retention: Due to BPH.
Urinary retention being managed as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 151**] chronic Foley to be changed q4wks.
Last treated with alemtuzumab from [**11/2194**] through [**1-/2195**], discontinued due to infections.
Also continued valgancyclovir daily for CMV prophylaxis.
Echo [**2-/2195**] showed normal LVEF and no evidence of diastolic dysfuntion or R sided failure.
Likely due to CLL adenopathy.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low potassium due to diarrhea.
Your diarrhea was thought to be due to your antibiotics, which were given for pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
Because your diarrhea and low potassium persisted, Gastroenterology evaluated you.
