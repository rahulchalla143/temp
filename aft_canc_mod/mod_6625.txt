Pt was admitted to ICU, chest CT revealed left hemithorax collapse.
Pt has also developed intermitted afib to 100s while on beta blocker.

Anti-D antibody is clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions.
A wallet card and a letter stating the above will be sent to the patient.
[**2183-1-14**] CXR FINDINGS: No previous images.
Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with apparent cutoff of the bronchus.
This indicates that there is substantial loss of volume in the left hemithorax, most likely relating to mucus plug or a malignancy, possibly associated with a substantial pleural fluid as well.
[**2183-1-15**] PATHOLOGY MAINSTEM BRONCHUS DIAGNOSIS: Left mainstem bronchus tissue: The specimen consists almost entirely of blood and fibrin with a few detached bronchial epithelial cells and inflammatory cells.
No definite malignancy is identified.
[**2183-1-15**] EKG Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay.
Probable left atrial abnormality.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Non-specific anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2183-1-15**] EKG Three beats of sinus rhythm.
The rhythm then appears to be atrial fibrillation at 90 beats per minute.
Diffuse anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
It then appears to convert to atrial fibrillation with relatively controlled ventricular response.
ST-T wave changes are slightly more prominent.
[**2183-1-15**] CXR SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is interval improved opacification of the left upper lobe with persistent dense opacification of the left lower lobe (obscuring the adjacent hemidiaphragm), which may represent atelactasis or an effusion.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
There is increased density along the left lateral hemithorax with complete opacification of the left apex, which may represent pleural thickening or effusion.
Left lower lobe atelactasis vs effusion.
Left hilar and and lateral pleural opacity may represent pleural thickening or effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 74-year-old man with history of renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy and sorafenib, with lung mets s/p XRT for L obstruction presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with hemoptysis, tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy and further management.
# Left lung collapse and hemoptysis: CXR showing complete collapse of L lung with complete cutoff of left bronchus.
Was stable respiratorily and no fever or leukocytosis on admission.
Went to OR with IP with bronch showing complete LUL and lingula obstruction, tumor was resected and was patent afterwards; however had blood/mucus/pus behind obstruction and so got one dose of Zosyn and Vanc, and was discharged with one week of Levaquin.
An obstruction in the LLL was unable to be debrided and so IP planned for photodynamic therapy the week after admission, which was to be arranged by IP on discharge.
# Renal cell carcinoma: s/p R nephrectomy, XRT, and sorafenib.
# sCHF: EF 40%, no current evidence of heart failure.
Disp:*3 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left lung collapse from tumor invasion Renal cell cancer with metastases to lung systolic HF EF 40% HTN CAD s/p CABG hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 47780**],  It was a pleasure taking care of you.
You were admitted to the hospital with left lung collapse due to tumor invasion from your cancer.
You underwent bronchoscopy, where tumor was removed and part of your lung was re-expanded.
You will need to complete a course of phototherapy for additional management of the tumor in the lung.
You were noted to occasionally have an irritable atrial (heart) rhythm.
This is NOT the same as atrial fibrillation, and can be brought on by stressors such as infection, fever, anesthemsia, or procedures such as bronchoscopy.
