Admission Date:  [**2183-3-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-5-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-10-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: 58 y/o M presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] after a syncopal episode today where he sustained a facial hematoma.
Pt reports severe nosebleeds that began 2 days prior to admission.
On saturday, he was feeling lightheaded and developped severe right thigh pain.
On Sunday, he noticed decreased appetite, left thigh pain and fevers/chills.
Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] and was febrile to 101.2 and received Vanc and Ceftazidime for neutropenic fever.
He underwent head CT that revealed small foci of petechial hemorrhage within the left frontal lobe and small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He underwent CTA that was negative for PE and received 2L of NS IVF.
On arrival, pt was complaining of right & left proximal thigh pain approx [**8-22**].
He was feeling exhausted and still mildly lightheaded.
Family History: Father died of metastatic prostate cancer in his 80s, mother alive with HTN and insulin resistance.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 137/73 P: 83 R: 20 O2: 975 on RA General: alert, oriented, large ecchymosis over left orbit, eye swollen shut HEENT: sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx with dried blood Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, precervical lymphadenopathy Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, NABS, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly Inguinal: no inguinal lymphadenopathy Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses Neuro: CN 2-12 intact (except unable to assess left eye due to swelling & eccyhmoses).
No saddle anesthesia, no focal spinal tenderness.
Increased size of left frontal and right posterior cingulate gyrus intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
No midline shift.
No evidence of acute infarction.
[**2183-3-24**] MRI L/T-SPINE No evidence of acute spine injury within the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine.
Note is made of a fluid level within the lower lumbar spine, most consistent with layering subarachnoid blood.
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: an immature population of cells consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia.
Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) 40124**] to be consistent with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 y/o M presenting after syncopal episode found to have multiple small ICH and new pancytopenia.
He was started on ATRA and monitored closely for symptoms of DIC, TLS and ATRA syndrome.
# Fevers: He initially was on Vancomycin and cefepime when first starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home, but as his culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his antibiotics were discontinued.
He remained afebrile until [**4-14**] when he spiked a fever.
He complained of some thigh pain and we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections.
He then developed a pneumonia during his febrile period and was transferred to the ICU for several days.
Serial repeat head CTs showed slow decrease in size of his abscesses.
And an MRI of his thigh showed retained small fluid collections bilaterally.
# ICH: Pt with multiple small ICH sustained from fall with acute left sided head injury in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia.
CT head revealed small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
(no hydrocephalus or shift).
On [**3-24**] follow-up Head CT revealed interval increase in hemorrhage but without appreciable midline shift or infarction.
A repeat head CT one month after a fall showed the brain abscesses that were discussed above.
He also required heparin and then lovenox for DVTs, and repeat head CTs while on these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds.
No evidence of hematoma or cellulitis.
No bowel or bladder dysfunction, no saddle anesthesia, no focal spinal tenderness to indicate acute cord compression.
MRI or the T/L-spine revealed no evidence of acute cord compression.
There was evidence of layering fluid likely from the SAH.
Although unlikely to be causing the pt's leg pain (nerve irritation secondary to blood) Neurosurgery recommended starting Decadron on [**2182-3-24**].
# Afib - pt went into afib while in the ICU.
# Vasovagal bradycardia - the day prior to admission, while the patient was having a bowel movement, he was noted on telemetry to brady to the 30s, he felt light headed and it resolved in 5 minutes.
# DVTs - while patient was in the ICU, he developed bilaterally pedal edema, thought initially to be due to large amount of IVFs.
Because of his new afib, though, we did ultrasounds and found him to have DVTs in R leg, R arm (because he was edematous and had pain around a new PICC line).
It was put in place without complications.
Evenutally he was found to have bilaterally leg DVTs and then bilateral upper extremity DVTs.
# Access - pt initially had a subclavian line, then it was pulled while the patient was febrile in early [**Month (only) 958**].
For outpatient continuation of his 6 week course of antibiotics, a hickman was placed as PICCs could not be placed due to bilateraly UE DVTs.
Vesanoid 10 mg Capsule Sig: Five (5) Capsule PO twice a day for 14 days: No substitutions please.
You were found to have low blood counts and a bone marrow biospy showed that you have leukemia.
You also had some small areas of bleeding in your head that were stable based on repeat CT scans.
While you were here, you developed an infection both in your brain around the areas where the inital bleeds were found, as well as in your thighs.
You also developed blood clots in your arms and legs.
Lastly, you developed a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation.
You should return to the hospital for any fainting, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling in your extremities, palpitiations or any other concerns.
