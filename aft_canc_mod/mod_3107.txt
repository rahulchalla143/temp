Admission Date:  [**2112-10-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-10-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-10-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  NEUROSUR  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 56 year old man with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgery for C-4 compression fracture.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old man with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (with known liver metastases) who was at [**State 1558**] [**2112-10-13**] receiving radiation therapy session nine of 14 to an anterior neck mass.
MRI showed a large mass at C-4 (mass was initially seen on [**2112-9-29**], but was not causing symptoms at that time).
He had right shoulder weakness one week prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pathology on the spinal mass from the operation was metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Postoperatively patient complained of difficulty swallowing.
On [**2112-10-19**] he had an acute episode of shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray showed patchiness at bases consistent with aspiration.
CT of chest was obtained which showed fatty infiltration of the liver with multiple lesions, largest 2.7 cm, no pulmonary embolus, bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes, severe calcification of the coronary arteries consistent with coronary artery disease.
On [**10-20**] a swallow study showed high aspiration risk.
On [**2112-10-23**] he was found tachycardiac and unresponsive with respiratory rate of 5, systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
He recalled difficulty clearing a thick mucus plug prior to his episode of unresponsiveness that required intubation.
Overnight [**2112-10-24**] he was noted to be agitated and confused and this was felt to be due to delirium and sundowning.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastases.
Previously he had been receiving gemcitabine, but it was stopped because of severe edema.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of myocardial infarction at age 39.
Oropharynx slightly dry.
Neck difficult to assess given presence of neck brace.
Crackles at right base posteriorly.
Decreased breath sounds at left base.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Microbiology data included blood culture [**2112-10-25**] anaerobic bottle with gram positive cocci, aerobic bottle with coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
There was slight anterior kyphosis.
CT of chest [**2112-10-19**] showed fatty infiltration of liver with some round, relatively hyperdense lesions within it.
There was no pulmonary embolus present.
There was an air fluid level within the trachea which may be consistent with secretions or aspiration.
Chest x-ray [**2112-10-19**] at lung bases bilaterally there are patchy opacities which are new in comparison with the prior study, question aspiration.
Chest x-ray [**2112-10-25**] there is again evidence of patchy atelectasis at the left lung base and minimal atelectatic changes may also be present in the right lower lobe.
No evidence of failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 56 year old man with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for cervical spine surgery.
His postoperative course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia and respiratory arrest on [**2112-10-22**].
Per history it appears that the arrest occurred because he had a large mucus plug that he was unable to clear.
Hypercarbia then led to depressed mental status.
When we saw patient on [**2112-10-27**] he was breathing comfortably and reported only minimal sputum production.
Patient likely had aspiration pneumonia by history with x-rays showing bibasilar opacities and by increase in WBC from 10 to 20 on the day of the witnessed aspiration event.
Patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile on [**2112-10-27**].
Patient failed a repeat swallow study on [**2112-10-26**] and had severe aspiration of both thin and thick liquids.
Prior to his admission to the hospital his ability to swallow food had deteriorated greatly secondary to the mass in his neck.
Given this poor baseline swallowing as well as his difficulty with swallowing postoperatively, the decision was made to have a G-tube placed for nutrition.
