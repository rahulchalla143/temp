1 of 3 items at 5 minutes -CN: surgical pupils L>R with minimal response bilat EOMI.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Mildly dilated pulmonary arteries measuring 3.2 cm, which may represent pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Calcified tortuous thoracic aorta, however, please note the evaluation of aorta is limited due to poor opacification and timing.
Mild diffuse septal thickening in peripheral portion of the lungs.
Small mediastinal nodes.
[**2109-4-8**]: TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function  (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No intra-cardiac shunt detected.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **]M with CML, tachy-brady syndrome who presents with syncopal episode, found to be hypoxic with WBC of 50's.
Hypoxia - The most likely cause to the hypoxia was CHF and volume overload as the hypoxia resolved with diuresis.
Although the chest xray was relative unremarkable for pulmonary edema.
Further evaluation with CTA was negative except for septal thickening and possible elevated PA pressures.
Note was made that although his initial ABG showed a pO2 of 60 c/w hypoxia, his pulse-oximetry was inconsistent likely related to the wide pulse variability secondary to this frequent ectopic rhythm.
Tachy-brady: The patient has a history of tachy likely aflutter with 2:1 conduction which managing with beta-blockade has been limited by symptomatic brady-cardia.
His syncope was most likely related to a bradycardic event.
Syncope - The cause of the syncope was thought to be a transient bradycardic event.
He remained asymptomatic during his hospital stay despite his irregular heartrate which was felt to be predominantly a low-atrial ectopic rhythm.
The TTE revealed no evidence of outflow obstruction as the cause of the syncope.
Mental Status - There was initial concern for altered mental status.
CML with elevated WBC: The patient has a long history of CML and has been on hydrea for maintenance of the blood counts.
He presented with elevated WBC and plts but no evidence of blasts in the periphery to suggest blast crisis.
HTN - titrate beta-blocker as tolerated by heart rate.
hypothyroid - no active issues.
There was a mildly elevated TSH but in the setting of the acute illness, no changes to his thyroid replacement was made.
- You should no longer take Lisinopril for high blood pressure.
