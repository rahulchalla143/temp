In the MICU, the pt was treated for his metabolic acidosis that was thought to be a combonation of gap acidosis from ARF and non gap acidosis from GI losses/diarrhea with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
The pt received bicarb for repleation.
However, the pt remained very agitated and confused.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 3.

Severe diarrhea - The patient's diarrhea continued without significant change despite scheduled imodium for the last week in addition to escalating doses of somatostatin.
CT of the abdomen was without evidence of Crohn's flare.
Crohn's - - He was initially placed on cipro prophylaxis for Crohn's, but this was eventually discontinued.
ARF - Resolved prerenal ARF with hydration; baseline .7; to peak of 2.1 on admission.
The titration of his insulin however was very difficult as he had multiple episodes of asymptomatic hypoglycemia when placed on more aggressive insulin regimens.
Anemia - Hct slowly trending down.
Iron studies show a mixed picture, likely combination of ACD and iron deficiency.
Thrombocytopenia - HIT POSITIVE.
UTI-the patient had leucocytosis to 11 on [**6-1**] w/ dysuria and hypoglycemia.
While the speciation was pending, we empirically started bactrim but persistently positive ua so this was d/c'd after 6 days.
A straight cath ucx grew enterococci sensitive to ampcillin and macrodantin.
