Admission Date:  [**2144-10-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-10-24**]   Service:  THORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was a patient who was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for management of a new right middle lobe nodule.
At that time, he was described by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as a pleasant and delightful 83-year-old gentleman who has been previously treated for low-grade lymphoma of the stomach, which had been discovered about nine to ten years previously.
A recent CT scan was performed to follow stable pulmonary nodules which demonstrated growth of the right middle lobe nodule.
At that time, he was not having any significant weight loss, no hemoptysis or sputum production, no chest pain, no musculoskeletal or neurologic complaints, and the remainder of his review of systems was otherwise negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for Alzheimer's disease which is mild to moderate in severity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia repair.
The decision was made to have him move in with his wife to the retirement community after his sons found him changing an electrical circuit with the electricity on, as well as other unsafe situations.
ENT examination demonstrated no supraclavicular or cervical or thyroid masses.
His heart was regular, with no murmur.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, no masses.
Axillae and groin showed no adenopathy.
The extremities showed no clubbing or edema.
His skin showed no lesions.
The thorax showed no asymmetry, masses or lesions.
CT of the chest performed on [**2141-6-21**] showed no evidence of right middle lobe lesions.
On [**2144-6-9**], the lesion had increased to 1.3 mm in greatest dimension, and finally the most recent CT scan of [**2144-9-8**], the right middle lobe lesion was more spiculated and increased to the size of 1.9 mm in greatest dimension.
There was no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusion seen.
There was diffuse thickening of the gastric wall, which is unchanged from previous CT scans, consistent with the patient's prior history of gastric lymphoma.
IMPRESSION:  The patient was likely at significant risk for possible lung carcinoma.
PLAN:  He was therefore scheduled for right middle lobe lobectomy.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, as well as right middle lobe lobectomy with pericardial patch that was completed on [**2144-10-21**].
He received 1700 cc of Crystalloid, and had minimal blood loss.
Postoperatively, the patient was seen by the EPS service, was on an epidural for pain management, otherwise had no issues.
At his postoperative check, he was doing well and had no complaints.
He had no air leak on his chest tube.
He had good pain control.
He was noted to have a right lower lobe collapse by chest x-ray.
The chest x-ray was obtained after the patient had significant signs of hypoxemia and tachypnea.
Additionally at this time, the patient was requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, as postoperatively he did have some relative hypotension and anuria.
The primary complaint and issues seem to be his secretion management and also this new right lower lobe collapse.
By [**2144-10-25**], the patient had been seen by the Infectious Disease service for some fever spikes.
He had also been intubated postoperatively at this point due to some respiratory failure and what was presumed to be adult respiratory distress syndrome vs aspiration event.
The fever spikes, it was unclear if there was a septic etiology to them to explain why he presented with adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Ultimately at this time also it became clear that the patient suffered from a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung with a diffuse pulmonary infiltrate seen by chest x-rays with this fever spike, having persistent pressor requirements and severe hypoxemia and an adult respiratory distress syndrome net protocol for support.
His BUN and creatinine were 54 and 2.2, and he was having persistent marginal urine outputs.
Ultimately he was taken off of pressure control ventilation which had been utilized initially to manage his hypoxemia and also his adult respiratory distress syndrome.
He was ultimately switched to assist control and then to CPAP and pressure support, however, his pulmonary situation did not markedly improve, and he had persistent bilateral fluffy infiltrates.
His chest roentgenography was always consistent with a possible picture of adult respiratory distress syndrome vs aspiration.
He still required significant ventilatory support and, from a hemodynamic standpoint, he had had some intermittent atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone bolusing and drips, as well as having blood pressure requirements with Levophed support, ultimately to allow for some renal perfusion.
During his postoperative course for his postoperative renal failure, he was seen by the Renal service, which recommended keeping his blood pressure greater than 120 and to continue the lasix drip as we had been doing, to continue to ensure that the patient did not have any issue of pulmonary edema.
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place, which was not showing any significant hemodynamics concerning for any type of failure.
It was clear that the patient was suffering from a neurologic deficit.
The corneas had bilateral reflexes positive bilaterally.
He was seen by the Neurology service, and the impression was that his examination was remarkable for depressed cortical function with preserved brain stem function, with decreased level of consciousness, perhaps secondary to several factors.
Given the renal insufficiency, sedative and narcotic medications, an MRI of the brain was recommended to exclude metastatic disease of the brain.
He, in consultation with his brother, as well as the patient's wife, ultimately decided to withdraw care due to the bleak outlook and his poor prognosis from his poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, the adult respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and now CNS depression and decreased cortical function, all consistent with possible multi-organ system failure.
His sedatives and narcotics were removed and, after approximately a 35 minute hiatus without any sedation, his examination revealed that he had fixed and dilated pupils.
He had no doll's eye reflex.
He had no spontaneous respirations, no heart sounds, no carotid, no femoral pulses, no radial pulses.
He was not responding to any painful stimuli.
He had no corneal reflexes.
Other diagnoses include poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe status post right middle lobe lobectomy complicated by respiratory failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, as well as acute renal failure, depressed cortical function with intact brain stem function prior to removal of support.
Post-support, the patient had no evidence of brain stem function, no evidence of cortical function.
