He reports he has had several days of lethargy, low grade fevers, non productive cough and DOE.
Was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-4**] with these complaints and exam was notable for bibasilar rales, R>L LE edema.
CXR was done which showed a new right pleural effusion and vascular congestion.
PCP was concerned for new CHF, w/ question of viral cardiomyopathy given recent episode of labryinthitis and started patient on lasix 20 mg PO daily and ordered echo.
TTE was performed on [**3-6**] which showed mild concentric LVH w/ normal left and right ventricular fx (EF 65%), PA systolic pressure of 30 mmHg, a small pericardial effusion w/o evidence of tamponade.
He was seen in f/u clinic when exam was notable for new tachycardia to 110s, BP 130/60, O2 sat of 92%, and [**1-12**]+ edema in R lower leg with JVP of 6 and pulsus of 5.
Exam was notable for mildly tachypnea and a mildly swollen RLE with a positive [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign.
Patient underwent CTA of the chest which showed bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the right upper, middle, and lower segmental vessels and the left lower lobe segmental branches.
There was no CT evidence of R heart strain.
CT was also notable for a R pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules, and hilar/mediastinal LAD.
His oxygen requirement increased to 4L and he was saturating 92% on 4L at the time of transfer to the floor.

No evidence of pneumothorax.
Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests layering effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Partially occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein with occlusive thrombus in the right posterior tibial and peroneal veins.
No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with relative sparing of the left upper lobe branches.
Attenuated pulmonary arteries and mild leftward interventricular septal bowing concerning for right heart strain.
Conglomerate soft tissue density within the right hilus concerning for a primary lung carcinoma.
Peribronchovascular opacities, as well as septal thickening are concerning for extension of tumor and lymphangitic spread.
Moderate-to-severe mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hilar adenopathy.
Moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, both concerning for malignant involvement.
Numerous basilar pulmonary nodules concerning for hematogenous metastatic spread.
There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function 3.
The right ventricle is mildly enlarged.
RA collapses in atrial systole possibly consistent with hypovolemia 6.
The aortic valve is trileaflet and is mildly thickened with trace aortic insufficiency 7.
Estimated PA systolic pressure, calculated from peak TR velocity, is 30 mmHg above RA pressure.
Small concentric pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of cardiac tamponade.
Echodensity seen along RA wall in the effusion (subcostal view), which is probably the wall of the RA in motion, collapsing from low filling pressures, but cannot exclude clot.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Degerative changes of the thoracic spine and shoulders.
No evidence of metastatic disease in the brain.
A small focus of slightly increased signal intensity in the left parietal bone posteriorly on the FLAIR and DWI sequences -suspicious for osseous lesion- correlate with non-contrast CT Head and Bone scan.
No evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral pulmonary nodules as discussed on recent CT chest.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo M w/ h/o DM and prostate ca s/p resection presenting with DOE and RLE found to have submassive PE and new lung mass and right pleural effusion.
#) Pulmonary embolism: Extensive clot burden with BNP of >1000, mild signs of septal bowing on echo, no evidence of RV strain on exam.
Pt was initially treated with heparin drip, Given extensive pulmonary emboli, RLE DVT, and possible malignancy with unclear plans for further workup, a retrievable IVC filter was placed by interventional radiology without issue.
Pt was then transitioned to enoxaparin, which he will continue given anticipated need for biopsy soon.
Pt initially required 4L nc, which showed rapid improvement.
Bilateral lower extremity dopplers showed RLE DVT.
Pt was treated with heparin drip and enoxaparin 90mcg sc bid as above for pulmonary embolism.
Pt's right lower extremity swelling improved rapidly with anticoagulation and by date of discharge, his lower extremities were equal in size.
Pt only reported mild tenderness to palpation of right lower extremity.
#) Pulmonary nodules/hilar mass: Hilar mass is new finding and per radiology, tracking w/ bronchovascular structures makes it concerning for primary lung process.
No family history of malignanacy.
Most recent CT scan [**2176-10-11**] without evidence of hilar mass.
In setting of hilar and mediastinal LAD and unprovoked DVT, there is concern for stage 4 pulmonary malignancy (due to effusion).
Does have a hx of remote melanoma and prostate CA.
Abnormal cells were noted on effusion (see below).
Pt had imaging including CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, MR head, and bone scan with no clear metastatic disease, but extensive malignant disease in the chest w/ hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and signs of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Pt's workup will depend on the results of Pt's pleural effusion cytology, which is still pending.
If cytology is positive for malignant cells, malignant effusion automatically places at stage 4.
If effusion analysis is negative for malignant cells, Pt may have further workup with biopsy.
No h/o CHF and no evidence of cardiac dysfunction on recent TTE, making this etiology less likely.
1.4L of serosanguinous fluid was removed.
Pt has exudative effusion by cholesterol, protein, ldh.
Pt's oxygenation and respiration greatly improved after right thoracentesis.
Pt had no evidence of re-accumulation by day of discharge.
#) Cough:  Dry cough with deep inspiration likely from pulmonary embolism.
Pt felt some relief with [**Year (4 digits) 108422**]-codeine syrup and was discharged with a prescription.
#) Fever / urinary tract infection: temp to 100.4 on [**3-7**], initially suspected clot fever from thrombus/embolism resorption.
#) hematuria: somewhat bloody urine previously, attributed to foley, which has since been removed.
Little to no hematuria now.
#) Diabetes mellitus: usually diet controlled.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Pleural effusion cytology still pending.
-Will need to follow-up oxygen requirement and assess for pleural effusion reaccumulation.
-[**Month (only) 116**] need repeat imaging to assess treatment of pulmonary emboli.
-Pt has a retrievable IVC filter which should be removed as soon as his staging / biopsy procedures are completed.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 108423**],  You came to the hospital because you had shortness of breath and fatigue.
You were found to have multiple blood clots (pulmonary emboli) in your lungs and a blood clot in your right leg.
You were started on blood thinners to treat these clots in the intensive care unit and stabilized before you were transferred to the medical floor.
You were also noted to have a lung mass.
Depending on the results of the lung fluid studies, you may need to have a bronchoscopy and biopsy.
You had several imaging studies that were requested by your cancer doctors, and they will discuss the results with you.
We have made the following changes to your medications:  STOP taking furosemide (lasix) (you were on this for presumed congestive heart failure, but you do not have this diagnosis)  START using oxygen via nasal canula as needed START taking ciprofloxacin 500mg tablets, one tab by mouth every 12 hours for 2 weeks START using enoxaparin (Lovenox) subcutaneous injections, 100mg, every 12 hours until instructed to stop by your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking [**Name5 (PTitle) 108422**] AC (with codeine) 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid  Five mL by mouth every four hours as needed for cough: Do not drive or operate machinery on this medication.
