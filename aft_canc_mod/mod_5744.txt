Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -[**2189-2-9**] ERCP complicated by duodenal perforation -[**2189-2-10**] External biliary drain placement by interventional radiology   History of Present Illness: 84F w/ possible duodenal perforation during ERCP today.
Pt w/ complicated medical history including A-fib requiring coumadin, hypertension and CHF initially presented to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital ED three days ago w/ fatigue, diarrhea & hypotension.
After stabilization of her bleeding and blood pressure, she underwent CT abdomen which demonstrated a mass in the head of her pancreas.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP and possible stent placement.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin - CHF - HTN - Depression - Hard of hearing .
PSH: - appendectomy - cholecystectomy   Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission: 97.9  110AF  115/80  18  100%RA Somnolent, somewhat confused (A&O to self) Icteric skin, scleral icertus No cervical, supraclavicular or axial lymphadenopathy Irreg irreg CTA bilat Abd w/ well healed midline surgical scar.
Nontender throughout.
No shake tenderness.
Lower extremities edematous w/ brawny skin changes .
Significant amount of retroperitoneal free air with discontinuity of the wall of the 2nd part of the duodenum.
Findings are consistent with duodenal perforation.
Moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4.8 cm pancreatic head mass consistent with neoplasm.
Enhancing liver lesion suspicious for metastasis.
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation due to pancreatic neoplasm.
Obstruction of the distal common bile duct on the basis of extrinsic compression by extraluminal mass.
Moderate diffuse intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Persistent extensive retroperitoneal free air predominantly within the right hemiabdomen; however, with interval decrease to prior.
No extraluminal oral contrast or retroperitoneal collection here.
Similar anasarca, ascites and third spacing.
Interval increase in bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis at the lung bases.
Known large pancreatic head mass consistent with neoplasm.
Similar enhancing liver lesion concerning for metastasis.
No intrahepatic biliary duct dilation; status post external biliary drainage catheter into the common bile duct.
Similar prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: Post her ERCP for pancreatic head mass the patient was transferred to the TSICU with NGT in place given concern for duodenal perforation.
CT a/p with NGT and IV contrast demonstrated massive pneumoperitoneum/RP free air consistent with duodenal perforation.
Her abdomen remained soft during this time with very mild epigastric discomfort, and she did not display septic signs.
The drain was not able to be internalized at that time secondary to peri-ampullary swelling.
She returned to IR on [**2189-2-12**] for attempt at internalization of her biliary drain.
They noted possible inferior ST wave depressions despite normalization of BP after HR control.
Instead, they requested repeat CT scan, which showed no active extravasation of contrast from the duodenum.
[**2189-2-14**] CDiff returned positive and she was begun on IV flagyl (in addition to her IV unasyn).
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: ERCP complicated by duodenal perforation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an ERCP procedure to evaluate a mass at the head of your pancreas.
The procedure was complicated by a perforation of your duodenum, and you were started on IV antibiotics and underwent a bile-duct drain placement by the interventional radiologists.
The drain was not able to be internalized because you did not tolerate the anesthesia for this procedure, and your family elected to hold off on having it internalized for now.
You are being discharged on oral antibiotics which you should continue to take (both for your duodenal perforation and for a colon infection called "C Diff" which you developed while in the hospital).
Please return to the ED or call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] office if you experience fevers/chills/nausea/vomiting, have uncontrollable abdominal pain, notice a change in color in your drain output, or if the drain becomes dislodged.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital of hematology-oncology to discuss the best next steps going forward for your pancreatic mass (possibly chemotherapy).
