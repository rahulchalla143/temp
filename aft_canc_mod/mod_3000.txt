Studies: CXR [**2179-8-27**]: "There is a patchy opacity in the posterior recesses in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe suspicious for a pneumonia.
The previously noted reticular interstitial opacities in the left suprahilar and right perihilar regions are again noted and relatively stable.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.
There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles which may be due to small underlying effusions.
"No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
New area of consolidation is noted within the left lower lobe which in correct clinical setting might represent development of  pneumonia.
"2.The extensive interstitial thickening accompanied by lower lung predominant ground glass attenuation and scattered small nodules are unchanged.
Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
Evidence of previous asbestos exposure with calcified pleural plaques."
A/P: 76M h/o CLL (dx in [**2165**], s/p splenectomy and chemo, last dose on [**7-21**]), DM, HTN, BPH s/p TURP and indwelling foley, PAF on coumadin presented with gross hematuria, INR of 13.4.
Admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring, hemodynamically stable overnight, transferred to BMT service for resolution of coagulopathy and continued monitoring.
#) Gross hematuria: Hematuria was only noted in the ED, and by the time Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] arrived in the ICU it had cleared.
Has been hemodynamically stable since presentation and hematuria resolved.
#) Supratherapeutic INR: Initial top of the differential was drug interaction (given recent antibiotics): the patient had very high doses of coumadin (19mg/20mg daily alternating) together with recent cipro and fluconazole treatment initiated at [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellseley.
#) Questionable LLL pneumonia on CXR: Pulmonary attending in ICU felt pneumonia not most likely diagnosis.
He has been afebrile and has had no change in his cough.
Not covered in the ICU overnight with no bad effect.
In the ED, UA was positive for nitrite and bacteria but no WBC, suggesting chronic colonization.
#) CLL: Dx in [**2165**], s/p splenectomy and chemo; last on [**2179-7-21**] c/b febrile neutropenia requiring admission.
#) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
#) Diabetes mellitus.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR weekly; fax results to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 51492**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Care Solutions, Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Hematuria secondary to elevated INR Chronic lymphocytic leukemia   Discharge Condition: Stable hematocrit, no hematuria, tolerating PO   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with blood in your urine and elevated INR.
