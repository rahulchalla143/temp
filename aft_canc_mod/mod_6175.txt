Briefly, pt is a 63 y/o F hx NHL s/p CHOP who has since developed progressively worsening SOB and DOE (baseline is 2LNC at home).
She tells me that her SOB and DOE really started after CHOP and also after a trip to Fla in [**9-26**] where she stayed in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and contracted "black mold."
ROS + cough green-yellow sputum increased in thickness X few weeks.
+ headache, no CP, palpitations, fever, chills, + nightsweats, + weight gain post chemo.
No XRT # Hypertension # Cerebral aneursym s/p clips # OSA: did not use cpap for a long time # Hypothyroid  Social History: SH: Pt lives with partner.

No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] LUNGS: occaisonal wheezes, no labored breathing ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
No evidence of pneumonia.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Diffuse airtrapping throughout the lungs with emphysematous change.
There is no large effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic function.
High Resolution Chest CT: Again seen are diffuse scattered areas of ground-glass opacity throughout the lungs bilaterally, in a somewhat mosaic pattern.
Areas of both increased density and increased lucency are seen suggesting mixed infiltrative and obstructive process.
There are no focal consolidations.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are seen; however, none appear to meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There are no pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes.
No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions are identified.
Right-sided port again identified.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse multifocal ground-glass opacities in a predominating mosaic pattern, worse when compared to [**2187-11-20**], little changed from [**2188-3-30**].
Findings are most concerning for hypersensitivity reaction.
Other diagnostic considerations include possibly drug reaction or bronchiolitis obliterans.
b)  Subpleural fibrosis with honeycomb change.
b)  Subpleural fibrosis with honeycomb change.
The differential diagnosis includes an infection process, sarcoidosis and less likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Brief Hospital Course:  # Dyspnea: The patient was admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia.
She was thought to be volume overloaded and diuresed.
During her hospital stay, her shortness of breath improved subjectively although she still had significant dyspnea on exertion.
She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs q6hours; no steroids or Advair.
She was switched from Tiotropium and Advair to Combivent 4 times daily as her symptoms and oxygenation appeared to improve with frequent nebs.
Echo showed no evidence of systolic or diastolic heart failure.
PFT's showed obstrutive pattern with increased lung volumes and reduced diffusion capacity.
High Resolution Chest CT showed diffuse multifocal ground-glass opacities in a predominating mosaic pattern, worse when compared to [**2187-11-20**].
VATS showed numerous non-necrotizing granulomas c/w sarcoidosis.
# Purulent discharge from port-a-cath: On [**2188-4-6**], the lumen of the patient's port-a-cath was found to be draining discharge.
A wound culture was sent, found to have 3+ PMN's but no organisms grew.
The patient showed no sign of systemic infection w/o fevers, leukocytosis or chills.
# Hypertension: Beta-blocker was stopped to reduce any contribution to obstructive lung disease.
ACE-i was considered but the patient appeared to be in acute renal failure.
# ARF: Baseline creatinine from OSH records appears to be 0.9-1.0.
The acute renal failure may have been due either to IV contrast or diuresis on admission.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Dextromethorphan-Guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) ML PO Q6 () as needed for cough for 10 days.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
Discharge Diagnosis: Sarcoid   Discharge Condition: stable, continues to require 2-3L NC to maintain SaO2 >92%   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is also important that you take calcium and vit D to prevent decreased bone density on prednisone.
Start taking Fosamax to prevent osteoporosis while being on prednisone.
Take tylenol for mild pain.
Take Morphine IR for severe pain.
If you have worsening shortness of breath, worsening chest pain, fevers or chills, you should return to the emergency room.
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] on [**2188-4-15**] at 1:30pm on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center [**Location (un) 24**] for suture removal.
