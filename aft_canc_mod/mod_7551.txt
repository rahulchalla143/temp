She initially presented at the end of [**Month (only) 216**] with bilateral hip pain with worsening LE edema and LUE swelling.
Studies revealed a right scapular mass which was found to be adenocarcinoma.
A workup for a primary tumor was inconclusive but revealed a spot on her lung which was felt to be the most likely candidate; a colonoscopy was incomplete, a virtual colonoscopy was negative but suboptimal, a capsule study was not done because of a hiatal hernia, and a mammogram was negative.
She was given 2 units of pRBCs last week for worsening anemia after her chemotherapy.
Her oncology fellow was concerned that she was getting rectal meds while neutropenic and asked them to start antibiotics which were started yesterday (cipro).
When he went to talk to her she was only intermittently responsive and oriented.
On arrival to the ED she triggered for hypotension to SBPs of 77 which were responsive to fluids with SBPs above 100 after.
Labs revealed neutropenia 57% WBC 1.9 and hyponatremia (not as low as before).
A CXR showed a possible RLL opacification, blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn and she was started on vanc and merepenem (has a history of a cephalosporin allergy).
She was admitted to the ICU for MS monitoring.
According to her husband she has not been complaining of pain for the last several days but she has seemed more altered.
He asked them to not give her too much pain medication.
She does have a sister, a [**Name2 (NI) 802**], and many friends.
She told him that that if she was not better in next few days she would be worried that her symptoms are due to underlying cancer and not just the chemotherapy and that this would mean a worsening prognosis.

>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
No pneumothorax is detected.
Again seen is cardiomegaly, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and obscuration of left  hemidiaphragm.
There is also hazy opacity and atelectasis at the right base, probably with a small right effusion.
A small left effusion may also be present.
There is increased density at the left lung base with obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation as before.
There is continued evidence for small pleural effusions bilaterally as well.
A bipolar transvenous pacemaker remains in place.
Allowing for differences in technique, there is no definite interval change.
IMPRESSION:  No significant change.
[**2129-10-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci are consistent with age-related involutional change.
Minimal periventricular white matter hypodensity is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in the setting of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is redemonstration of bilateral optic disc drusen.
A mucus retention cyst is seen within a posterior right ethmoidal air cell.
There is aplasia of the left frontal sinus.
The remainder of the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
There is new consolidation at the left lung base, representing some combination of atelectasis and/or infection as well as a small left pleural effusion.
Streaky right lower lung opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis.
There may be a small layering pleural effusion on the right.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.
Findings consistent with left lower lung atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
New small left pleural effusion and possible small right layering pleural effusion.
Increased mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo F w/ metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary on palliative chemo/[**Month/Day/Year 16859**] admitted with altered mental status.
She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status.
Etiology undetermined, but most likely multifactorial and due to a combination of opioids and hyponatremia.
Initially infection was suspected, potentially of pulmonary origin.
She was started on vancomycin and meropenem while in the ICU, however this was discontinued as her mental status improved with improvement of her metabolic abnormalities.
She was afebrile throughout her hospital stay.
# Hypotension: Briefly hypotensive in the ED to SBPs 77 which was fluid responsive.
Initially thought to be hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO intake at rehab as well as vomiting [**2-24**] chemotherapy.
Her hypotension was ultimately attributed to likely right sided heart failure with dilated R ventricle causing intraventricular septal bowing.
Her right ventricular dilatation is though to be secondary to pulmonary hypertension, of which the etiology is unclear.
# PNA: Afebrile but per husband has had cough productive of whitish sputem for last few weeks.
Met SIRS criteria on admission with hypovolemia, leukopenia, [**Doctor First Name **] tachypnea.
Ultimately, pneumonia was determined to be a highly unlikely causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**] of her altered mental status.
# Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.
Total body volume overloaded (with LE edema and pulmonary edema on CXR) and per husband she is 40 lbs above her previous weight.
# Pancytopenia: Patient with pancytopenia on arrival to hospital as above s/p first cycle of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol.
Attributed to persistent bone marrow suppression.
# Metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: Patient recently diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma to left shoulder with unknown primary, status post one cycle of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled with rate 80-110's.
Maintained sinus rhythm while on oncology floor.
Her dabigatran was temporarily held due to thrombocytopenia as discussed above.
# Fluid overload/lower extremitiy edema: Patient with significant total body fluid overload and lower extremity edema, present since last discharge.
Attributed to hypoalbuminema in setting of malignancy; diuresed as above with 10 pound weight loss while on oncology floor.
However, per her husband, she would not want prolonged measures (though okay for short term intubation).

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted on [**2129-10-28**] for altered mental status at your rehab facility.
You required a short stay in the ICU due to low blood pressures and low sodium levels in your blood.
Your altered mental status was most likely due to a combination of medications and low sodium levels.
Please let the staff at the rehab facility know, or return to the ER, if you experience any of the following: increasing confusion, excessive sleepiness, falls, trouble thinking or speaking, trouble moving part of your body, new or worsening headache, chest pain, palpitations, trouble breathing, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increasing swelling in your legs or arms, or any other symptoms that concern you.
