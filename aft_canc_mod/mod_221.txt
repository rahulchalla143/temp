Patient was in his USOH until about 1 month ago when he started experiencing SOB, weight loss (8lbs in 2 weeks), cough, gouty attacks in his toes, and right sided chest pain.
Per wife, he has become jaundiced with increasing shortness of breath.
This morning he was apparently doing okay, by lunch time he was only able to speak [**1-21**] words at a time due to shortness of breath and by this evening he was unable to talk.
His wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7243**], called the IP office regarding his symptoms and was referred to the ED for further management.

CT Head Non-Con [**2182-4-29**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No space occupying lesion identified.
If clinical concern for intracranial mass is high, MRI is more sensitive for detecting metatatic disease; non-contrast CT has limited sensitivity but there is no evidence for mass effect or edema.
No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Short term interval progression of the large left hilar mass with progression of mediastinal, right hilar and left axillary lymphadenopathy.
Small left pleural effusion has decreased in size.
Right pulmonary nodules are overall increased slightly in size despite the short interval.
Bilateral lung parenchymal opacities likely represent atelectasis and post obstructive pneumonitis.
Increased size and heterogeneity of the liver since [**2182-4-18**], compatible with diffuse metastatic disease including rapid increase.
Porta hepatic lymph nodes are enlarged and increased in size.
No other metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 63M with cigar smoking history and new diagnosis of Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung who was intubated admitted for respiratory distress found to have renal failure, fulminant hepatic failure, DIC, and TLS.
# Stage IV Adenocarcinoma of the Lung: Patient had recent hx of weight loss, SOB, voice hoarseness and a CT with left perihilar mass with compression of adjacent pulmonary artery and bronchi, bilateral lung nodules with LAD and what appears to be diffuse liver metastases.
His course was fairly atypical given the general nature of this malignancy as he, over a period of a week developed significant symptoms of chest pain and SOB which progressed to multiorgan failure and expiration despite aggressive intensive care.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated for respiratory distress, tachypnea, and hypoxia likely related to his acidosis compressive perihilar mass in the ED.
He underwent a CTA chest which was negative for pulmonary embolism or significant pleural effusion.
His ventilator settings were aggressively titrated for management of his acidosis but as his condition continued to deteriorate the focus of his care was transitioned to comfort with weaning of his ventilator settings.
# Acute Renal Failure, Hyperkalemia: Patient had a Cr of 2.5 on admission up from unknown prior baseline and initial K of 6.8 in the ED with prominent peaked t-waves on EKG as well as an arterial pH of 6.84.
His hyperkalemia was felt to be the result of acidsosis causing extracellular shifts, renal failure causing decreased excretion, and tumor lysis syndrome causing increased production.
His acidosis and hyperkalemia were initially controllable with high dose continuous bicarbonate drip as well as frequent administration of IV insulin and dextrose.
On meeting with his family, it was determined that if he were able to make his own decisions he would likely not be in favor of being put on dialysis for an irreversible condition.
# Severe Lactic Acidosis: On admission his arterial pH was 6.84, GAP of 38, and lacate of 14.9.
His lactic acidosis was thought to be multifactorial related to likely fairly sudden-onset renal failure and fulminant hepatic failure with highly aggressive malignancy and tumor lysis.
TLS is very atypical for a solid malignancy so concern was raised for possible lymphoma although review of his blood smear and final report on his pleural fluid as positive for adenocarcinoma removed this suspicion.
Positive UA with negative urine cultures, pending blood cultures, and possible obstructive liver enzyme profile (although could be [**Last Name (un) 7245**] malignancy related).
Also with low fibrinogen and thrombocytopenia.
This was thought to be related to bulk disruption of his hepatic parenchyma by massive tumor infiltration and overall multiorgan failure from rapidly progressive malignancy.
Despite the greatest efforts of the [**Hospital 228**] medical team and staff, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had progressive multiorgan dysfunction without options for oncological treatment from his terminal lung cancer.
He passed away in no apparent distress in the presence of his loving significant other and sister.
