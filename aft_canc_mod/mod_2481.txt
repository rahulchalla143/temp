Vasogenic edema from the known metastatic lesion in the left frontal lobe is more prominent.
2)MRI Head ([**7-5**]): Increase in size of enhancing component of the left frontal lobe metastatic lesion with increased surrounding edema compared with the immediate prior MRI of [**2148-5-20**].
No evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus.
2)Cxray ([**7-5**]): Post-radiation and post-surgery changes in the right perihilar region.
No new abnormalities to account for change in mental status.
CT may be considered for more complete characterization if clinical suspicion persists.
No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.
5)CT Head ([**7-12**]): Small foci of blood and pneumocephalus in the left frontal lobe status post left frontal craniotomy are expected post- operative findings.
No evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged mass effect on frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
