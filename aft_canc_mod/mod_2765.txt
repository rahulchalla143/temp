History of Present Illness: This patient, a 67 year old female, with a past medical history significant for multiple small bowel obsructions and ventral hernia and known left ovarian mass for 10 year was admitted to [**Hospital3 8834**] [**2138-1-10**] for a small bowel obstruction.
Her symptoms resolved with consrevative therapy, however a MR enterography performed.
An As an incidental finding, a complex left adnexal mass was seen.
In the expected location of the left adnexa, a 4 x 6 x 4 cm complex lesion was noted with an avidly enhancing 2 cm component.
The MRI impression included in the differential diagnosis was an epithelial neoplasm of the ovary, versus an endometrioma with an associated malignancy.
The MR enterography showed a 6 cm lower abdomen wide neck ventral hernia containing multiple loops of small bowel.
The patient was seen in consultation concurrently by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**], who planned abdominal exploration with abdominal wall reconstruction and also by GYN Oncology.
Social History: Ex-smoker, but having quit over 40 years ago.
Family History: Family history is negative for breast, colon, uterine, or ovarian cancer.
Gen: Mildly lethargic, arousable, NAD HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Cardiac: RRR Pulm: No issues, CTA Abd: Obese abd, no nausea, no vomiting, Surgical wound intact, Left JP drain removed on day of discharge, Right JP drain draining 95cc overnight and to remain in place until follow-up.
Lower Extremities: Obese, no significant edema noted.
Uterus and cervix, right tube and ovary (A-D): - Uterus with atrophic endometrium and adenomyosis.
- Unremarkable cervix.
Pannus (K): Skin and fibroadipose tissue with focal fibrosis.
Abdominal wall (L): Dense fibroconnective tissue with foreign body giant cell reaction and scar.
Left pelvic lymph node (M-S): Seven lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/7).
Left peri-aortic lymph node (T): One lymph node, no malignancy identified (0/1).
No obvious PWs.- Per Cardiology  ECG1 [**2138-6-23**]: atrial fibrillation at 58.
Low voltage.
- Per Cardiology  CTA Chest [**2138-6-26**] IMPRESSION: 1.Bilateral pulmonary emboli with new linear atelectasis in the lower lobes.
2.Small dependent fluid postoperative collection surrounding the spleen.
The findings of the pulmonary emboli were conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28528**] at the time of reporting.
All tissues from the case were sent to pathology for evaluation.
The patient was  In the ICU the patient received boluses of intravenous fluids for low urine output with good affect.
The patient was extubated and started on a PCA for post-operative pain control, and transferred to the inpatient floor where she was placed on telemetry.
On the inpatient [**Hospital1 **] the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate up to 150s.
She noted nausea and diaphoresis with the episode but was otherwise asymptomatic and the episode was hemodynamically tolerated.
However, this was transient and resolved without intervention.
Cardiology was consulted for further management which recommended continuing Lisinopril 20mg daily, initiating Lopressor 25mg three times daily, Aspirin 325mg daily, Echocardiogram which showed LVEF >55%, no aortic regurgitation, mitral mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion, control of surgical pain, hold Dyazide diuretic, continue statin, and check TSH which was normal at 2.5mg.
On [**2138-6-26**], the GYN oncology surgical team became concerned that the patient may have had atrial fibrillation related to pulmonary emboli given her prolonged operative case, new diagnosis of cancer, and obesity.
The patient was not short of breath, expressing complaints of chest pain, hypoxic, or tachycardic at this time.
A CTA was obtained [**2138-6-26**] which showed Bilateral pulmonary emboli with new linear atelectasis in the lower lobes and small dependent fluid postoperative collection surrounding the spleen.
The patient remained on telemetry on the inpatient floor without issue on intravenous Heparin and Warfarin PO until [**2138-6-27**] when, after missing approximately two doses of Lopressor by mouth developed short bursts of sinus tachycardia which resolved with Lopressor by mouth.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 5 days: Please do not drink alcohol or drive a car while taking this medication.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Complex pelvic mass, malignant ovarian neoplasm on frozen section.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for surgical managment of the complex mass located in your pelvis.
Pathology reports indicated that the left ovary showed cancerous tissue.
You have a very low abdominal incision which is closed with staples.
Monitor for signs of infection including; white/green drainage, incresing warmth or redness of the skin, increased pain, or if you develop a fever.
Call the office if you develop these symptoms or report the emergency room if severe.
Watch for similar signs of infection at the JP drain site.
On the floor you had a rapid heart rate in an irregular rythm called atrial fibrillation.
The cause of this atrial fibrillation was determined to be multiple small blood clots in your lungs called pulmonary emboli.
These can happen when peaople are immobile or have conditions that make them more likely to develop a blood clot.
It is good to take it at this time if you will go ot have your blood drawn in the monring.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is very important that you take this medication as presecribed and report to the office to have your laboratory values checked because you will be at increased risk to bleed.
You are at increased risk for bleeding, please follow the coumadin and food teaching sheets and monitor yourself for brusing, bloody stools, fast heart rate, or low blood pressure.
