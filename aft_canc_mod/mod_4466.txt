During his hospitalization, he developed acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, became acidotic and hemodynamically unstable.
Initial gram stain of this fluid revealed no organisms but cell count was >20,000 with 98% neutrophils.
Past Medical History: PMH: esophageal cancer s/p chemo (cisplatin/5FU), paroxysmal AFib with CHADS score of 0 treated with ASA only  PSH: portacath & lap Jtube [**11-4**]   Social History: The patient has a history of drinking alcohol in the past, but quit two years ago.

The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
No evidence of esophageo-pericardial fistula.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
Small pericardial effusion.
Diffusely echogenic kidneys bilaterally, suggestive of medical renal disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion.
[**2132-2-18**] ECHO: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%) .

He had an arterial line and [**Last Name (un) 18821**] monitoring initiaited to monitor his hemodynamics and a CVL placed to provide additional access reuscitation.
Repeat TTE after admission showed small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade.
Imaging studies failed to reveal any abnormal connection between the esophagus and the pericardium, so the source of the pericardial infection remained unclear (possibly hematogenous spread from a pneumonia).
Despite aggressive resuscitation as described above and successful weaning of IV pressor support, the patient's renal failure failed to improve and urine output dropped of preciptitously.
Renal was consulted to initiate hemodialysis; however, the patient's family and HCP ultimately decided that this was not in-keeping with the patient's wishes; he was made CMO and placed on minimal vent settings and a fentanyl drip.
The final cause of death was from respiratory failure at 1715pm on [**2132-2-23**].
