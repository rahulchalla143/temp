Admission Date:  [**2161-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-12-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-10-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis Pericardial window placement bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 44 yo man with PMH HIV (CD4 390 in [**10-12**]) who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with abd distension.
Pt states that he was in his USOH until 1 week PTA when noted increased constipation and increased abd distension.
He self treated constipation w/ laxatives and enemas, without relief in abd distension.
Pt also noted some SOB over the past week which he attributed to his abd distension pushing on his diaphragm.
Of note, pt also noted some chest pressure, which he described as musculoskeletal, associated w/ b/l rib pain approximately 1 week ago, which he attributed to muscle strain from moving x-mas trees (he owns a nursery).
He also experienced fatigue at this time, and both resolved w/ rest.
Due to his abdominal distension, his covering outpt provider told him to go to the ED.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] ED where CT scan demonstrated ascites and pericardial effusion and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Was noted to have decreased voltage on EKG.
Emergent ECHO in ED demonstrated RV diastolic collapse and pt was taken to cath lab for emergent pericardiocentesis.
Of note, ED course also notable for 1 episode of apnea, cyanosis, and hypotension shortly after morphine administration, resolved within seconds and back to baseline.
Pericardiocentesis demonstrated equalization of pressures, w/ RA, RV, PCWP equal to 25, opening pressure 20.
Post-procedure, RA pressure was 14, and pt had symptomatic relief.
Currently pt c/o only mild SOB, mild pain at pericardial drain site.
Past Medical History: -HIV, last CD4 390, VL 12K in [**10-12**], no h/o opportunistic infections, but has poor genotype on 6 Antiretroviral medications.
Travels to [**Location (un) 29255**] every winter, no recent travel outside the country.
Family History: Mother w/ h/o Breast Ca (doing well), maternal grandmother w/ CAD at late age.
Large pericardial effusion resulting in cardiac tamponade.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Impression: Moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion with stranding and preserved biventricular systolic function.
Post pericardial window the effusion has decreased to trivial to small.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates an abnormal lymphoid population expressing the B-cell marker CD19 along with CD38 (bright).
Review of corresponding cytospin shows highly atypical mononuclear cells with are medium-sized, with a basophilic cytoplasm, occasional cytoplasmic vacuolation, large round nuclei and prominent abnormally-shaped nucleoli.
In the setting of HIV infection, these morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are highly suspicious for a primary effusion lymphoma.
Path results of pericaridal fluid and tissue samples obtained at time of operation were diagnostic for primary effusion lymphoma, an HIV associated lymphoma.
The patient's HIV is known to be multi-drug resistant with a detectable viral load when last measured.
He tolerated the chemotherapy well with no significant complications and good control of adverse symptoms.
If you develop chest pressure, shortness of breath, increasing abdominal  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 455**] 5-HEM ONC 7F HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY-7F Date/Time:[**2161-12-22**] 3:00
