Admission Date:  [**2104-8-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-10-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-7-19**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor First Name 147**] ATTENDING:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 22919**] HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22920**] is a 63-year-old male who had a history of sporadic blood in his stool, on and off for about 30 years.
He also underwent a CT pelvis with IV contrast which showed scattered diverticula within the descending and the sigmoid colon with no evidence of inflammatory changes.
The study was also broad-based soft tissue mass, which appeared to involve the wall of the low left posterior rectum.
There were no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes or evidence of invasion of the adjacent ischiorectal fat.
The transrectal ultrasound showed a T1 to T2 lesion at the level of the seminal vesicles.
The patient was set up with the Oncology Service and he underwent chemoradiation in an effort to maximize his chances of a sphincter preserving operation which was was very keen on.
After extensive discussion of all the above, advantages, disadvantages, as well as potential complications, including the possibility of a temporary or permanent stoma, were discussed with the patient and he wished to proceed with the surgical resection.
Rectal cancer status post chemotherapy XRT, as above.
Coronary artery disease with a recent normal stress test.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN.
No intravenous drug abuse.
Neck was supple, no thyromegaly.
ABDOMEN:  Examination revealed no masses, tenderness, hernias, or ascites.
Rectal exam confirmed almost complete regression of the rectal tumor.
On postoperative day #3, he was found to have a posterior anastomotic leak which required him to be taken back to the operating room on [**2104-9-1**] and underwent a diverting ileostomy.
On [**9-5**], the patient had an episode of shortness of breath, which was felt to be due to fluid overload.
A swab of the ileostomy showed gram-negative rods.
Then, on [**2104-9-17**] the patient developed an acute episode of shortness of breath and respiratory distress with dropping of the O2 saturations in the high 80s.
A VQ scan was obtained, but came back as per report, indeterminate for pulmonary embolus, since the patient was not able to cooperate with the ventilatory part of the test.
Nevertheless, the VQ scan showed several perfusion defects and with the onset of the patient having a rise in creatinine and team being unable to obtain a CT angiogram, he was started on IV Heparin empirically.
His PA catheter numbers showed elevated cardiac output with a low SVR.
He initially required vasopressors, but he was able to be weaned off those quickly with volume resuscitation.
He underwent an abdominal CT on [**9-19**], showing a fluid collection in the left lower quadrant pain and in the presacral area.
He underwent CT-guided drainage of the left lower quadrant pocket and this revealed foul, tan fluid and the drain was placed by interventional radiology.
A second collection was found to be draining to the rectum.
The Infectious Disease Department was on board with the team and they thought that it was mostly due to abdominal abscess.
The CT also showed the gallbladder, which was dilated on imaging, also with increased LFTs, question of a calculus cholecystitis versus dilatation secondary to illness proposed.
From [**9-29**] to [**10-3**], he started to improve with no major events.
He had an echocardiogram to look for endocarditis, since he continued to spike temperatures, but the study was essentially normal, except for a moderate effusion, which on repeat echocardiogram, several days later was resolved.
After repeat CT scan showed resolution of the left lower quadrant abscess, the drain was discontinued.
For current issues as per system, pulmonarywise the patient has Pseudomonas pneumonia and the Imipenem antibiotic should continue until the patient follows up with the Infectious Disease for which he has an appointment already scheduled on [**2104-10-30**].
From the cardiovascular standpoint, the patient is stable with a most recent echocardiogram done on [**10-2**], which showed no effusions.
From the Infectious Disease standpoint the left lower quadrant pain abscess was strained.
The collection is stable, clear, fecal contents absent, but no signs of infection at this time.
From the hematology standpoint, the patient developed a partial DVT postoperatively in the right upper extremity and was placed on Lovenox, which he should continue for at least six weeks.
