There was no evidence of sepsis so the patient was then transferred to medicine.
Patient spiked a fever to 101.6 and he was given 500 mg azithromycin to treat presumptive sinusitis found on CT as well as his pneumonia.
His O2 saturation while ambulating improved and patient was able to maintain a level greater than 90% without supplemental oxygen.
# Anemia - Per report baseline is 34-38.
He recived one unit of PRBC for decreased hematocrit in the MICU.
Iron studies were consistent of anemia of chronic disease.
# ARF - Patient was initially admitted with creatinine elevated from baeline.
# increaseds LFTS - Patient was found to have elevated LFT's on admission.
Patient has known CLL so there was concern for malignancy affecting the liver.
A right-upper quadrant ultrasound revealed: "a 1 cm hyperechoic nodule in segment 2 of the left lobe of the liver, probably representing hemangioma, and small gallstones with sludge, without evidence of acute cholecystitis" ALT, AST, and Bilirubin were all trending down by day of discharge.
#CAD/CHF: Initially euvolemic on exam there appeared to be some mild overload later during his stay, likely secondary to the IV fluid hydration he had been reciving for his ARF in the setting of decreased diuretics.
The volume overload was treated with lasix and patient was started on a daily dose of oral Lasix.
