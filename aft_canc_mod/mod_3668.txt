Admission Date:  [**2144-4-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-5-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-10-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: respiratory failure, eval for trach  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ETT at OSH and extubation PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: This is a 32 y/o male with neurofibromatosis, s/p multiple cervical and thoracic surgeries c/b paraplegia [**2141**], progressive scoliosis, who now p/w progressive respiratory failure.
He initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2144-4-24**] with symptoms of progressive dyspnea without any associated symptoms of f/c/s, cough, chest pain, or sputum.
He was further admitted to the OSH ICU for hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Of note, patient had a Klebsiella UTI at OSH, was started on Zosyn on [**2144-4-28**].
Patient denies any current symptoms and is comfortable.
Neurofibromatosis dx [**2127**] 2. h/o multiple thoracic and cervical spine fibromas causing obstruction ([**2130**], [**2131**], [**2138**]) c/b paraplegia in [**2141**] after cervical laminectomy with tumor and hardware removal 3. significant scoliois requiring fusion in [**2132**], repeat [**2133**] 4. h/o hypothalamic cystic brain tumor, s/p surgery and VP shunt [**2134**] 5. h/o PE in setting of spinal surgery [**2141**] 6. h/o ileus in [**1-1**] 7. h/o recurrent UTI's   Social History: Lives at home with his father, who is his caretaker.
Family History: Mother passed away from breast CA, also had h/o neurofibromatosis.
Intubated, ETT in place Neck: supple, large, unable to extend the neck Chest: diminished BS b/l, L>R CV: RRR s1 s2 normal, no m/g/r Abd: soft, obese, NT, NABS Ext: no c/c/e, withdrawn and slightly spastic Neuro: AO x 3, able to move left arm and wiggle toes.
CT Trachea [**5-1**] 1) Left upper lobe collapse with abrupt termination of the left upper lobe bronchus, most likely due to extrinsic compression from large left lateral thoracic wall neurofibroma.
Partial collapse of left lower lobe may also be due to this process.
If warranted clinically, correlative bronchoscopy may be helpful to exclude any associated intrinsic abnormality.
2) No definite evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, though the intubated portion of the trachea is difficult to assess due to the endotracheal tube.
3) Small right pleural effusion.
4) Multiple neurofibromas in paraspinal, thoracic wall, and subcutaneous locations.
Similar mediastinal and retroperitoneal lesions may also represent neurofibromas.
Extension of paraspinal neurofibromas into the spinal canal could be further assessed by MRI if warranted clinically.
5) Dilated air filled small bowel loops; please correlate with clinical history, and if needed, imaging of the abdomen to exclude small bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P - 32 y/o male with neurofibromatosis, s/p multiple cervical and thoracic surgeries, scoliosis, p/w respiratory failure.
# Respiratory failure - progressive, hypoxemic & hypercarbic respiratory failure.
CT chest showed LUL collapse liikely from extrinsic compression from large neurofibroma.
They felt that given his neck anatomy he would require a partial manubrectomy/sternectomy to place the tracheostomy and he would face long term consequences including granulation tissue formation as well as skin breakdown given the flexed position of his neck.
He will continue to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**State 1727**] to monitor his pulmonary status.
# Klebsiella UTI - recorded at OSH, resistant to fluroquinolones, started on Zosyn on [**2144-4-28**] which continued for 7 days (end date [**2144-5-4**]).
# F/E/N - PO diet as tolerated .
# PPx - heparin SC, aggressive bowel regimen .
# Access - right femoral line [**2144-4-29**], d/c'd [**2144-5-2**], PICC placed on [**2144-5-2**] and removal on day of discharge.
# Communication - father, [**Name (NI) 449**] [**Name (NI) 37557**] .
# Dispo - Discharged home on home oxygen, nightly BiPAP.
