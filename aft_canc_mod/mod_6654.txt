No prior studies available for comparison.
There are no prior CTs available for comparison.
FINDINGS: In the setting of mild underlying emphysematous changes, there is a large, 4.0 x 3.5 cm mass with spiculated margins located in the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe, which abuts the pleura but does not appear to demonstrate chest wall invasion at this time.
There is a large 1.9 x 1.8 cm prevascular lymph node which extends to the AP window, as well as numerous non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes, the next largest situated in a right precarinal location measuring 10 x 10 mm.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
No additional suspicious mass lesions are seen within the pulmonary parenchyma.
There is linear scarring or atelectasis at the lung bases, and a calcified granuloma at the right lung base.
Below the diaphragm, there is a very large bilobed mass which appears to be centered in the left retroperitoneum, likely originating from the left adrenal gland, with overall measurements of approximately 10.4 x 9.2 x 8.8 cm.
This mass is predominantly nonenhancing with likely necrotic center, however, there are multiple enhancing septations and a thickened, somewhat nodular enhancing rim, compatible with metastatic disease.
A similar, much smaller 13 mm lesion is seen at the apex of the contralateral right adrenal gland.
There are small retroperitoneal lymph nodes which are nonspecific, some of which are marginally enlarged, the largest in a left paraaortic location measuring approximately 17 x 9 mm (image 72).
There is a small hepatic cyst.
There is a very large gallstone within a nondistended gallbladder.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, there is a right renal cyst.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There are no suspicious osseous lesions identified, however there are compression fractures at both L4 and T10, of unknown chronicity.
Atrophic psoas muscles with focal fatty replacement.
IMPRESSION: Presumably stage IV lung cancer, with a large left upper lobe mass, enlarged mediastinal lymph node and bilateral adrenal masses, left much greater than right.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1982**]  DIAGNOSIS: FNA, Adrenal:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Pass #5 - Adequate - Atypical cells present.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-29**] 9:03 PM There are multiple intracranial masses both supra and infratentorially.
The largest mass is in the midline superior cerebellum slightly to the left of midline with distortion and mass effect on the fourth ventricle and causing tonsillar herniation as well as ascending transtentorial herniation.
A .6 cm right cerebellar enhancing mass is also noted.
Additionally, there is a 2.8 x 2.5 cm left frontal lobe mass with approximately 5 mm of midline shift and perilesional edema.
There is a .8 cm mass in the left frontal lobe precentral gyrus with mild surrounding edema.
There is mild ventricular prominence.
There is no evidence for acute ischemia.
IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with metastatic disease as detailed above.
Final Report CT TORSO ON [**5-30**]  IMPRESSION: Presumably stage IV lung cancer, with a large left upper lobe mass, enlarged mediastinal lymph node and bilateral adrenal masses, left much greater than right.
[**2184-6-2**] FNA, Adrenal: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
CT STEREOTAXIS W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-6-2**] 9:54 AM FINDINGS: Artifacts arising from the metallic base of the stereotactic apparatus obscure imaging detail within the posterior fossa.
However, the MR- demonstrated metastatic lesions are still visible, with the largest being within the left frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, the latter lesion extending to the vermis.
Extensive edema surrounding the frontal lobe lesion causes compression of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, more evident on the left side.
There is no shift of normally midline structures in the supratentorial compartment, but there is considerable compression and slight rightward shift of the fourth ventricle, also seen on the prior study.
No gross osseous abnormalities are defined.
CONCLUSION: Stereotactic planning CT scan, with redemonstration of multiple presumed metastatic lesions in the brain.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-6-2**] 5:56 PM FINDINGS: There has been no significant change.
The left medial parasagittal subcortical white matter adjacent to the prior edema is similar.
There has been no significant change in the edema.
The left cerebellar lesion is again hyperdense consistent with hemorrhage in the mass.
There is no change in the compression of the fourth ventricle.
The cerebellar tonsils are again close to the foramen magnum consistent with the mild tentorial herniation seen on the MR as well as the ascending transtentorial herniation noted on the MR.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since most recent short interval study.
Known slight cerebellar tonsillar herniation as well as upward transtentorial herniation as seen on recent MRI.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2184-6-2**] 11:50 PM FINDINGS: The multiple enhancing metastatic lesions, in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and in the left frontal lobe, are redemonstrated, for surgical planning.
No significant change is noted in these lesions, allowing for the technical differences, compared to [**2184-5-29**] study.
No significant change in the multiple metastatic lesions and the mild subfalcine herniation to the right side, since [**2184-5-29**].
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-6-2**] 5:56 PM FINDINGS: There has been no significant change.
The left medial parasagittal subcortical white matter adjacent to the prior edema is similar.
There has been no significant change in the edema.
The left cerebellar lesion is again hyperdense consistent with hemorrhage in the mass.
There is no change in the compression of the fourth ventricle.
The cerebellar tonsils are again close to the foramen magnum consistent with the mild tentorial herniation seen on the MR as well as the ascending transtentorial herniation noted on the MR.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since most recent short interval study.
Known slight cerebellar tonsillar herniation as well as upward transtentorial herniation as seen on recent MRI.
She underwent CT of the torso which revealed a large left upper lobe mass, enlarged mediastinal lymph node and bilateral adrenal masses, left much greater than right.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted for the lung mass on [**5-31**].
They determined that the lung mass could not be biopsied due to the close proximity to the aorta.
The pathology was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
On [**6-2**] the patient had a steriotactic third ventriculostomy.
