HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of metastatic melanoma who presented for elective resection of an anterior abdominal wall mass.
The patient was in his usual state of health until [**2176-5-23**] when he presented with an 8 mm ulcerated melanoma of his right calf.
He was enrolled in the ECOG 4697 study, receiving GNCSF and a peptide vaccine.
He then developed a new right groin nodule in [**2179-8-24**].
Follow-up CT scan revealed a 3.9 x 2.2 cm soft tissue mass in his abdomen as well as tiny nodes in the mesentery.
He underwent partial small bowel resection with complete resection of tumor in [**2179-9-24**].
In [**2179-12-25**], he developed subcutaneous nodules in the right shoulder.
In [**2179-12-25**], he developed new nodules near his abdominal surgical scar.

No jugular venous distention.
No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Normal bowel sounds, non-distended, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
RADIOLOGY:  CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis [**2180-6-9**], notable for interval increase in the size of the periumbilical subcutaneous nodules and two mesenteric nodules.
Also notable for failure to visualize the previously noted subcutaneous nodule on the left back.
CT scan of the head from [**2180-4-25**], notable for no hemorrhage, mass effect or mass.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Green Surgery and underwent abdominal wall resection, component release of ventral herniorrhaphy, resection of small bowel mesenteric metastases, and small bowel resection with anastomosis.
His brother noted that he first stared off into space, then began to shake his right arm and leg, which then progressed to be described as similar to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
CT scan of the head was notable for a large left frontal enhancing mass, new since prior CT scan.
No intracranial bleed was noted, but surrounding edema was concerning.
In the Intensive Care Unit, he did well and experienced no further seizures.
An MRI, on [**2180-7-6**], with and without contrast was notable for a 4 cm left frontal lobe mass adjacent to the falx with a lobular component.
The corpus callosum and frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] were inferiorly displaced.
A second focus of enhancement was noted in the right parietal lobe, representing another likely metastatic focus.
No other abnormalities were noted.
He was then transferred back to the floor on postoperative day five where he continued to do well with no further seizures.
