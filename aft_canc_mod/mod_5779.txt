CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2197-3-13**] 4:10 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old man with STEMI, hypoxia.
Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates marked opacification of the bilateral lungs.
No pneumothorax.
There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles.
No pneumothorax is appreciated.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent marked opacification of the bilateral lungs.
The finding may simply represent severe pulmonary edema.
Possibility of pneumonia or even an underlying mass is not excluded given the extensive opacification.
There is moderate left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis - the basal segments and lateral wall have the least poor function.
Mild global RV hypokinesis.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
ST segment depressions and T wave inversions in leads I and aVL.
The previously mentioned multiple abnormalities persist.
There is variation in precordial lead placement.
The T waves are now biphasic in leads V4-V6 which may represent further evolution of ongoing myocardial infarction.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCA had serial 99% lesions in mid and distal segments with distal PDA totally occluded.
There was moderate pulomary arterial hypertension of 38/20 mm Hg.
Cardiogenic Shock.
Echo [**3-14**] There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis and probably focal apical hypokinesis (views suboptimal).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2197-3-15**] 8:08 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old man with STEMI, cardiogenic, septic shock.
There is improving pulmonary edema compared to yesterday's study.
Increasing retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of atelectasis and left-sided pleural effusion.
Increase in retrocardiac opacity likely representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
EKG showed anterior and inferior Q waves, ST elevations of inferior leads and aVR, and lateral ST depressions.
His CXR showed complete white-out of both lung fields, thought secondary to pulmonary edema from cardiogenic shock, and aspiration pneumonitis.
Cardiac Catheterization from outside hospital showed severe three vessel disease, with collaterals from RCA to LAD, and active thrombus in the RCA.
Did well for most of the day, initially refused to take medications because he insisted he would have a bad reaction to them, later on in the day he agreed to take his meds.
CXR with possible increased left sided infiltrate.
ABG's suggestive of increased CO2 production or increased dead space.
CT scan and CXR were consistent with Multi-lobar Pneumonia thought to be due to VAP.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were then discontinued and he is to complete a 7day course of Ciprofloxacin  #) Thrombocytosis:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4698**] developed thrombocytosis during this hospital stay.
This was thought to be secondary to reactive thrombocytosis due to Pneumonia and STEMI.
Plavix was increased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for prevention of thrombosis of his BMS x 4.
Reactive Thrombocytosis is still the most likely cause of his elevated platelet count.
#)ARF: Patient developed acute renal failure with progressively increasing creatinine up to 2.8 after being hospitalized for three days.
Psychiatry was consulted and believed that the patient did NOT have schizophrenia.
Disp:*90 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute STEMI- inferior MI s/p stent to RCA Ventilator associated pneumonia Systolic CHF with EF 40%   Discharge Condition: Stable, planning for CABG in next few weeks.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a large heart attack.
You were also intubated for several days and required another intubation for a multi-focal pneumonia leading to respiratory distress.
Please call your PCP or go to the emergency room if you have fevers over 102, chills, chest pain, trouble breathing, or any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
