Imaging revealed a metastatic lesion to the skull with both infiltration of the outer layers of the skin, as well as the skull proper, as well as the dura, as well as the underlying brain.
Metastatic Left Breast Cancer - diagnosed in [**6-/2134**] - infiltrating with ductal and lobular features - ER/PR positive, LVI negative, HER-2/neu indeterminate - [**12-29**] lymph nodes positive - known metastases to the L3 vertebral region and the sacrum - treated with radiation in the past - failed multiple chemo agents due to intolerance of side effects - taking Faslodex with quarter-annual Zometa infusions - peripheral neuropathy since chemo #.
Osteopenia - last BMD -2.46 in [**1-26**] - currently on Zometa for bone mets #.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - s/p ablation at [**Hospital1 2025**] ~[**2129**] - also had cardiac cath at that time, negative per patient - large LLE hematoma on Warfarin - unwilling to continue this med despite Cardiology recs - refuses further cardiology followup #.
Obstructive sleep apnea - CPAP about 7 hours a night #.
Rheumatoid arthritis in the hands #.
Benign Familial Microscopic Hematuria - worked up and felt to be benign - worrisome causes were ruled out #.
Childhood Illnesses - Ruptured appendix at age five - Rheumatic heart disease at age seven - Herpes zoster age eleven #.
OTHER - Right knee meniscal tear as noted by MRI [**12-1**] - Hx of colonic adenomas, found [**4-26**], colonoscopy [**8-31**] negative - Diverticulosis incidentally found on CT [**3-27**] - Gallstones discovered incidentally during surgery, ~[**2122**] - Loss of hearing left ear due to car accident - Left lower extremity cellulitis ~[**2132**], Resistant bug requiring long term IV infusion pump, Salmonella UTI around the same time  Social History: Widowed since [**77**], no romantic involvement since.
Family History: Father with MI at age 47, subsequently had 8 MI's before passing away in his 60's.
There is no right-left confusion or finger agnosia.
Sinus rhythm.
Diffuse non-specific T wave flattening.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 70 188 76 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 34598**]1  CT Head [**6-5**](post-op): FINDINGS: There has been an interval left craniectomy with a wire mesh at the operative site.
There is expected pneumocephalus overlying the left frontal convexity, and in the subcutaneous tissues at the operative bed, where there is soft tissue swelling.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
There is no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction differentiation.
There is no significant shift of normally-midline structures.
No osteolytic lesion is seen.
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the left parietal extra-axial mass and adjacent bone have been removed with cranioplasty in this region.
Mild pachymeningeal enhancement is seen surrounding the operative area.
No residual nodular mass lesion identified.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
No acute infarcts are noted.
Post-gadolinium images demonstrate foci of enhancement in the right parietal and temporal regions which could be due to additional skull metastasis.
Soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells, left greater than right side.
On the sagittal images, postoperative changes are seen in the cervical region with partially visualized C3 and C4 vertebral bodies demonstrating low signal which could be due to an infiltrative process such as metastasis.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes with cranioplasty and resection of extra- axial left parietal metastasis with small extra-axial postoperative collection and residual pachymeningeal enhancement.
No nodular residual areas of enhancement seen.
Small areas of enhancement are seen in the right parietal and temporal bones which could be secondary to additional skull metastasis.
No acute infarcts, mass effect, or hydrocephalus seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 65F with significant medical history for metastatic breast cancer who was electively admitted on [**6-5**] for resection of a left parietal mass.
Post-operatively she was admitted for routine neurosurgical care, as well as managment of her known atrial fibrillation, with propensity to enter rapid ventricular response post-operatively.
Neurologically, she progressed as expected, however required a diltiazem infusion for two days to treat her a-fib with RVR.
On [**6-5**] Cardiology wa consulted DR [**Last Name (STitle) **], intra-op platlets because the patient had last taken last Aspirin on [**5-30**], Intra-op the patient was given 60 mg of esmolol and 5 mg lopressor for her onset of intra-op atrial fibrillation.
On [**6-6**]: This patient began zofran for nausea and her pain medication was increased due to expected post-op headache.
On [**6-7**], She was transferred to the step down unit and continued on a diltiazem intravenously for continued atrial fibrillation and was followed by cardiology.
It was discussed that the pt might benefit from one additional night of monitoring in regards to her atrial fibrilation but she was adamant that she be discharged home on [**6-8**].
Gabapentin 100 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for neuropathic pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for wheezing.
Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Parietal Mass Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions/Information  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-4**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
