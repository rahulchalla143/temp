Admission Date:  [**2164-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-9-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-1-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: diagnostic thoracentesis [**2164-9-28**]  History of Present Illness: 73 year old male with history of HTN, CAD, COPD who presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**9-22**] with fatigue and positional dyspnea.
During that hospitalization the patient had remarked on hemoptysis and chest imaging revealed a right middle lobe lesion.
In the interim between the two hospitalizations, pathology of the cells from the lavage revealed cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
He received bronchodilators for presumed COPD and was diuresed with furosemide 40 mg IV BID.
His effusion has been somewhat controlled on furosemide [**Hospital1 **] and he has been satting reasonably well on [**1-11**] L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Of note, vancomycin was discontinued once blood, urine, and sputum cultures returned without growth.
Currently, the patient appears in mild distress but denies shortness of breath or pain.
He denies any particular complaints.
Past Medical History: -CAD s/p MI eight years ago, managed with PTCA -Hemorrhagic Stroke w/ craniotomy [**10/2162**] complicated by recurrent bleed and seizure approximately 6 mos later -HTN -COPD   Social History: He is retired from working on missile systems for [**Company 2676**].
Family History: Mother died of laryngeal cancer, Father died of leukemia  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 96.7 BP: 116/96 HR: 105 RR: 20 O2sat 94% on 3L GEN: elderly male in mild respiratory distress HEENT: mild left sided facial droop, atraumatic, sclerae anicteric RESP: Speaking in brief sentences, absent breath sounds on right, few crackles on left with somewhat poor air movement CV: tachycardic, no M/R/G ABD: Soft, NT, ND, BS+, no HSM or masses appreciated EXT: no c/c/e, 2+ pulses in DP's bilaterally SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: AAOx3.
Suboptimal visualization of the left hepatic lobe, limiting evaluation.
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of hepatic metastasis.
Right pleural effusion.
Bilateral renal cysts  OSH Echocardiogram ([**2164-9-24**]) IMPRESSION: 1 LV EF 60% w/ nl wall motion 2.
Mild circumferential pericardial effusion 4.
No transvalvul gradients or significant regurgitations OSH CTA Chest ([**2164-9-22**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
Large R perihilar mass, which is probably maligannt, associated mediastinal and R hilar adenopathy 3.
Moderate R pleural effusion with substantial atelectasis of the right lower lobe 4.
Probably post-obstructive pneumonia in the right upper lobe OSH Bilateral LENI's ([**2164-9-22**]) IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study, no evidence of DVT   Brief Hospital Course: 73 y.o.
male with significant smoking history and recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure thought due to post-obstructive pneumonia and volume overload now improving.
The acute hypoxic respiratory failure was believed to be multifactorial etiologies due to obstructive lung cancer, compressive atelectasis due to large pleural effusion, possible postobstructive PNA and very poor pulmonary reserve due to underlying lung disease.
Chest imaging revealed moderate right pleural effusions, as well as a large right-sided perihilar mass with encasement of the trachea, proximal portion of the right main bronchus, the right main pulmonary artery, the right brachiocephalic vessel, and the esophagus.
A few cc of fluid were aspirated by bedside thoracentesis.
Hematology/oncology was consulted and discussed treatment options to consider only after the patient recovered from his critical illness.
Overnight on the night of [**9-28**], the patient had respiratory arrest requiring intubation.
He had return of spontaneous circulation, but remained intubated.
