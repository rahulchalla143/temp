Admission Date:  [**2104-2-19**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  Medicine/Medical Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 88-year-old female of Philippina origin with a history of bronchial adenocarcinoma, status post right lower lobe and right middle lobe resection in [**2101-12-5**], without chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and with a questionable cerebellar mass, possible metastasis diagnosed in [**2102-6-5**] by head CT which has remained unchanged, and history of mild baseline Alzheimer's dementia who was living at home and fully capable of activities of daily living two days prior to the date of presentation who has a more recent past medical history significant for an appendectomy in [**2103-9-5**] with a perioperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, a left femoral popliteal to common femoral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis diagnosed in [**Month (only) **], hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus urosepsis in [**2103-10-6**], was in her usual state of health significant for a recent weight loss of approximately five pounds, down to a weight of 65 pounds, until two days prior to admission when she had begun to have a cough productive of some mild sputum and general feeling of malaise with some mild nausea without vomiting, who continued good p.o.
In the morning on the day of admission she complained of low back pain and felt progressively weaker and felt progressive shortness of breath and some difficulty breathing with a slightly productive cough.
She refused to eat breakfast and did not take any of her medications.
Around 11 a.m. the patient became unresponsive and the family noted crackling breath sounds audible and brought the patient to the Emergency Room via personal transportation.
On the way to the Emergency Room via the family's automobile the patient became apneic and the daughter performed mouth-to-mouth ventilation for a few seconds until the patient's respirations started again spontaneously.
Prior to this presentation, the family did not note any complaint of chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, fever, chills, bright red blood per rectum, seizure activity, urinary or fecal incontinence, and no signs of focal weakness or neurologic symptoms.
No complaints of visual disturbances.
The patient was described as being slightly diaphoretic but not cyanotic.
She had had several greenish slightly loose bowel movements in the last few days, but no frank diarrhea or emesis.
In the Emergency Room she was intubated for hypocarbic respiratory failure and was unresponsive and hypotensive.
Electrocardiogram showed new right bundle-branch block, first heart sound, Q3, precordial T wave inversions, with no ST elevations or changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
The patient was given ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously times one in the Emergency Department and was also given calcium gluconate, insulin, and glucose, and Kayexalate for a high potassium level.
Chest x-ray with an official read of mild interstitial edema, questionable right upper lobe infiltrate.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a tachycardic regular rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the second intercostal space on the left side.
No carotid bruits.
No jugular venous distention, and no heave.
Lungs anteriorly with bilateral crackles.
Extremities revealed positive peripheral cyanosis.
No edema, and no calf asymmetry or swelling.
Adenocarcinoma of the lungs, status post right lower lobe and right middle lobe resection in [**2101-10-5**], for which the patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] at [**Hospital1 1444**], with no radiation or chemotherapy.
The patient had previously been without signs of recurrence by surveillance chest x-ray.
Baseline mild Alzheimer's dementia.
Status post appendectomy with perioperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction on [**2103-10-9**].
Recurrent urinary tract infections with an admission for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus urosepsis in late [**2103-10-6**].
History of deep venous thrombosis with left popliteal to common femoral deep venous thrombosis diagnosed in [**2103-10-6**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient does not drink alcohol, has no history of smoking, and does not engage in recreational drug use.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was not obtainable at the time of admission; however, per the patient's family, the review of systems is incorporated in the History of Present Illness, and essentially was in her usual state of health with no complaints.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Pertinent examinations on presentation in the Emergency Room revealed a chest x-ray with right pleural effusion, bilateral interstitial edema, and question of no nodules, no clear V-lines, no hilar prominence.
Head CT without contrast was unremarkable for an acute event.
Most recent echocardiogram on [**2103-10-11**] which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted and taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support, status post intubation and continued aggressive fluid resuscitation for hypotensive condition.
PULMONARY:  The patient presented with a presumed community-acquired pneumonia with a question of congestive heart failure component given her history of generalized malaise, productive cough, and respiratory failure.
Significant question of mass pulmonary embolus on admission with continued hypoxia and oxygen saturations in the middle 80s on 100% FIO2 via endotracheal tube.
Given her history of deep venous thrombosis a CT angiography was obtained on the evening of admission which showed a significant consolidation, questionable large pleural based mass in the right lower thorax.
No pulmonary embolus, diffuse nodules throughout both lungs, consistent and concerning for diffuse metastatic disease.
The patient subsequently received a bronchoscopy in the Intensive Care Unit that night which showed some small mucous plugging in the right upper lobe with no endobronchial lesions.
Status post bronchoscopy, the patient's saturations markedly improved to 100%, and her peripheral cyanosis resolved, and her arterial blood gas essentially normalized.
She was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed community-acquired pneumonia and gentle restriction of her fluids, and diuresis was attempted given the question of possible water overload contributing to her lung difficulties.
By hospital day six, she was doing on a pressure support of 20/5 but had increased CO2 but tended to compensate with a relatively normal pH to compensate for metabolic alkalosis secondary to contraction alkalosis in the face of attempts at diuresis.
The patient continued in relatively stable fashion from a pulmonary point of view, weaning down her pressure support until hospital day 10 when she had increased white count.
On hospital day 11, she had an increased temperature.
On hospital days 12 through 14 she began to have increased sputum production with occasional desaturation episodes resolved with aggressive suctioning and copious removal of secretions via her endotracheal tube.
Endotracheal cultures at this time were positive for stenotrophomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive Staphylococcus.
Chest x-ray at this time had evolved to show a new left lower lobe infiltrate while the right upper lobe infiltrate had begun to clear.
She was started on vancomycin and Bactrim and showed improved respiratory parameters.
On hospital day 14, the patient was extubated and initially tolerated this well with a nonrebreather 100% face mask; however, she became progressively tachypneic, and tachycardic, to the 130s and hypertensive to the 180s, with a short period of approximately five minutes of supraventricular rhythm appearing on the monitor.
Her arterial blood gas at that time showed increasing hypocarbia with a pH of 7.3, CO2 of 88, and 02 of 109.
A post reintubation film showed that the patient had collapsed her right upper lobe in the peri-extubation period.
At this point, the decision for the patient to receive a tracheostomy in light of her failed extubation attempts, her prolonged time on a ventilator, and with endotracheal intubation, and the aggressive suctioning; although, her secretions had significantly decreased since the patient had been started on vancomycin and Bactrim, after culture results indicated a ventilator-associated pneumonia as described above.
The patient underwent a bedside tracheostomy after discussion with the family and the patient on [**2104-3-6**] without incident.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient presented with a history of cough and sputum.
Her white blood cell count on presentation was normal; although, she was hypothermic, and hypotensive, and with a history of diarrhea diagnosed as a presumptive diagnosis on admission of community-acquired pneumonia.
The patient presented as Clostridium difficile positive on hospital day two and was kept on Flagyl throughout her initial hospital stay both for the community-acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile.
She continued to be afebrile with a stable white blood cell count until hospital day 10 when she started to have a slight increase in her temperature to a temperature maximum of 101, and with a rising white blood cell count to 17.9 on hospital day 9, and increased sputum production.
This was felt to be consistent with a diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Sputum culture at that time were positive for 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters and 4+ gram-negative rods which were subsequently identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and stenotrophomonas as above in the Pulmonary history.
Throughout her hospital stay the patient's urinalysis had been negative with no other locus of infection was identified or suspected.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a decreased blood pressure on admission and hypothermia secondary to aggressive volume resuscitation.
By hospital day three she was 13 liters positive; however, in the setting of a small presenting body weight of 65 pounds, the patient began to develop moderate edema in her hands and feet; although she never showed signs of being significantly intravascularly volume overloaded.
Efforts to diuresis were limited contraction alkalosis and decreased blood pressures.
Subsequent repeat electrocardiograms showed no changes from the prior.
On hospital days three to five, she had some slight bradycardic episodes down to the 50s which were asymptomatic and some occasional episodes of increased blood pressure during periods of agitation which normalized.
The patient had one episode of approximately five minutes of supraventricular complex tachycardia during her failed intubation attempt with an increased blood pressure; however, the patient had no electrocardiogram changes at that time, and her hemodynamics resolved.
Elevated troponin at the time of admission mildly at 4 was felt to be consistent with right heart strain in the setting of severe pulmonary hypotension due to her hypoxia.
On hospital day four, the patient had some episodes of bradycardia with alternating short and long P-R intervals, questionable bigeminy; however, an electrocardiogram at that time was not felt to be consistent with this diagnosis.
A repeat echocardiogram obtained on [**2104-2-28**] to assess for cardiac function revealed a left atrium that was normal in size with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity was noted to be unusually small, although with normal overall good left ventricular systolic function and left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55% with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
There was significant aortic valve stenosis.
Severe mitral annular calcification with mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Left ventricular inflow pattern suggested delayed relaxation phase, possible degradation of diastolic dysfunction with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension of approximately 35, estimated, small pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left pleural effusions was noted compared to the previous echocardiogram from [**2103-10-11**]; this tricuspid regurgitation and degree of pulmonary hypertension were decreased.
From that time forward, the patient was not restarted on her beta blocker; however, she probably should be at some point in the near when she overcomes her acute illness.
However, the patient had acute renal failure on presentation as noted by a rise in her creatinine on presentation to 2.2.
On hospital day 15, she began to mobilize fluid on her own without the addition of diuretics and to be negative on a daily basis.
Her edema decreased.
basis with no severe or chronic abnormal levels of any electrolytes noted.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with a history of loose green bowel movements and continued to have fairly voluminous diarrhea for the first two to three days of her hospital course which was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin.
She continued with form stool and no indication of systematic infection.
The patient had two episodic one to two periods of mild abdominal pain and tenderness which was never acute or surgical in nature.
The patient never developed a distended abdomen.
KUB films obtained at these times were both negative and within normal limits, and these episodes of mild abdominal pain resolved with bowel regimen and subsequent bowel movements.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused with one unit of blood on two separate occasions during her hospital stay for slowly dropping hematocrits which were felt to be consistent with phlebotomy; given an appropriate bump in hematocrit post transfusion and no signs or symptoms of ongoing bleeding.
The patient was guaiac-negative, and no identifiable source.
The patient also demonstrated a slow decrease in her platelets during her hospital stay.
The patient was continued on heparin intravenously per standard protocol from the date of admission throughout her hospital stay for the known diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in the left proximal vein.
A right upper extremity ultrasound obtained on [**2-26**] due to a concerning asymmetrical aspect of the patient's upper extremity edema revealed a small amount of obstructive retracted clot within the right internal jugular vein with patent flow around the clot.
There was normal flow at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein, and normal flow within the subclavian vein, and cephalic systems.
The patient showed normal flow, Doppler wave forms at the subclavian axillary and brachial veins.
LINES:  The patient had received a left femoral triple lumen central venous catheter in the Emergency Department on the day of admission which was discontinued on hospital day 15 for concern of the patient's rising white blood cell count in that period, although there were no local signs of infection, and culture of the catheter tip was negative.
The patient received a left internal jugular triple lumen which was placed on [**2-29**] and remained clean, dry, and intact with no signs of complication or infection or obstruction.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had a random cortisol level of 113 on the day of admission to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
No other endocrinologic issues were identified.
GENITOURINARY:  There were no issues.
SKIN:  The patient received the usual medical intensive care unit skin care with no active issues arising.
No decubitus ulcers were identified or developed.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  The patient had no rheumatologic issues.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  At this point, the patient was felt to be stable with no acute intensive care issues requiring medical intensive care unit care.
