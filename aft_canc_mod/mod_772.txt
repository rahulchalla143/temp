Admission Date:  [**2145-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-1-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname 714**] [**Known lastname 19004**] is a 74-year-old woman with widely metastatic breast cancer (metastases to brain, lung, bone, and liver), on Coumadin for DVT, history of a with right sided deficit, who presented with an acute change in mental status, weakness, and word garbling per her husband now with altered mental status, word garbling, and weakness per husband.
At that time she developed bilateral sharp shooting pain in her thighs, radiating up to her pelvis and inguinal area.
She also developed diffuse pruritis around the same time, but no rash.
She has continued to have pain that is responsive to oxycodone.
Yesterday, she went for an INR check and felt lethargic and weak.
Her weakness was more notable on her left side, which is usually her stronger side.
She again had difficulty speaking and it was apparently difficult to get the words out.
There had been no changes in her urine noted.
She has poor PO intake, usually only eating breakfast, with poor fluid intake.
She was also recently started on Megace, which was stopped about one week ago due to an elevated INR.
She was noted to have a right-sided facial droop, which per report was old.
A head CT was without a bleed or edema.
Her laboratories were remarkable for thrombocytopenia, anemia, and new renal failure.
She denied any discomfort and would answer some questions appropriately.
Review of systems is otherwise negative for fevers, recent illness, chills, nightsweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: She was born at home in [**2070**] without any TORCH perinatal infections.
She does not have diabetes, hypertension, or COPD.
Family History: Father died of rectal cancer.
No conjunctival pallor, PERRL, no scleral icterus.
NECK: Supple, flat JVP, no LAD appreciated.
No meningismus, Kernig and Brudzinski signs negative CARDIAC: Regular, III/VI SEM best heard at RUSB, no rubs or gallops LUNGS: Clear to ascultation anteriorly and posteriorly with very occasional wheeze, few rales at bases ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no dullness to percussion, no guarding or rebound tenderness GENITOURINARY: Rectal tone WNL (as assessed by nursing), patient appearing uncomfortable when temperature obtained, no inguinal masses or tenderness to palpation EXTREMITIES: Warm, bilateral ecchymoses over tibias, right leg slightly more edematous than left.
Some signs of venous stasis.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Left lower lobe opacity may represent pneumonia or edema.
Recommend repeat imaging after diuresis to excluded underlying infection.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of stenoses in the cervical or intracranial arteries.
No evidence of intracranial aneurysms.
No CT signs of an acute infarction.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction.
Unchanged intracranial calcifications, consistent with treated metastases.
Unchanged sclerotic bone lesions in the spine.
Sclerotic lesions in the sternum, not previously imaged.
These are consistent with metastases.
Patchy pulmonary opacities in the imaged upper lungs.
Partially imaged pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known firstname 714**] [**Known lastname 19004**] is a 74-year-old woman with past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status and feeling of weakness on left side.
Has weakness on right side at baseline.
(1) Altered Mental Status: Patient had altered mental status on admission and thru [**2145-3-22**], oriented only to self and was combative.
This is thought likely to be toxic/metabolic factors in the setting of old CVA deficits.
The toxic/metabolic factors could include penumonia, oxycodone use, and possible small contribution of hypocalcemia.
There was concern for leptomeningeal disease given her metastatic breast cancer to the cerebellum, however, lumbar puncture was not persued given patient's mental status cleared and we would not expect it to resolve spontaneously.
Seizure could also be responsible if altered mental status was secondary to seizure.
CT of the head was negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.
Patient still has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and mild edema.
She refused MRI given her severe claustrophobia.
CTA showed no evidence of intracranial thrombosis.
Patient did receive antibiotics for bacterial meningitis in the ED but they were not continued given that she had no fever or signs of meningismus.
Patient was also placed on lactulose for concern for hepatic encephalopathy given increased LFT's but this was discontinued.
Patient required Haldol and Benedryl for agitation until [**2145-3-23**] when her mental status cleared.
(2) Pneumonia:  Left retrocardiac mild PNA.
(4) Acute Renal failure:  Patient was pre-renal (FENA 0.1%) in setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg).
(5) Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission to 67 systolic BP and she received fluid boluses.
She was day 18 of her gemcitabine therapy so this likely represent marrow suppression from that cycle.
Consistent with severity and timing of prior post chemo thrombocytopenia.
We suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative in ED).
She has poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
Most likely secondary to oxycodone.
She was treated with benedryl which was later discontinued due to her MS changes.
She had no signs of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation in tact.
She was pain free on day of call out from ICU.
She subsequently had some pain and swelling in the right leg; doppler studies were negative for clot.
She was given ibuprofen for pain on the floor.
(10) SVT:  Patient had 2 episodes of SVT while in the ICU with HR up to 150 which responded to metoprolol 5 mg IV.
Coumadin restarted on [**2145-3-23**] at 3mg daily down from home dose of 5mg daily given that she was supratherapeutic and also on antibiotics.
RLE doppler studies done to evaluate leg pain and swelling were negative for clot.
(14) History of Cardiomyopathy:  Held ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in setting of hypotension.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  altered mental status Secondary:  metastatic breast cancer, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, hisotry of DVT, history of CVA  Discharge Condition: Stable.
If you have ongoing pain that does not improve with acetaminophen, you should talk to your doctor about other medications that might help.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have fevers or chills, another episode of altered mental status, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
