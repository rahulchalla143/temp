No PE identified.
Moderate bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions associated with basal atelectases.
Spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe not significantly changed in size from [**2179-5-7**] with bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial opacities in the apical posterior segments in LUL similar in appearance to prior study.
Spiculated opacity in the right apex also without significant change.
There is a 1.8 cm round lesion in the posterior right temporal lobe, which demonstrates evidence of chronic blood products on the gradient echo sequence.
The rim of this lesion also demonstrates slow diffusion, which may indicate hypercellularity.
The nonenhancing center of the lesion does not demonstrate slow diffusion, suggesting that this does not represent an abscess.
There is moderate vasogenic edema involving the right temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes.
There are no associated blood products or diffusion abnormalities.
There is mild associated vasogenic edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo with metastatic small cell lung cancer who presents with change in MS, fever and seizeures who was found to have vasogenic edema.
# Fever: Initial concern for aspiration pneumonia vs. ventilator associated pneumonia.
Multiple chest X-rays showed no evidence of infection and antibiotics were stopped.
He had no fevers while on the general medicine floor.
# Shortness of breath: Patient had an acute episode of shortness of breath on [**2179-6-15**] after being laid flat for removal of a central line.
Chest CTA showed no evidence of emboli or infiltrates, but did show small bilateral pleural effusions, likely related to volume resuscitation in the ICU.
