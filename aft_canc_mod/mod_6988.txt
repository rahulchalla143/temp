Admission Date:  [**2158-12-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-1-12**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 107446**] is an 85-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as diverticular disease who presented to the Emergency Department with syncope and supraventricular tachycardia, as well as progressive abdominal tenderness.
Of note, is that the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] after being admitted for a subarachnoid hemorrhage after a fall.
She was also readmitted earlier in [**Month (only) 404**] for a fall at the rehabilitation center and then sent back.
Prior to admission, the patient was apparently having diarrhea and emesis.
She has also been having decreased oral intake and decreased appetite.
Consequently, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] where she was found to be in supraventricular tachycardia and a heart rate in the 160s.
The heart rate was broken with some beta-blocker and fluid repletion.
She was also noted to be having progressive abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs.
A CT of the abdomen and chest performed on [**2158-12-26**] showed extensive wall thickening and probable pneumatosis coli of the distal jejunum, highly suspicious for ischemic bowel.
There was no evidence of free air in the abdomen to suggest perforation.
In addition, a large periaortic enhancing mass was noted with central calcification.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Diverticular disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
History of bilateral mastectomy approximately 20 years ago.
History of subarachnoid aneurysm coiling.
Transabdominal hysterectomy.
General exam:  Alert and oriented elderly female with abdominal pain.
Neck exam:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Abdomen:  Flat, with periumbilical lower abdominal tenderness, peritoneal signs.
Urinalysis showed no signs of urinary tract infection.
Electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia, no ST changes.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a CAT scan of the abdomen and chest which showed a large periaortic enhancing mass with central calcification.
In addition, extensive wall thickening and probable pneumatosis coli of the distal jejunum was noted which was highly suspicious for ischemic bowel.
In light of the CT findings, as well as supraventricular tachycardia and physical examination, the decision was made to proceed to the Operating Room for a surgical intervention.
end-to-end anastomosis, as well as sharp wedge biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass seen on the CAT scan.
There were no complications.
The small bowel and the retroperitoneal biopsy were sent to the Pathology Department.
She still demonstrated metabolic acidosis by blood gas.
She was afebrile postoperatively.
The patient continued to have persistent significant requirement for fluid and a fixed metabolic acidosis, which was concerning for continued bowel ischemia.
She again underwent segmental enterectomy including the anastomosis, as well as resection partial enterostomy with secondary necessary to resect the Ileo right colon with a jejunal colic.
The perioperative course was significant for hypotension and decreased urine output.
Her postoperative course was significant for decreased urine output, as well as increasing requirement for ventilator support.
She remained to have large base excess on the blood gas.
Blood cultures obtained on [**2159-1-5**] grew coagulase positive Staph aureus.
She continued to have low cardiac index and cardiac output.
The patient was also noted to have melena and assumed to have gastrointestinal bleed, likely lower gastrointestinal bleed.
She remained afebrile with stable blood pressure.
The patient continued to show no significant improvement.
She had no heart sounds.
She had no respiratory sounds.
There was no tracing on the monitor.
