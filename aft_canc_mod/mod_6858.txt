Admission Date:  [**2197-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-7-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 53-year-old right-handed woman with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal white matter, and corpus callosum with some associated edema and mass effect, s/p 2 cycles of induction high-dose methotrexate, and s/p 1 cycle of high-dose methotrexate and rituximab.
She was  initially admitted for scheduled high-dose methotrexate and rituximab dosing and transferred to the ICU with acute mental status decline.
During her recent hospitalization from [**2197-6-26**] to [**2197-7-4**] for third induction cycle of high-dose methotrexate, she develop mental status changes.
It was due to cerebral edema and encephalopathy developed 2 days after high-dose methotrexate.
Head CT showed midline shift with subfalcine and uncal herniation in the setting of tumor progression.
On re-admission on [**2197-7-7**] for a scheduled cycle of methotrexate and rituximab, her examination was notable for an alert metnal status, poor language fluency and comprehension, equal pupils, right lower facial droop,  3/5 strength in the right upper extremity, 1-2/5 in the right lower extremity, absent ankle jerk, upgoing right toe, and impaired pain sensation on the right side of body.
Overnight, the patient was noted to have declining mental status with minimal responsiveness, and no purposeful movements.
MRI was read as revealing no change in her intracranial mass, surrounding edema or mass effect/midline shift; though her primary neuro-oncologist did think there was some progression with mild worsening of midline shift.
Past Medical History: - CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, corpus callosum and left subfrontal region.
- PICC-associated right upper extremity DVT, diagnosed on [**2197-6-18**] and had PICC removal.
- Prior gram positive bacteremia - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - s/p oophorectomy  Social History: She lives with husband.
She has no tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
Likely right lower facial droop.
ABDOMEN: No tenderness in the left upper quadrant.
No rebound or guarding.
EXTREMITIES: Left upper extremity with diffuse ecchymoses in the area of removed Port-a-cath.
No doll's eyes.
Right lower facial droop.
Bilateral lower extremities without movement.
Unable to elicit patellar or ankle jerk reflexes bilaterally.
INR 1.2, PTT 42.6 MTX 5.3  [**2197-7-8**]: Imaging: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**2197-7-8**]): Prelim report with no change in size of the mass surrounding edema, ventricular size and periventricular edema compared to the previous MRI of [**2197-7-1**].
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**2197-7-1**]): Again a large enhancing mass is identified in the left basal ganglia region with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Compared to the prior study, the enhancing component of the brain and the lesion in the corpus callosum and also in the left subfrontal region has decreased.
However, the mass in the left basal ganglia may have slightly increased in size, now measures 4 x 3 cm compared to 2 x 3.5 cm on the previous study.
There is persistent dilatation of the ventricles with dilation of both temporal horns indicative of hydrocephalus.
Periventricular edema is also identified.
Extensive edema in the left frontal lobe is seen which might not have significantly changed since the previous study.
There continued to be uncal herniation on the left and extension of edema into the left side of the midbrain and pons.
No other areas of abnormal enhancement identified.
There is mild midline shift from the left to the right.
IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI examination, the component of the tumor seen in the basal ganglia may have slightly increased in size but the enhancing lesions in the corpus callosum and left subfrontal region have decreased.
Edema is unchanged and midline shift and mass effect is also unchanged.
The ventricular size is unchanged with dilated temporal horns and signs of transependymal flow of CSF and periventricular edema.
Chest X-Ray ([**2197-7-7**]): New left-sided PICC line positioned in the left brachiocephalic vein.
New increased density in the left base, which may be secondary to film technique  MRI Head on [**2197-7-26**] with improvement in above lesions.
Altered Mental Status: Patient was found unresponsive on hospital day 1 after scheduled methotrexate and rituximab treatment.
Altered mental status was likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema.
MRI obtained on transfer on [**2197-7-8**] showed no interval development of acute ischemia or hemorrhage, but there was evidence of midline shift.
Patient was continued on pulse dose steroids and mannitol, and Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Repeat head CT on [**2197-7-14**] showed decreased midline shift and edema, and neurologic examination (right-sided weakness and facial droop) improved on transfer back to floor.
On the floor, the patient did well from a neurological standpoint.
The patient's methotrexate took longer to clear secondary to third spacing of fluid.
Abdominal Pain (noted on transfer to floor): Possibly secondary to diverticular microperforation with spontaneous resealing by omentum.
CT scan showed bowel dilatation and gas in the portal system.
Surgery consult recomendeded a conservative approach with antibiotics of antibioticsmonitoring the patient's good clinical status, normal hemodynamics, and absence of leukocytosis.
Pain medications were held and given only after a thorough clinical examination for peritoneal signs.
The patient's vital signs remained stable and no peritoneal findings were noted.
A KUB after she diet was resumed was unremarkable for bowel dilatation or abnormal [**Last Name (un) **] pattern.
CNS Lymphoma: s/p 3 cycles of high-dose methotrexate combined with rituximab and receiving cranial irradiation c/b acute encephalopathy.
Hypertension: Patient's systolic blood pressure reached a peak of 190-200, secondary to increased intracranial pressure, and recovered with mannitol infusion to SBP 150s on transfer.
It was stopped temporarily due to fall in hematocrit, but this remained stable at 24.
Depression with Psychotic Features: Patient reports seeing her mother in the room.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.25 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Haloperidol 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
During your hospitalization you were found to have increasing somlonence from swelling in your brain and required transfer to the intensive care unit, as well as medication to help decreased the swelling in your brain.
You also were complaining of abdominal pain for which we gave you antibiotics.
Please return to the emergency department if you experience headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, looses or absent stools or any other symptom that concerns you.
