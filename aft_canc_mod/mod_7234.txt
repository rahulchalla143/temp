Despite bowel rest, NG decompression, and fluid resuscitation, she had persisent abdominal pain and tachycardia.
Postoperatively, she was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
She was extubated in the OR and transferred to the ICU for management of her atrial fibrillation, which required diltiazem drip.
Her course is described below by system:  Neuro: Pain was initially controlled with narcotics, however the patient had an episode of confusion after given IV ativan.
All narcotics and benzodiazepines were stopped and her pain was managed with tylenol thereafter.
CT and MRI/MRA scan findings found no acute intracranial process, with no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage, a known, stable left parietal cavernoma.
Vascular neurology service evaluation concluded that the patient had likely developed a seizure given that she had been off of her carbamazepine during her admission, and recommending restarting this home medication.
Since re-initiating her anti-seizure medications, she has done well with no clinical neurologic changes to her baseline status.
Her anti-coagulation was resumed, given her history of thrombophilia.
She was bridged on twice daily lovenox while on 0.5mg of coumadin daily (home dose coumadin 1mg M,W,F; 1.5mg T,Th); her coagulation profile prior to discharge was as follows: PT: 16.2  PTT: 55.1  INR: 1.5  CV: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation that is difficult to control at baseline per her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 109326**], rate control was attempted for her with emsolol and amiodarone with minimal effect.
While on the floor, she was monitored on telemetry and was found to be moderately bradycardic to the 40s, but asymptomatic and normotensive.
She developed no pulmonary issues and was stable from this standpoint.
Heme: The patient is on long-term coumadin given her history of PE and thrombin mutation.
She was anticoagulated with a heparin drip [**Hospital1 **] due to her history of PE and thrombin mutation.
She was afebrile throughout her stay and did not require antibiotics upon discharge.
Coumadin 1'  and 1 [**1-11**] Tues / [**Last Name (un) **] mg daily   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Small bowel obstruction  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a partial small bowel obstruction and initially underwent conservative management with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-gastric tube.
Despite this, however, your pain did not resolve, thus you underwent a small intestinal bypass and removal of an enterolith within your small intestine.
You were managed post-operatively in the ICU for a rapid heart rate given your history of atrial fibrillation, and recovered well on the floor.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2172**] home dose of clonazepam was not resumed secondary to concern that it may not have helped with sleep as originally prescribed and initially may have exacerbated your isolated seizure episode.
Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace, and if the symptoms does not improve call the office.
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed with staples.
