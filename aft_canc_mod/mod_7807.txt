He subsequently underwent endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration.
He subsequently developed obstructive jaundice and on [**Month (only) **], he was noted to have a biliary stricture.
The subsequent CT scan images showed complete resolution of pancreas mass.
However, repeat [**Month (only) **] showed persistence of biliary stricture.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] evaluated the patient for possible Whipple procedure secondary to highly suspicious brushing results.

Physical Exam: On Discharge: VS: 98.6, 70, 138/69, 12, 95% RA GEN: Pleasan with NAD NECK: Left longitudinal incision open to air with steri strips and c/d/i CV: RRR RESP: CTAB ABD: Bilateral subcostal incision open to air with staples, minimal erythema on middle portion of incision.
This could be due to technical factors or slow flow, however a thrombosed LPV cannot be excluded.
Pneumobilia 3.

Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
On POD # 4, one JP output increased up to 1 L and patient underwent liver doppler to rule out portal vein obstruction.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound was evaluated daily and small area of erythema was noticed on the middle part of the incision on POD # 3.
Hematology: The patient was transfused with 2 units of pRBC intraoperatively secondary to blood loss.
Post op patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no further transfusions were required.
