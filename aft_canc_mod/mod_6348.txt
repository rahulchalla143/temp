[**2131-5-18**] Final pathology of mesenteric mass: PENDING ON DISCHARGE  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2520**] was taken to the operating room on [**2131-5-18**] for exploratory laparotomy given concern of ischemic colitis in the setting of an increased WBC count, rising lactate, and acute decompensation requiring pressors.
There was no acute abdominal pathology found: his gallbladder was encased in omentum and varices without evidence of necrosis or gangrenous change, his liver was cirrhotic with moderate ascites.
A large 3-4 cm mass in the root of the mesentery was identified and sent for pathologic analysis, which returned as a spindle cell tumor, possibly consistent with a desmoid.
Postoperatively, his JP drained greater than 2L of serosanguineous fluid daily.
His LFTs progressively trended down during his admission, and he will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2132-5-31**] for further management of his ascites.
Final pathology of his mesenteric mass is pending on discharge.

Peritoneal fluid culture from [**2131-5-25**] was negative, and peritoneal fluid culture from [**2131-5-28**] was pending at the time of discharge (with 3+ PMNs and no microorganisms seen on gram stain).
On discharge he was afebrile and feeling well.
