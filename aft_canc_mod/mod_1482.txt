Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 20%with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, newly diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with lower extremity peripheral edema and oozing.
He was found to have significant evidence of volume overload on physical exam with a very elevated JVP and 4+ pitting edema to the level of the abdomen.
He had a transthoracic echo which showed biventricular systolic dysfunction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%.
He had relative hypotension with SBP in the 90's and had reportedly had episodes of hypotension after being started on an ACE-inhibitor at an outside hospital.
On [**9-27**] the patient was found unresponsive and hypoxic and was intubated and transferred to the cardiac care unit.
At that time he was found to have significant multiorgan failure and shock requiring pressor support, afebrile.
Imaging was not supportive of mesenteric ischemia or pulmonary embolism.
It was felt that this was [**12-21**] cardiogenic shock from end stage heart failure.
CT head, MRI head showed no evidence of a acute bleed.
Based on imaging and EEG, neurology felt that there was a poor but "not dismal" chance of neurologic recovery.
