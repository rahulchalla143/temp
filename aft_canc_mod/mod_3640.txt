In pertinent recent history, the pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a probable upper GI bleed from [**3-14**] to [**3-21**].
His varices could not be banded at that time due to an esophageal stricture.
On Monday, he came to the hospital and had an infusion of Procrit.
Following this, he felt very tired and continued to feel more and more fatigued on Tues and Wed.
No BRBPR or hematoemesis.
Pt denies abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
In further discussion, pt reports that he has felt mildly lightheaded since Tuesday.
No vertigo.
He denies CP and SOB.
Had difficulty moving around at home for the last two days because of his severe fatigue but not because of SOB.
He reports mild pain in his right hip which he attributes to his arthritis.
No LE pain or swelling.
No dysuria or hematuria.
GI bleeding- Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 55482**] with a bleed thought to be due to esophageal varices.
Pt could not be successfully banded due to a esophageal stricture that limited the passage of the banding device.
Per recent notes from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], it appears that the pt had a good local result but has progressive pulmonary mets.
These may be from his esophageal CA but as his CEA is also rising it cannot be excluded that they are from his HCC.
Seasonal allergies 6.
HTN  Social History: Pt is married and lives with his wife.
He has a brother with "heart disease" and a sister with breast cancer.
Mildly dry mucous membranes.
Pulm- Diffuse crackles throughout lower half of lungs bilaterally.
Note is made of faint opacity in the right lower lobe, which may represent aspiration or aspiration pneumonia.
Note is made of multiple small nodular opacities in bilateral lungs, probably representing metastatic disease noted on the prior chest CT.
IMPRESSION: Faint opacity in right lower lobe, which may represent aspiration versus aspiration pneumonia.
Multiple nodular opacities in bilateral lungs, probably representing metastatic disease noted on prior chest CT in this patient with HCC.
GI bleeding- Pt with melanotic stools and a Hct drop from 32 on [**4-22**] to 25.6 on arrival in the ED.
However, this is very difficult as they could not be banded in the past secondary to esophageal strictures.
No intervention was made but iv octreotide was administered for four days and his hct remained stable.
His most recent CT scan from [**4-16**] showed tumor thrombus occluding the portal vein and nodular implants along the hepatic capsule along with mesenteric stranding consistent with peritoneal carcinoma.
Pt also has significant increase in size and number of bilateral pulmonary nodules and a new lytic foci in the left iliac bone and increased size of lytic foci in the right sacroiliac joint and the thoracic spine.
Hypercalcemia- This is a new finding for the pt, it is likely hypercalcemia of malignancy.
The pt also had hypomagnesemia which may be secondary to the hypercalcemia.
Starting a bisphosphonate may be considered as an outpatient if his calcium remains elevated.
