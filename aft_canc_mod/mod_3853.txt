Admission Date: [**2186-2-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2186-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-4-19**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2186-4-1**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post 4-vessel CABG in [**5-4**], status post pacemaker placement who was admitted for evaluation of elevated white blood cell count.
In [**2-2**], he noticed fatigue, decreased energy, diffuse body aches, swollen gums, and swollen glands.
He experienced extreme dyspnea on exertion, initially only while walking uphill or exerting himself, but progressively increasing to the point that he was having dyspnea with walking on level ground for distances greater than [**9-20**] feet.
Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times 4 vessels in [**5-4**].
No history of myocardial infarction.
Basal cell carcinoma, status post excision.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father was deceased from [**Name (NI) 4278**] lymphoma and diabetes mellitus 2, mother deceased from a colon cancer, and sister with cervical cancer.
Generally, this is a well- developed, thin, chronically ill-appearing male, no acute distress.
No scleral injection or icterus.
There was positive lymphadenopathy at the right and left submandibular, soft, mobile lymph nodes approximately 1 cm in diameter and matted lymph nodes in the anterior cervical neck chain.
Cardiovascular exam, was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and crescendo/decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was a surgical scar noted from his kidney surgery.
Extremities were warm and well perfused without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Leukemia:  The patient underwent bone marrow biopsy, result consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia.
Notably, on admission, he had febrile neutropenia with an ANC less than 500.
Status post subclavian line placement for chemotherapy, he had increased bleeding and oozing from line site on [**2186-2-27**] and was found on laboratories to be in acute DIC.
He had a prolonged period of neutropenia from [**2186-3-2**] to [**2186-3-24**].
However, he had a transfusion- dependent anemia and low platelets that was concerning for antiplatelets antibodies.
Additionally, towards the end of his hospital course, a peripheral smear started to reveal presence of immature cells.
This was concerning for recurrence of his disease.
Dyspnea/hypoxia:  Starting on [**2186-3-6**], the patient became more dyspneic with increasing oxygen requirement.
CT scan of the chest at that time demonstrated right upper lobe ground glass opacities concerning for infection versus hemorrhage.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2186-3-7**] with grossly bloody lavage fluid concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
As part of the workup for his dyspnea, he also underwent echocardiogram, which showed a depression of his ejection fraction to 40 percent.
The patient's dyspnea remained with very minimal improvement.
In light of this, repeat CT scan was performed on [**2186-3-20**], which demonstrated persistent bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities concerning for atypical versus fungal infection versus cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
However, as his counts came back up, he had an increasing oxygen requirement concerning for engraftment syndrome.
There was a concern whether he had some evidence of aspiration versus hospital acquired pneumonia as serial chest x-rays demonstrated left lower lobe and lingular opacities.
He continued to have increasing oxygen requirement and had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**2186-3-28**], necessitating transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
It showed a slight decrease in previously noted bilateral pleural effusions.
There was patchy consolidation bilateral diffusely mostly in the peripheral lung zones.
There was increasing atelectasis at the right greater than the left bases.
There are bilateral lower lobe opacities with question of airway collapse.
There were no filling defects concerning for a pulmonary embolus noted.
The patient continued to be in profound respiratory distress and was managed in the Intensive Care Unit with noninvasive ventilation mode.
There was some concern that perhaps some of his respiratory compensation was due to amiodarone toxicity, as he had been on amiodarone in the past.
He was also evaluated for a possible VATS procedure.
He continued to have episodes of hypoxia and desaturation, which responded to repositioning, anxiolytics, and noninvasive ventilation.
However, post intubation, he became unstable from the hemodynamic standpoint.
His degree of hypotension ultimately necessitated initiation of pressors.
At this time, it was felt that the patient's prognosis was very poor given his increased need for hemodynamic support via pressors in his prolonged persistent hypoxia unresponsive to ventilation techniques, and broad spectrum antibiotics for possible pulmonary process.
At that time, it was decided that VATS could not be performed due to the patient's instability as well as due to his overall prognosis.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 40 percent with inferolateral hypokinesis and anteroseptal hypokinesis, which was a new finding.
Therefore, the patient was started on management for congestive heart failure.
However, around this time, his white blood cell counts returned.
At this standpoint, [**2186-3-25**] and [**2186-3-26**], the majority of his dyspnea was felt to be related to pulmonary issues and not to heart failure issues.
This resulted in elevations in his liver transaminases concerning for drug reaction versus hepatic involvement of the [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
An ultrasound was done to assess the hepatobiliary system and there was no evidence of hepatic involvement.
Status post treatment with Lasix, the patient developed a diffuse maculopapular rash.
He was continued on his antibiotics due to his profound neutropenia and immunocompromised state.
At no time was there any mucosal involvement, blistering, or bullae formation.
Urinary electrolytes were evaluated and felt to be consistent with Fanconi's syndrome.
His phosphorus loss was exacerbated by diarrhea as well as respiratory alkalosis.
Evaluation of his parathyroid hormone found it to be markedly elevated.
However, due to multiple complicating events status post initiation of chemotherapy for his AML, including worsening cardiopulmonary status and need for higher level of care in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, code status was re-addressed to his family on [**2186-3-31**].
