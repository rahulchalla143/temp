Surgery was deferred due to co-morbidities and a percutaneous cholecystostomy drain was placed.
Approximately 1.5 wks ago the patient became increasingly jaundiced.
She was again evaluated at [**Hospital3 20284**] Center in [**Hospital1 189**] where CT and MRI showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and CBD with proximal narrowing near the cystic duct concerning for Mirizzi's syndrome.
ERCP was attempted but unsuccessful as the scope could not pass an edematous duodenal bulb.
Past Medical History: PMH: A.fib (not anticoagulated), DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, anemia  PSH: percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, wisdom tooth extraction, cataract surgery, ERCP - at [**Hospital3 **] (date unknown), ERCP - [**2141-7-14**] aborted, ERCP [**2141-7-17**] [**Hospital1 18**]   Social History: No tobacco or recreational drug use.

Dilatation of the proximal common bile duct with abrupt cutoff of the lumen at the level of the liver hilum.
Markedly abnormal gallbladder with irregular enhancing wall thickening.
Due to the extensive soft tissue extension the appearance is concerning for gallbladder carcinoma, differential diagnosis includes Mirizzi syndrome although this is considered less likely.
Gallstones are not seen on CT and ultrasound would be helpful to document an obstructing stone in the cystic duct.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Soft tissue stranding along the right paracolic gutter; uncertain clinical significance, this may be postsurgical, however peritoneal metastases canot be entirely excluded.
[**2141-7-27**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST - Persistent mild dilatation of the left biliary ducts which is improved from the [**2141-7-18**] CT.
Unchanged appearance to the gallbladder, again most consistent with invasive gallbladder carcinoma.
Findings remain highly suspicious for peritoneal disease along the right paracolic gutter.
Unchanged extension to the portal hilum and second portion of the duodenum as noted previously.
Interval increase in size to moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
Moderate ascites within the pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4135**] is a 68 year-old female who intially presented to an outside hospital with RUQ pain concerning for acute cholecystitis.
She noticed worsening jaundice and represented to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center in [**Hospital1 189**] where a CT and MR imaging showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and dilated CBD with proximal narrowing, concerning for Mirizzi's syndrome initially.
She was referred for ERCP and decompression but this was unsuccessful as the scope could not pass the edematous duodenal bulb.
She was admitted on [**2141-7-17**] for management of her obstructive jaundice.
On [**2141-7-17**], an ERCP was re-performed and a circumferential infiltrating mass causing near complete obstruction was noted at the second part of duodenum and biopsies were performed which yielded chronic duodenitis, but no malignancy.
A CT scan performed on [**7-18**] demonstrated moderate-to-severe intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Dilatation of the proximal common bile duct with abrupt cutoff of the lumen at the level of the liver hilum was noted.
A markedly abnormal gallbladder with irregular enhancing wall thickening was noted.
Due to the extensive soft tissue extension the appearance was concerning for gallbladder carcinoma.
A this point, EGD with duodenal stenting was performed on [**2141-7-21**], to bypass the obstructing duodenal mass noted above.
She did have poor ability to clear secretions and given her extensive hospitalization, there was concern for poor respiratory status.
She had a CXR on [**7-23**] which demonstrated findings concerning for RLL pneumonia and she was monitored closely with chest PT and encouragement of IS.
She was afebrile at that time.
In an effort to determine the source, the biliart drain was uncapped, revealing foul-smelling bilious drainage and laboratory studies, along with cultures, were obtained.
As noted above, her RLL infiltrate was of concern and work-up at the time demonstrated findings consistent with a UTI.
On [**7-27**], repeat PTC was performed and PTBD demonstrated persistent dilatation of the left biliary system, thus metal stenting was not attempted.
The patient underwent a CT scan again on [**7-27**] showing persistent mild dilatation of the left biliary ducts which is improved from the [**2141-7-18**] CT.
Unchanged appearance to the gallbladder, again most consistent with invasive gallbladder carcinoma.
Given these findins, repeat PTBD was performed on [**7-28**] and left and right metal biliary stent placement was successful, and IR left an external drainage route at that time given her previous cholangitic issues and MRSA infection.
She will be scheduled to follow-up with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 189**] Oncologist regarding her likely invasive gallbladder carcinoma for proper staging and possible treatment.
She was to complete a 2-week course of Vancomycin and Zosyn given her RLL pneumonia concerns and her biliary MRSA infection.

PTBD Drain Care: *Keep drain capped *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
PICC Line: *Please monitor the site regularly, and [**Name6 (MD) 138**] your MD, nurse practitioner, or [**Name6 (MD) 269**] Nurse if you notice redness, swelling, tenderness or pain, drainage or bleeding at the insertion site.
* [**Name6 (MD) **] your MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the Emergency Room immediately if the PICC Line tubing becomes damaged or punctured, or if the line is pulled out partially or completely.
Contact your [**Name2 (NI) 269**] Nurse if the dressing comes undone or is significantly soiled for further instructions.
