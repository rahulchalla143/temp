Admission Date:  [**2127-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-12-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Fever, abnormal chest CT.  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old male with a history of stage I lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] classical Hodgkin's s/p XRT now with recurrent Hodgkins disease, s/p 3 cycles of AVD (last treatment was [**4-25**] (C3D15)), and presumed bleomycin pneumonitis on steroids, who presents from clinic with fever to 102.2 and dry cough.
He took tylenol and proceeded to go to a dental appointment which included a cleaning and filling.
A CT thorax on the day of admission demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities, and he was sent for admission.
On review of systems he has noted a dry cough which has been unchanged since an episode of bleomycin hypersensitivity (see below).
He developed R sided chest discomfort and chills 2 hours after receiving bleomycin, with T 101.8, O2 sat 88% on RA.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 29992**] note from [**5-7**]: Briefly, he initially presented with left-sided neck adenopathy in 7/00.
Excisional biopsy was consistent with lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] classical Hodgkin's disease with diffuse effacement and diagnostic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.
However, this was felt to be less likely due to persistence of germinal centers.
BCL1 staining was was not consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.
CT torso showed no significant adenopathy.
CT scan dated [**2125-1-29**] revealed mild interval increase in size of right hilar node, largest measuring 1.1cm and slight interval increase of the right sided subcarinal adenopathy measuring 1cm.
He was stable until recently when he experienced a renal stone.
This showed interval increase in disease, with multiple new intra-adbominal masses.
He underwent a CT guided FNA of one of the lung based nodules which revealed a minute fragment of fibrous tissue with scattered small lymphocytes and rare large atypical cells, including binucleated forms, with prominent nucleoli consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]-  Sternberg cells.
Immunoperoxidase stains revealed that some of the large atypical cells are positive for CD20 and CD30, and negative for CD15.
LCA is difficult to interpret due to high background staining, however the large cells appear to be negative.
Since he had only had XRT, and no previous chemotherapy, the plan was made for ABVD, of which he has completed 3 cycles, with complications as above, as well as neutropenia requiring neupogen injections.
Additionally, On the day of his first dose of Neupogen, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was taken to the emergency room.
PMHx: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Nephrolithiasis Paroxysmal A-Fib:  Noted in clinic on day of his first dose of neupogen, [**2127-3-11**].
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was taken to the emergency room.
HEENT:  Anicteric, white lesions on tongue, otherwise oral mucosa moist and without lesion.
Lymph nodes:  No cervical, axillary, or supraclavicular adenopathy.
Lungs:  Mild scattered rales throughout.
Cor: RR, tachycardic, 1/6 systolic murmur at RSB.
Increased patchy pulmonary opacities distributed diffusely in both lungs, most pronounced in the right upper lobe.
In the given clinical setting of cough and fever, the primary consideration is diffuse infection including PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations include drug-induced lung disease and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Also, an SIP, COPD and pulmonary edema could have this appearance.

His presentation with dyspnea and worsening ground glass opacities on CT scan, in the setting of Hodgkin's Disease and having been on steroids was concerning for PCP.
If he becomes neutropenic he will need to continue Bactrim for 21 days from becoming neutropenic.
He additionally was continued on clindamycin initially in case of blood stream infection from his dental procedure.
This, too, was discontinued once the BAL was positive for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] fever was possibly secondary to a combination of neupogen injection which he had received on the day prior to admission, as well as PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] immediately defervesced by the 3rd hospital day, possibly in part from steroid effect.
He continued to have luekocytosis with bandemia but no fever.
Felt leukocytosis secondary to steroids.
Onc ehe was stabiled from a respiratory standpoint.
Pt tolerated well with no noted side effects.
4) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  His pulse was regular on exam during the admission, with normal rate.

Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] and come in to the hospital if you are having any fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, difficulty breathing or any other concerning problems.
If he becomes neutropenic will need to continue Bactrim DS 2 tabs DS for 21 days from neutropenia otherwise can complete 21 day course which would end [**5-30**].
