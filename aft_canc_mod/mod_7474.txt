HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old white female with a history of multiple myeloma, complicated by end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, complicated by multiple clots on Coumadin, who was brought to an outside hospital by her boyfriend with confusion, nausea and vomiting of black vomitus, and headache.
Evidently, approximately one month prior to admission the patient had fallen and hit her head without any neurological symptoms, loss of consciousness, or sequelae.
Then, approximately three days prior to admission, the patient was noted to have increasing confusion by her boyfriend and daughter.
The patient was also noted to have an increase in easy bruising, anorexia, nausea and vomiting.
On review of systems, the patient reported an approximately 60 pound weight loss over the course of six months from a weight of greater than 200 pounds, with anorexia, diffuse abdominal pain for about four months, and some bright red blood per rectum for approximately two months.
At the outside hospital, head CT showed a multiloculated acute on chronic subdural hematoma, with an INR of 8.3 and a hematocrit of 24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Multiple myeloma with light chain disease for approximately eight years treated with Thalidomide.
2) Secondary end-stage renal disease, now on hemodialysis three times per week.
3) Multiple thromboses of upper extremity AV graft, status post multiple thrombectomies.
4) SVC syndrome secondary to central line thrombosis.
6) Chronic anemia.
General - the patient is an elderly lady lying in bed in mild distress with some agitation.
HEENT - extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to light bilaterally, no carotid bruits.
Cardiac - regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs - mild crackles at the bases, otherwise clear to auscultation.
Abdomen - soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, somewhat decreased, guaiac positive, positive retroperitoneal bruising.
Extremities - warm, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, a left thigh fistula with a positive thrill.
Neurological - the patient is alert and responds verbally with fluent speech, oriented x 3 with one correction from [**2020**] to [**2120**] with prompting, tongue midline, facial motor symmetric, repeats short phrases without difficulty but recall is limited, patient had a question of mild left-sided neglect, movement of all extremities spontaneously, no obvious upper extremity drift, but positive right upper extremity ataxia-type tremor.
HEAD CT ON ADMISSION:  A loculated collection, hemorrhage, probably of different ages in the right temporal lobe, asymmetry of the lateral ventricles with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, effacement with foci in the right and a small amount of midline shift to the left.
ASSESSMENT:  A 64-year-old female with acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage secondary to supertherapeutic Coumadin and fall.
Due to the multiloculated and small size of the subdural hematoma which was deemed to be acute on chronic, evacuation by neurosurgery was deferred, although they continued to follow closely throughout her admission.
Upon presentation, the patient's neurological exam was nonfocal with a question of left-sided neglect.
After admission to the MICU, the patient developed a more obvious left facial droop and decreased movement of the left extremity.
These neurological symptoms had resolved completely by the time of discharge.
All of these scans showed a subdural hemorrhage, stable, from the time of admission.
The patient was also noted on EEG during the admission to have evidence of epileptiform activity.
Of note, the patient had missed her dialysis session the previous day due to multiple studies on that day.
Therefore, it was felt that the episode of respiratory failure was most likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume overload and secondary congestive heart failure.
With dialysis and careful monitoring of volume status, the patient improved and was extubated for the second time on hospital day #5.
In addition, the beta blocker was discontinued for concern of exacerbating bronchospasm.
At the time of discharge, the patient was no longer wheezing or requiring nebulizers.
Under direct laryngoscopy, the patient was observed to have erythema and swelling of the posterior larynx.
This was thought to be consistent with irritation due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, in addition to intubation.
4) CARDIAC:  Following the episode of respiratory failure, cardiac enzyme levels were obtained, and the patient was observed to have a small increase in troponin levels.
This was thought to be due to cardiac stress in the setting of volume overload, and the possibility of contribution from coronary artery disease.
5) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  After admission to the MICU for the second time, the patient was noted to have an infiltrate on chest x-ray which was thought to be consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was also noted to have a urinary tract infection by UA for which the patient was covered by Levofloxacin.
Blood cultures were obtained in addition to the urine culture, both of which came back positive for streptococcal bovis.
Given the association of streptococcal bovis with GI pathology, in addition to the patient's symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding and history of weight loss, abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum, there was concern for the possibility of a GI source of the infection.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone with plan for at least a 4-week course of ceftriaxone to cover for the possibility of endocarditis, especially considering the patient's valvular disease with mitral regurgitation.
A TTE showed no evidence of vegetations, but a TEE was declined due to inability to visualize the upper GI tract and concern for bleeding with a history of black emesis.
6) GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with a history of black emesis, in addition to bright red blood per rectum.
As noted above, this in combination with weight loss, abdominal pain, streptococcal bovis bacteremia, and urinary tract infection raised concern for the possibility of a gastrointestinal source such as a colonic malignancy.
7) RENAL:  The patient has end-stage renal disease secondary to light chain multiple myeloma.
8) ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is being maintained on levothyroxine.
These showed a very low TSH level and a low T3 level, but these findings were thought to be unreliable in the acute setting.
Presumed uremic platelet dysfunction was treated with DDAVP, as well as dialysis.
However, in addition the patient has a significant history of AV graft thrombosis and SVC syndrome.
There was concern for procoagulant risk.
In addition, the patient was started on low dose aspirin after discovery of slightly increased troponin levels.
The plan at discharge was to hold all additional anticoagulation until there was radiographic evidence of no repeat subdural hemorrhage for approximately four weeks.
If that head CT showed no progression of the subdural hematoma or new bleed, then anticoagulation with Coumadin could be restarted two weeks later.
10) ONCOLOGY:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma that was seen to be active with multiple lytic lesions in the skull seen on head CT.
11) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Due to risk of aspiration, a swallowing study was obtained after the patient was transferred to the floor on hospital day #5.
This showed no evidence of aspiration, and the patient was restarted on a full PO diet.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Subdural hemorrhage secondary to supertherapeutic Coumadin.
3) Streptococcal bovis bacteremia.
4) Urinary tract infection.
5) Pulmonary edema.
6) Non-Q wave myocardial infarction, 7) Aspiration pneumonia.
9) Laryngeal edema secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease and intubation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Ceftriaxone 1 gm qd for 26 more days (total course of 4 weeks), 2) diltiazem 60 mg tid, 3) pantoprazole 40 mg qd, 4) aspirin 325 mg qd, 5) levothyroxine 25 mcg qd, 6) dexamethasone 2 mg qd for 2 weeks, to be continued until after repeat head CT in 2 weeks, at that point a neurologist should be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding tapering the dexamethasone, 7) phenytoin 150 mg q am, 200 mg q pm, 8) calcium carbonate 1,000 mg qd, 9) albuterol/ipratropium 103-18 mcg aerosol 1-2 puffs inhalation q 4-6 h prn shortness of breath or wheezing.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should be followed closely for any change in neurological status.
Any change (such as focal signs, increased somnolence) should prompt a repeat head CT to rule out repeat bleed or increased edema from nontolerance of dexamethasone tapering.
If this shows no repeat bleed and gastrointestinal work-up is negative, then two weeks later (four weeks from discharge), the patient can be started on anticoagulation again.
Also, based on the level of edema seen on the head CT, the patient's dexamethasone can be slowly tapered.
This is to rule out any gastrointestinal malignancy or gastrointestinal source of the streptococcal bovis bacteremia, in addition to the gastrointestinal bleed.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], after leaving the acute rehab setting.
In addition, due to the patient's abnormal thyroid function tests during this inpatient setting, the patient's thyroid function tests should be repeated as an outpatient.
