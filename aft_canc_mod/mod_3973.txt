DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic primar peritoneal carcinoma.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient had been diagnosed with possible ovarian cancer one month prior to presentation when she presented to her primary care physician with increasing shortness of breath and abdominal distention.
A paracentesis was performed at that time secondary to increasing shortness of breath and ascites with positive malignant cells on cytology.
The patient underwent a preoperative chest x-ray, which revealed bilateral pleural effusions, which were consistent with the pleural effusions seen on her chest CT with the right greater than left pleural effusions.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post multiple fractures after a car accident, status post surgical repair.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to sulfa.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and distended secondary to ascites.
Sterile vaginal examination was limited secondary to body habitus.
There is palpable cervix and vagina, which were within normal limits.
Her rectal was guaiac negative with no masses.
Extremities: There is trace edema bilaterally.
A preoperative chest x-ray was obtained at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2119-9-13**], which showed bilateral pleural effusions consistent with prior imaging.
Surgery was uncomplicated with a blood loss of 300 cc and approximately 4 liters of ascites drained.
Patient's pathology and cytology from the surgery are consistent with metastatic primary peritoneal carcinoma Stage IV papillary serous pathology.
Postoperative course:  On postoperative day number one, the patient was transferred to the ICU secondary to oxygenation issues.
On postoperative day number two, after being called out from the ICU, the patient was found to have an acute desaturation in her oxygen status.
Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed worsening bilateral pulmonary effusions.
She underwent a CTA to rule out a pulmonary embolus, for which she was ruled out.
She also had some mild chest pain for which she underwent serial cardiac enzymes, which came back negative.
On postoperative day number four, the patient was evaluated by the Medicine consult team and a repeat chest x-ray showed worsening of her right pleural effusion.
On postoperative day number five, she underwent a chest x-ray post thoracentesis, which showed a very small pleural effusion.
This was then followed up by a repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day four, which showed no change in the pneumothorax.
On postoperative day number six, her chest x-ray was repeated, which showed no change in her pneumothorax, and still remains small and the patient remains clinically stable.
GI:  The patient initially had nausea and vomiting postoperatively, which resolved and she was able to tolerate regular diet prior to discharge.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Primary peritoneal carcinoma metastatic disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
