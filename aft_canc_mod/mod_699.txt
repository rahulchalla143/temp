Patient initially presented on [**2195-12-31**] with the sudden onset of headache, diplopia, and neck stiffness while watching television.
He presented to the ED where he was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage with no evidence of aneurysm.
Surprisingly, his bleed was thought to be spontaneous with no clear precipitant.
His course has been complicated by blood sugar abnormalities for which [**Last Name (un) **] is following, nausea and vomiting for which he has been left NPO, and fevers.
His nausea and vomiting has markedly improved today on the day of transfer due to his being allowed to eat.
Regarding his fevers, he initially developed fevers to 101 on [**1-1**] and has had near daily fevers since then.
He has felt malaise and occasional chills with fevers.
His antibiotic course was complicated by diarrhea which improved with yogurt and probiotics.

STUDIES: - [**2195-12-31**] - Noncontrast Head CT - Subarachnoid hemorrhage centered in the suprasellar cistern with extension along the tentorium on the right.
- [**2195-12-31**] - CTA Head - Subarachnoid hemorrhage centered in the suprasellar cistern with extension along the tentorium on the right.
Expected evolution of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, without evidence of interim rebleeding.
Mild stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral artery.
No evidence of an intracranial aneurysm or vascular malformation.
- [**2196-1-4**] - CXR Portable - The lungs are clear without infiltrate or effusion.
There is no focal infiltrate.
No significant change compared to prior - [**2196-1-6**] - Carotid / Cerebral Study - pending - [**2196-1-7**] - LENIs - No lower extremity DVT bilaterally.
- [**2196-1-8**] - KUB Portable - No evidence for ileus or obstruction.
- [**2196-1-8**] - Portable CXR - No evidence of pneumonia.
- [**2196-1-8**] - CT Head - Marked improvement in subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage since [**2196-1-4**], without evidence of interim bleeding or hydrocephalus.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trace aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Fevers - Had episodic fevers from 101 - 103 deg F with no localizing signs/symptoms.
Had no signs of CSF infection, and CXR was negative for pneumonia.
Echo was obtained due to question of new murmur on exam, which showed trace AR, normal valves, and otherwise normal heart structure/function.
Given his initial diarrhea and recent exposure to clindamycin, stool for C. diff was sent, and was negative.
He was monitored for signs of lymphoma, but no lymphadenopathy was appreciated, WBC count/diff appeared to be within his baseline, and LDH was normal.
Fever secondary to his recent bleed were thought to also be contributing.
Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage - Initially found to have spontaneous hemorrhages, with no source by CTA and diagnostic angiogram, but which were stable on repeat imaging.
His associated headache pain was controlled with IV pain medication initially, and he was then transitioned to a PO pain regimen, which was well-tolerated prior to discharge.
In addition, he was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis and nimodipine for vasospasm protection.
He remained neurologically intact and stable through hospitalization, with resolution of a 6th cranial nerve palsy thought due to his hemorrhages.
Hypertension - Blood pressure was stable and wnl during hospitalization, and he was transitioned from nimodipine to his home antihypertensive, lisinopril, prior to discharge.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus - Self-managed by patient via his insulin pump.
Was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes team, where he receives his diabetic care, and his blood sugars were wnl with his self-management.
Hyperlipidemia - Stable, was continued on home pravastatin.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 6-8 hours as needed for headache for 2 weeks: This medication may make you drowsy or sedated.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: Stable with normal VS, able to ambulate unassisted.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the neurosurgery service for a spontaneous bleed in your head, with no surgical intervention warranted.
You were given medication to control your headache pain, which improved by the time of discharge.
Your fevers were evaluated by the medical and infectious disease services, and no signs of an infection in your blood, urine, heart, or lungs were found.
