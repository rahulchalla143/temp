Admission Date:  [**2155-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-3-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amphotericin B / Ambisome / Campath / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy Gastric tube placement Aterial and central venous cannulization Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 37212**] is a 45 y.o.
CML s/p allogenic transplant, chronic GVH, bronchiolitis obliterans s/p recent discharge for worsening dyspnea presented to the ED with hypoxia and altered mental status.
He was noted to have consolidation on CT chest and was going to be treated at home with Levofloxacin and home O2.
On review of OMR it appears he signed out AMA, refused IV antibiotics, further evaluation for his altered mental status and hypercarbia.
For his altered mental status he underwent a CT head which showed an unchanged hypodensity on R fontal and a new 6 mm hyperdense focus in the left temporal lobe, ?mets versus hemorrhage.
History of CML (chronic myeloid leukemia).
Chronic GVH (graft-versus-host).
History of pericardial effusion and tamponade.
Sarcoma of right cheek, status post surgical resection and XRT.
History of multifocal pneumonia.
History of colitis prior to transplant, s/p asacol treatment 10.
History of ganglion cyst removal from right forearm.
Left side of face notable for scar repair.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema noted.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2155-2-14**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
No CTA evidence of a tracheal innominate fistula.
Marked interval worsening of bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and consolidations.
No evidence of high-grade stenosis, occlusion, or dissection involving the extracranial arterial vasculature.
Incomplete evaluation of the intracranial arterial vasculature demonstrates no evidence of high-grade stenosis, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
Stable calcifications and hyperdensity in the right temporal and frontal lobes, likely representing prior radiation treatment.
Scattered sclerotic densities within the bone marrow likely secondary to metastases.
Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged as well as moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
The above-described findings might obscure infection and if clinically warranted further evaluation with chest CT might be considered.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension is detected.
Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect within the right frontotemporal lobe -partly characterized on the recent CT scan and outside neck MRI from [**Month (only) **].
Punctate subacute hemorrhage within the posterior aspect of the left superior temporal gyrus associated with additional areas of hemosiderin staining throughout the subarachnoid space bilaterally with no hydrocephalus.
A hemorrhagic focus, cavernoma are likely; metastatic or infectious lesion remains possible despite the lack of solid enhancement, however less likely.
Extensive maxillary sinus and bil.
mastoid air cell disease bilaterally with air-fluid levels as well as partial visualization of the post-surgical changes within the right face.
He became increasingly tachypnic as well, to RR>50.
Due to concern for fatigue and altered mental status, pt was intubated.
Due to jaw reconstruction and radiation changes, he had to be nasally intubated.
He initially failed SBTs due to copious secretions, poor mental status, and low tidal volumes.
He was transferred to BMT floor, however he had a witnessed aspiration event leading to eventual re-intubation on [**2-28**].
Pt likely has multifactorial chronic end-stage respiratory failure due to severe bronchiolitis obliterans and generalized muscle weakness.
However, CXR more c/w bibasilar collapse with bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient was diuresed aggressively in attempts to clear pleural effusions and re-expand lung, however, Cr began to rise after massive diuresis with lasix gtt and further diuresis was not possible.
There was some bleeding noted from trach site on [**2155-3-18**] so he had bronch which did not reveal etiology of bleeding and also had CTA which did not reveal any communication with artery.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS Patient initially admitted with altered mental status.
MRI/MRA showed right frontotemporal enhancing lesion, and left superior temporal gyrus punctate hemorrhage.
It was felt that lesions were most likely post-radiation changes and did not require biopsy.
LP had 7 WBC but normal protein and glucose, less concerning for bacterial meningitis.
Following second intubation, mental status remained largely at baseline, with some increased waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] on sedation, likely [**3-11**] ICU delirium.
Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive at MRI and required pressors.
CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis oblit erans.
Bactrim and Acyclovir for prophylaxis were held due to renal failure but could be restarted as outpatient if kidney function does not recover and he is continued on HD.
## Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response:  Patient developed A flutter with RVR while on BMT floor.
This issue was complicated by infection, mental status, radiation changes to jaw, and overall deconditioning.
He had a witnessed aspiration event and he subsequently failed speech and swallow for all PO's.
Video swallow suggested diffuse muscle weakness, likely due to deconditioning.
Vanco level was also found to be elevated at 94 which may have led to nephrotoxicity as well.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray [**Hospital1 **]: [**2-8**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed for dry nostrils.
Polyvinyl Alcohol 1.4 % Drops [**Month/Day (2) **]: 1-2 Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup [**Month/Day (2) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, aspiration pneumonia  Secondary: atrial flutter, chronic graft versus host disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 37212**],  You were admitted for diffuclty breathing which is secondary to your lung disease as well as recurrent aspiration.
You were intubated twice for difficulty breathing and ultimatley had a tracheostomy placed because you were unable to breathe well without the help of the ventilator.
Please do not eat or drink via your mouth as this worsens your breathing and will decrease your ability to ever come off the ventilator.
