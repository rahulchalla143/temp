CXR [**2128-4-17**] AP AND LAT Compared with [**2128-4-16**] at 23:54 p.m., there is negligible interval change in the appearance of the AP film.
Small left effusion is again seen.
No focal consolidation.
Gallbladder wall edema and pulsatile portal venous flow, compatible with changes of right heart failure, as seen previously.
Small amount of lower abdominal ascites.
No evidence for biliary ductal dilation.
Left effusion with left base atelectasis.
ECHO  [**2128-4-16**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction and severe functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 100868**] is a 72F with history of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF=20%), primary effusion lymphoma s/p chemo on [**4-9**] who presents with lethargy found to have elevated uric acid level, and on the floor she became increasing lethargic and  was found to have a lactic level of 15.
# Elevated uric acid: The etiology of her elevated uric acid could be due to overdiuresis or tumor lysis syndrome from recent chemotherapy.
# Electrolytes abnormalities: Her phosphate was initially within but subsequently trended up.
The etiology was likely tumor lysis syndrome vs poor renal function.
# Lactic acidosis: On hospital day 2, patient's lactate level was 15 with an increased anion gap.
Rare causes such as Type B lactic acidosis from her primary effusion lymphoma, in addition to rasburicase were on the differential diagnosis.
The etiology of her lactic acidosis is unclear, however it rapidly improved with fluids.
She was started on vanc/cefepime briefly bcause of concern for sepsis as an etiology for her lactic acidosis, however these were stopped after 48h when culture data was negative.
# Elevated LFTs: Her LFTs were trended up in hospital day 2 which was thought to be secondary to rasburicase.
Abdominal ultrasound was obtained to rule out obstruction which showed no biliary dilation.
# Chronic systolic heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy (EF=20%): Initially her home diuretics were held given she looked dry on exam.
On hospital day #2, patient complained of SOB with labored breathing.
Lung exam was notable for bibasilar crackles.
Her symptoms likely related to her heart failure.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Her Cr was initially at baseline at 1.8 and IVF was held after the uric acid level were normalized.
It was likely related to hypovolemia from poor forward flow.
# Primary effusion lymphoma: S/p chemo with Doxil on [**4-9**] (cycle 2 day 7).
Pt c/o nausea and received Zofran.
# Hyponatremia: Likely related to hypovolemia from poor forward flow with history of chronic hyponatremia in low 130s.
# Elevated troponin: Initially with elevated troponin (0.13->0.10->0.09) at presentation likely secondary to renal failure.
Pt denied CP, or palpitation.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rated control w/ metoprolol and amiodarione.
No active issues.
