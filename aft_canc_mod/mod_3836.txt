Wet Read: IPf TUE [**2130-8-22**] 11:17 PM No definite drainable fluid collections seen.
FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Pancreas, adrenal glands and spleen appear within normal limits.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Kidneys demonstrate nonspecific perinephric stranding, with bilateral extrarenal pelvises, with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
There are small low-attenuation lesions within the kidneys, too small to characterize.
The stomach, duodenum, and loops of small and large bowel appear within normal limits.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes.
No definite drainable fluid collection is seen.
Small amount of free fluid is seen.
No drainable fluid collection in the pelvis.
Loops of small and large bowel appear normal.
Suprarenal abdominal aorta is within normal limits.
Infrarenally, there has been removal of previously identified endovascular graft and excision of the native aorta with placement of an aorto-uni-iliac tubular graft anastomosis distal to the right common iliac artery.
There is no evidence of contrast extravasation.
Patient has an inferior vena cava filter.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUE: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There is diffuse anasarca.
There are foci of air within the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior abdominal wall on the left, 2:59 and right 2:56, with opacification in the soft tissue at 2:49 on the left, which should be correlated with injections, or possible infection at this site.
Status post excision of endovascular aorta graft and fem-fem bypass graft, with placement of aorto-uni-iliac tubular graft extending from the infrarenal aorta to the right common iliac artery.
Bilateral pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Small amounts of loculated fluid and air in the subcutaneous tissue abdominal [**Last Name (un) **]; maybe due to subcu injections.
Correlate clinically to exclude a wound infection.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    70 year old woman with placement of DHFT.
With the exception of tube placement and apparent removal of right internal jugular [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] sheath, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the recent prior radiograph.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital 794**] Hospital in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]on [**7-29**] w sharp diffuse abdominal pain associated with back pain.
A CT scan obtained at [**Doctor First Name 794**] showed an infected AAA endograft.
Her pain is currently managed on PO dilaudid, a fentanyl patch, and Gabapentin.
She continued to have chronic lower abdominal pain so a CTA was obtained on [**2130-8-7**] which showed no graft leak and no intra-abdominal abscess collection, but she did have a stable fluid collection around the aortic graft that did not appear to be infected.
Another CT was obtained on [**2130-8-22**] that showed a stable periaortic fluid collection.
A psychiatric consultation was obtained at the patient's request due to concerns for depression.
Her SSRI was discontinued for possible Serotonin syndrome while on Linezolid.
Her PO intake remained poor for a number of days with poor calorie counts.
She is back to her baseline weight but does still complain of some dependent edema for which she continues the lasix.
Endocrine: She does have diabetes and was on a diabetic diet, but to stimulate PO intake this restriction was lifted.
She has not experienced any bone marrow suppression on the Linezolid at this time.
A urine culture from [**2130-8-16**] grew Enterobacter and Pseudomonas.
She reports a temperature spike to 102 on the evening of [**8-21**], but this was not recorded anywhere in her vital signs log.
A CTA was obtained on [**8-22**] to evaluate for an intra-abdominal abscess and this showed a stable fluid collection around the aorta and no identifiable cause of her fever.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical PRN (as needed) as needed for yeast.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
