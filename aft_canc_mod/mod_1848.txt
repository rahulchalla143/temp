Admission Date:  [**2120-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-7-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: expired  History of Present Illness: 56 year old female with history of cholangiocarcinoma status post trisegmentectomy with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and cholecystectomy and recent admission for C. dif (treated) now tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] due to severe abdominal pain.
She stated that she had decreased appetite after she came home from chemotherapy last Thursday ([**7-25**]), and the pain began approx 2 days ago.
She has difficulty characterizing the pain but states that it is very bad.
She reports associated diarrhea, however at [**Location (un) 620**] reported constipation with only small BM/flatus today.
Denies fever or chills, no shortness of breath or chest pain.
She had no nausea until arrival to the [**Hospital3 **] at which point she developed emesis.
She seemed to tolerate this relatively well, and had a small improvement.
She underwent RFA and had a hepatic artery thrombosis which resulted in a long course of chronic hepatic ischemia.
She developed progressive disease and has consulted a number of physicians around the country.
She was extensively treated and recently her chemotherapy has been modified and decreased because of hematologic toxicity.
Family History: It is significant for an aunt with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, father with prostate cancer and heart disease.
Physical Exam: T 96.4, BP 102/69, P 132, RR 18, 96% RA Gen - Ill-appearing, cachectic, sleepy, breathing comfortably, jaundiced HEENT - MMM, no oral lesions.
rhythm, nl S1, S2, no S3/S4, no murmurs Lungs - Poor insp.
effort, decreased BS at L lung base, no crackles or wheezes appreciated.
Abd - Soft, tender to palp RUQ, LLQ, no guarding, no rebound tenderness.
Liver non-palpable, no fluid wave.
CT Scan Abd/Pelvis ([**7-29**]): ABDOMEN FINDNGS:  There is interval development of left basilar airspace opacity which is incompletely imaged.
Lack of intravenous contrast limits the evaluation of solid organs.
Again seen are the post-surgical changes with right hepatic lobe resection and post-Whipple changes.
There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
No extra-luminal air is identified.
Multiple small and borderline enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are seen, with the largest measuring approximately 9 mm in the portocaval region.
Evaluation of bowel loops is significantly limited due to inadequate contrast in the bowel and background mesenteric edema, which has increased compared to prior study.
There is diffuse mid to distal small bowel wall thickening to the level of terminal ileum, which could be related to liver dysfunction/hypoalbuminemia.
No definitive bowel obstruction or transition point is noted.
There is a stable left adnexal hyperdense lesion, which could represent a hemorrhagic cyst or dermoid.
A moderate amount of pelvic ascites is noted.
Body wall edema is seen, slightly increased from prior study.
Diffuse thickening of the mid to distal small bowel wall to the level of terminal ileum, which may be secondary to hypoalbuminemia.
However, other potential etiologies including infectious and metastatic disease should be considered.
Increased ascites, mesenteric edema which may be related to volume status and/or liver dysfunction.
RUQ ultrasound: FINDINGS:  This is a limited study for the evaluation of intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The left hepatic lobe is heterogeneous in echotexture with numerous focal areas of low echogenicity.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen.
Heterogeneous echotexture and focal areas of decreased echogenicity.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
4 mm biliary duct in the left hepatic lobe may represent the main left hepatic duct.
Since the most recent radiograph, nasogastric tube has been removed, and size of bilateral pleural effusions has worsened as has perihilar edema.
There are persistently low lung volumes, limiting assessment for pneumonia.
Retrocardiac density likely representing atelectasis and/or consolidation is not significantly changed.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax with stable appearance to right-sided central venous catheter.
Gaseous distention to loops interposed bowel is again noted.
Low lung volumes with interval worsening and bilateral pleural effusions with probable adjacent atelectasis, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Slight interval worsening to perihilar haziness, likely representing continued fluid overload concordant with clinical history provided.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo F with progressive cholangiocarcinoma s/p recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for c diff colitis, admitted for severe abdominal pain and vomiting  #)Abdominal pain / C.dif colitis - The patient developed severe C.Diff colitis requiring MICU stay for hypotension and septic picture.
At this time, the patient was very deconditioned, had anasarca, and her abdominal pain and distension continued to get worse.
Although she never became CMO status, the family decided to stop medical interventions except for antiobiotics.
The patient was started on a morphine and ativan drip to help with the pain and to provide the patient comfort, and she expired on [**2120-8-15**] at the hospital.
#)Hyperbilirubinemia - Pt has a history of hyperbilirubinemia, likely a result of progressive disease state.
The patient's hyperbilirubinemia worsened after her shock liver due to her sepsis, but then started to improve slowly.
Although, near the time of death, the hyperbilirubinemia began to worsen again likely due to progressive disease.
