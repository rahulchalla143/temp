Physical Exam: VS-   96.6 82  18  148/86  97%RA GEN- Pale, lethargic female lying in bed, appears comfortable in NAD HEENT- MMM, pale conjunctiva, PERRLA, EOMI, no sinus tenderness, OP with palatal petechiae, no active gingival bleeding, white film on tongue.
NECK- Supple, no bruits, no tender lymph nodes or lymphadenopathy CV- Regular rate and rhythm, no M/R/G, nl S1, S2 CHEST- Rales right mid lung field, otherwise clear.
No dullness to percussion.
Left sided Hickman in place with no erythema, and non-tender.
ABD- Soft, diffusely tender without guarding or rebound, mildly distended, positive bowel sounds.
EXT- no C/C, trace LE edema bilaterally, pale palms, delayed cap refill NEURO- AAOx3, CN intact except decreased sensation over V1 distribution on left side.
SKIN- Diffuse petechial lesions worse in lower extremities and coalesced on left toes.
MSK- Small left knee effusion noted.
Blood flow and dynamic blood images show no evidence of GI bleeding.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of GI bleeding.
Extensive lymphadenopathy within the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
Markedly abnormal small bowel, with proximal dilatation and distal bowel wall thickening (a long segment predominantly in the ilium).
No small-bowel obstruction as contrast is seen passing into the colon.
Furthermore, the differential of bowel wall thickening includes infection, inflammation, lymphomatous involvement, or ischemia.
High attenuation free fluid within the mesentery and pelvis, which could represent hemorrhage or proteinaceous fluid.
Focal area of high attenuation within the pelvic free fluid which could represent IV contrast extravasation, oral contrast extravasation, or focal hemorrhage.
Unchanged dilated small bowel loops, consistent with ileus.
Air and fluid are noted within the colon through the rectum, indicating no evidence of obstruction.
Interval increase in fluid around dilated small bowel loops and fluid within the pelvis.
Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions.
Extensive lymphadenopathy within the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
CONCLUSION: No pneumonia seen.
Diffuse erythema was seen on upper and lower scopes, indicating possible GVHD vs other cause of enterocolitis.
There was felt to be no urgent need for scope, and she was felt to be a poor surgical candidate.
Her diet was advanced, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, transfused FFP, platelets, and PRBC, and then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 3242**] for further monitoring.
GI BLEED- Likely lower GI source on admission given bright red blood.
She has no history of diverticulosis or other possible sources of bleed.
She showed no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic compromise.
The following day she was taken back to the endoscopy suite, where there was successful upper and lower scope, revealing diffuse erythema consistent with GVHD or other cause of enterocolitis.
COAGULOPATHY: Likely related to nutritional deficiency.
AML / BLASTS: Elevated WBC / blasts on admission, both of which improved.
Monitored uric acid and LDH, electrolytes.
THRUSH: Chronic problem.
