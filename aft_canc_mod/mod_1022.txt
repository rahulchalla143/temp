[**2135-7-14**] CXR: no obvious infiltrate, pulmonary edema.
[**2135-7-15**]: Colonoscopy: There was a very tight bend at the sigmoid colon which could represent previous anastomosis if patient has had prior surgery.
There were a few areas of a few red drops of blood seen in the ascending colon which were washed without underlying lesion seen.
However, this was minimal and does not account for transfusion requirement.
Polyp in the sigmoid colon Bile was seen in the terminal ileum and cecum without evidence of blood.
[**2135-7-15**]: EGD: Impression: Mild gastritis.
No retroperitoneal bleed.
These may be the sequelae of prior penetrating ulcer or focal dissection.
Dense calcification at the origin of the renal arteries and SMA; significant stenosis cannot be excluded.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis on this limited non-contrast exam.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis with septal hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # GIB - Patient having melanotic stools with hemodynamic instability requiring total of (6units, last transfusion on [**2135-7-15**]) of pRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**].
EGD was negative for acute bleed.
Colonoscopy was negative for acute bleed.
Hct remained stable since last transfusion on [**2135-7-15**]  # hypotension - Initially concerning for GIB given guaic positive stool, decreased HCT, and recent similar admission.
After the colonoscopy he did require levophed briefly, but then was able to maintain BPs without pressor-support.
# confusion - per family, confusion was typical of pt's hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension, and possible septic picture.
No evidence to suggest primary CNS infection (no meningismus, headache, kernig, brudzinki negative), no focal neurologic deficits on exam.
# hyperkalemia - likely [**3-14**] ARF.
no ECG changes c/w hyperkalemia.
# ARF - likely [**3-14**] volume depletion.
# CAD - s/p NSTEMI.
denies chest pain or dyspnea, and EKG without frank evidence of ischemia though has old LBBB, and worsening TWI and STD in V4-6 in setting of sinus tach and anemia (likely reflects both LVH and some demand ischemia).
feels ACS is unlikely, but given +troponin and recent NSTEMI, will proceed as follows: - held ASA and plaivx initially, then restarted when EGD revealed no active bleeding.
- held metoprolol, lisinopril given initial hypotension, then restarted when pt actually became hypertensive on the floor - transfuse to maintain HCT > 27.
- Echo done, result as above .
# CHF - EF 40% at OSH in [**6-18**], on lasix at home.
# hyperlipidemia - held statin initially, then restarted prior to discharge.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/g Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for yeast infection on buttocks.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: GI bleed Acute renal failure .
Secondary: Coronary artery disease Hypertension Chronic systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
Upper and lower endoscopy was done however we could not find the source of the bleeding because it had stopped bleeding by then.
Some changes were made to your medications: - Stopped hydralazine (blood pressure medication) - Stopped Prilosec and instead started Ranitidine - Changed Seroquel from 25 mg twice a day to 25 mg once at bedtime - Added Nystatin cream as needed for fungal infection of the buttocks .
CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis done during this hospitalization showed some changes that should be followed up with a repeat scan in 3 months ([**Month (only) 216**]-[**2135-10-11**]).
If you experience dizziness, palpitations, black tarry stools, red blood with stools, or any other symptoms concerning to you, please call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
