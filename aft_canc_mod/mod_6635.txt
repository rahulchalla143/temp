History of Present Illness: Briefly, this is a 69 year old male with hx COPD (on steroids) CAD s/p CABG, duodenal [**First Name3 (LF) **], admitted with recurrence of GI bleed.
he had reportedly received 21 units of blood at outside hospitalizations but after an endoscopy at an OSH he remained without further bleeding for 48 hours before his [**Hospital1 18**] admission.
During the [**Hospital1 18**] admission he had a nonbleeding duodenal [**Hospital1 **] clipped and another shallow, nonbleeding [**Hospital1 **] monitored; he required no blood transfusions.
He was sent to [**Hospital3 **] rehab, found to have continued bleeding with 1-2 loose black stools/day and was sent to [**Hospital6 **] (hospitalization was [**11-8**]/-[**11-17**]).
Initially, his primary issue was some respiratory distress for which he had an ultrasound guided right sided thoracentesis with removal of 600 cc of serious fluid.
This improved his dyspnea but he has continued to have issues with unstable blood volume and chronic blood loss.
He had an EGD on [**11-14**], which revealed a posterior dudodenal [**Month/Year (2) **] with visible vessel and active bleeding that was secured with clip, BiCap cautery, and epinephrine injection.
He also had diffuse erosive gastropathy noted.
On arrival to the floor he was found to have stable VS,denied any chest pain, worsened dyspnea from his baseline, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, constipation, syncope, presyncope, fevers, chills, night sweats or other acute issues.
He continues to have black tarry stools.

Physical Exam: VS: T 96.2, BP 138/96 Range 152/88, P 62 Range 58, RR 20, O2 Sat 98% on 1L Gen: Obese gentleman sitting up in chair in NAD HEENT: Normocephalic, anicteric, PERRL, OP benign, MMM Neck: No masses or lymphadenopathy, Right IJ CVL CV: Irregular, tachycardic, no M/R/G; there is no jugular venous distension appreciated Pulm: Expansion equal bilaterally, good air movement, diffuse end expiratory wheezes Abd: Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive BS, no organomegaly or masses.
J tube site c/d/i Extrem: Warm and well perfused, 2+ lower extremity edema to knees Neuro: A and O*3 with appropriate mental status to gross exam, moving all extremities.
Mild tearing eyes Bilaterally.
Hyperkeratotic lesions scattered over dorsal surface hands bilaterally s/p  topical therapy.
There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.
There is joint space narrowing and there are large dorsal osteophytes at the fifth carpal/metacarpal joint.
Streaky density at the lung bases and bilateral pleural thickening and/or fluid are again demonstrated.
There is a calcified pleural plaque at the right base as before.
The patient presented with recurrence of his GI bleed.
Most recent EGD revealed discrete duodenal ulcers with visible vessel and persistent bleeding as well as oozing gastritis.
The patient continued however to have melanotic stools and required additional blood transfusions although his vital signs were stable and he was asymptomatic throughout.
A repeat endoscopy on [**2131-11-23**]  showed active bleeding with blood clots at the previously clipped single bleeding [**Date Range **] in the pylorus channel.
His prednisone which he was taking for his pulmonary disease were tapered back to his baseline 10mg daily.
The surgery went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the SICU intubated secondary to his lung disease, NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and on propofol/fentanyl for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received roxicet with good effect and adequate pain control.
He presented with diffuse edema and anasarca.
He received diuretics with all blood transfusions preoperatively.
No signs/symptoms of active ischemia.
Presistently elevated troponin (0.04) presumably due to renal failure.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Neurology was consulted and felt that there was no neurologic pattern to his deficit.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet and tube feeds, ambulating, voiding with assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Congestive Heart Failure 3.
