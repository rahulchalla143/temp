The patient has noticed double vision over the last two days as well as unsteadiness with falling to the right.
Past Medical History: R breast ca s/p mastectomy '[**45**], [**Last Name (un) **] (s/p mastectomy in [**2155**]), uterine sarcoma with mets to abdomen and probably lung s/p TAH, XRT, and currently treated with chemotherapy, hx cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis   Social History: widowed, former ppd x 34 years quit four years ago.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T 97.7; BP 147/93; P 81; RR 16;  General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no m/r/g Carotids: no blood flow murmur Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.
Fluent speech with no paraphasic errors.
No pronator drift.
There is a slight right sided pronator drift noted.
Minimal atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications are noted.
There is centrilobular emphysema, with numerous bilateral metastatic lesions scattered throughout the lungs.
There is a mass in the right upper lobe which measures 7.1 cm x 5.9 cm (3:18), that is heterogeneous in appearance, with areas of necrosis.
The largest lesion in the right lower lobe is a bilobed mass or two adjacent masses, which measure approximately 5.4 cm x 4.0 cm.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver is diffusely low in attenuation, consistent with fatty infiltration.
There are scattered rounded hypodensities in the right lobe, with an exophytic lesion arising from the inferior right lobe (3:68), measuring 2.2 cm, suspicious for a metastatic lesion.
There is a heterogeneous lobulated large mass arising from the right adrenal gland which measures 8.4 cm craniocaudad x 5.0 cm transverse.
Additional heterogeneous masses are seen within the periportal region, with a mass measuring approximately 3.0 cm x 2.8 cm (3:62).
There are scattered nodules throughout the peritoneum, with one adjacent to the transverse colon (3:56) measuring 9 mm, as well as irregular mass posterior to the right psoas muscle (3:70) measuring 3.0 cm x 1.9 cm.
No free air or free fluid is identified.
There is an irregular hypodense lesion in the expected location of the right adnexa (3:96), which measures 2.7 cm x 2.6 cm.
No pelvic free fluid or adenopathy is identified.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are diffuse osseous metastases, with scattered sclerotic foci seen within the pelvis as well as scattered throughout the vertebral column (predominantly thoracic).
Sclerotic foci are also present within bilateral ribs, compatible with metastatic lesions.
Widespread metastatic disease, including innumerable bilateral pulmonary masses, as well as probable hepatic lesion, right adrenal mass, and nodules/masses scattered throughout the peritoneum and mesentery.
Diffuse sclerotic osseous metastasis with wedge compressions of T7 and T8 of uncertain chronicity.
FINDINGS: There is a tract in the right frontal lobe relating to recent 3rd ventriculostomy.
Multiple enhancing supra- and infratentorial lesions are stable including a large lesion in the right cerebellum with significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Some of the lesions appear to be leptomeningeal, particularly in the left frontal lobe.
There is no evidence for acute ischemia.
There is suggestion of multiple calvarial enhancing lesions which could represent metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION: Changes from right frontal craniotomy reportedly for a third ventriculostomy.
Unchanged intracranial metastatic disease including the largest lesion in the right cerebellum with significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 66F who presented with diplopia and vertigo, with PMH of known significant metastatic disease.
Head CT was done with revealed intracranial pathology.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-8**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
