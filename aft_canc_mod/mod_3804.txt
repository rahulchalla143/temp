His initial illness began in [**2130**], where he had a dark line across his right great toenail which widened.
In [**2134-1-19**], he had an extensive work-up.
A full body CT showed bilateral small pulmonary nodules, and the spleen limber for which MRI of the body was recommended, and prominent left pelvic and periaortic lymph nodes were not determined to be pathologic at that time.
MRI of the whole spine showed diffuse metastatic disease without spinal cord involvement.
A bone marrow biopsy on [**2-8**] was positive for extensive melanoma involvement.
A head CT showed a left frontal metastasis.
However, he on [**2134-3-2**] developed sudden right-sided weakness and underwent an emergent craniotomy.
He was in no acute distress, but uncomfortable.
He remained in the postanesthesia recovery unit overnight on the evening of [**2134-3-3**] for pain control and to check his neurologic signs.
A postoperative MRI showed postoperative changes in the posterior left frontal lobe with no increased mass effect as compared to his preop study.
There was linear enhancement along the anterior aspect of the operative site, and a small amount of residual tumor could not be excluded.
There was an area of T1 hyperintensity and susceptibility effect in the operative site which might be related to a small amount of blood products following the surgery.
He remained in the ICU until [**2134-3-5**] for blood pressure control monitoring and due to his dense right hemiparesis and fever to the 102 range.
Initially, the urine looked like it was positive for a UTI, but the cultures were negative.
He did have a chest x-ray that was questionable for pneumonia and was started on Levaquin for that.
He continued to have high fevers through the [**2134-3-12**].
At that time, we had recommended a meningitis work-up, and Mr. [**Known lastname 54910**] refused to have an LP done.
On [**3-10**], he had complained of excruciating back pain which was not relieved with Dilaudid, percent and his MS Contin.
A pain service consultation was obtained, which they recommended placing him on a PCA overnight to get his pain under control, and then he was started on morphine sulfate IR 15-30 mg q.3-4h.
8h., Tylenol 500 mg q.4h., and within 2 days his pain was much better under control.
His staples have been removed, and his incision is dry and intact without signs of infection.
