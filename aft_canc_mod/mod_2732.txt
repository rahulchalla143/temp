History of Present Illness: The patient was and 84 year old male with a history of HTN and DMII who was in his usual state of health until threee days prior to admission when he developed a mild, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea and a fever to 100F.
On the night of admission, he awoke with sudden onset of shortness of breath.
On arrival to the ED, th OS was in the 80's on room air: hypertension, tachypnea and tachycardia were noted.
On review of systems, he denied chest pain, joint/muscle aches, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, prior PND (before the episode as above), swelling or orthopna.
There was no recent plane rides or orther prolonged stationary period, trauma, or history of surgery.
He was hypertensive, tachypnic and tachycardic (SVT).
Physical Exam: temp 100.6, BP 157/79, HR 107-102, RR 26-28, O2 89% on 2L --> 97% on 100% NRB Gen: resting comfortably in  minimal resp distress HEENT: nonicteric sclera, MM slightly dry Neck: +JVD to 7cm Chest: crackles at bases bilaterally CV: tachy, reg rhythm, no murmurs Abd: +BS, soft, NTND Ext: no edema Neuro: grossly intact  Pertinent Results: [**2199-3-2**] 03:00AM   WBC-12.4* RBC-4.31* HGB-11.8* HCT-34.0* MCV-79* MCH-27.4 MCHC-34.7 RDW-14.2 [**2199-3-2**] 03:00AM   NEUTS-86.9* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-9.4* MONOS-2.0 EOS-1.6 BASOS-0.2 [**2199-3-2**] 03:00AM   PLT COUNT-317 .
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with increasing respiratory distress and was intubated.
A definite pathogen was not identified, but atypical (possibly malignant vs premalignant) cells were seen in BAL along with chest imaging revealing upper lung-zone infiltrates.
He suffered several episdoes of new-onset AF/RVR in the setting of his acute illness - a BB was added and titrated.
The patient's post-ICU course was complicated by resolving confusion as well as an incidental upper GI bleed (proven to be from PUD).
On admission, he leukocytosis, increased lactate, and fever with multifocal PNA vs ARDS on CXR.
His Chest CT showed dense apical infiltrates of unclear etiology, but he did well on CAP Rx (Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin).
There was likely underlying lung disease of unclear etiology contributing to his clinical picture.
His BAL was without organisms , but showed atypical cells (see below).
He was scheduled for Pulmonary follow-up.
UGIB: Late in his course, the patient had asymptomatic melena.
He had a positive NG lavage (red-brown, coffee grounds) and a subsequent EGD showing a duodenal clotted/bleeding ulcer and received cautery and local epineprhine INJ.
Atypical Lung Cells: Upon BAL, abnormal cells were visualized which were deemed likely mucinous metaplasia, but the low possibility of mucinous adenocarcinoma existed.
PAF: He had new onset PAF/RVR over this hospital course, which was possibly related to the acute stress of infectiona and resp distress.
This initially manifested in the MICU, but he then had brief bursts (3-5 seconds) of SVT vs PAF and sinus tachycardia on the floor.
Enlarged Thyroid: An incidental heterogeneous thyroid with coarse calcifications and associated adenopathy was seen on CT, concerning for malignancy.
An U/S showed a large dominant nodule within the right lobe of the thyroid gland (5.4 cm) and a heterogeneous appearance of the left lobe of the gland.
He was slotted to have outpatient endocrine follow-up and a biopsy for a malignancy evaluation.
2) Duodenal Peptic Ulcerative Disease and Hemorrhage.
4) Diabetes Mellitus Type II.
2) If your breathing becomes difficult, or you become short of breath, have fevers, chills, sweats or any other concerning symptoms please contact your doctor or return to the emergency room.
