Admission Date:  [**2185-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-1-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents / Pletal  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right heart catheterization   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 730**] [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2158**] (LIMA->LAD,SVG->OM1,SVG->D1,SVG->PDA) prior DESx2->SVG to OM1, known occlusion of SVG->RCA, recent DES to SVG->D1 at OSH and [**2185-4-20**] with repeat DES to D1, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2, who was recently admitted with complaint of new chest pain [**4-19**] that felt like normal angina but more intense.
One day prior to admission the pt had 3 episodes of SS CP with radiation to left arm, first two were relieved with SL nitro, final episode was more intense so the pt went to the ED.
After the procedure she had two episodes of chest pain that resolved with nitroglycerin.
That evening the patient developed her typical sscp.
Took another nitro with temporary relief but when pain returned she presented to the ED.
ECG showed inferolateral ST depressions that resolved with resolution of patient's chest pain.
In the ED, patient developed respiratory distress in setting of hypertension thought to be pulmonary edema.
She was given Lasix IV and then started on a heparin gtt, nitroglycerin gtt for treatment of pulmonary edema.
Patient was started on CPAP for respiratory support.
On arrival to the ICU patient c/o 5/10 chest pain.

Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Femoral Vascular U/S [**4-21**] -No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.
Chest X-ray ([**2185-4-22**]) - Increased interstitial opacities and tiny pleural effusions consistent with mild volume overload, stable cardiomegaly.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal and mid-inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-3-8**], inferior hypokinesis was present on both studies, but is more pronounced now.
Severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PASP of 45/16 mmHg.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
CT Chest ([**2185-4-28**])- Most recent chest CT showed moderate-to-severe emphysema, extensive right pleural calcification, probably restrictive, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with particular left atrial enlargement possible chordopapillary calcification and probable pulmonary hypertension.
Today's examination shows new small bilateral, nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions layering posteriorly and new heterogeneous opacification predominantly in the lung that is dependent with the patient supine, particularly pronounced in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
The transverse diameter of the left atrium at the level of the left circumflex coronary artery has increased from 44 to 54 mm, probably a real indication of progressive left atrial enlargement suggesting that all of the findings could be due to cardiac decompensation, although right upper lobe pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage should also be considered.
The diameter of the dilated intrapericardial right pulmonary artery, 29 mm, is unchanged.
Wide spread atherosclerotic calcification is present in the head and neck vessels, nondilated thoracic aorta, and native coronary arteries.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffuse enlargement of the left adrenal gland is unchanged, probably hypertrophy.
New mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions associated with increased left atrial size and chronic pulmonary hypertension consistent with mitral valvular pathology and acute cardiac decompensation.
Right upper lobe consolidation could be either pneumonia, hemorrhage, or pronounced edema due to moderate emphysema and/or mitral regurgitation.
Severe generalized atherosclerosis including native coronaries.
Probable pulmonary hypertension.
Calcific right pleural thickening.
Discharge labs: Na 130, K 4.9 Cl 92 Bicarb 29 BUN 42 Creat 1.2 Hct 29, WBC 12.4 Plt 360   Brief Hospital Course: 83F with CAD s/p CABG with extensive native vessel diffuse s/p taxus stent to SVG-diag on [**4-20**], HTN, COPD, DM, presenting with unstable angina and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and profound new hypoxia.
# NSTEMI: Patient with crescendo chest pain prompting admission and had NSTEMI with peak CK 428, MB 44 and TropnT 0.38.
Chest pain was controlled on nitro drip and she had no further episodes of chets pain during admission.
Suspect demand ischemia in setting of hypertension/pulmonary edema.
It was decided not to proceed to cardiac catheterization given the recent cardiac cath showing no intervenable lesions and patient was started on ranexa for management of chronic angina.
Acute On chronic diastolic congestive Heart Failure: originally thought to be the cause of hypoxia.
Pt's regimen changed to Torsemide 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] for management of fluid retention.
Pt is compliant with a low Na diet and should have a 1500c fluid restriction.
# Dyspnea - Patient was severely dyspneic on admission requiring admission to the CCU with BiPAP.
She intially diuresed with improvement in oxygenation, however after extensive diuresis, patient still had significant oxygen requirement.
A Chest CT was performed that showed small bilat pulmonary effusions, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and right upper lobe consolidation could be either pneumonia, hemorrhage, or edema.
Pt had no symptoms of infection or pneumonia and was deemed to be hypovolemic after aggressive diuresis.
Therefore, it is thought that hypoxia and DOE is due to pulmonary hemorrhage possibly [**1-24**] Plavix and ASA usage post stent.
# Hemoptysis - Patient has several epsiodes of very small volume hemoptysis while in the hospital.
Had episode of Atrial Fibrillation in [**2-27**], outpatient cardiologist made decision not to anticoagulate per most recent discharge summary.
#Leukocytosis: Patient had a leukocytosis on admission with no clinical history to suggest infectious source, Urinalysis was negative, chest X-ray showed asymmetrical opacifications but not clear pneumonia.
She remained afebrile and white count trended down during admission without antibiotics.
# Decreased esophageal motility: Swallow evaluation initiated to assess whether silent aspiration contributing to hypoxia.
Video swallow shows no aspiration but [**Month (only) **] motility noted.
Albuterol  90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol  Sig:  1-2 Puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for wheeze.
Temazepam  15 mg Capsule  Sig:  One (1) Capsule PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Street Address(1) 19427**] Nursing & Rehab Center - [**Location (un) 3307**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease Pulmonary Hemorrhage causing hypoxia Diabetes Mellitus type [**Street Address(2) 106225**] Elevation Myocardial Infarction   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You had chest pain and a small heart attack.
We started a new medicine, Ranexa, to help decrease the chest pain.
You also had some difficulty breathing while in the hospital.
This was intially thought to be related to volume overload from heart failure and you were diuresed with lasix however symptoms did not improve and the lung doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**].
They felt you had some blood collecting in your lung and that it would resolve gradually.
Ranexa: to prevent chest pain 2.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have further chest pain, trouble breathing, increasing swelling in your legs, light headedness, coughing up blood, or any other unusual symptoms.
