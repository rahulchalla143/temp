On colonoscopy in [**2131-3-15**] she was found to have a cecal polyp.
By ultrasound guidance, these lesions were biopsied and the results were consistent with a hepatic abscess.
She complained of some crampy abdominal pain.
However, she was not having any nausea or vomiting at that time.
The patient was admitted for further workup of these liver lesions and management of them.
Ulcerative colitis.
Anxiety disorder.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
The abdomen was soft and nondistended.
Slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
There was no evidence of any hematoma at the biopsy site.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] was a 75-year-old woman status post orthotopic liver transplant in [**2130-11-15**] with a new diagnosis of colon cancer and probable hepatic abscess by ultrasound biopsy.
The patient underwent a hepatic angiogram on [**2131-5-1**] which showed a focal near occlusion of the hepatic proper artery, a complete occlusion of the hepatic artery at the same level after attempted crossing with a guide wire.
She was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively where she was a little hypotensive and mildly septic.
The patient had a repeat computerized axial tomography to evaluate a liver abscess which showed a mild increase in the size of the known lesion within the liver.
A repeat ultrasound showed normal blood flow to the liver, so it was decided to take the patient to the operating room for a right hemicolectomy for management of her cecal cancer.
Her antibiotic regimen at that point was vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for her history of Enterobacter cultured from her initial biopsy upon admission.
A repeat computerized axial tomography of the abdomen postoperatively showed a new area of irregular hypodensity within the liver.
This was thought to be consistent with more of an ischemic change.
The patient was experiencing a short period of abdominal distention; however, this resolved, and the patient was eventually able to tolerate a regular diet.
The pathology of the colon cancer indicated a mucinous and signet-ring cell carcinoma, high-grade, poorly differentiated to under differentiated with invasion to the muscularis propria and to the subserosa, and [**5-26**] positive lymph nodes.
There was no venous invasion.
There was perineural invasion present.
Given her new diagnosis of end-stage III-C T3 N2 M0 by TNM staging, Oncology recommended adjuvant chemotherapy of the cecal carcinoma with a chemotherapy combination of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.
Ulcerative colitis.
Hepatic abscess.
