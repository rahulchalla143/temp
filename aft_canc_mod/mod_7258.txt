Admission Date:  [**2195-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-3-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-7-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: weight loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 84 yo M with CLL initially admitted on [**2195-2-9**] to rule out infection in the setting of fatigue, weight loss, and poor appetite.
He developed fever to 101 on [**2-15**], along with diarrhea.
Earlier this evening, at around 5 p.m. on [**2-16**], the patient developed hypotension to SBP 80s in the setting of fever to 100.7.
It is unclear if he was symptomatic from his hypotension.
He was treated with 3.7 L of NS, but then developed tachypnea and wheezing.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient complained of shortness of breath, but he stated that this was started to improve.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small, echolucent, circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of hemodynamic impairment.

Pt intubated for airway protection given one episode of coffee ground emesis, had an episode of wide complex tachycardia peri-intubation and loaded with amiodarone.
His course in ICU complicated by sinus bradycardia, thought to be related to amiodarone loading and hypothermia, now improved to 50-60s.
Since being on the floor, active issues have included gross volume overload, ascites, and LLL collapse.
# Dyspnea: While in the unit, dyspnea thought to be possibly multifactorial of pneumonia versus exacerbation of asthma/ component of COPD.
50 mg IV Q6H for asthma or allergic reaction to cefepime or adrenal insufficiency.
While on the floor, the patient had repeat CT chest which showed evidence of LLL collapse.
Subsequent CXRs showed some mild improvement, however, upon discharge the patient still had b/l atelectasis with LLL, as well as small L pleural effusion-->clincally, however, he was doing well, satting well on room air.
# Febrile neutropenia: While in the unit, the patient had fevers to 100.7 [**2-16**] at 1700.
Patient with diarrhea for past day.
Patient defervesced and actually became hypothermic for a little while after he was extubated, but as patient recovered, his temperature normalized.
# hypotension [**1-29**] CMV adrenalitis: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was found to be hypotensive and he was maintained on pressors to keep MAP >60.
Considered stopping fludrocortisone given hypernatremia and low-ish K and concern for hyperaldosteronism, but as there was concern for adrenal insufficiency and did not want to completely withdraw mineralocorticoid action, was not stopped.
On transfer to the BMT floor, the patient's sodium was trended, and hypernatremia had resolved, as he started taking better POs.
CT scans of head were done which just showed age related volume loss but no acute abnormalities.
Likely related to prolonged hospitalization and critical illness.
# Hct drop/Anemia: While in the intensive care unit, the patient with Hct drop to 17.7 on [**2-22**].
Pt received 4 u pRBCs, 2u plasma, 1u FFP and underwent EGD which had no e/o bleeding site.
No e/o melena and stools guaiac negative.
No clear evidence of active bleeding and hemolysis, coombs test was negative.
Pt w/ coagulopathy w/ abnormal PTT and INR.
Potential coagulopathy [**1-29**] poor nutrition vs. hepatic dysfunction (potentially from malignant spread).
Patient had a second drop in Hct overnight from 2/28-2/29 dropping from 32 to 25.
Given history of heme malignancy and potential for immune dysregulation with dytsfunctional bone marrow, these drops in Hct may be a hemolytic process.
# Bradycardia: Patient has had temperature to <96F with bradycardia to the 40??????s.
ECG shows sinus bradycardia and no ischemic changes.
Less likely an acute head bleed as negative CT on [**2-24**], but given patient is hypertensive, bradycardic with AMS and thrombocytopenia, may consider new SDH.
# Episodes of Vtach (8 beat runs) on telemetry, one episode of sustained Vtach / SVT: Sustained likely SVT occurring shortly after intubation (rate in 190s).
He was loaded on amiodarone at that time but no long-term antiarrhythmic has been started as patient?????
While on the BMT floor, the patient was initially on telemetry; the patient did not have any repeat episodes of SVT or Vtach while on the floor.
# Diarrhea/Abdominal Distention: The patient admitted to ICU with profuse diarrhea, C diff and norovirus negative, and diarrhea subsided on its own.
KUB showed no clear signs of perforation and lactate would be expected to be higher in that setting.
Considering diarrhea resolved and distention in abdomen and tinkling bowel sounds, may have obstruction or partial obstruction, however these were not seen on CT. C.diff PCR negative, but CMV viral load~700copies/mL, suggesting possible CMV colitis.
While on the BMT service, the patient's abdominal distension continued, and he was found to have moderate ascites.
Hepatology was consulted and it was thought that ascites could be in setting of gross volume overload.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Cr 1.5, improving.
Acute component likely caused by hypoperfusion in the setting of possible septic physiology, but could also be related to medications.
No evidence for full adrenal insufficiency given normal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim, and aldosterone levels are difficult to assess in this setting.
# Purported history Type IV RTA and question respiratory alkalosis on ABG: While in the intensive care unit, patient with HCO3 of 17, although per renal, unlikely RTA.
Unclear etiology of respiratory alkalosis.
# elevated ALT: Towards the end of the hospitalization, the patient's ALT began to trend up; unknown etiology.
# ascites:  The patient as found to have new ascites during this admission.
Hepatology thought that this could be in the setting of gross total body volume overload.
The patient also has hepatitis serologies and Hep B and C viral loads that are still pending.
# CMV viremia with adrenalitis:  The patient will need weekly CMV viral loads checked.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having increase fatigue at home.
You also briefly spent some time in the intensive care unit because of low blood pressures.
