The pain started the afternoon of [**10-14**] afternoon he laid down.
He had similar abdominal pain approximately 4 days prior, and at that time, he had a CT scan without IV contrast that demonstrated a non-leaking 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He reports he was discharged 2 days ago from the VA with a negative work-up for his abdominal pain.
He had been pain free the day prior to admission but he also had nothing to eat until this afternoon.
No nausea or vomiting.
Blacked out at home and went to Caritas HC where a CT without contrast showed leaking aneurysm and creatinine up to 5.8 from baseline 1.8.

An urgent CAT scan with IV contrast performed at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated a contained, leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Due to prohibitive surgical risk, the pt underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair with bilateral groin cutdowns on emergent basis on [**2166-10-14**].
ARF on CRF felt [**2-8**] to hypotension and poor perfusion.
On [**2166-10-16**], surgeon [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was consulted for concern for ischemic bowel as the patient had an episode of watery diarrhea.
A flex sig was performed at the bedside which revealed no evidence of either mucosal slough or transmural ischemia.
No further episodes of diarrhea occured following the sigmoidoscopy.
On [**10-19**],he was kept NPO, an NGT was placed for vomiting and a KUB was done to eval for free air.
Status post aortobifemoral graft with no interval change in the size of extensive right retroperitoneal hematoma.
On [**10-22**], hepatobiliary surgery was reconsulted for concerns for obstruction as he had abdominal pain and distention since [**2166-10-16**] without BM.
After review of the MRI and CT scans from the VA, the pancreatic mass was felt to likely be either a primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma or potential renal cell carcinoma metastasis.
Because the mass was obstructing the distal common bile duct, the patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.
Brushings obtained during the ERCP were negative for malignancy, and biopsy obtained during a subsequent EUS of the mass was an insufficient sample and thus a proper diagnosis could not be made.
On [**10-23**],  He was started on vanco, zosyn and flagyl for possible small perforation.
Of note, patient's other current major issue is progressive renal dysfunction.
On [**11-18**], the patient was noted by nephrology to have altered mental status concerning for uremia, and so he received a tunnelled hemodialysis cathether.
On [**11-19**] he was started on hemodialysis but became hypotensive to 40s and so dialysis was stopped early.
On [**11-20**] AMS, hypoxic, transferred to SICU, intubated, became tachy/brady then asystolic, pulse returned w/ CPR found to have massive MI by echo put on pressors and taken to cath lab.
Pt was warm, with no heart sounds or breath sounds.
