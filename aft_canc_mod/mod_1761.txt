Admission Date:  [**2179-1-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-1-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2104-10-30**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with right upper lobe lung cancer (on carboplatin and Taxol) who was admitted the week prior with neutropenic pneumonia and was discharged on levofloxacin from an outside hospital.
Three days after this, she felt weak and was found on the floor by her [**Hospital6 407**] with a temperature of 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and she was sent to [**Hospital3 15174**].
She complained of shortness of breath and odynophagia.
She denied fall, loss of consciousness, chest pain, back pain, or shoulder pain.
The shortness of breath resolved the day prior to admission.
Her throat pain also resolved on the morning of admission spontaneously.
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a creatine kinase of 309 and a troponin I of 3.97.
There was a question if the patient was volume overloaded at the outside hospital.
She also denied hemoptysis; however, there was a verbal report of hemoptysis from the outside hospital.
Right upper lobe lung cancer (on carboplatin and Taxol).
Recent neutropenia.
Thrombocytopenia (with a baseline platelet count of 40,000 to 60,000).
History of breast cancer in [**2171**]; status post left mastectomy and chemotherapy.
Degenerative joint disease.
Coronary artery disease; with episodes of chest pain up to six years ago (details unknown).
General physical examination revealed the patient was in no acute distress.
Lung examination revealed diffuse expiratory wheezes with minimal crackles at the right base.
There were 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads V1 through V3.
There were deep T wave inversions in leads V1 through V3.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The decision was made to not emergently catheterize the patient given that she had been symptom free for over 24 hours.
Enzymes were cycled, and the patient ruled in for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient did go to the Catheterization Laboratory the following day which revealed 2-vessel coronary artery disease; in the left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery.
The patient was also noted to have severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
An echocardiogram at the outside hospital noted an ejection fraction of 35%; however, the patient had no overt signs of heart failure during this hospital admission.
This revealed a consolidation within the right hilar region causing obstruction of the bronchus of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe where there was distal increase interstitial and alveolar opacity consistent with postobstructive pneumonitis and/or lymphangitic spread.
It was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
There was no evidence of bronchovascular communication.
It was most likely that the hemoptysis was due to her non-small-cell lung cancer as well as her pneumonia.
