She was noted to have bilateral crackles on exam.
CXR was consistent with volume overload, left pleural effusion +/- consolidation.
She was then noted to be hypotensive with BP 69/12.
She does report decreased UOP with decreased PO intake and diarrhea recently.
Anemia, due to renal failure, anemia of chronic disease, and myelodysplastic syndrome; previously on epo weekly and requiring  regular transfusions, multiple positive anti-RBC antibodies.

SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Slightly increased right pleural effusion which is now moderate, and unchanged small left pleural effusion.
Minimal residual opacity in the posterior left upper lobe from previously seen consolidation.
Thickening of the mid to distal esophagus with fatty infiltration in the distal esophageal wall, suggesting esophagitis, which may relate to the patient's moderate-sized axial hiatal hernia.
[**2194-3-19**]  	Radiology	CHEST (PA & LAT) IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old female with a history of PE, MDS, CKD, anemia, CAD who presents with hypoxia and hypotension.
# Hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure:  Patient presented with acute on chronic hypoxia, as she has an oxygen requirement at home of 2.5L.
A CXR on admission demonstrated pneumonia and a chest CT confirmed the presence of an infiltrate and also demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Patient's hypoxia was thought to be secondary to pneumonia, pleural effusions, and diastolic heart failure, and her hypercapnia was thought to be secondary to muscular weakness and possibly obstructive sleep apnea (does not carry this diagnosis).
Given the severity of right-sided heart failure/diastolic heart failure, and expected recurrent exacerbations the CHF service was consulted and recommend continued diuresis with lasix qod/prn, with dosing until blood pressure decreases or Cr increases.
# Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive at presentation with a SBP in the 80s and was thought to be relatively volume deplete in the setting of diarrhea and poor po intake.
# Altered mental status:  There was some concern initially that patient's mental status was altered and a head CT was negative for an acute process.
# DVT and PE: Patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on lovenox at home, with LMW heparin levels checked regularly (last checked on [**2194-3-4**], LMW hep = 1.04).
# CRI:  Patient's creatinine was at it's baseline (1.8-2.3) and medications were renally dosed.
#Hemorrhagic bullous s/p rupture: Wound healing nicely and large blood clot was debrided by plastic surgery.
Healthy tissue was seen underneath the clot.
# Code: DNR/DNI- confirmed with daughter  #Social: Multiple discussion were had with the patient and her daughter throughout this hospitalization regarding goals of care and prognosis.
Given the severity  of her right heart failure and delicate fluid balance (preload dependence/diastolic CHF), and hence likely course of continued CHF exacerbations and frequent hospitalizations, the patient was seen by the palliative care service to introduce the services offered by additional programs/home hospice, The family was not interested in hospice services at this time,but will continue with a visiting nurse and other services as needed.
Home Oxygen Diagnosis: congestive heart failure Please start nasal cannula 2 L/min to keep sats >94%   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 1952**], [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1)Acute on chronic diastolic and right-sided heart failure 2)Hypercarbia 3)Pneumonia 4)Chronic Kidney Disease   Discharge Condition: Stable; on 2L NC; Weight 126lbs in the hospital   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with low oxygen levels and hypercarbia (high carbon dioxide).
This was likely due to congestive heart failure, possible pneumonia, and weakness.
You were given lasix to try and get rid of some of the fluid in your lungs and the swelling of your arms and legs.
Call your primary physician with concerns or questions, and return to the emergency department if you have fever greater than 101, low oxygen, shortness of breath, bleeding, increased pain, or other alarming symptoms.
