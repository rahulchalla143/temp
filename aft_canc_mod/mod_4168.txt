No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LCx had a 99% hazy stenosis just prior to the second obtuse marginal branch.
The RCA had mild disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 22 mm Hg and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with a PASP of 41 mm Hg.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LCx with a 2.5 x 18mm Promus drug eluting stent which was postdilated to 3.0mm.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Final  angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
