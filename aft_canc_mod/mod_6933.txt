Microscopic dissection.
Left sided EVD preoperative placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 106268**] is a 62 y/o female with DM who reports that for the past 2-3 weeks she's had intermittent nausea/vomiting.
She [**Doctor First Name 1638**] any abdominal pain with the vomiting and does not vomit blood.
She also developed dizziness and loss of balance over the past few days.
She fell at home today and was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ER where head CT reveals right frontal circular lesion along with right temporal lesion.
Contrast was not given with this scan, but mass effect and midline shift is noted with effacement of frontal horns.
Past Medical History: VAGINITIS [**2167**] BRONCHITIS/ASTHMA [**2168**] FIBROIDS [**2167**] ANEMIA [**2169**] HYPERTENSION [**2168**] GASTROINTESTINAL [**2-/2178**] URINARY TRACT INFECTION [**2-/2178**] ADULT ONSET DIABETES MELLITUS [**2183**] BREAST CANCER [**2185**] ER positive, HER-2/neu negative s/p wide excision and axillary dissection in [**2185-3-24**].
Pathology revealed a 4.5 cm grade III infiltrating ductal carcinoma with no extensive intraductal component and no lymphatic vascular invasion; however, 12 of the 27 lymph nodes were positive with the largest being 1.2 cm.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Right pronator drift present.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin   Pertinent Results: [**2186-5-1**] 11:40PM   WBC-9.3 RBC-5.01 HGB-13.8 HCT-38.8 MCV-78* MCH-27.6 MCHC-35.6* RDW-14.8 [**2186-5-1**] 11:40PM   NEUTS-92.6* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-5.2* MONOS-1.6* EOS-0.3 BASOS-0.3 [**2186-5-1**] 11:40PM   HYPOCHROM-NORMAL ANISOCYT-NORMAL POIKILOCY-NORMAL MACROCYT-NORMAL MICROCYT-NORMAL POLYCHROM-NORMAL [**2186-5-1**] 11:40PM   PLT SMR-HIGH PLT COUNT-489* [**2186-5-1**] 06:47PM   K+-3.9 [**2186-5-1**] 06:45PM   GLUCOSE-213* UREA N-12 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-135 POTASSIUM-5.7* CHLORIDE-94* TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-21* [**2186-5-1**] 06:45PM   estGFR-Using this [**2186-5-1**] 06:45PM   CALCIUM-10.7* PHOSPHATE-4.8* MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2186-5-1**] 06:45PM   PT-13.2 PTT-24.9 INR(PT)-1.1  MRI [**5-1**]: Multiple large enhancing masses within the brain with surrounding vasogenic edema most consistent with metastatic disease.
The largest of these lesions is within the right frontal lobe measuring 28 x 31 mm which causes 11 mm of leftward midline shift and subfalcine herniation.
A smaller lesion in the right cerebellar peduncle partially obliterates the fourth ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or uncal herniation at this time.
Peripheral enhancement in the resection cavity is concerning for residual tumor.
11 mm of leftward midline shift remains.
Postoperative changes about the right frontal craniotomy site.
Mild pneumocephalus and small amount of intraventricular air is consistent with the patient's operative history.
Enhancing lesions in the right temporal lobe and right mid brain consistent with metastatic disease.
Small amount of hemorrhage along the resection tract better seen on the CT scan performed earlier the same day.
Left breast seroma versus lymphocele.
Left breast skin thickening and fibrotic changes in the left upper lobe which are consistent with post- radiation change.
5-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule, stable since [**2182**].
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
There is extensive necrosis and cytologic atypia, presumably related to the radiation treatment.
Brain, right, tumor (B-D): Metastatic carcinoma, histologically similar to the breast primary ductal carcinoma (S07-[**Numeric Identifier 106270**]).
There is extensive necrosis and cytologic atypia, presumably related to the radiation treatment.
The immunoperoxidase stains show the tumor is positive for estrogen receptors and mammoglobin, and negative for progesterone receptor and GCDFP.
This pattern is consistent with breast primary carcinoma, and is the same result as in the report S07-5242M for the primary tumor.
Imaging was done which showed large enhancing masses within the brain with surrounding vasogenic edema most consistent with metastatic disease.
On [**5-3**] she was taken to the OR for craniotomy, removal of intracranial/ intraventricular tumor and left sided EVD preoperative placement.
An MRI was repeated which did not show evidence of stroke.
Her exam was remarkable for significant fluctuations in mental status, therefore she was rescanned on [**5-6**].
This time, she was noted to have worsening mass effect and smaller ventricles, the EVD was therefore changed from 10 to 15cm.
Given her waxing mental status, she was evaluated by speech therapy for concern for aspiration.
Lastly, prior to discharge she had her XRT planning session.
