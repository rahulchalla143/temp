The patient recalled going for a walk in the afternoon and then no memory of events until he was brought to the Emergency Room on [**2113-8-19**].
EMS was called and they found the patient alert with stable vital signs, unremarkable exam and no complaints.
A head CT with and without contrast, however, revealed a large left frontal parietal mass presumed to be metastases given his history of small cell lung cancer.
He initially presented with the right lower lobe lung nodule in [**2112-7-26**] and a cough with weight loss.
In addition, he had postobstructive pneumonia.
A bronchoscopic biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer.
He was billed as a limited stage and underwent four cycles of carboplatin and etoposide between [**2112-9-25**] and [**2112-12-26**], resulting in resolution by radiologic studies at least of his mass.
Hypertension x10 years 3.
Status post stroke 10 years ago with loss of his left peripheral vision 4.
Left upper extremity weakness 5.
Dysphagia 6.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 7.
Hypercholesterolemia 8.
Peripheral vascular disease 9.
Hypertension 10.
Penile prosthesis 11.
Small cell lung cancer as described above  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Insulin 70/30 10 units in the a.m., 12 units q p.m., now 15 units q p.m. as per patient  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No chest pain, no palpitations, no bowel or bladder incontinence, no nausea, vomiting or shortness of breath.
No acute bloody stools.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes.
GENERAL:  He is a pleasant man in no acute distress.
No evidence of tongue laceration.
NECK:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur in the left upper sternal border.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no palpable hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact with a left homonymous hemianopsia which is old.
No pronator drift.
Electrocardiogram was not changed from prior and a head CT on admission showed a 4.1 x 3.7 cm enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe extending to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left ventricle with effacement of sulci on the right consistent with metastatic disease, new since the [**12-26**] exam.
In addition, a chronic right occipital infarct which is unchanged.
The patient underwent work up to determine extent of his metastatic disease, including an MRI of his head which was again consistent with metastatic disease as well as a CT of his lung, abdomen and pelvis, which showed no metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.
No liver lesions, adrenal lesions, however his lung mass appeared to have increased in size.
Brain metastases of small cell lung cancer 2.
