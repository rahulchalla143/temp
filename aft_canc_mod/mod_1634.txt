No significant interval change in nodal size and massive splenomegaly.
Increasing opacification in the right lower lobe may have an infectious etiology.
No pathology is identified to explain the patient's source of fever.
Unchanged size and appearance of multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes.
Interval development of moderate right and small left pleural effusion and interval development of ascites.
No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
Subcutaneous edema in the area of swelling in the right forearm.
Low voltage.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-8-8**], the findings are similar with limited views except for mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
------------------- Lumbar Puncture  - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchoscopy  - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
--------------  Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old female with hx of CLL who presented to the ED with fever x 2 days up to 101.9 day 23 s/p second cycle of FCR (Fludarabine, Cytoxan and Rituxan).
In the ED, she was not neutropenic but did have an episode of hypotension that responded to IVF.
#Febrile Neutropenia/ID: Patient was continued on broad neutropenic coverage with cefepime and vancomycin on admission given hypotension in ED and counts < 1000 and decreasing on admission.
A small RLL infiltate was identified concerning for pneumonia.
In patient with history of TB there was concern for reactivation of prior infection in setting of neutropenia and patient was placed in respiratory isolation.
On Hospital day 2 patient complained of headache, neck pain and nausea.
Abx broadened to include fungal coverage and anaerobes at that time.
On morning of Hospital day 3 patient became hypotensive w/ SBP in upper 70's, low 80's requiring IV fluid boluses, mild tachycardia, and increasing tachypnea.
With IVF's patient's pressures normalized, but she became hypoxic.
Impression was for sepsis and she was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.
In ICU LP was performed that showed no evidence of significant CNS infection.
Bronchoscopy exluced TB or other fungal processes.
Repeat CT scan of the chest demonstrated a new pleural effusion concerning for a para-pneumonic effusion.
However, patient remained afebrile and so decision was made to monitor her and to perform thoracentesis only if patient's fevers returned.
Antibiotics were peeled off as possible and patient completed full course of azithromycin for atypicals and cefepime 2mg IV q8 days for regular pneumonia coverage.
She remained afebrile and she autodiuresed on arrival to the floor much of the fluid she had retained earlier.
#Cardiac: Echo demonstrated no new wall motion abnormalities, depressed EF of infectious lesions.
Small pericardial effusion noted on CT scan not reported on Echo.
Patient without pulsus on exam, but with low voltage on EKG not noted previously.
