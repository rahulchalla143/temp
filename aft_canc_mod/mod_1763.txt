Patient was noted to be in afib with RVR in the OR and was started on neo gtt.
She was then transferred to the floor but after arriving on the floor the she went back in afib with RVR and had hypotension down to SBP 80s.
She has had issues with pain control and has been noted to be delirious at times but mostly AOx3.

LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
[**2128-5-24**] Femur Film IMPRESSION: Distal femur diaphyseal fracture.
No acute process identified.
Fragments of bone and bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopiesis, no evidence of malignancy; multiple levels are examined, see note.
Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
Views demonstrate steps related to fixation of a distal femoral shaft fracture.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval progression of metastatic disease since [**2128-5-4**] with increase in the size and number of metastatic foci.
Interval development of pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusion.
[**2128-5-29**] Femur Right The film is listed as two views of the femur.
However, the study consists of a single view of the femur and a single view of the right lower extremity.
No acute fracture is detected on this limited exam.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are detected.
There are degenerative changes of the right knee.
[**2128-6-7**] Bilateral LENIs: There is nonocclusive thrombus of some age in one of the left posterior tibial veins.
The other deep veins of the lower extremities show no ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 26818**] is a 60 year old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Her post-operative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
Patient did not have any issues with increased bleeding on Lovenox.
# Hemoptysis: On [**6-3**] and [**6-5**] Ms. [**Known lastname 26818**] had an episode of hemoptysis.
Pulmonary was consulted who felt this was likely related to known pulmonary metastatic disease in the presence of lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
Ultimately, patient's lovenox had to be increased to therapeutic doses given her left lower extremity DVT.
She did not have any hemoptysis for >48 hours, however, prior to discharge - with close supervision.
# Pain Control: The pain service was consulted to help manage Ms. [**Known lastname 28510**] pain.
Nortriptyline was eventually stopped given some concerns for tremor and weakness in her upper extremities.
- Continue Morphine Sulfate IR 15-30mg every 4 hours for breakthrough pain - Continue MS Contin 90mg TID for ongoing pain (can decrease to 90/60/90mg if overly sedated) - Continue gabapentin and lidocaine patches - the latter has been particularly helpful in controlling patient's pain .
Atrial fibrillation: Her post-operative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
- Continue lorazepam PRN for anxiety and before bed to help with sleep .
Metastatic renal cell: Ms. [**Known lastname 26818**] is s/p nephrectomy/adrenalectomy, spinal tumor resection/T9-L2 fusion, and left ORIF on [**2128-5-25**].
She will restart her Sutent after allowing a couple of weeks for her fracture to heal.
# Skin Nodules: Per review of path reports, she has nodules on her back which were consistent with known metastatic disease.
Likely due to obstructive sleep apnea.
- Continue 2L nasal cannula when sleeping - Continue incentive spirometry, mobilization, and avoid increasing sedating meds.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer Left distal femur fracture.
Hemoptysis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital after a fracture of your left femur.
Your post-operative course was complicated by an irregular rhythm which has now resolved.
Your post-operative pain is also being controlled with a specific medication regimen.
You were also found to have a blood clot in your left leg, so you were started on blood thinners.
The important ones are as follows: We STARTED Lovenox injections for the blood clot We STARTED Morphine Intermediate Release as needed for breakthrough pain and MS Contin for ongoing pain We STARTED Lidocaine patches for pain control We STOPPED nortriptyline because of tremors/weakness.
We CHANGED your dosing of metoprolol to better control your irregular heart rate.
