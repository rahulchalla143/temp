Admission Date:  [**2112-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-9-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-12-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 34698**] is a 66 year old man with PMH  notable for POEMS s/p autoSCT [**12-15**], therapy-related MDS (no MDS therapy), recently hospitalized for F/N and diagnosed with recurrence of POEMS syndrome, CKD on HD presenting with 2 day h/o worsening BUE motor fasciculations and depressed level of consciousness.
Patient recently admitted with neutropenic fever and hypotension initially requiring intubation.
Pt admitted yesterday [**3-10**] fasciculations and altered mental status.
Had been doing well on the floors except for complaints of penile/bladder pain that was challenging to control with methadone, morphine, percocet and dilaudid.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: POEMS syndrome manifested by polycythemia, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathies including hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and elevated PTH (diagnosed in [**2099**]).
[**4-/2108**]/[**2108**]: Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11 and dexamethasone (20 mg days 1,2,4,5,8,9, 11, and 12) x three cycles discontinued due to painful lower extremity neuropathy.
[**4-/2112**]: bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed dysplastic basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, a marked left shift and dysplastic myelopoiesis and abundant hyperchromic megakaryocytes, which initially were felt to be consistent with colchicine toxicity; however, chromosome studies performed on that bone marrow material revealed an abnormal karyotype 15/16 studied cells showed a complex clone with the following anomalies.
These were all consistent with a myeloid abnormality since there were not an increased number of blasts much more consistent with MDS.
His manifestations have been as follows: A. Polyneuropathy - CIDP in [**2099-6-6**]; Painful lower extremity sensory neuropathy and proprioception defects.
B. Organomegaly - Splenomegaly C. Endocrinopathy - Hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypocalcemia related to hypoparathyroidism D. Monoclonal gammopathy E. Skin and nail changes - now resolving.
F. Pulmonary hypertension and restrictive lung disease.
G. Chronic renal insufficiency (which has now resolved with therapy) H. Anasarca, now resolved.
I. Hyperuricemia and gout - now resolved J. Polycythemia and thrombocythemia - now resolved 2.
S/p tracheostomy [**2101**] 5. prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy 6. gout 7. pulmonary HTN and restrictive lung disease 8. chronic kidney disease 9.
Acute angle glaucoma ([**2112-4-27**])  Social History: Pt is a Ukrainian refugee who immigrated to the US in [**2049**].

Compared with prior exam, there has been interval resolution of scattered bilateral consolidations, with interval appearance of new areas of discrete consolidation and ground-glass opacities in the left upper, right lower and right middle lobes suggesting multifocal pneumonia.
Interval worsening of bibasilar atelectasis, right worse than left, with nearly total collapse of the right lower lobe.
Significant interval improvement of anasarca, with almost complete resolution of pleural effusion and ascites.
Mild perinephric stranding and cardiomegaly not significantly changed compared with prior exam.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-8-22**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
There is swelling and a small scalp hematoma overlying the left forehead.
No fracture is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or infarction.
Small left frontal scalp hematoma.
Chronic changes as described above.
Bronchial lavage:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages and rare bronchial cells.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-9-6**] Transient improvement in the diffuse severe consolidative pulmonary abnormality which recurred between [**9-2**] and [**9-4**] have reversed slightly, although to some extent the greater opacification in both lungs could be due to lower lung volumes.
Nevertheless, this raises possibility of superimposition of a component of hydrostatic edema or a developing diffuse alveolar damage.
The global nature of the abnormality argues against worsening of concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo M w/POEMS syndrome and MDS a/w worsening motor fasciculations and decreased level of consciousness at rehab facility admitted for febrile neutropenia and hypotension with multifocal pneumonia.
Hospital issues prior to patient changing goals of care to comfort measures:  # Hypotension / Septic shock: On admission, Pt met SIRS criteria with enterococcus from urine culture, coag-neg staphlococcus in [**2-8**] blood cx from [**8-18**], and radiologic evidence for multifocal pneumonia.
Given his h/o aspergillus pneumonia and that he was neutropenic upon admission, ambisome was added to cover for fungal etiologies.
CXR and chest CT revealed multifocal lobar pneumonia.
Bronchoalveolar lavage on [**8-29**] and [**8-31**] showed no organisms on culture.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [**8-20**] for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection secondary to pneumonia complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
CT chest showed new focal opacities in the left upper, and right lower and right middle lung lobes consistent with pneumonia.
BAL showed no organisms on culture.
Ambisome was later switched to voriconazole due to persistent low potassium while on ambisome and an 8 day course of vancomycin and meropenem was completed for gram positive cocci in blood cultures.
The patient was actively diursed with IV lasix and electrolytes were repleated as needed for component of fluid overload.
# POEMS/MDS: Patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and POEMS.
He also received platelet transfusions as need with a goal platelet of 40 given diffuse alveolar hemorrohage.
He was further treated with neupogen and prednisone; lenolidomide was held due to concern for neurotoxicity.
# Pain management: He has chronic pain throughout, including bladder spasms, and was treated with oxybutynin, dilaudid PRN, and fentanyl patches.
Pain management was difficult with higher doses causing altered mental status.
The pain was most responsive to the IV steroids.
# Urine with enterococcus - A urine cx growing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
# Muscle fasciculations- Per neurology, this represents multifocal myoclonus and asterixis, which are fairly non-specific and likely [**3-10**] cortical irritation.
Etiology unclear, but most likely toxic/metabolic effect or underlying infection.
#Dysphagia: Patient had trouble swallowing medications and failed his speech and swallow evaluation [**3-10**] regurgitation/aspiration.
Upon removal of the NG tube, patient began having nosebleeds and a discussion of replacing the tube vs. TPN vs. PEG was had with the family.
