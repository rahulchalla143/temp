She had no evidence of tumor lysis during this    hospitalization stay.
The remainder of hospitalization course was markedly improved in terms of her neutropenia and pancytopenia.
She had persistent pulmonary nodules and persistent fevers of unknown origin during this hospitalization stay.
Differential diagnosis for these pulmonary nodules were likely persistent leukemia versus infectious etiology.
Further evaluation of these lesions will be determined in the future hospitalization course.
Atypical Mycobacterium bacteremia.
Patient had cultures    that were positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.
However, given the fact that the organism    was identified was Mycobacterium abscessus as per the    Infectious Disease consult, they recommended discontinuing    these agents switching her clarithromycin and AmBisome as    well as vancomycin and cipromycin given the fact that she    was febrile and neutropenic at this time.
There was debates between Pulmonary, who was consulted for evaluation of this patient given her persistent nodules, serial CT scans during the month showed that she actually had some improvement in the ground-glass opacities as well as the hilar pulmonary nodules.
There was a concern for possible rebronching and evaluation of these nodules with a tissue biopsy versus a VATS to rule out fungal infection.
At the time of this dictation, the plan was to continue monotherapy for the atypical Mycobacterium with clarithromycin and followup serial CT exams for further evaluations and possible adjustment of her treatment.
The plan was if she continued to spike high fevers and had a hemodynamic instability, plan was to broaden antibiotic coverage and possible further invasive tissue evaluation.
Left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression.
A    repeat torso CT on [**5-21**] showed persistent pulmonary    nodules, but no evidence of bronchial compression.
The patient was covered with    AmBisome, vancomycin, and Cipro given her ceftaz allergy    as described previously for febrile neutropenic coverage.
On [**5-10**], she developed axillary nodules as well as some thrush.
Dermatology was consulted in evaluation of these nodules.
They were biopsied and the cultures were consistent with gram-negative rods and Pseudomonas as well as a throat culture, which grew out Pseudomonas.
Aztreonam was D/C'd as well given the fact that the pseudomonal infection was not thought to be due to infection per se, but was thought to be due to pseudomonal colonization.
However, she continued to have new spiking fevers to 103 and a urine culture grew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus x2.
A torso CT was performed to evaluate for an occult abscess and in the setting, aztreonam and linezolid were empirically started.
Torso CT showed no hepatosplenic candidiasis, but resolving bilateral pulmonary disease and continued nodules of unclear etiology.
She also had a new rash that was in her upper trunk and diffusely macular, and erythematous, and blanching.
Dermatology was reconsulted on evaluation of this patient, and they recommended that this was likely due to a drug rash secondary to aztreonam and the patient was changed from aztreonam to ciprofloxacin as a result.
She continued to have spiking fevers afterwards of unclear etiology and continued with broad coverage.
On [**5-26**], her ciprofloxacin was D/C'd and she was covered just on AmBisome and clarithromycin, however, further evaluation with Pulmonary and Infectious Disease consult regarding pulmonary nodules recommended discontinuing the AmBisome given the fact that the pulmonary nodules are likely consistent with either atypical Mycobacterium infection versus leukemia, and she was maintained on clarithromycin monotherapy with reimage with possible repeat CT.  A repeat CT was performed on [**5-31**], which showed stable pulmonary nodules and no interval change other than a left pleural effusion.
The patient was also given inhaled pentamidine x2 one month apart during this hospitalization stay for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis.
The patient had an episode of hypotension at    the beginning of the month.
She was given a one time's dose of    dexamethasone, and her hypotension resolved.
Elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
The patient    had some elevations in her LFTs initially concern for    levofloxacin as she was subsequently changed to aztreonam    as described above.
There was also concern for hepatosplenic candidiasis.
On [**5-27**], she had a markedly increased transaminitis, where her ALT and AST were both greater than 500 up from 90 the previous day.
[**Name2 (NI) **] serologies were negative for acute hepatitis.
Hepatology was consulted in the management of this patient, and they recommended that this was likely due to a medication-induced transaminitis versus some acute Mycobacterium in the gallbladder given her persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase.
She had a MRI of her spine back in    [**Month (only) 547**] without evidence of compression as she had no acute    issues during this hospital course.
The patient was pancytopenic during her    hospitalization stay after which she received 2CdA.
This GM-CSF was again restarted on [**5-12**], and    she had a one time dose that was D/C'd secondary to fever    and bone pain.
She started the dose of G-CSF on [**5-12**]    given the fact that she was neutropenic and got five days    worth.
The patient had an elevation of her INR.
This was likely all due to malabsorption and poor p.o.
The patient started to have flank pain on [**5-11**].
Chest x-ray was performed, which showed improvement    of her right pleural effusion.
This was likely thought to be musculoskeletal    and the patient received oxycodone and Morphine with pain    relief.
An abdominal CT was performed, which showed    initially splenic, hepatic, and renal infarcts.
Her pain    resolved with pain control.
She was empirically treated with Heparin drip for a five day course given a positive deep venous thrombus that was noted adjacent to her right upper extremity, PICC line site.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed with bubble study, which questioned an intraatrial shunt and paradoxical emboli given the splenic, hepatic, and renal infarcts seen and the abdominal pain associated.
A definitive transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which showed no intraatrium septum, however, there was incidental note of a thickened aortic arch wall with question of clot.
A MRI was performed and obtained to evaluate this thickening and it was noted to be normal caliber for an aortic wall.
The patient was maintained on Heparin drip as described above and her pain resolved.
However, on [**5-21**], she subsequently had increasing pain in her left flank and a repeat CT was performed, which showed resolution of the splenic and renal infarcts, and question whether or not these were infarcts to begin with given the resolution.
Her pain was of unclear etiology at this time.
She was started on Morphine PCA, which was changed to Fentanyl PCA, given some dizziness and was weaned off to an increase in her oxycodone dose, and this was subsequently D/C'd and changed over to Fentanyl patch.
She no longer had any pain, and this was thought to be due to splenic stretch plus or minus splenic ischemia.
Diffuse macular rash.
Biopsy results were consistent with a drug rash.
New subcutaneous nodules.
On [**5-29**], the patient had    new rising subcutaneous nodules in her anterior thighs    bilaterally as well as posterior right thigh, which were    tender and erythematous.
Dermatology was consulted in    evaluation of these new nodules.
A punch biopsy was    attempted, however, this was aborted due to increasing    pain on her flank region and instead, Derm just swabbed    these cultures.
Cultures were negative for organisms or    polys at this time.
Differential for these lesions was likely pus related to abscess formation in the setting of reconstitution of her counts, and persistent Mycobacterial-disseminated infection.
