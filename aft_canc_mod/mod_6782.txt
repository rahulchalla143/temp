GENERAL MEDICINE ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL .
Chief complaint: jaundice, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP [**10-29**] with sludge removal with balloon   History of Present Illness: 55 yo F with history of DM, recent diagnosis of hepatobiliary malignancy (?cholangiocarcinoma vs. HCC)s/p ERCP and metal stent placement ([**8-30**]) for obstructive jaundice admitted [**2137-10-28**] with one day of fatigue and jaundice.
She was previously found to have a hilar mass with portal vein invasion which has yet to be biopsied for diagnosis.
Was asymptomatic except for jaundic and fatigue.

No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
Increased bilateral pleural effusion with septal thickening and scattered ground-glass, consistent with volume overload.
Right-sided aortic arch with mirror image type.
Note that this pattern is strongly associated with congenital heart disease.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Borderline lymph nodes, could be related to congestive heart failure.
TTE [**10-31**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
There were multiple filling defects that appeared like sludge in the biliary tree within the wallstent.
CT Torso [**10-30**]: Infiltrating mass obliterating the fat at the hepatic hilum along the region of the left hepatic duct.
This lesion encases the common and left hepatic artery and occludes the left portal vein, with narrowing of the main and right portal veins.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right than the left.
Right-sided aortic arch (mirror-image type).
Note that this type of variant anatomy has high association with coexistant congenital heart disease.
[**2137-10-28**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: Minimal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is dilation of right intrahepatic ducts.
the left portal vein is expanded and likely thrombosed there is direct extension of the mass into the left lobe of liver, measuring 2.5cm.
There is no other intrahepatic mass seen.
there is no evidence of pancreatic mass or pancreatic duct distention.
three is no evidence of renal mass or obstruction.
There is no evidence of renal calcification or calculus.
There is no evidence of pelvic mass or free fluid in the pelvis.
MRI Abdomen without and with contrast [**2137-9-19**]: There is a 3x3.5x2.5cm mass in the left lobe of liver, with contiguous exten into the porta hepatis.
There is thrombosis of the left portal vein.
there is encasement and narrowing o the proximal common hepatic duct, with dilation of right intrahepatic ducts more than left intrahepatic ducts.
There are no other liver masses seen.
The findings are consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
Metastatic disease cannot be completely excluded.
There is no renal mass or obstruction.
there is no retroperitoneal adenopathy identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 55year old vietnamese female with DM, recently diagnosed probably cholangiocarcinoma with portal vein invasion s/p palliative metal stent [**8-30**] admitted [**10-28**] with 1 day of lethargy and jaundice, found to have cholestatic elevation of LFTs.
On first day of admission [**10-29**], she underwent ERCP for new jaundice with concern for stent obstruction.
ERCP showed sludge s/p extraction with balloon wiht subsequent occlusion cholangiogram showing patent biliary tract.
Recieved total 2L IVF, not much improvement, thus transfered to ICU given concern for cholangitis vs. bleeding.
CTA [**10-31**] showed no PE but some pulm congestoion/small effusions.
LIkely was transient bacteremia (cx neg) from procedure as pt quickly recovered and did well.
CT reconstruction showed mass in liver hilum, near porta hepatis, with occlusion of portal vein/encasement of hepatic artery.
Plan was for CT guided biopsy but there was hesitance given high risk of bleeding given location.
There was an attempt by radiology to get diagnostic paracenthesis [**11-1**] (CT showed ascites but done after large IVFs) but no fluid.
after the procedure you developed fevers and low blood pressure and you were sent to ICU for a couple days for closer monitoring with IV antibiotics.
You are now doing better and will go home to complete oral antibiotic course We are trying to get a biopsy of the mass near your liver but were not able to get this done while you were here.
