Admission Date:  [**2130-11-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2130-11-28**]   Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2130-5-7**], diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and stage III colon cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy with 5-FU and leucovorin which was begun in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.
She had lower extremity weakness which resolved by the time of presentation.
She denied other symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, loss of consciousness, melena, bright red blood per rectum, dysuria or head injury.
She noted diarrhea and incontinence.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2130-5-7**] with an ejection fraction of 35%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as she presented with hypotension and a hypothermia as well as new onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate.
Her hypotension was believed due to in part her rapid ventricular rate, and also in part from sepsis of an unknown source.
There was a question of bowel ischemia that could not be ruled out.
She had an impressive lactic acidosis.
Around this time, she ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a creatine kinase peak of 154.
She required cardioversion for hemodynamic stability from her atrial fibrillation but did not remain in normal sinus rhythm for a very long time.
After all of these interventions, she initially started to improve but this improvement did not last, and her pressor requirements increased.
