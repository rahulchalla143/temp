Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: # extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer Patient complained of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for several months, with worsening hoarseness of his voice and difficulty projecting his voice.
The patient underwent an extensive workup which included a chest x-ray that revealed an enlarged anterior mediastinal mass.
Mr. [**Known lastname 37393**] was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2180-8-31**] and was also seen the same day by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a mediastinal mass biopsy.
The biopsy results were consistent with small-cell lung cancer.
[**2180-9-5**]: first cycle of cisplatin/etoposide [**2180-9-5**]: Brain MRI: multiple lesions without mass effect consistent with metastatic disease [**2180-9-6**]:cardica echo: mass close to the lateral LV, no frank tamponade but impaired ventricular filling.
[**2180-9-6**]:Bone Scan: no metastatic disease [**2180-9-6**]: CT abdomen/pelvis: bilateral small pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion.
No other metastatic disease Radiation Oncology evaluation: Recommended whole brain radiation.
[**2180-10-5**] TORSO CT:  Large left paramediastinal mass with encasement of multiple mediastinal and bronchovascular structures, particularly narrowing the left main pulmonary artery and the left upper lobe bronchus as well as narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein, pericardial invasion with small pericardial effusion.
Stable to decrease in size of pulmonary nodules, small left pleural effusion, no evidence of bony metastases or intra-abdominal metastasis/lymphadenopathy.
Completed on [**2180-11-13**] 4 Cycles of cisplatin / etoposide [**2180-12-1**] chest CT:  No significant change in size of the large infiltrative left paramediastinal mass with encasement of multiple mediastinal structures, no significant interval change in pulmonary nodules bilaterally, moderate pericardial effusion, slight increase in size without secondary findings of tamponade, moderate left pleural effusion larger in size.
[**2180-12-1**] head MRI:  Marked improvement in appearance of multiple small infra and supratentorial lesions, no new lesions identified, findings consistent with treatment response.

This option as well as a palliative approach in which we would manage his symptoms and not prolong his sufferings was discussed with pt.
Pt understands that he has end stage cancer with progressing quadriplegia, without any good therapeutic options.The procedure of intubation was also explained to patient.
While intubated in the ICU, he was noted to have hypotension and was on dopamine via peripheral IV.
This was discontinued as IV infiltrated, raising concern for ischemia.
Given the progressive quadriplegia and his worsening disease, it was decided by the family that he would not want the tracheostomy after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], outpatient oncologist, as well as with the primary ICU team.
