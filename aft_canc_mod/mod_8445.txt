She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-11**] - [**2164-9-20**] after presenting similarly with bleeding from her enterocutaneous fistula.
The patient's last admission was also complicated by a multi-organism bacteremia (Enterococcus and E. Coli; CoNS felt to be contaminant) and her PICC was changed, but placed in the same spot due to difficult with access.
She has been taking vancomycin and ceftriaxone at rehab (day [**8-25**]; vanco was to be held today due to high trough).
On arrival to the ED, she triggered for hypotension initially, but was mentating well and asymptomatic.
Due to concern re: sepsis physiology, she also received vancomycin and zosyn.
Of note, her Hct is slightly lower than her Hct on discharge, but her coags are elevated with a PTT of 150.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, lightheadeness/dizziness or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

- Recurrent SBO - SVC syndrome - ?
DM, patient historically denies Oncological history (per outpatient oncology note): Metastatic colon cancer to the lung and pancreaticmass in addition to a large fungating enterocutaneous fistula.
The patient was originally diagnosed in [**2156-3-12**] with a T3, N0, M0 ulcerating adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon.
In [**2157-9-12**], she developed metastatic disease in the porta hepatitis.
She is status post multiple systemic chemotherapies, most recent regimen included 33 cycles of infusional 5-FU and leucovorin, and most recently she has been started on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] panitumumab, she received her first dose on [**2164-6-1**].
The patient developed angioedema secondary to erlotinib.
She has also had a reaction to oxaliplatin in the past.
Lastly, the patient had intolerance of cetuximab and irinotecan due to allergic reaction to cetuximab.

No evidence of pneumothorax.
New small bilateral effusions.
Stable right lower lobe pulmonary nodule compatible with known metastatic colon cancer.
ECG: ST 117 rightward axis and nl intrevals, low voltageno ST changes.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension  CXR [**2164-9-28**]- FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-27**], the central catheters remain in place.
There is diffuse haziness of both hemithoraces consistent with substantial layering pleural effusions.
This obscures the appearance ofthe underlying pulmonary metastasis at the right base.
No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
RENAL U/S [**2164-9-29**]- FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to patient's body habitus and presence of a large ostomy bag.
There is no hydronephrosis.
Further evaluation for masses or stones is very limited, however, none were seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Large bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis have worsened.
There is a duplex brachial and basilic vein noted on the right side.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage IV metastatic colon cancer complicated by an enterocutaneous fistula and extensive spread of carcinoma into the osotomy bag who presents from a rehab center with with acute on chronic bleeding into her ostomy and hypotension.
# Acute GI bleed with coagulopathy: Patient with intermittent brisk bleeding into ostomy bag in the setting of cutaneous extension of carcinoma.
Seen by surgery who recommended surgicel and said no role for surgical intervention.
Initial PTT/INR elevated, thought some effect from prophylactic heparin SC patient was getting at [**Hospital1 1501**].
Another 2 units PRBC were given on [**9-28**] for decrease in Hct and concerns for presisting bleeding in context of hypotension.
Pt also had evidence of coagulopathy with elevated INR.
INR remained elevated during hospitalization, and patient was not administered during admission due to this.
Bleeding resolved on its own and pt had no further bleeding for several days prior to discharge.
# Hypotension: Thought most likely secondary to acute GI bleeding as above.
She was most recently being treated with Vanco/Ceftriaxone at her [**Hospital1 1501**] for pan-sensitive Entercoccal & E. Coli bacteremia (still getting course of therapy when admitted).
ID added Metronidazole as well for anaerobic coverage.
Patient was still orthostatic after fluid so albumin infusion was given along with 2 units PRBC as noted above and urine output picked up.
ID stated that antibiotics course could be stopped after doses given on [**10-2**], however, patient had evidence of UTI at that time, and cefepime was continued.
# Altered mental status: there was concern for patient having waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status after she left the ICU.
There was concern for infectious etiology, for which patient was at the time being treated with cefepime for UTI.
# Right arm swelling: patient was noted to have and erythematous right upper extremity after leaving the ICU.
Ultrasound was performed revealing no evidence of DVT.
Area around PICC insertion was slightly erythematous, but since this was the patient's only IV access, the line was not pulled.
# Metastatic Colon Cancer: Pt not felt to be candidate for further chemotherapy.
Pain was controled with fentanyl, morphine IR & MS contin.
Pt started back on diet [**9-28**] when became clear she was not briskly bleeding from GI tract.
There was likely some element of poor GI absorption in nutrition status and contributing to coagulopathy.
# Acute Kidney injury: Cr up to 1.6 from baseline of 0.7 in the setting of GI bleed and hypotension.
Thought to be pre-renal initially although question of interstitial injury from vancomycin.
Vancomycin was held while in ICU and troughs were followed but never became sub-threrapeutic before floor transfer.
There was no hydronephrosis on renal u/s.
# Hypoxia/Pleural Effusions: Patient had a history of lung nodule and bilateral effusions in the past.
On most recent CXR patient with recurrence of effusions.
ECHO on [**9-28**] done for concern over cardiac systolic decompensation with volume overload.
Mild pulmonary hypertension that had not previously been present.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Gastrointestinal bleed Acute Renal Failure urinary tract infection  Secondary Diagnoses: Metastatic Colon Cancer Anxiety Depression   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 69629**]:  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a gastrointestinal bleed into your ostomy and evidence of damage to your kidneys as well as a urinary tract infection.
During this admission you also completed your course of antibiotics from a gastrointestinal infection from a prior hospitalization.
