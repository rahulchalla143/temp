Admission Date:  [**2117-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-9-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR - pigtail catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 54 year old female with GIST chief complaint of nausea/vomiting/ diarrea/high fever for 24 hours.
Was diagnosed with GIST (gastro intestinal stromal tumor) a month ago and was started on therapy with Gleevec with the hope to move on to surgery later.
She was found to be hypotensive (sbp 70's) and febrile requiring IVF boluses and pressors (levophed and dopamine).
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she continued to have sbp in 90s.
Past Medical History: GIST dx'ed [**9-10**] - CT scan that showed a large mass in the lesser sac of the stomach that was diffusely heterogeneous and necrotic with irregular borders, displacing the stomach and the  duodenum.
Hypertension s/p cholecystectomy.
Family History: Significant for father who died of lung cancer and a mother and sibling who died of cardiac disease.
Physical Exam: V: 100.2F HR 125 BP 83/55 RR 22 100%/4L n.c. Gen: awake, alert and oriented, appears somewhat scared and curled up in bed HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric sclera, OP clear, MMM CV: regular, tachycardic, no murmurs appreciated Pulm: CTA-ant Abd: hypoactive BS, softm mild distension, mild epigastric TTP, no rebound or guarding Ext: WWP, no edema Neuro: AOx3 Skin: mild rash vs sun exposure on upper chest   Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen ([**2117-10-16**]): 1.
Large abdominal mass with air locules and air-fluid levels, consistent with necrotic GIST.
The large amount of air and air fluid level are concerning for abscess.
No evidence of perforation or hemorrhage.
Findings concerning for pancolitis.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
Multicystic mass arising from the stomach with the largest cystic component now containing a drain, slightly decreased in size compared to [**10-16**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions, perhaps slightly increased in size compared to recent prior.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P [**10-19**]:  54 year old female with [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH found to be septic with necrotic tumor mass, PNA, and diarrhea.
# Sepsis: Given interventional radiology drained over 1 liter of foul smelling blood from a necrotic area of GIST tumor ([**10-16**]) which is growing gram negative rods, highly suspicious for source of sepsis.
Patient slowly weaned off all pressor support, including phenyl ephrine (off [**10-16**]), levophed (off [**10-17**]), vassopressin (off [**10-19**] 0300) - CT abd/pelvis: necrotic fluid filled mass c/w GIST tumor, fluid collection is multiloculated and pigtail catheter appears to be in one of the loculations - With aggressive flushing [**10-19**] pigtail catheter began draining copious amount of sanguinous fluid, after draining a scant amount over the past 24 hours.
- Consulted surgery as feel definitive treatment will be surgical removal of the mass - Cont vanc/zosyn/flagyl as patient is improving from septic stand-point do not feel indicated to double-cover for GNR at this point - Continue to follow fever curve (pt afebrile *24 hours) - Cont to monitor BP, as per family patient hypertensive at home.
# Respiratory Distress: likely due to pneumonia with LLL infiltrate and increase cough, complicated [**10-17**] by volume overload in the setting of receiving blood.
Also patient anemia may be contributing to her feelings of dyspnea.
Given the possibility of surgery and the patient's continued low blood pressures, will hold on further diuresis at this point - Xopenex q4hr as needed for SOB - I/O: even, to slightly negative - Continue to wean O2 as able .
# Anemia: Stabilized.
Initially post-IR catheter placement,pt experienced HCT drop (28.8-23.8)concerning for internal bleed from necrotic tumor mass.
Bilirubin was rising which increased concern for bleeding/hemolysis.
# Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Resolved.
On presentation, patient had low platelets and elevated INR in setting of sepsis concerning for evolving DIC.
Fibrinogen mildly elevated.
Patient received 4 units FFP to prepare for IR guided drainage of necrotic mass.
[**10-17**] in setting of concern for HCT drop bleeding vs hemolysis patient received 2 additional units FFP to bring INR to 1.5.
- cont antiemetics, pt with nausea from tumor - on PPI .
# Pain Control: patient with abdominal pain due to tumor and new pigtail catheter - Morphine IV prn for pain .
# Diarrhea: Resolved.
On admission concerned for potentially infectious colitis however high reported incidence of Gleevec induced diarrhea and nausea.
# Renal failure: Resolved with fluid resuscitation, likely acute kidney injury from sepsis/ATN.
# Metabolic acidosis: Resolved.
Mildly elevated AG (14) in setting of acute renal failure and lactic acidosis which are most likely causes.
# Access: RIJ, Aline .
# Prophy: PPI, pneumoboots given concern for evolving coagulopathy .
# Code: FULL.
Intra-abdominal abscess within the lesser sac.
Drainage of intra-abdominal abscess in the lesser sac.
Post-op Fever She was restarted on VAncomycin and Zosyn after spiking a temperature to 101 on POD 1.
IMPRESSION: Status post subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and removal of previously seen large intra-abdominal mass with air- fluid levels.
Postoperative changes seen within the abdomen, without evidence of recurrent collection.
Her HR responded to medications, but she remained hypotensive with SBP in the 80's and was likely septic.
She did well in SICU without any further episodes of tachycardia.
She was then transferred back to the floor and from this point, did not have any further complications and continued to recover.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
