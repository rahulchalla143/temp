Patient's course was complicated by thrombocytopenia and fevers, please see below, and thus pneumonectomy was postponed until that time.
Fevers:  Patient began to spike fevers during her [**Hospital Unit Name 1863**] admission.
None of patient's blood cultures or urine cultures had any growth except for contamination with Staph epi.
Patient's last fever was on [**4-17**], and she remained afebrile since that time.
Thrombocytopenia:  Patient developed an acute drop in her platelets during her [**Hospital Unit Name 1863**] course.
This occurred after beginning Bactrim for initial sputum culture.
She received 1 unit of platelets after a bronchoscopy for minor oozing, however, required no other transfusions.
Anemia:  Patient had a slow trending downward of her blood count.
Patient's iron studies indicated anemia of chronic disease as well.
Blood pressure control:  Patient's blood pressure continued to oscillate from hypertension to hypotension.
