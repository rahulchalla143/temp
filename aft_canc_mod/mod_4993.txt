No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
There is a mass or tumor in the right ventricle which fills the apex and extends well into the RV cavity.
The mass is seen extending into the RVOT 1-2 cm from the pulmonic valve, however no turbulent flow is seen in the RVOT by color flow doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Short-term stability of extensive hemorrhagic mass in the right parietal lobe with additional smaller lesions in the left frontal and parietal lobes.
No evidence of new lesions.
No new mass effect or hemorrhage.
Status post right parietal craniotomy with expected post-surgical changes and blood products in the surgical bed; with gadolinium contrast, no frank evidence of residual mass lesion is identified; however, close followup is recommended.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute or subacute ischemic changes.
Persistent vasogenic edema and asymmetry of the right ventricular trigone and right temporal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is no evidence of new areas with abnormal enhancement.
Surgery was without complication.
Post operatively he had persistent left field cut/ slight left pronator drift but was otherwise neurologically well.
He had persistent N/V therefore multiple anti-emetics were ordered.
Head CT was stable post op, with no hemorrhage.
He underwent an [**Doctor Last Name 4338**] for post op evaluation which revealed post operative changes.
He was kept in the ICU for close observation and euvolemia maintenance.
During his decadron taper his left sided drift/weakness slightly worsened.
