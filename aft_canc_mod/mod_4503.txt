Admission Date:  [**2123-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-8-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: clogged J-tube  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1022**] is an 87 year old male with a past medical history of metastatic gastric cancer s/p Subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy and feeding jejunostomy [**2123-5-7**] who presents as OSH transfer from [**Hospital3 **] hospital for clogged J tube.
After a stay on the surgery service [**2123-4-28**] through [**2123-5-27**] for this procedure, patient was discharged to NE [**Hospital1 **] and then later to NH, during which time he had intolerance to tube feeding.
At [**Hospital3 **], Initial CBC showed a WBC of 17 with 40% bands and CXR showed bilateral lower lobes consistent with possible aspiration.
Patient also had some episodes of vomitting, and CT scan was performed which was negative for obstruction.
At this time, patient feels well and reports no chest pain, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain or nausea   Past Medical History: PMH: # recently diagnosed metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma causing gastric outlet obstruction s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy, J-tube ([**5-10**]) # Stage II coccyx decub ulcer # Bilateral cataract surgery [**2122**] # Elevated LFTs on last admission felt to be [**2-2**] TPN   Social History: Was living at nursing home, retired storekeeper.
Family History: [**Name (NI) 86502**] CA, Uncle-lung CA, Cousin x2- rectal cancer   Physical Exam: Physical exam Vitals: T: 96.8 BP: 100/69 P: 70 R: 18 SaO2: 100% 2L General: Awake, alerti, interactive, cachectic, ill appearing HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, dry MM, no lesions noted in OP, no thrush Neck: supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi or rales Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: scaohoid, with J tube in place with 1 cm surrounding erythema but no drainage/pus, non tender, nondistended, but abdomen is firm Extremities: 2+ LE bilateral symmetric edema Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No abnormal movements noted.
Bilateral opacities consistent with multifocal infection.
There are several nonspecifically dilated small bowel loops up to 4 cm.
There are no other abnormalities seen.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
New soft tissue mass at the level of the hepatic flexure adjacent to suture material concerning for metastasis or peritoneal implant.
No dilated loops of bowel are seen at this point to suggest obstruction.
Increased intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, likely related to the hepatic flexure soft tissue mass, as detailed above.
Massive new ascites.
Thickening of the peritoneum within the upper abdomen and deep pelvis are concerning for peritoneal implants.
New right femoral deep venous thrombosis.
Progression of oral contrast passed the soft tissue mass near the colocolonic anastomosis within the right upper quadrant.
This excludes a complete obstruction, although a component of partial obstruction may still be present.
No other changes on this examination from the contrast-enhanced exam done earlier on same date.
Deep venous thrombosis of the right common femoral and proximal superficial femoral veins.
No thrombus seen more distally.
No left-sided deep veinous thrombosis seen, possible sequelae of previous left DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1022**] is an 87 year old Korean-speaking gentleman with metastatic gastric cancer s/p subtotal gastrectomy/transverse colectomy/feeding jejunostomy 3 months ago, who had been treated at an outside hospital for aspiration pneumonia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for clogged j-tube.
He was not continued on antibiotics, as he had received a sufficient course and had no fever/leukocytosis/cough.
During this admission, he had issues with feeding, poor nutritional status, and hypernatremia.
There were many cultural barriers to care in this patient's case: he insisted that his son be the one to make all medical decisions for him.
Since he had been recently treated for aspiration pneumonia, he underwent Speech+Swallow evaluation: he had normal swallowing function but he did tend to vomit after eating, and due to weakness was often unable to fully clear food from his airway.
Tube feeds also resulted in extreme nausea/vomiting; CT scan showed that there was no obstruction distal to the j-tube, but he did have extensive abdominal ascites and peritoneal implants.
On the evening of [**2123-8-18**], the patient's wife was feeding him chicken and plums (she knew he was only cleared to eat pureed solids) and the patient had an aspiration event.
The patient agreed with this plan, and was aware that his respiratory status would likely require further intervention.
--- Mr. [**Known lastname **] overall status continued to decline; he became extremely air-hungry, and this was treated with morphine PRN.
His respiratory rate slowed markedly, his blood pressures dropped, and he became minimally responsive.
