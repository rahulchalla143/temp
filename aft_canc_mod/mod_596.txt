CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Worsening shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 48 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post lumpectomy and radiation with a history of two recent admissions in [**Month (only) 116**] and [**2183-7-10**], for bilateral malignant pleural effusions and bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2 and Bi-PAP, now presenting with one week of progressive worsening shortness of breath.
The patient noted, starting approximately one week ago, progressively worsening shortness of breath at rest with increasing home O2 requirements.
Two days prior to admission, the patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining of shortness of breath, increased heart rate, decreased O2 saturations in the low 90s.
The patient was evaluated for pulmonary embolism by CT angiogram which was negative with only slight increase in the right pleural effusion and atelectatic changes.
On the morning of admission, the patient saw Dr. [**Name (NI) **], reporting worsening shortness of breath, increased O2 requirements from 1.5 to 4 liters, decreased O2 saturations from the mid-90s to the low 90s and increased heart rate above 100.
An echocardiogram of the lungs was done showing no change in pleural effusions and the patient was referred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for transthoracic echocardiogram.
The echocardiogram revealed a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion with a right atrial collapse and a right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired filling and tamponade.
Metastatic breast cancer diagnosed in [**2177**]: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma status post lumpectomy and radiation with axillary node dissection, recurrence [**2182-8-10**]; admission [**4-/2183**] and [**7-/2183**] for bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2.
Cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**]:  Small hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident from a cavernous hemangioma.
Seasonal allergies.
Right low anterior rib fracture.
for rib pain.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Her mother died of mixed connective tissue disorder.
Her father died of hairy cell leukemia.
Generally, the patient is a thin female, notably short of breath while speaking.
HEENT examination: No scleral icterus.
Neck examination:  At 30 degrees with jugular venous distention approximately 10 centimeters.
No carotid bruits noted.
Lung examination with decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, right greater than left, crackles half way up the right side and a third of the way up the left side.
Dullness to percussion bilaterally, right greater than left; no wheezes.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulsus paradoxus with radial pulse decreasing with inspiration.
No peripheral edema, clubbing or cyanosis.
Neurologic examination:  The patient is awake, alert and oriented times three with no gross lesions.
CT angiogram in the Emergency [****], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, slight interval increase in right pleural effusion with left loculated atelectatic changes.
A [**8-20**] lung ultrasound showing no change in pleural effusion.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showing left ventricular systolic function, mildly decreased septal hypokinesis, moderate to large pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse consistent with impaired filling or tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In brief, the patient is a 48 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post two recent admissions for bilateral malignant pleural effusions, bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2 and bi-PAP, now presenting with progressively worsening shortness of breath times one week and transthoracic echocardiogram consistent with pericardial effusion.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with an echocardiogram consistent with pericardial effusion.
Miss [**Known lastname 16968**] had an EKG upon admission which showed no evidence of electrical alternans and EKG upon discharge which also showed no evidence of electrical alternans.
The house officer was called to see the patient in the evening of [**8-21**], for chest pain with inspiration.
An EKG showed some elevation in PR interval in AVR.
A follow-up echocardiogram was done revealing normal ejection fraction 45 to 50% and no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of malignant pleural effusions likely contributing to her symptoms of shortness of breath.
The patient reported subjectively that her shortness of breath had improved somewhat following the tap.
Hematology/Oncology:  The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer and malignant bilateral pleural effusions, now with a new pericardial effusion which is exudative.
New pericardial effusion, cytology pending.
Metastatic breast carcinoma with a history of malignant pleural effusions.
Seasonal allergies.
History of rib fracture.
It is recommended that the patient have a follow-up echocardiogram to evaluate any further re-accumulation of pericardial fluid.
The patient is to call if she has worsening symptoms or shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain.
