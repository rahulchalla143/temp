Admission Date:  [**2150-3-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2150-3-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-4-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ONCOLOGY CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers and hypoxia.
[**Name (NI) 6**] MRI on [**2150-1-30**], demonstrated an enhancing mass in the vermis.
The pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma, she did not have a primary carcinoma identified at the time.
She has a known history of a lung nodule in the right middle lobe for the past year.
A recent CT scan on [**2150-1-31**], demonstrated hilar lymphadenopathy and a stable right middle lobe nodule.
She was noted by her significant other to have a rapid decline in function concurrent with steroid taper, with difficulty walking, and progressive shortness of breath approximately two weeks prior to admission.
Her primary care physician had started levofloxacin on [**2150-3-4**], for one week history of a cough productive of clear sputum (blood cultures from that time were negative).
She denies prior PPD testing or tuberculosis exposure.
She denies any chest pain or abdominal pain or dysuria or odynophagia on presentation.
Hepatitis C since two years.
Oral Candidiasis history.
There is no history of alcohol consumption.
No history of intravenous drug abuse within the past nine years.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for gallbladder carcinoma.
Neck:  Supple, no jugular venous distention or bruits.
Patient had significant bilateral supraclavicular adenopathy.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Dry crackles to the mid lungs bilaterally.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally.
Pelvic examination:  Nodular cervix with white liquid exudate.
No masses felt.
No cervical motion tenderness.
Breasts:  No masses or areolar discharge.
Also notable for diffuse emphysema with a small right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
Several low attenuation areas in the left kidney consistent with a cyst and large bilateral adnexal cysts.
PATHOLOGIC DATA:  [**2150-1-7**] cerebellar mass, status post craniotomy, was consistent with adenocarcinoma felt to be metastatic.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 46-year-old female, HIV positive, on antiretroviral medications, hepatitis C positive, recently diagnosed with brain metastases found to be adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, admitted with fevers, hypoxia and large cervical lymph node.
She underwent a fine needle aspiration of the left cervical lymph node.
The final biopsy results showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Further investigation was obtained with bronchoalveolar lavage cytology that demonstrated atypical cells, however, was nonspecific.
A CT with contrast of the chest was obtained on [**3-7**] that was consistent with a picture suggestive of bronchoalveolar spread of carcinoma that was highly suspicious for a lung primary.
Taking these investigations as a whole, she has a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with metastatic disease to the brain that is likely a primary pulmonary carcinoma.
In view of the later findings of Aspergillus infection (see below), the decision was made to wait on pursuing chemotherapeutic interventions empirically and to see whether her Aspergillus infection (which has a high mortality) will clear with a four week course of ampicillin.
Infectious Disease:  Presenting with hypoxia, fevers.
Found to have diffuse pulmonary process.
BAL culture data and multiple sputum samples consistent with Aspergillus fumigatus infection.
She was initially treated with amphotericin-B for her Aspergillus infection, however, had a rigorous reaction to this medication requiring Demerol.
On AmBisome fever curve persistently decreased as well as her oxygen requirement.
Given her good respond to AmBisome, it argues against concurrent infections with the Aspergillus.
Patient was also noted to have Clostridium difficile infection for which she was treated with Flagyl.
She was also noted to have gardnerella infection also treated with Flagyl.
Neurology:  Status post craniotomy/stereotactic surgery for cerebellar vermis metastases.
Once the fungal infection was identified, the steroids were discontinued.
Hematology:  We transfused two units of packed red blood cells on [**3-15**] for a low hematocrit secondary to polyphlebotomy.
Does tolerate solids with aspiration precautions.
Noted to be hypokalemic frequently as her potassium is being wasted by the AmBisome therapy.
Metastatic lung carcinoma.
Aspergillus fumigatus infection of the lung.
Brain metastases status post craniotomy/stereotactic     surgery for cerebellar vermis metastases.
