Admission Date:  [**2117-8-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-8-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-7-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple gastrointestinal bleeds all of unclear source but all self-resolved.
First episode was 12 years ago when the patient developed rectal bleeding.
Multiple suspects including diverticulosis, gastric polyp, internal hemorrhoids and gastric ulcer.
Positive gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia.
[**2117-7-30**] the patient took Dextra for the fifth time for knee pain and on [**8-1**] he had lower gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient had negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy, negative colonoscopy except for diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.
On [**8-5**] he had frank hematochezia with three bowel movements, had lightheadedness.
He went to the Emergency Room, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no nausea or vomiting.
He did have some positive lower abdominal pain during bowel movement which was revealed after having bowel movement.
In the MICU he did have melanotic stool but hematocrit remained stable and was then transferred to the Medicine floor for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diverticulosis, internal hemorrhoids, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds that self-resolved, gastric polyp and shallow gastric ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, hypertension, status post transurethral resection of prostate, status post bilateral inguinal hernia repair, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocystinemia.
Anemia found to be iron deficiency anemia.
Iron sulfate.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, no inflammatory bowel disease history, no bleeding disorder.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Extraocular movements intact, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, no jugular venous distention.
Supple neck and moist mucous membranes.
No wheezes or crackles.
2+ dorsalis pedis.
CK and Troponins have remained within normal limits and the patient has ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Additionally given that he had no further episodes of bleeding it was decided to just watch and see if the patient had any other events.
The patient then did have some blood per rectum and a tagged red blood cell scan was performed on [**8-11**] however, this did not reveal the source of bleeding either so again it is felt that perhaps a Heparin induced bleeding scan was the best course of action for this patient however, as stated above the bleeding then spontaneously resolved and the patient had no further episode of bright red blood per rectum and he had a stable hematocrit.
The patient was to follow-up with his primary care physician within one weeks time and was to report sooner should he have any further episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
