Admission Date:  [**2165-10-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-3-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Reglan / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Compazine / Hayfever / Levofloxacin / Vancomycin / Magnesium Sulfate / Dalmane / Acyclovir Analogues / Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: neutropenic fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2165-10-30**] arthrocentesis  History of Present Illness: 64 y/o F w/lymphoma s/p SCT x2 last [**11-1**], now with transfusion-dependent MDS, s/p recent hospitalization (summarized below) [**Date range (3) 95146**] who presents with fever.
She reports having trouble with her left knee since [**2118**], but on Thursday she was walking up the stairs and slipped.
Since then, it has been swollen and painful, and she has had difficulty walking on it.
Again she had no LOC, denies neurologic complaints.
Currently, her only complaint is of knee pain and mild dysuria.
In terms of her recent hospitalization, she was initially admitted with shortness of breath.
This was felt due to a combination of CHF and pneumonia.
Her hemodynamics were difficult to manage throughout her hospital course as she was intermittently hypotensive (SBPs to 70s) but would quickly develop pulmonary edema with minimal amounts of fluid.
At one point she required ICU admission for her hypotension requiring pressors.
It was felt by the ICU team that she likely has a restrictive physiology with a tenuous balance between shock and pulmonary edema.
Her hospital course was also complicated by febrile neutropenia.
She did develop a severe rash to cefepime but tolerated both aztreonam and meropenem.
LLL anthracotic nodule s/p wedge resection - bronchial metaplasia only, no malignancy identified.
Migraines with visual disturbances (?
Recurrent Shingles 6. s/p resection of LLL, as above 7.
Depression 11.
CP - diagnosis of myalgias in [**1-30**] 12.
CAD - Cath mid [**2164-11-27**] - left main stenosis, LCS and RCA disease -- after angiogram sever chest pain- IABP placed and CABG with mitral valve reparir ring [**2164-12-13**].
Pneumonia [**2164**] 19: Hypogammaglobuliniemia requiring IVIG <br> She was first diagnosed in [**2144**] when she presented with a right neck mass.
In [**2147**], she underwent high dose chemo with stem cell rescue, which was successful.
She also suffered from depression and was started  on Prozac during that time.
She was doing well until [**2157**] when she was admitted for work-up of a left lower lobe mass.
LN Biopsy revealed an anthracotic node and lung wedge bx showed only patchy areas of scarring and bronchial metaplasia, with no malignancy identified in either tissue.
She presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat.
In mid [**Month (only) 404**], she had  a recurrence of her shingles (treated with Valtrex; recurred on right chest, left neck).
She also saw an ENT for her sore throat  who saw a mass on her tonsillar pillar.
Biopsy revealed findings  c/w diffuse large B cell lymphoma with high-grade features, given the proliferation fraction of ~90%.
The alternative consideration of an atypical Burkitt was considered less likely given the nuclear pleomorphism and reported bcl-2 positivity.
She followed-up with her Oncologist after the biopsy was done and underwent BM bx revealing no marrow involvement.
Her course was c/b fluid overload, profound nadir and mucositis.
She had a PET scan  [**2-2**] showing marked interval decrease in FDG-avid disease within the pulmonary parenchyma and interval resolution of FDG-avid lymph-adenopathy within the neck, mediastinum, and hila.
Neck: supple, no palpable cervical adenopathy.
Does have 2 cm erythematous nodule in R neck at site of recent IJ - pt reports the erythema is improving.
Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no w/r/c CV: RRR, III/VI SEM heard best at LLSB, normal S1, S2 Abd: soft, nt/nd, +bs Ext: warm/dry, no edema.
Left knee is swollen, warm, with mild erythema over anterior portion, ROM intact although pain with extreme flexion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o F w/MDS, CHF, hypotension, who presents with fever and neutropenia.
# Neutropenic Fever: Pt reported a single fever at home.
Pt was afebrile on arrival and throughout admission.
Pt has multiple drug allergies to antibiotics.
She had a swollen knee as a result of a recent fall which was concerning for septic arthritis.
# R knee pain: Pt presented with a swollen knee s/p a mechanical fall.
Gram stain negative for microorganisms and was consistent with pseudogout.
Patient's pain was managed briefly with PCA morphine pump, however, provided minimal relief.
Rheumatology was then consulted and treated her pain with systemic steroids (prednisone 20mg po x 3 days) and a single intraarticular injection with steroids.
# Low UOP: During admission pt has had low urine output.
She required straight cath for urinary retention on [**2165-10-30**]---likely secondary to narcotics and benadryl for transfusion pretreatment.
Pt was started on bethanechol without improvement.
She triggered again for low UOP on [**2165-10-31**] after 12 hours without urinating.
This episode was most likely secondary to poor forward flow.
Pt has CHF with EF 30% low bp, tachycardic, and increased creatinine consistent with poor renal perfusion.
Small bolus was given with caution as pt has a history of being extremely fluid sensitive.
After slow bolus pt became dyspneic and lethargic.
Hospice care can provide transfusions for symptomatic relief, however, it has been deemed unreasonable to monitor her blood counts regularly.
# CHF: Patient has known chronic systolic CHF (EF 30%) which is easily exacerbated by additional IVF.
# SOB: Etiology of SOB is most likely her CHF (and resultant pulmonary edema and effusions) and questionable constrictive pericarditis.
Pt also underwent R sided thoracentesis to relieve her large R sided effusion.
She was given Lasix during transfusions to reduce incidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Patient also has a significant anxiety component to her dyspnea.
She will be discharged on supplemental oxygen, prn Ativan, captopril, albuterol/ipratropium inh and fentanyl PCA to provide her with maximal relief.
# Hypothyroidism: Pt was continued on levothyroxine until she developed difficulty swallowing pills secondary to her mouth pain.

[**Name Initial (NameIs) **]:*1 inhaler* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Androscoggin VNA and Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Myelodysplastic syndrome Neutropenic fever systolic congestive heart failure Pseudogout of R knee   Discharge Condition: Poor; pt is unable to stand or ambulate without assistance; po intake (food and medications) is limited by her mouth sores   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for febrile neutropenia.
You had significant inflammation in your knee which was diagnosed as pseudogout.
You were treated with steroids and your pain and fever resolved.
You showed evidence of significant immune system dysfunction when you began to develop several sores in your mouth.
The sores represent both viral and fungal infections that responded only minimally to treatment.
Your hospitalization was also complicated by your delicate fluid status.
Your heart failure would cause low blood pressure which would reduce blood flow to the kidneys and ultimately cause poor urine production.
Your multiple refractory health problems have a very poor prognosis.
Please contact your local [**Hospital **] Healthcare Representative for any further questions or concerns.
