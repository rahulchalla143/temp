Resolution of previously seen left upper lobe consolidation and near complete resolution of the previously seen right lower lobe pneumonia * [**4-13**] Chest CT: 1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Multifocal pneumonia, mostly in the upper lobes of both lungs.
Bilateral small pleural effusions * [**4-15**] CXR: Worsening multifocal pulmonary opacities within the upper and mid lung zones.
There is mild global LV hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2181-12-20**], mild global hypokinesis is now suggested (without regionality) and increased pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

* FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
* ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2182-4-15**]): NO AFB SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
* [**4-13**] Nasal Wash Aspirate: Negative * [**4-14**] Induced Sputum: Negative for AFB, Fungus      Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old man with MDS who was initially admitted with febrile neutropenia and coag + staph blood cultures (micrococcus sp.
), who was subsequently transferred to the ICU for increasing respiratory distress and multi-focal pneumonia.
Respiratory Distress/Multi-focal pneumoina- Mr. [**Known lastname 34834**] was found to have a multi-focal pneumonia by chest x-ray.
His respiratory distress was felt secondary to this underlying process and he was treated with broad antibiotics given his neutropenic status.
(He also had a history of stenotrophomonas VAP for which bactrim would be the treatment of choice).
Throughout this initial stage, he appeared fairly well clinically, without persistent fever, chills or shortness of breath.
Subsequently, he did begin to have more subjective dyspnea with desaturations requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
It was felt that broad antibiotic coverage should continue since the differential remained broad, however fungal etiology was highly suspected, as was possible gram positive pneumonia (especially given positive blood and urine cultures for MRSE).
He was weaned back off of positive pressure support, and then off of NRB face mask, with maintenance of oxygenation on nasal cannulation upon transfer back to the bone marrow transplant service on [**4-21**].
He continued to improve on the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] floor, with diuresis progressing successfully with lasix prn, and with O2 requirement improving despite a lack of radiologic improvement on repeat CT scan.
Given his clinical improvement, and given the volume that his many IV abx presented, and given his lack of positive cultures after [**4-10**], it was decided to change him to the following, emperic, abx.
regimen, on which he was sent home: Vancomycin IV, Clindamycin PO, Bactrim PO, Acyclovir PO, and Flagyl PO (which was added given loose stools on the day of D/C over concerns for C. Diff Colitis development on Clindamycin).
Stools were sent for C. Diff toxin before D/C and will be followed as outpatient.
# Coag Negative Staph UTI/Bacteremia - Mr. [**Known lastname 34834**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1801**] presented with fever and neutropenia, with positive urine and blood cultures for coagulase negative staph.
Trans-thoracic ECHO was performed and showed no vegitations.
Of note, he had no line in place at time of initial positive blood culture.
# Altered Mental Status: The patient developed transient confusion and disorientation, which was felt likely secondary to medications and ICU delerium.
His ambien was discontinued and he was treated with olanzapine prn for agitation.
# Tachycardia- He developed transient episodes of sinus tachycardia to the 110's in the ICU.
This was felt likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of low blood pressures in the 90-100 systolics and recent auto-diuresis of 2 liters over the previous day.
The tachycardia improved somewhat with IVF hydration.
Of note, he remained asymptomatic without chest pain, shortness of breath or palpiations.
His tachycardia subsequently resolved.
#MDS- Noted hypoplastic MDS.
He remained neutropenic and transfusion dependent for red blood cells and platelets.
