No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or new mass effect.
If there is continued concern for parenchymal changes, MR can be considered if not CI.
Slightly decreased but persistent moderate hydrocephalus compared to prior study from [**2186-12-28**].
Marked short-interval worsening of hydrocephalus when compared to the [**2187-1-4**] CT and, particularly, the recent [**2187-1-1**] MR, with new transependymal migration of CSF.
Status post externalization of the right transfrontal ventricular drain, with expected small amount of hemorrhage along the tract, small pneumocephalus and trace intraventricular hemorrhage.
Overall unchanged dilated lateral ventricles and third ventricle.
Persistent periventricualr hypodense appearance related to CSF seepage.
There is no new hemorrhage or mass effect.
Stable appearance of calcified pineal mass.
Moderate ventriculomegaly, unchanhged.
Right frontal intraventricular hemorrhage is now more apprent.
Pineal mass, unchanged  [**1-20**] - [**1-22**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which reached a maximum of a 6 Hz frequency.
It is also abnormal due to the bursts of generalized delta slowing, indicating deeper involvemtn of the which encephalopathy.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures in this recording.
Persistent hydrocephalus, increased compared with prior despite presence of VP shunt and recent shunt exchange.
No acute abnormality, though a large portion of the right frontal lobe is not well visualized due to metallic artifact from the patient's shunt valve.
Brief Hospital Course: 26 yo M with pinealoma s/p VP shunt presenting with altered mental status including lethargy and marked psychomotor slowing.
The patient presented with profound psychomotor slowing and lethargy.
He had an initial metabolic and infectious work-up that was negative including normal chem 7, CBC, LFT's, lactate, ammonia and urinalysis.
CT head completed at an outside hospital was reviewed with a local radiologist (images are in the [**Hospital1 18**] PACS system) and was felt to show unchanged chronic mild hydrocephalus with unchanged VP shunt position and no appreciable change in the pineal mass.
The patient was cocaine positive in the urine and given his known history of polysubstance abuse including marijuana, barbituates, suboxone and alcohol, a toxic ingestion initially was felt to be the most likely explanation.
However, his mother and sisters relayed a history of subacute or chronic lethargy and psychomotor slowing for many weeks with intermittent exacerbations requiring hospitalization including in mid [**Month (only) 1096**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] when he was barbiturate positive.
EEG revealed generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy.
Concern was also raised by the neurology resident about the possibility of a melatonin dysregulation syndrome associated with his pinealoma - continued research on this possibility is ongoing.
The patient will continue to follow-up as an outpatient for ongoing care of his pinealoma including consideration of future proton beam therapy through the [**Hospital1 2025**] as well as a drug rehab program at the same site.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: On [**1-4**], the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increased sedation, new aniscoria, and increased bilateral ventricular size seen on MRI.
He was monitored overnight with q2hour neurologic examinations.
On [**1-6**] he had an episode of tachycardia to the 130's which was controlled via medication.
On [**1-7**] he began to wake up a bit more however became increasingly tachycardic and diaphoretic and as such was started on Bromocriptine for "brain storm" in conjunction with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 87490**] the neurointensivist.
EEG leadsd were also placed to monitor for seizure activity.
CSF was sent for cytology.
He was transferred to the SDU on [**1-9**] however overnight he developed brainstorming symptoms he was transferrd back to the ICU.
The neurology team noticed that the patient had some facial twitching therefore they ordered a continuous EEG and an MRI.
No epileptiform activity was noted on the EEG's.
His UA dipstick was negative, and his CXR did not demonstrate any acute CP process.
9. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
14. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for PRN pain or fever >101.4.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Altered mental status Pinealoma Hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt Polysubstance abuse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
