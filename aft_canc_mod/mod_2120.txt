The patient is a 47 year old female with a history of multiple myeloma refractory to treatment who presents with hypotension, respiratory failure, septicemia, pneumonia.
She developed a cough several days prior to admission, according to her fiance on [**2156-8-5**].
She was seen in the oncology clinic and complained of progressive headache that had begun on [**2156-8-4**], which she described as a band encompassing the perimeter of her scalp.
She had a history of hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to her uncontrolled myeloma.
She denied visual changes, nausea or vomiting, or other symptoms at that time.
The patient had recently had plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity/high IgG.
At the end of the procedure, she had shaking chills but no fever and she was hemodynamically stable.
On [**2156-8-6**] at 5:00 am, she had an unwitnessed fall and her fiance found her nearly unresponsive and brought her to the [**Hospital1 46**] E.R.
Blood cultures were drawn and grew out Gram-negative rods.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2156-2-14**], treated with thalidomide, prednisone, Decadron and Cytoxan with refractory disease and continued myeloma.
The patient was found during this admission to have up to 22 percent of her peripheral blood smear to contain plasma cells.
Also she has history of asthma.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She had bronchial breath sounds.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She had hypoactive bowel sounds.
She had diffuse mild erythroderma and she was unresponsive.
Her total bilirubin was 2.5, troponin 0.25, MB CK 467, MB 10, consistent with a non-ST elevation MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  HYPOTENSION SECONDARY TO GRAM-NEGATIVE SEPTIC SHOCK:  The patient was continued on pressors and given many liters of I.V.
OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient developed fungemia secondary to central line, broad-spectrum antibiotics and TPN.
Ophthalmology consult was done to rule out endophthalmitis.
She had TEE with no evidence of vegetations.
After sterile blood cultures, she had replacement of a central line.
The patient developed herpes, crusted lesions in her oropharynx and nasopharynx and on her nose.
Encephalitis doses were used due to the fact that the patient was unresponsive for the length of her hospital course and it was impossible to know whether she was suffering from encephalitis or not.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS FROM LACTATE AND RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had CVVH and that was eventually titrated to regular dialysis and patient was off of pressors.
ANEMIA:  The patient had evidence of DIC at presentation, also in conjunction with besides her septic shock her myeloma, resulting in decreased production.
The patient had also oozing of blood from her mouth and from her lines and from other sites during her stay secondary to DIC.
ELEVATED LFTS SECONDARY TO SHOCK LIVER  COAGULOPATHY SECONDARY TO DIC:  The patient received, as mentioned before, FFP, multiple units, throughout her stay both for procedures as well as to prevent the oozing that she had from multiple sites in her body, especially her oropharynx.
This was maintained especially during the CCVH where her hypocalcemia became acutely worse.
MYELOMA:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] followed the patient regarding her myeloma, spoke to the family on multiple episodes saying that there was no treatment that could be offered to the patient, given the fact that she had already had multiple treatments without response and that she presented with multi-system organ failure with peripheral plasma cells and was deemed not a candidate for further treatment of myeloma.
Multiple CAT scans confirmed this and she was supported with FFP and platelets to prevent further bleeding.
She had atrial fibrillation during her episode, most likely in the context of volume overload and pressors.
She was hypotensive and had adenosine push once for what was believed to be an early SVT, then was shocked and came out of the atrial fibrillation.
The patient was sent for a pulmonary CT to rule out pulmonary embolus that showed diffuse patchy severe air-space disease consistent with ARDS, pus, blood or capillary leak, with an PA:FIO2 ratio of less than 200.
Blood cultures were drawn on that day which eventually grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two out of four bottles.
The patient also had respiratory washings from that day which also grew out Pseudomonas on her sputum.
The patient passed away at 6:00 am with no spontaneous pulse or respirations and was pronounced at that time.
