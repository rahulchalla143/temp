Admission Date:  [**2142-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-7-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-10-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Doctor First Name 147**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Duodenal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Classical pancreaticoduodenectomy w/open cholecystectomy   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 62 year old male who presented with chest pain, migrating to the epigastrium.
Cardiac workup was negative, but EGD showed a duodenal abnormality.
They described chronic active duodenitis with areas of pyloric mucinous metaplasia of the villous epithelium.
Furthermore, there was focal ulceration and granulation tissue and inflammatory exudates.
Although there no neoplasm was identified directly, there was suspicion from the pathologist as well the gastrointestinal endoscopy referral, that this harbored a malignancy based on its gross morphologic appearance.
As far as symptoms, the patient denied any jaundice, itching, abdominal or back pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, flushing, ascites, diarrhea, steatorrhea, fever or chills.
Duodenal mass, suspicious for carcinoma of pancreatic head 2. s/p pancreaticoduodenectomy w/open cholecystectomy 3.
CAD s/p stent 4.
HTN 6.
Hypercholesterolemia   Social History: 1ppd, quit 23 years ago.
He has no known environmental exposures.
Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: General:  Well nourished, well appearing in no apparent distress Head and neck: Pupils equal round and reactive to light, neck supple, trachea midline.
no cervical lymphadenopathy Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen:  obese, soft non tender non distended with no masses Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: alert and oriented times 3, with normal motor strength and sensation bilaterally  On discharge, the patient had an open abdominal wound with a draining pancreatic fistula.
The primary origin of the fistula is in the midline of the wound, with a secondary origin on the left side of the wound.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A):         Gallbladder with no significant pathologic change.
Cystic duct and wall (G):           Unremarkable cystic duct.
Chronic duodenitis with focal submucosal fibrosis.
B.     Pancreas with mucinous metaplasia of ducts and patchy chronic inflammation.
Stomach, antrectomy (NA-XA):           A.     Stomach with chronic inactive gastritis.
B.     Duodenum with no significant pathologic change.
Note: The grossly appreciated duodenal stricture is likely secondary to the submucosal fibrosis.
Sections of the pancreatic and bile duct margins need to be submitted and if significant pathology is found, an addendum will be issued.
ADDENDUM: Sections of the pancreatic and bile duct margin (cassettes AB and BB) are benign.
benign pancreatic parenchyma is seen in cassettes [**Last Name (un) **] and ZA.
Focally within the duodenum (section DA), there is a benign submucosal neuroma.
[**2142-6-19**]: CT scan abdomen IMPRESSION: 1) Post operative fluid and air in the resection bed as well as mesenteric and omental fat stranding are consistent with recent surgery.
2) No evidence of focal abscess or bowel obstruction.
3) Fatty liver.
4) Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, possibly related with some degree of consolidation.
Persistent and unchanged amount of fluid and air within the resection bed, mesenteric, and omental fat, which are consistent with the recent surgery.
No loculated or organized fluid collections are seen.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with small right sided pleural effusion.
No significant fluid collection is now identified.
MODERATE GROWTH.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

The patient had persistent low blood pressures and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.
He was extubated on post operative day one without difficulty.
He was maintained on a insulin drip for glucose control, and continued to have fluid resucitation.
Patient also had some confusion and the patient attempted to get out of bed.
On post operative day 4, the patient had a temperature spike to 102.8.
His incision was noted to be erythematous, and cultures were sent, and he was started on antibiotics for a suspected wound infection.
On post operative day 5 the patient had increaseing abdominal distention and a abdominal xray was not concerning for obstruction.
HIs Foley was dicontinued, but his diet was not advanced secondary to his abdominal discomfort.
His wound ws reopented on post operative day 6 and the patient was started on unasyn for his wound infection.
His NG tube was removed and he was started on sips on post operative day 7, and clears on post operative day 8.
The drainage from his wound began to increase and there was concern that the patient had a pancreatic fistula exiting through his wound.
Fluid sent from the wound demonstrated a very hisgh amylase and the drain output continued to increase, putting over 300-500cc/day out of the abdominal drain.
His TPN was optimized, however his blood glucose levels at times were consistently over 200 despite an escalating sliding scale.
