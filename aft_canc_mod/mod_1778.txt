Admission Date:  [**2127-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-11-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 74yo F with history of HTN, IVDU 15 years ago complicated by endocarditis and hepatitis C, who was admitted for hypotension, weakness, poor PO intake, and abdominal pain.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: You had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which is a procedure that uses a video camera on a tube to look down your throat into your stomach.
The EGD showed irritation of your esophagus, with mild irritation of your stomach and duodenum (part of the intestine).
The esophageal irritation is consistent with stomach acid damaging the esophagus.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] first developed low-level diffuse abdominal pain 3 months prior to admission.
Her pain was throughout the abdomen,  with some focus in the epigastric area, and did not radiate.
It was  not associated with change in bowel habits, though she has some baseline straining and constipation.
Around [**7-12**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] began having difficulty obtaining food due to financial constraints.
She presented to her PCP office on [**7-16**] with generalized weakness, hypotension, and tachycardia.
She endorsed poor PO intake with no solid food and very few calories for about 3-4 days partly due to finances in addition to her month-long history of weakness.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 74yo female with history of hypertension, distant history of IV drug use complicated by endocarditis, Hepatitis C presenting with hypotension and abdominal pain.
# Hypotension - The patient was admitted with a blood pressure 74/53.
Hypotension may be multifactorial including continuing blood pressure medication usage in setting of hypovolemia from poor PO intake.
AM cortisol level was normal, making adrenal insufficiency an unlikely source of her hypotension.
She was then transferred to the general medicine floor afebrile and without an elevated WBC count.
#Abdominal pain - Patient complained of abdominal pain of approximately 2 months' duration, diffuse, throughout the abdomen, but not radiating elsewhere.
During her admission on the general medicine floor, she also began complaining of sharp epigastric and RUQ tenderness, without radiation.
Her abdomen was distended and tympanitic.
Pancreatic enzymes were only mildly elevated, AST/ALT/bili were normal, and abdominal ultrasound and CT were negative for abdominal pathology, making an acute cholecystic, pancreatic, hepatic, or obstructive GI process unlikely.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**7-23**] showed mild esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis with "feline esophagus".
A colonoscopy on [**7-25**] showed several small pedunculated polyps, which were excised and sent for pathological review; there was no evidence of acute malignant process.
Her abdominal pain was thought to be due to a combination of GERD associated with H. pylori, poor PO intake, and some minor constipation.
However, a functional GI pain etiology could not be excluded and she was recommended to follow up with her PCP.
# Protein-energy malnutrition - Patient admitted with poor PO intake.
Other considerations include malabsorption, poor intake secondary to financial considerations.
She was determined to have moderate protein-energy malnutrition based on low albumin on admission, which resolved after eating.
# Fatigue - The patient presented with several days of fatigue.
The patient's TSH returned low, making hypothyroidism an unlikley source of her fatigue.
Age appropriate cancer screening including abdominal ultrasound, CT, and colonoscopy did not reveal a source for her fatigue.
It was thought that her fatigue was most likely related to poor nutrition.
# Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 2.8 (baseline 1.0).
Urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal etiology.
# Hyponatremia - The patient was admitted with a sodium of 129.
# Hyperglycemia - Patient presented with hyperglycemia on admission (Glc 133) in setting of poor PO intake.
# Eosinophilia - Her eosinophilia on CBC was mild and chronic, and she had a full workup in the outpatient setting.
There were no lung findings.
There was no evidence of acute parasitic or autoimmune process.
# Anxiety/Depression - The patient was continued on home citalopram throughout admission.
5. promethazine 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for insomnia.

These symptoms were consistent with a condition called "hypovolemia" or dehydration due to poor liquid and food intake.
Once we gave you enough fluid, you had a high blood pressure, which we treated with blood pressure medications.
While in the hospital, you also complained of abdominal pain.
We performed multiple blood tests, radiologic scans, and endoscopic exams to look for the cause of your abdominal pain.
Your abdominal CT scan showed no visible problems in your abdomen, but did show a protruding disc in your spine.
Your upper GI endoscopy showed esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus which connects the throat to the stomach.
We started you on a medication called prevpac to control the stomach acid and help eradicate a GI bug called H.pylori.
Your colonoscopy showed 4 benign-appearing polyps but an otherwise normal colon.
If you have difficulty affording food, please call Elder Services to access resources to help you.
You also complained of fatigue while in the hospital.
We did blood tests to evaluate your fatigue, and we believe that it is most likely due to poor nutrition.
Our blood tests showed that you had poor kidney function when you arrived at the hospital, most likely due to poor liquid intake.
