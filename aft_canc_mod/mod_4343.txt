Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 67458**] is an 80 yo gentleman with  h/o DM2, HTN, CKD admitted with painless jaundice found to have a pancreatic mass.
# Presumptive Pancreatic CA/Obstructive Jaundice: Patient underwent ERCP on [**2190-5-3**] with stent placement which was complicated by an episode of pulseless VT s/p resuscitation in the ERCP suite, intubated and then a short ICU stay and extubated quickly.
His CA [**02**]-9 level was dramatically elevated consistent with pancreatic CA however a tissue diagnosis was not obtained since he had a complicated ERCP no biopsies were taken.
He may opt to undergo empiric treatment for pancreatic CA vs. outpatient biopsy.
Patient's pain was controlled with long acting oxycontin 10 [**Hospital1 **], short acting oxycodone for breakthrough.
# CKD: Cr elevated to 1.9 at peak and trended down with IV hydration.
# VT arrest: Patient experienced pulseless VT during ERCP procedure s/p shock and resuscitation.
Differential included high adrenergic output vs. CAD ?old scar.
There have also been case reports of inducible VT with electrocautery.
ECHO showed normal EF with no WMA.
# Anemia: Labs c/w AOCD.
# DM: Elevated FS recently likely due to pancreatic disease.
Patient maintained on RISS while in house, diabetic diet.
# HTN: Patient was transiently hypotensive s/p cardiac arrest, he was volume resucitated.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Chronic Renal Insufficiency 5.
Hypertension 6.
Ventricular Tachycardia s/p cardiac arrest requiring shock   Discharge Condition: Fair - decreasing LFTs and bilirubin, pain under good control   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your medications as directed.
Contact your doctor or come directly to the Emergency Department with any fevers, worsening jaundice, abdominal pain, chills, shortness of breath or any other problems.
You have diabetes and your glucose has been high here in hospital.
