Admission Date:  [**2116-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-3-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-3-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**] Chief Complaint: Pt found down at home.
History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 6358**] is a 76 year old woman with history of diffuse B cell lymphoma with known brain metastasis, s/p cycle 3 of Alimnta, initially admitted to the hospital for presumed seizures, recently transferred out of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after she developed hypotension and tachypnea on the oncology floor.
She reports that patient was responding questions appropiately up to around 8 am (oriented to self and place, not year) but when RN returned patient was no longer interactive.
Primary team called and confirmed patient was unresponsive to voice or painful stimuli.
Patient continued to have slightly labored breathing but was not hypoxic or hemodynamically unstable.
Stat head CT obtained with question of right frontal lobe hypodensity, full report to follow.
Here she was noted to be having seizure activiy and Phenytoin was added to Keppra.
During her hospitalization, she became neutropenic and developed coag negative staph urinary tract infection.
Patient was noted to remain with altered mental status and head CT and LP were performed, without new fidings concerning for infection.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was fluid resusitated and CT abdomen was obtained which revealed bladder changes concerning for acute infection as well as dilated bowel loops; no abscess or obstruction was noted.
Patient was transferred to the floor after overnight observation and overall improvement in her mental status, blood pressure and respiratory rate.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**2115-4-17**] the patient presented with 3 weeks of slurred speech and was found to have a large L basal ganglia mass extending into the brain stem.
Biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
CT torso & BM bx were negative for lymphoma.
She received her first treatment of high-dose methotrexate that admission and has since completed her 11th cycle on [**2115-12-18**].
PMHx: #Diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma w/CNS involvement #Seizure Disorder #Hypertension #RBBB #L thigh lipoma  Social History: Lives in [**Location **] with her husband.
During CT scan revealed spontaneous movement of head and extremities, now only responding to deep sternal rub.
PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: Negative Dolls eye reflex, not withdrawing to pain on upper or lower extremities.
Grossly unchanged appearance of right frontal periventricular lesion, compatible with known lymphoma.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
Mild spondylosis.
Left cervical rib at C7.
[**2116-2-18**] CXR: Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
[**2116-2-18**] Abdominal X-ray: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
CSF immunophenotyping [**2116-2-23**]: Review of the cytospin shows few scattered large atypical cells, morphologically highly suspicious for involvement by the patient's previously diagnosed large cell lymphoma.
Flow cytometry failed to detect an atypical B-cell population and was thus non-contributory.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
No evidence of abscess or focal fluid collection.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Renal cysts.
Nonspecific mild dilatation of the transverse colon without focal wall thickening or pneumatosis.
Renal USG [**2116-2-28**]:  Study was somewhat limited due to labored breathing of patient and inability to hold breath.
Within the right kidney, there is a 1.3 x 1.3 cm hypoechoic focus in the lower pole consistent with a renal cyst.
Within the left kidney, there is a 2.0 x 1.8 cm hypoechoic focus consistent with a cyst.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
Limited study in the absence of gadolinium and in the presence of patient motion.
Nevertheless, there appears to be increase in size in the previously visualized hypothalamic and right frontal periventricular lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, admitted with profound obtundation, and altered mental status.
UNRESPONSIVENESS: Given known CNS lymphoma, the pt's altered mental status was concerning for hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect, which were not found in the original CT scan and appeared  unlikely given overall regression on imaging and lack of systemic anticoagulation.
EEGs were done and showed no seizure activity.
The background was slow and of low voltage suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy and more focal left temporal slowing suggested subcortical dysfunction in that region.
Her unresponsiveness was likely multifactorial with strong contribution from low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea.
After a two week delay in chemotherapy (because of multiple systemic issues) a repeat MRI of her head showed a small increase in size in her hypothalamic and right frontal periventricular lesions.
She continued to be treated for her urinary tract infection (See below).
Respiratory failure: Patient had respiratory distress and then respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation.
After extubation and most likely, secondary to her obesity, edema and hyporesponsiveness, she had a persistent snoring.
Later, she then became hypernatremic again on [**2116-3-10**] and was given 1L of D5 without improvement.
The etiology is thought to be malignancy invading hypothalamus.
SIRS: Upon admission patient had a urinary tract infection with Staphilococcus coagulase negative.
Later in the hospital course, pt developed hypotensiveness, tachycardia, hypothermia.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The pt has a baseline creatinine of [**12-12**].3.
She likely had ischemic ATN due to multiple episodes of hypotension and pressor support.
# Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease.
Initially no further treatment was considered, due to multiple medical comorbidities.
After patient recovered from the hypotension episodes and after multiple family meetings assessing goals of care, on [**2116-3-12**] decision was made to pursue whole-brain radiation salvation therapy, despite the low probability of recuperating.
When pt was hypotensive, it was held and patient did not further require BP medication.
# PPX:  DVT ppx with SQ Heparin  and a bowel regimen.
