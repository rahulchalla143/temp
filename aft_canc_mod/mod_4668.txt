Diverticulosis without Diverticulitis.
Some biliary dilatation and ?hepatic parenchymal changes in lower lobe of liver, no sign of surgical abdomen.
CXR [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]: possible retrocardiac opacity also seen on CT, concerning for aspiration PNA .
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: no definite vegetations seen; focal wall motion abnormalities in the LAD distribution.
No relevant change on comparison to the recent radiograph dated [**2199-7-31**].
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Dilated RV cavity.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
CONCLUSIONS The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: no definite vegetations seen; focal wall motion abnormalities in the LAD distribution.
The retrocardiac density suggesting left basilar atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged since [**2199-7-14**].
The previously seen left pleural effusion could not be completely evaluated because of incompletely imaged left costophrenic angle region.
Probable right-sided minimal effusion is unchanged since [**2199-7-14**].
====================== VIDEO SWALLOW: FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the esophagus and oropharynx without evidence of obstruction.
There is no gross aspiration or penetration.
Blood culture: pending Urine culture: Negative   Brief Hospital Course: 82F with UC, PSC, COPD and recent SBO s/p lysis of adhesions, discharged on [**8-3**] from hospitalization for presumed cholangitis, (ERCP deferred, pt improved on antbx) re-presents with septic physiology.
Third admission in past 2 months for fever and hypotension.
Developed these symptoms while on Cipro/Flagyl.
GI and ERCP team evaluated the patient and felt no need for ERCP, especially since intra-hepatic stenting would not be possible given her primary sclerosing cholangitis.
We also considered endocarditis or osteomyelitis as possible sources for recurrent sepsis; echocardiogram negative for vegetations, recent MRI spine also unremarkable (back pain improved since that study per patient).
ID felt this was potentially recurrent cholangitis - perhaps an organism resistant to cipro/flagyl (such as enterococcus).
Suspect nutritional deficiency, at home alone recovering from recent hospitalizations during which time she was likely NPO for procedures.
Patient's UC largely quiet, no complaints of crampy abdominal pain, blood or mucous in stool.
Annual colonoscopies, last in [**2198-12-19**] without dysplasia.
CT findings suggest possible persistent PSC-related inflammation but LFTs not elevated and patient without much RUQ abdominal pain.
#CT finding suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma.
PSC associated with cholangiocarcinoma and patient does report 25-pound weight loss over past year.
Held home lisinopril; can be restarted as outpatient at PCP f/u visit.
11. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**1-20**] inh Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
You should have your electrolytes and kidney function checked one week after discharge on the bactrim (your PCP will order this test)   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis Cholangitis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with recurrent fevers and hypotension (sepsis).
An extensive workup was done, and no source of infection was identified; however, you improved with broad spectrum IV antibiotics.
You were seen by your infectious disease doctors who think that this is most likely due to recurrent cholangitis that may have been resistant to the Cipro/Flagyl you were taking at home.
