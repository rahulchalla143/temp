On [**8-15**], patient noticed more pain, worse with movement, radiation to RUQ, no change with position or exertion.
She did feel short of breath after climbing stairs in her home, which is not her baseline.
Of note, patient now recalls a prior mild episode of similar pain one month ago, after gardening but while at rest.
There, she had ultrasound consistent with acute cholecystitis with stone impacted in neck, pericholecystic fluid.
CT showed massive pericardial effusion, pericholecystic fluid, nonspecific RLQ stranding, normal appendix and right pleural effusion.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further management of pericardial effusion.
Found to have pulsus of 30, bedside ECHO showed large pericardial effusion with some RA/RV compromise and evidence of tamponade.
She was scheduled for pericardiocentesis in the cath lab.
On review of systems, she has a prior hx of stroke and DVT in the context of her viral meningitis in [**2137**].
She reports an intentional 20 lb weight loss w/ Weight Watchers.
She denies any prior history of pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
She has mild ankle edema at baseline.

Uncle w/ leukemia, no other cancer hx.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD or HJR.
No pericardial rub.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, tender to palpation in RUQ and mild diffuse TTP.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema R>L to shin SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Examination of cytospin reveals pleomorphic cells with vacuolated basophilic cytoplasm.
EKG ([**8-16**] 4:00): rate 100, NSR, NA/NI, low voltages, Q waves in III, no ST/T wave abn.
Right pleural effusion .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion, ranging 1.5-2.5 cm adjacent the RV to 3.3 cm adjacent to the LV in diastole.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed, see below) of [**2140-7-12**], there is now a large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion which is mainly located posteriorly.
There is a small echodense effusion (1.1 cm) anterior to the right ventricle.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling .
Right atrial mass with heterogeneous late gadolinium hyperenhancement suggesting cardiac lymphoma, although primary cardiac tumor or metastatic disease cannot be fully excluded.
No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
No significant valvular regurgitation.
Mild [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 44 year old female with PMH of PCOS, GBS meningitis with intracranial hemorrhage and residual seizure activity, and h/o right DVT with IVC filter who presented with symptoms of cholecystitis and was found incidentally to have a large pericardial effusion.
A pericardiocentesis was performed and the fluid analysis was consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma.
# Pericardial effusion: A large pericardial effusion was found incidentally on an abdominal CT and there was evidence of tamponade physiology on echocardiogram and pulsus paradoxus.
Pericardiocentesis with drain placement was performed on [**2141-8-17**] which drained a total of 1200cc.
Fluid analysis was suggestive of Burkitt's Lymphoma.
# Burkitt's Lymphoma: Pericardial fluid was kappa light chain restricted CD10 positive monotypic B cells expressing FMC-7, CD19, CD20, and myc rearrangement consistent with Burkitt's Lymphoma.
A cardiac MRI showed a mass that was 3cm x 1cm on the lateral wall of the right atrium adjacent to the AV junction.
Chemotherapy using the [**Doctor Last Name 98945**] regimen for Burkitt's lymphoma was started and the patient tolerated it well.
At this time she will proceed to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for hospital admission for high-dose methotrexate.
# Acute cholecystitis: Right upper quadrant U/S was consistent with acute cholecystitis on admission.
She was tolerating fatty foods with no residual pain and her antibiotics were discontinued after 9 days.
Her epigastric pain resolved after her pericardiocentesis.
# Hx seizure: Once chemotherapy was started, neuro was consulted and the patient was switched to Keppra from Dilantin because of the possibility of drug-drug reactions with Dilantin.
# h/o DVT: She received an IVC filter in the past because anticoagulation was contraindicated in the setting of an intracranial hemorrhage and neurosurgical procedure.
Neuro was confident that she was no longer at an increased risk for intracranial bleeding and anticoagulation was discontinued when chemotherapy was started.
Prior to discharge on [**8-27**], she was found to have a clot in the right basilic vein associated with her indwelling PICC line.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary cardiac Burkitt's Lymphoma  Secondary diagnoses: -PCOS -seizure disorder -migraines -history of Group B strep meningitis causing intracranial hemorrhage -history of DVT with IVC filter   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for evaluation of a pericardial effusion incidently found on an abdominal CT scan.
You underwent a pericardiocentesis to drain this fluid and the analysis showed that it contained tumor cells that were consistent with Burkitt's Lymphoma.
There was no evidence of tumor in your bone marrow or in your spinal fluid.
On [**8-27**], you were found to have a clot in the basilic vein of your arm, associated with your indwelling PICC line.
Please seek medical care if you experience any concerning symptoms such as fevers, chills, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
You will be scheduled to return next Friday, [**9-1**], when you will be seen in the clinic and will then proceed to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for hospital admission for high-dose methotrexate.
