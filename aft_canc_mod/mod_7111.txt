She reports that her cycles became quite irregular with heavy bleeding at times.
This led to a pelvic ultrasound, which revealed an irregularity concerning for the possibility of a polyp or irregularity within the endometrial cavity.
The irregular bleeding continued and she delayed care it looks like for five or six months.
An attempt had at an endometrial biopsy in the past was associated with severe pain and so she was somewhat concerned about doing this.
A biopsy was eventually obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma was identified.
She denies any history of abnormal Pap smears.
She denies any history of pelvic infections or ovarian cyst.
Family History: FAMILY HISTORY:  She reports that her mother's aunt had a cancer of unknown type.
Oral mucosa without evidence of thrush or mucositis.
NECK:  Supple, no masses.
No thyromegaly.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey, negative cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
CHEST:  Lungs with poor inspiratory effort, insp/exp wheezes, and decreased BS @ bases.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, there are no appreciable murmurs.
BACK:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
No palpable abdominal or pelvic mass.
EXTREMITIES:  There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There is no mass palpated at cervix.
Rectal exam reveals good sphincter tone without mass or lesion.
The patient is in mild volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions demonstrated, right most likely more than left.
No pneumothorax is seen.
CXR [**8-15**] There is increased lower lobe atelectasis and slightly worsened right middle lobe atelectasis.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is persistent, if any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There are no signs of pulmonary edema or new focal area of consolidation.
No other change.
Non-specific T wave change in leads III and aVF.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-8-5**] the P wave is less peaked  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 107101**] is a 49yo presented for planned TAH/BSO for endometrial cancer.
The Mirena IUD has been shown to be somewhat effective in treating some endometrial cancers, but in this case, it is more of a temporizing [**Doctor Last Name 360**] given her significant vaginal bleeding.
The decision was then made to admit the patient for optimization of her pulmonary status.
As her glucose fingersticks were extremely high, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained for optimization of diabetes medications.
Postoperatively, extubation was not attempted secondary to her poor respiratory status and she was transferred to the ICU.
She was subsequently extubated on POD#1 and transferred back to the med/[**Doctor First Name **] floor on POD#2, after further optimization of her pulmonary status.
Her postoperative course was complicated by the following issues:  *) Pulmonary status: Pt did have an oxygen requirement following transfer to the floor.
Her vital signs were always stable during these episodes, and while sitting up during the day, no abnormalities or mental status changes from baseline were noted.
The team felt that she was likely difficult to arouse at baseline secondary to her lung disease and that the combination of narcotics, psychiatric medications, and benzodiazapenes were contributing.
*) EKG changes: An EKG obtained during an episode of sedation revealed T wave changes.
She was maintained on telemetry and had multiple episodes of sinus arrhythmia, but the character of such was deemed overall benign by the medicine consultants.
*) HTN: Her blood pressures continued to be elevated with vasotec, so HCTZ was added to the regimen.
