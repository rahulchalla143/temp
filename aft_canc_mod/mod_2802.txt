Bronchial artery embolization  History of Present Illness: 63M with h/o COPD and T4N2 IIIB NSCLC diagnosed in [**2133-10-27**] s/p 4 cycles of carboplatin and taxol and 8000gy radiation (6600 cGy between [**2134-1-8**] - [**2134-3-17**] and 1400 cGy from [**2135-11-3**] - [**2135-11-9**]) who presented to the [**Location 1268**] [**Location **] on [**2135-12-31**] with hemoptysis.
His first episode of hemoptysis resulted in admission [**2135-10-30**] to [**2135-11-4**] which was notable for tx to MICU and flexible bronchoscopy with limited visualization due to clot; he received palliative radiation as above.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy with intraluminal laser therapy as he can no longer receive XRT to central or left side of his chest.
Anemia 5.
Tachycardia  Social History: Lives alone in [**Location (un) 14663**].
Physical Exam: Vitals T afebrile  BP 121/86  P 114  RR 20  O2Sat 96% RA Gen: pleasant, middle aged man, in NAD, speaking in full sentences on RA HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, adentulous, OP clear CV: tachycardic, regular, no mrg Lungs: decreased BS on L Abd: soft, NTND, +BS Ext: w/wp, no edema Neuro: aox3, CN 2-12 grossly intact, strength 5/5, sensation grossly intact  Pertinent Results: From [**Hospital1 59561**]: [WBC 10, HCT 30, PLT 272 INR 1.6 PTT 27.6 Sputum Cx [**12-31**]: normal flora  Chest CT ([**12-31**]): Soft tissue mass abutting the hilum [left side] is not significantly changed.
Improved aeration of left lower lobe bronchus.
Diffuse centrilobular emphysema, numerous nodular denisities throughout the left upper lobe unchanged.
Large left pleural effusion, unchanged.
Large pericardial effusion.
A right bronchial artery was visualized exiting from the thoracic aorta, with multiple collaterals traversing the mediastinum and terminating in abnormal appearing vessels within the left aspect of the mediastinum, consistent with tumor vasculature.
In addition, there were several tiny collateral vessels supplying the left chest wall and lungs as well as possible tumor mass via the left subclavian artery and intyernam mammary artery.
A selective arteriogram of the right bronchial artery was performed, further demonstrating the collateralization extending to the left bronchial arterial supply, and terminating in tumor vasculature.
The catheterposition was beyond the take-off of a small trunk to the right upper lung vessels.
Additional arteriography with the catheter tip further advanced into the inferior trunk again demonstrated contrast opacification of the tumor vessels from this location.
Embolization was performed via injection of 500 to 700 micrometer embospheres to the end point of arterial stasis.
Following the performance of embolization, the catheter was repositioned to the left subclavian artery and selective arteriography performed.
Also due to the tiny size of these collateral vessels as well as the possible pulmonary territory that they supply, a decision was made to forego embolization of these small collaterals and if bleeding should not be controlled they may hypertrophy in the future .
The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications evident at the time of the procedure.
Right bronchial arterial trunk supplying the left bronchial arterial territory, possibly secondary to scarring due to radiation therapy.
No evidence of active extravasation of contrast to suggest active hemorrhage during the examination.
Successful embolization with 500 to 700 micron embospheres of the left bronchial artery via the right bronchial arterial trunk.
Tiny collaterals from the left internal mammary and subclavian artery to the left chest wall and lung.
There is some scant supply to the tumor but also connection with the pulmonary artery radicles and therefore no embolization of these branches was done at this time.
Small LV cavity.
Hyperdynamic LVEF.
Dilated RV cavity.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Severe PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA  PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion.
No RV diastolic collapse.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26080**] was admitted to the medicine floor for bronchoscopy and possible endoluminal laser therapy as he has had maximal XRT to the chest.
Respiratory: He was having small amounts of hemoptysis on admission.
He had a bronchoscopy on [**2136-1-3**] that showed bleeding from the left lower lobe and no endobronchial lesion.
He was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The etiology of his respiratory failure was felt to be mucous plugging vs blood.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2136-1-5**] that showed obstruction of the left lower lobe by old bloody secretions, 50% narrowing of superior LLL secondary to extrinsic compression, extrinsic compression of the lingular segment, patent left lower lobe bronchus.
He was started on levofloxacin for possible post obstruction pneumonia.
NSCLC: No indication for endolumenal therapy.
Cardiac: He has a history of atrial fibrillation and developed multifocal atrial tachycardia on [**2136-1-5**].
He had a echo that showed a pericardial effusion, but no evidence of tamponade.
This may be a malignant pericardial effusion and showed be followed with repeat echos.
He did not have a pulsus paradoxus while he was here.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 25750**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non Small Lung Cancer T4N2 IIIB S/P chemotherapy, radiation S/p left bronchial artery embolization COPD (FEV1 1.24 in [**7-1**]) Intubations x2 GERD Anemia Tachycardia  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your oncologist and pulmonologist.
