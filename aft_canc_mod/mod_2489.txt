He complained of two-week history of jaundice associated with intermittent vague abdominal pain with some constipation.
At [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital patient underwent EGD on [**2128-11-11**] and was found to have gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease.
A recent abdominal ultrasound showed a questionable focal lesion (location not reported).
On [**2128-11-11**] he also underwent an ERCP that revealed common bile duct stricture which was stented with a plastic stent.
Per report patient's bilirubin had been 23.8 on admission to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital and continued to remain elevated after stenting.
He became apneic with heart rates in the 30s, systolic blood pressure to 81, and oxygen saturation to 40% very briefly.
He became agitated en route to the Intensive Care Unit and vomited more brown material.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Esophageal ring.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck:  Supple; jugulovenous pressure at 6 cm at 45 degrees; no bruits; no lymphadenopathy; well healed scar on anterior neck.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1, S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Chest: Bibasilar rhonchi with upper airway congestion, otherwise clear to auscultation.
Abdomen:  Obese; J-P drain at right upper quadrant with 40 cc of serosanguinous fluid; site is clean, dry, and intact without erythema; liver edge palpable at 4 cm below midclavicular costal margin; no palpable splenomegaly or pulsatile mass; soft, nondistended, good bowel sounds.
Derm: Warm, dry, with bilateral palmar erythema.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 104, normal axis, no acute ST-T changes, no prior study available for comparison.
Portable chest x-ray showed the ETT at carina, diffuse patchy infiltrates bilaterally, and no effusions.
Patient with likely aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis.
On day two of ICU admission patient was extubated without difficulty.
Patient's white blood cell count decreased during admission, and an initial fever after intubation to a maximum of 102.2 resolved and patient was afebrile for last eight days of admission.
A biopsy of the common bile duct was done at that time and showed chronic inflammation and no evidence of tumor or mass.
Both PTC and CT of abdomen and MRCP were unrevealing for extrinsic mass.
However, this stricture was concerning for malignancy.
The final pathology indicated a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder.
The cystic duct appeared free of malignancy, but the serosal liver bed showed focal extension of tumor.
There were also scattered foci suspicious for lymphvascular invasion per the report.
The cytology report came back negative for malignant cells.
Patient was seen by the Surgery team headed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who wishes for a wide surgical resection of malignancy that would include a partial liver lobectomy and removal of the ductal system.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] wishes for patient to follow up with him on [**2128-12-10**] to allow his aspiration pneumonia and acute issues to resolve.
It is unclear at the time of this discharge whether the common bile duct stricture is related to the adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder or is simply just inflammation as the pathology precludes.
Pain management:  Patient complained of abdominal pain related to his drain placement.
Patient has a history of narcotic abuse and repeatedly requested minimal narcotics for his pain control; however, these were needed during his admission for relief of pain.
Patient felt good relief and improvement of his pain throughout his admission.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was started on pantoprazole and was on Heparin during his admission for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Patient was ambulating without difficulty and was cleared to go home with services.
