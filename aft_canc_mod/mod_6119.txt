He has recently presented with endoscopic evidence of a progressive duodenal and ampullary adenoma, which is extending up into the inferior bile duct.
It cannot be removed endoscopically and has adenomatous disease has been biopsy proven.
There has been no pancreatic or biliary ductal or duodenal obstruction.
In light of this, he is referred for consideration of elective pancreatoduodenectomy,  The patient states that he was originally diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis back in the [**2138**] to [**2148**] where he underwent a total abdominal colectomy for polyposis syndrome.
He recently sought the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 78664**] at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center for an abdominal pain syndrome that he has been having.

He denies any nausea or vomiting associated with this.
He denies any hematemesis or coffee-ground emesis.
He denies any bright-red blood per rectum or diarrhea.
I do not have the results of the imaging but the endoscopy did show a 1.5 cm polyp at the ampulla.
Past Medical History: His medical history is again significant for a likely diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis and peripheral vascular disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY His past surgical history is significant for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and carotid endarterectomy.
Family History: His family history is significant for his maternal grandfather that was affected with colorectal cancer, mother that was affected with polyposis, brother that was affected with colorectal cancer, 2 daughters that are affected with polyposis, a grandson that is affected with polyposis, a brother that was lost to colorectal cancer and a son that is also affected with polyposis.
There was no jugular venous distention (JVD).
The abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
The extremities have no cyanosis, erythema or edema.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2187-7-5**] 7:37 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-4**], there is little change.
Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic changes.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Vague opacity in the right middle lobe may represent additional atelectasis or pneumonia.
Unremarkable post-operative appearance with no evidence for abscess.
Moderate gastric distension without evidence for obstruction.
Radiology Report ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2187-7-12**] 11:35 AM  IMPRESSION: Paucity of bowel gas, nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
Post-op Pulmonary Edema: He was Triggered for O2 sat 88 on 2L; 60yr h/o smoking, COPD; CXR showed slightly more vascular congestion; EKG essentially normal; ABG NL with O2 in 70s; given nebs, venti mask; and was transferred to the ICU as his cardiac enzymes were rising.
On POD 7, he complained of chest pain and had some EXG changes.
For clinical concerns, a CT was obtained to rule out abscess/leak.
[**7-10**]: CT abd: No evidence for abscess, moderate gastric distension.
He then had emesis on POD 9.
A NGT was placed and put out a large amount of bilious fluid.
He also had some redness and bogginess on his right flank near the drain site.
