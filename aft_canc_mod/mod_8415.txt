Admission Date:  [**2170-3-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-4-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9598**] Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 85 yo woman with h/o lymphoma who presents s/p fall at home.
The patient has reportedly experienced a low grade fever and increased fatigue over the past three days and unsteadiness on her feet.
The event was unwitnessed, she does not recall feeling light headed, having any chest pain or palpitations or blurry vision,hitting her head, any seizure activity, aura or post ictal state or loss of bowel or bladder control.
She has a hx of EBV driven B and T cell proliferation-probably angio-immunoblastic lymphoma and is s/p 6 cycles CHOP completed [**10-16**] currently in remission.
She had presented with LAD in neck in [**2165**] with CT showing multiple lymph nodes and biopsy cervical lymph node showing an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder, highly suggestive of evolving T-cell lymphoma.
Subsequent inguinal biopsy in [**5-16**] was interpreted as either EBV expressing large B cell NHL or angio-immunoblastic lymphoma with an EBV expressing malignant B cell clone.
PET/CT on [**2169-11-14**] showed no evidence of disease.
She had a CT Head and Neck, which did not show any evidence of ICH or fracture.
She had a CXR, which was negative for PNA, CHF, with trace fluid in R fissure, no pleural effusion.
She was initially placed in ED Obs, where she was seen by PT and found to be orthostatic (SBP 140 to 80s).
On floor, patient had a low grade temp to 99.4 and rigoring.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for status post cholecystectomy, status post subarachnoid hemorrhage [**4-/2167**] with no residua, status post appendectomy, hypertension Gerd Hypothyroidism Lymphoma  Social History: The patient lives in a retirement community and continues to be active in all facets of her life.
HEENT - mucous membranes dry, OPC, unable to visualize tympanic membranes [**1-9**] wax, no ear pain with exam, no erythema, swelling externally.
ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs)  SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**4-11**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, gait exam deferred.
Mild interstitial coarsening which could be related to interstitial disease or may be exaggerated due to technique.
No acute intracranial process.
No displaced fracture.
Stable age-related involutional change, small vessel ischemic disease.
Mild paranasal sinus disease.
No acute fracture within the cervical spine.
Mild multilevel degenerative disease.
MRI Head ([**3-25**]) - CONCLUSION: No evidence of intracranial lymphoma.
Two small foci of old hemorrhage in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
Numerous new mediastinal, hilar, axillary, retroperitoneal, intraabdominal, mesenteric, pelvic, and inguinal enlarged abnormal lymph nodes are consistent with recurrent lymphoma.
Wall thickening with surrounding fat stranding of the ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and proximal transverse colon, consistent with colitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Small intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites, new since prior exam.
[**Month/Year (2) **] ([**3-27**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bone Marrow Bx ([**3-28**]) - SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: - HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH ATYPICAL T-CELL DOMINANT LYMPHOID AGGREGATES, SUSPICIOUS FOR BONE MARROW INVOLVEMENT BY T-CELL LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE PROCESS (SEE NOTE)  Bone Marrow Bx Cytogenetics ([**3-28**]) - INTERPRETATION: No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
[**4-1**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process as clinically questioned.
Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
Increased pleural effusions, large on the right and small on the left.
[**2170-4-5**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Bilateral pleural effusions persist.
Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels.
This suggests some underlying elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with left basilar atelectasis.
[**2170-4-11**] RUE Ultrasound: No evidence of DVT  Brief Hospital Course: This is an 85 year old female with hx HTN, lymphoma s/p R-CHOP, SAH in setting of mechanical fall, admitted following unwittnessed non-mechanical fall and found to have recurrent lymphoma.
Syncope: Pt presented s/p fall with loss of consciousness.
0f note she was orthostatic in ER and has had prior episodes which sound vasovagal in nature and it is likely that her vasovagal syncope and orthostasis was secondary to hypovolemia.
Patient noted to have moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] '[**67**].
Pt had mild peripheral edema, with MR [**First Name (Titles) 21782**] [**Last Name (Titles) 34106**] to poor forward flow and syncope, however repeat [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] showed no concerning features to suggest this.
Pt has also had low grade fevers, rigors and fatigue for several days, suggesting possible infection although exam non focal without elevated white count Her urine  cultures showed staph UTI.
Lymphoma: She has a history of EBV driven B and T cell proliferation-probably angio-immunoblastic lymphoma and is s/p 6 cycles R-CHOP concluding [**10-16**] with PET in [**11-15**] showing no evidence active disease.
Her presentation was discussed with her hematologist/oncologist who concluded that her rigors, fevers and fatigue was also strongly suggestive of  B sypmtoms due to lymphoma recurrence.
Patient also had cervical, inguinal, and axillary lymphadenopathy.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed lymphoma recurrence.
However, she developed altered mental status and severe hyponatremia and chemotherapy was ultimately deferred due to her poor functional status.
Initial concern was HIT as patient had a pre-test probability that was intermediate based on her 4T score.
A HIT antibody was sent with a mildly positive result (Optic Density of 0.44) This was repeated and was negative.
A bone marrow biopsy showed involvement of lymphoma in her bone marrow and it was ultimately felt that she had bone marrow suppression and thrombocytopenia from lymphoma.
Atrial Fibrillation: New onset during this hospitalization with rates in the 140s.
She was monitored on telemetry and was noted to be in and out of atrial fibrillation.
She was continued on ASA 81 mg but was not further anticoagulated due to thrombocytopenia.
Hyponatremia: While on the oncology service, the patient developed mental status changes with associated hyponatremia.
Her sodium improved with hypertonic saline.
She had hypotension, however, and was therefore unable to tolerate the lasix.
Urine sodium decreased, suggesting improvement of her underlying SIADH.
SIADH may be [**1-9**] oncologic process or respiratory infection.
Her delirium improved with hypertonic saline administration in the ICU but she remained mild delirious, felt to be due to resolving ICU delirium, UTI effect, bronchitis effect, or hyponatremia effect.
Sputum cultures failed to reveal a bacteria and she remained afebrile.
HTN: She remained normotensive however given concern for infection and potential to decompensate to septic physiology, her diovan was initially held.
While in the ICU, after being started on [**Hospital1 **] lasix, the patient had some problems with hypotension.
Anemia: She had a normocytic anemia likely secondary to disease progression in her marrow and anemia of chronic disease.
UTIs: Initially found to have a Klebsiella UTI, for which she completed a 5 day course of ciprofloxacin.
She was later found to have an MRSA UTI, for which she completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 100913**] House  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma  Secondary Diagnoses: Hyponatremia Altered Mental Status due to Urinary Tract Infection Urinary Tract Infection Bronchitis Hypothyroidism Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were also spiking fevers and were found to have recurrence of your lymphoma.
However, you developed altered mental status and low sodium.
You were transferred to the ICU temporarily due to your low sodium level.
