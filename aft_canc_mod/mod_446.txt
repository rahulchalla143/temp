# Multifocal pneumonia: Etiology is most likely community-acquired pneumonia.
Given the possible alcohol use, aspiration pneumonia considered to be possible.
Patient does potentially have TB exposure risk from outreach program with other veterans.
In addition, since he does not have a spleen, need to have clinical suspicion for infection with encapsulated organism.
The hypercarbia that he initially had in the ED was likely due to decreased respiratory rate  due to somnolence, which was likely from combination of alcohol and methadone use.
However, as clinical suspicion for MRSA PNA was low, vanco was discontinued.
Pt refused pneumonvax vaccination.
Respiratory viral screen did not have sufficient sample, but viral culture was also sent (still pending).
