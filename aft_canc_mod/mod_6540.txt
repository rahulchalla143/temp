[**2149-10-30**] Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 72-year-old male with h/o HTN, CAD s/p 3 stents in [**2143**], hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and neurofibromatosis who presented from OSH for cardiac catheterization.
He stated that the pain was [**6-29**], substernal, non-radiating, and relieved after 15 minutes by SL NTG.
ECG performed at the time showed signs of ischemia, and the patient was found to have a NSTEMI with a Troponin I of 24.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on the day before admission, where they found a 70% in-stent restenosis of LCX, a ostial LAD lesion that was very difficult to lay out, 50% left main disease and an occluded RCA with left to right collaterals.
The patient was angiosealed and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for IVUS and pressure wire of the Left Main.
Of note, the patient also has a history of left arm weakness in [**2149-7-21**], which was thought to be a cryptogenic TIA vs a stroke due to a small PFO.
On review of systems, the patient denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
