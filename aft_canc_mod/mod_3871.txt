On POD #1, patient received 2 units of pRBCs for low HCT and persistent hypotension.
By POD #2, patient had progressive respiratory decomensation, and could not be extubated.
Sputum cultures would ultimately grow out pan sensitive klebsiella, and the patient was switched to levofloxacin.
Starting on POD #7, patient had to sedated and paralyzed for agitation and poor oxygenation.
