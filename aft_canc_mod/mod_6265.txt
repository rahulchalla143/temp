Chest X-ray [**2105-12-4**]: Large right hilar mass consistent with the known neoplasm, along with post-obstructive pneumonic consolidation in the right lower lobe.
Small bibasal effusions are present .
Worsening disease in the right lung with enlarging tumor causing new marked narrowing and obstruction of multiple right bronchi, as well as multiple enlarging mediastinal lymph nodes.
New ground glass and more consolidative opacities in the right upper lobe, right lower lobe, and to a lesser degree left lower lobe that suggest postobstructive multifocal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 8840**] was admitted with shortness of breath.
She had a chest x-ray which showed a large right hilar mass and a post-obstructive pneumonia.
She was weaned off the Levophed on arrival to the MICU and did not require additional pressors for hypotension throughout her course.
She alternated between bipap and a non-rebreather face mask for oxygenation.
Her primary oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended a repeat chest CT, radiation oncology consult and IP consult for possible symptom relief.
Radiation oncology was consulted and stated that additional radiation would not be likely to improve her symptoms and could make her temporarily worse.
She had also received prior mediastinal radiation for her Hodgkin's disease in the past.
Her pulmonologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] for additional assistance.
On admission, she had elevated cardiac enzymes which peaked at 0.21.
This was believed to be demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis.
She did not complain of chest pain during this admission.
She had acute renal failure on admission with a creatinine of 1.7 which improved to her baseline of 0.8 with IV fluids and was felt to be related to dehydration.
Ms. [**Known lastname 8840**] continued to receive antibiotics, steroids and nebs to treat her symptoms.
Palliative care was consulted and saw this patient for several days.
