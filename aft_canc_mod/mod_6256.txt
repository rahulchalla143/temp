?Abscess in right frontal area   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p drainage of right frontal abscess  History of Present Illness: Patient is an 86 year-old right-handed woman with a past medical history of mild dementia, coronary artery disease status post CABG [**2104**], hepatitis C, left frontal meningioma, and newly diagnosed metastatic lung cancer.
She was recently admitted to the neurosurgery service and underwent 3rd ventriculostomy and extensive evaluation for her new brain masses.
It was determined during her previous inpatient stay that surgical resection of the associated lesions was not indicated given the location of the lesions and surgical risk on the patient with regard to her age, and other comorbid conditions.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG [**2104**] 2.
Early Alzheimer's disease 3.
Left frontal meningioma 5.  s/p 3rd ventriculostomy   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY:  Widowed.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2 2  2  2 Left      2 2 2  2  2  Toes upgoing bilaterally   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**8-17**]: Final Report  FINDINGS: The right frontal postoperative hematoma has evolved, decreasing in size and is isointense to the brain parenchyma.
A single locule of air remains.
There is residual vasogenic edema within the right frontal lobe.
No new foci of hemorrhage are seen.
There is no significant midline shift or change in ventricular size or configuration.
The calcified left frontal mass as well as hyperdense cerebellar lesions are unchanged with continued mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Evolving hematoma in the right frontal lobe, markedly decreased in size.
Stable size of hyperdense/calcified left frontal and cerebellar masses.
MRI Brain with and without contrast [**8-13**]:  Final Report FINDINGS: Again seen is an air and fluid collection within the right frontal lobe measuring 43 x 29 mm with a thin rim of peripheral enhancement.
On DWI, there is slow diffusion.
The findings are most consistent with abscess along the prior ventriculostomy site.
The dominant left cerebellar lesion with a heterogeneous pattern and minimal capsular enhancement has mildly increased measuring 43 x 33 mm (previously 35 x 29 mm).
The lesion now extends to the cerebellar vermis and causes increased mass effect on the fourth ventricle and cerebellar pontine angle.
The 15-mm right cerebellar lesion has not appreciably increased in size.
The enhancing left parietal lesion is not appreciably changed in size.
Post-surgical changes are noted within the right frontal region.
There is no appreciable change in the ventricular configuration.
Mild increase in size of right frontal fluid and air collection with signal characteristics most consistent with an abscess.
Slight interval growth in heterogeneous left cerebellar mass.
This is concerning for metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted after having a seizure and mental status changes from rehab.
She had previously had a 3rd ventriculostomy from which her sutures were supposed to have been removed between [**7-22**] and [**2142-7-27**].
She went to the OR for drainage of the abscess on [**2142-8-13**] and as soon as the sutures were removed a large amount of purulent drainage came out.
ID was consulted for the abscess and the patient received vancomycin per their recommendations.
She also received aztreonam but had a rash from it so it was stopped on [**8-16**].
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: right frontal brain abscess  Discharge Condition: neurologically improving  Discharge Instructions: DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CRANIOTOMY/HEAD INJURY  -You should have your dilantin level checked upon arrival to rehab and it should be checked weekly.
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
