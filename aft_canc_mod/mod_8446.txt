Patient recently returned from [**Country **] on the [**7-27**] and has been having diarrhea and abdominal cramps.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Sensation: Intact to light touch  Toes: Upgoing left  Handedness  Right  Upon discharge: Awake, alert, oriented, slight left pronator, LUE weakness -[**4-16**] otherwise full  Pertinent Results: CT Head [**3-28**] There is an area of mixed density with surrounding vasogenic edema extending from the right frontal cortex into the right basal ganglia and right insula, with 11 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures and possible uncal herniation and narrowing of the right perimesencephalic cisterns.
Differential diagnosis includes brain neoplasm, however other entities cannot be completely excluded.
Heterogeneously enhancing lesion identified on the right operculum, with significant enhancement and areas of necrosis, consistent with a primary brain neoplasm vs. metastasis.
There is mass effect and shifting of the normally midline structures with transfalcine herniation and approximately 10 mm of shifting.
No concerning thoracic lesions.
Sigmoid diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.
No evidence of abdominal or pelvic malignancy.
CT head [**3-28**] IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of a large right frontal mixed attenuating mass.
No new mass effect is seen since the 2:10 a.m. examination  MRI brain with and without contrast [**3-29**]: Right frontal lobe mass again identified for surgical planning with surface markers.
CT head [**3-29**] postop: Status post right frontal mass resection and post-right craniotomy changes with expected subcutaneous pneumocephalus with minimal fluid and blood products in the surgical bed; right hemispheric sulcal effacement and 8 mm of right to left midline shift.
There is no significant change in mass effect seen.
There is no hydrocephalus seen.
No acute infarcts are identified.
CT head [**4-1**] postop: IMPRESSION: Status post right frontal craniotomy with expected subcutaneous gas and pneumocephalus; resection cavity consists of fluid, gas locules and blood products, but no acute extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
Post-surgical changes in the right frontal region and in the right frontal lobe with blood products and fluid levels along with areas of enhancement in the periphery and on the medial aspect.
Surrounding vasogenic edema has significantly increased compared to the prior study with increase in the leftward shift of midline structures.
There are also areas of increased signal intensity noted in the right thalamus which may relate to a component of reactive edema.
Assessment for residual tumor is limited on the present study and the immediate post-surgical changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-28**] and was admitted after she was found to have a large right frontal brain lesion.
She was planned for the OR later in the week however she became lethargic and required mannitol so her case was moved up and she went to the operating room on [**3-29**] for right sided craniotomy for removal of the lesion.
Her postoperative Head CT demonstrated expected changes without hemorrhage.
MRI demonstrated moderate residual tumor and she was transferred to the regular floor in good condition.
Postop Head CT was negative for hemorrhage.
Post op MRI was performed and revealed post operative changes.
9. diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal brain lesion   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
