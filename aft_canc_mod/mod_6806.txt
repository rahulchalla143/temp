S/U tox negative.
CXR neg for an acute process.
Abd u/s with portal vein thrombosis and cirrhotic liver.
Heme saw pt for erythrocytosis and phlebotomized one unit from pt.

Trace amount of pericholecystic fluid and hepatic dome ascites.
Diffusely heterogeneous and coarsened liver echotexture with nodular external contour, likely related to underlying cirrhosis.
No focal underlying intrahepatic masses were identified.
A biopsy may be of benefit for pathologic evaluation.

Liver failure: On admission, the ultrasound demonstrated that the patient's liver was diffusely heterogeneous with no discreet mass.
The differential diagnosis was broad, including infectious disease, autoimmune disease, and inherited disorders, such as hemosiderosis, which was strongly considered given the positive family history.
Iron studies were suggestive of hemochromatosis and hemochromatosis gene analysis was positive for a homozygous C282Y mutation.
An abdominal MRI demonstrated background hemosiderosis, a large left lobe liver mass compatible with hepatoma invading left portal vein with left portal vein thrombosis, and additional multifocal areas of signal abnormality scattered throughout both lobes of liver compatible with multifocal hepatoma.
It was felt that the patient had developed cirrhosis secondary to hemochromatosis and in turn developed malignant transformation.
erythrocytosis: The differential diagnosis included polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] vs. epo producing neoplasm such as hepatocellular carcinoma.
The patient had an elevated epo level and evidence of HCC as above.
The patient was felt to have hepatorenal syndrome.
portal vein thrombus: Felt to likely be associated with HCC.
hypertension: The patient's home medications were held given his borderline blood pressures throughout the admission.
He was given dextrose IV as needed for hypoglycemia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: liver failure, suspected hepatocellular carcinoma hepatorenal syndrome erythrocytosis   Discharge Condition: The patient is comfortable.
