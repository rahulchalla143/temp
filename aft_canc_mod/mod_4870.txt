Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC Placement CVL placement Tongue Biopsy Lingular artery embolization Intubation Bone Marrow Biopsy Skin biopsy  History of Present Illness: 25 yo man with hypoplastic MDS, transfusion-dependent chronic pancytopenia, chronic mouth sores, and h/o peri-rectal abscess, who presents with 2 days of right-sided neck pain.
He was seen in the outpatient clinic today and was noted to have a fever to 100.3 and pancytopenia, so he is being admitted for transfusions as well as further evaluation of his neck pain out of concern for an abscess.
He denies any subjective fevers or chills, tooth pain, or dysphagia.
No SOB or difficulty breathing.
He denies any peri-rectal pain and states that the abscess has completely healed.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2136-11-15**] demonstrated a hypocellular marrow with cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13).

[**2137-4-14**] CT Neck W/Contrast: Status post lower teeth removal without evidence of surrounding abscess or bony lytic lesion; prominent right cervical lymph nodes, although none meet pathologic size criteria; no evidence of abscess.
[**2137-4-20**] CT Neck W/Contrast: There are no fluid collections concerning for abscess formation.
There are multiple prominent cervical chain lymph nodes demonstrated bilaterally, the largest demonstrated as a level 2 lymph node (series 2: image 28) measuring up to 7 mm in short axis.
There is no periapical lucency.
There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions within the visualized osseous structures.
Prominent cervical chain lymph nodes bilaterally by quantity, though none meet pathologic size criteria.
[**2137-4-21**] MRI OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Arising 2 cm above the anal verge, there is an enhancing fistulous tract which begins at the 1 o'clock position and travels in the intersphincteric space, draining into the left perineum (5:24 through 27 and 4:42-45).
At the 12 o'clock position, at the level of the origin of the fistulous tract, there is an additional 5-mm peripherally enhancing focus within the intersphincteric space which extends slightly inferiorly and may represent a tiny abscess or a small sinus tract (702:22).
There is associated enhancing inflammatory tissue within the left perineum measuring 2.2 x 1.3 cm.
There is no drainable abscess.
There are no abnormal or enhancing lymph nodes within the pelvis.
There are several T1 hypointense bony abnormalities within midline sacrum, left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], and the right acetabulum, all of which demonstrate mild enhancement and are likely related to the patient's myelodysplastic syndrome.
Intersphincteric fistula extending from 1 o'clock, 2 cm above the anal verge to the left perineum.
Additional tiny 5 mm enhancing focus in the intersphincteric space may represent a tiny abscess or small sinus tract.
Associated inflammatory tissue in the left perineum.
Several enhancing T2 hypointense lesions within the bony pelvis, likely related to the patient's myelodysplastic syndrome.
MRI head FINDINGS: There have been no significant changes since the prior study.
The diffusion study is of limited quality due to artifacts.
However, there are no findings  to suggest acute infarction.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or masses.
Focal tissue loss in the body of the left caudate nucleus as discussed above.
No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
MR neck IMPRESSION: The previous region of mass-like enhancement of the right tongue base is significantly reduced in size consistent with the history of surgical resection.
There remains diffuse enhancement of the right tongue base which is nonspecific and may be postoperative, inflammatory or infectious in origin.
There is one focus of non-enhancement of the right tongue base measuring 7 mm in greatest dimension which may represent residual necrosis or variation of enhancement, not likely a fluid collection.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A linear echodensity is seen in juxtaposition to the right atrium/right ventricle, most likely representing acoustic artifact emanating from the PICC line.
MRI neck [**7-18**] IMPRESSION: Persistent post-operative changes of the base of tongue with no suspicious interval change to suggest recurrent infection.
GI biopsies Gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies: A.  Stomach, body: Fundic mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
B.  Stomach, antrum: Antral mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
C.  Duodenum: Duodenal mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Brief Hospital Course: *BMT COURSE ([**2137-6-3**] - [**2137-8-8**])  25 yo man with hypoplastic MDS, transfusion-dependent chronic pancytopenia, chronic mouth sores, and h/o peri-rectal abscess, who presented with fever and right-sided neck pain.
# Hypoplastic MDS: The patient presented with neutropenic fever.
Exam was significant for sore on the R inner lip mucosa.
Tenderness in the anterior cervical lymph chain, and continued presence of tender peri-rectal lesion (now closed).
Initial negative including a chest x-ray and CT of the neck with contrast showed no evidence of infection.
Thorough ID work-up including CMV VL, monospot, EBV PCR, Bartonella serologies, Toxoplasma serologies, throat culture for GAS and Arcanobacterium, R lip wound culture, respiratory viral culture, beta-glucan, galactomannan, were all negative.
He continued to spike fevers and received micafungin for fluconazole resistant candidal esophagitis.
An EGD showed no evidence of esophagitis.
An MRI of the pelvis showed an intersphincteric fistula extending from 1 o'clock, 2 cm above the anal verge to the left perineum and an additional tiny 5 mm enhancing focus in the intersphincteric space which may represent a tiny abscess or small sinus tract.
He was found to have a tongue mass.
While intubted he underwent tongue biopsy and right lingular artery embolization.
The bleeding ceased and he was found to have a tongue mucor infection on pathology.
He remained afebrile on Ambisome and Meropenem.
Meropenem and vancomycin were also discontinued on [**7-18**] given ANC and adequate period of coverage for VRE bacteremia that was diagnosed on [**2137-7-2**].
He spiked a low grade temp 100.6 on [**7-19**] w c/o dysuria and mild nausea.
Chest xray was negative for pna and showed atelectasis.
Chest xray was notable for atelectasis and pt used incentive spirometer.
He was started on [**Hospital1 **] compazine with relief of his nausea and vomiting.
He continued to have loose stool <500cc/day.
On [**8-5**] he developed low grade temps and was found to have a positive CMV viral load at 2900 (repeat VL was 3490).
BK viral load returned significantly elevated (above threshold).
He will be seen daily in the oncology clinic for ambisome, tacrolimus and tranfusion requirements immediately after discharge.
Given uptrend of LFTs and stable evaluation of mucor, the posaconazole was discontinued (as well as other broad spectrum abx) given non-neutropenic status.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome/pancytopenia: The patient was transfused as needed to keep Hct>24 and platelets>20.
Was found to have cord match after siblings refused to be biopsied because of religous reasons, underwent cord BMT on [**2137-6-24**].
# Transaminitis: Patient has a h/o intermittent transaminitis which has been evaluated by hepatology.
Possibly secondary to iron overload from from numerous transfusions.
*ICU COURSE* Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after ENT removal of pedunculated and bleeding tongue mass.
Pt has had post-operative laryngeal edema in past requiring steroids.
# Oral mass: The patient underwent excision of a mass at the base of his tongue by ENT that was diagnosed as mucor.
He was continued on broad antimicrobials (Zosyn, Flagyl, Bactrim, Ambisome, Acyclovir) and his pathology from the neck was consistent with fungal forms.
# MDS: The patient remains pancytopenic and is transfusion dependent.
# Transaminitis: Patient has a h/o intermittent transaminitis which has been evaluated by hepatology.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**Date range (1) 72430**]: Code Blue was called for hypotension and respiratory distress in the setting of acute large volume blood loss from his mouth and nose.
He was also started on Levophed for pressure support.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] for IR embolization of the culprit bleeding vessel.
MICU [**Location (un) **] [**5-24**]- [**6-3**]: Pt had lingual artery embolized and maintained on intubation with oropharynx packed.
[**5-29**] rigid bronch in OR which showed only mucus and clot which was suctioned and clear lower airways.
Also friable mucosa with clot (non-obstructing) in post oropharynx.
Zosyn was discontinued early in MICU course for a question of allergic reaction of erythematous [**Doctor Last Name **], blanching skin rash.
[**6-3**] MRI brain showed no evidence of stroke and mental status noted to be much improved.
# MUCORMYCOSIS/OP BLEED:  Patient s/p exision of basilar tongue mass which grew mucor on culture, with subsequent large tongue bleed requiring coiling.
Also on posiconazole which cannot be given without fatty enteral diet, so will need a NGT/dobhoff.
ID will request MRI of [**Last Name (un) **] pharynx next week to assess progress of mucor treatment.
His head MRI did not show evidence of anoxic brain injury .
# DESATURATIONS:  decreasing 02 requirements .
# NEUTROPENIC FEVER:  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever, though temps continue to run in 99s.
# RASH: Has resolved, suspecting likely drug rash from ?zosyn.
# MDS: Patient is transfusion dependent with hypoplastic MDS.
You were admitted to the hospital with fever and neck pain.
Your white count was abnormally low and you were found to have a condition called Myelodysplastic Syndrome.
Your neck pain was found to be caused by a fungal infection called mucor.
