Worsening of appearances with high-grade small bowel obstruction with transition point within the right lower quadrant and collapsed small bowel proximal and distal to the ileostomy.
Increase in intra-abdominal ascites.
No free air.
New bilateral pleural effusions and overlying atelectasis.
Stable subcutaneous edema within the tissues bilaterally.
High-grade small bowel obstruction with transition point likely in the right lower quadrant with decompressed terminal ileum and end ileostomy.
Small volume free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.
No evidence for spillage of orally administered material into the peritoneal cavity; however, oral contrast has not transited through all loops of small bowel.
Fluid in the deep posterior pelvis anterior to the coccyx likley within a dilated loop of bowel; however, differentiation between a dilated loop of bowel and a pelvic fluid collection is difficult.
Bilateral pleural effusions, increased.
Bibasilar ground-glass changes concerning for infection.
Status post cholecystectomy with persistent CBD and left biliary duct dilation.
CXR: [**3-24**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive bilateral pulmonary edema is unchanged in extent and severity.
Also unchanged are bilateral small pleural effusions as well as moderate cardiomegaly.

[**Last Name (STitle) 1007**], and the chronic pain service.
While the patient has a long history of chronic abdominal pain, she and her husband stated that this pain was as bad as it had ever been and her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 18142**].
The physical exam and CT findings were concerning for a small bowel obstruction.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had an extensive discussion with the patient and her husband of the risks and benefits of surgery, particularly in light of her extensive surgical history.
Because the CT demonstrated a fairly distal transition point, it was decided to insert an endoscope through the ileostomy in an attempt to decompress the obstruction.
Prior to being taken to the operating room, an epidural was placed for pain control.
No mucosal ischemia was noted.
The ileostomy produced 150cc of serous output with minimal gas throughout the first postprocedure day.
The epidural ceased to function and the patient was transitioned to a Dilaudid PCA with good pain control.
She did require IV fluid bolus for intravascular dehydration as evidenced by low urine output.
Over the course of the next day ileostomy output remained very low and the patient's pain increased throughout the day as did her abdominal distension.
Early on POD#3 a CT scan was obtained that demonstrated worsening small bowel dilitation with peristence of the previously identified transition point; small bilateral pleural effusions; and new perihepatic ascites.
An internal hernia was identified and the source of obstruction repaired.
A chest X-ray demonstrated bibasilar effusions/atelectasis as previously seen on CT.  On HD 7, her epidural was removed.
She has episodes of confusion and blood cultures, urinalysis, chest x ray were obtained.
A chest xray showed pulmonary edema and her breathing improved with lasix.
On HD 9, her wound began to have purulent, foul-smelling drainage.
ID was consulted due to her multiple antibiotic allergies and recommended daptomycin and flagyl in addition to the levafloxacin for broad coverage.
on HD 10, her staples were dc'd and wound opened to be packed with dry gauze.
She received additional lasix for low O2 sats due to pulmonary edema.
Overnight, she started to have stool-appearing output from her wound.
On HD 11 she underwent a CT scan that showed obstruction but no obvious leak or abscess.
On HD 12, she continued to be agitated and desat'd to low 80s when off oxygen.
CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema/opacification and she had increased work of breathing.
She became agitated intermittently and was given haldol and ativan.
A wound VAC was placed.
On [**2120-4-6**] she had a follow-up CT scan, which showed a persistent 3 cm pelvic fluid collection.
She also had some nausea/vomiting and her WBC count increased to 16 so TF were held for a day.
She was started on abx and her WBC count then decreased and any residual abdominal pain resolved.
