Admission Date:  [**2134-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-5-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Prednisone / Cortisone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: transfer for episode of neurologic deficit  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: placement of right carotid stent  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83yo gentleman with h/o CAD, "ischemic and valvular" cardiomyopathy with EF 15-20%, s/p BiV pacer without ICD, paroxysmal AFib not on coumadin admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with subacute left-sided weakness and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after episode of transient L upper extremity weakness and dysarthria after using the commode.
On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 **], he experienced transient dysarthria and left arm weakness after using the commode.
His initial event was felt to be vagally mediated, and the neurology service was further investigating whether the patient would benefit from intervention of his known carotid artery stenosis.
During the patient's work-up, he had a similar episode on [**5-26**] when he was on the commode and developed transient left-sided weakness, at which point it was decided to pursue carotid stent.

Upon arrival to the CCU, EKG demonstrated regular wide complex tachycardia with LBBB pattern, no visible pacing spikes.
EKG from [**2-/2130**] (prior to PPM) demonstrates LBBB with same morphology.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: Regular wide complex tachycardia at about 100.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with trivial regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Severe left ventricular hypokinesis.
Mild right ventricular hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2131-3-16**], the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is lower.
Of note, it extends fairly distally in the internal carotid artery and somewhat tortuous vessel.
The peak systolic over diastolic velocity in the ICA is 550/195.
In addition, it is fairly distal in the internal carotid artery and somewhat tortuous vessel.
CT Head without contrast [**2134-5-25**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved without evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted on the carotid siphons.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
The previously seen elevated velocities are not seen today, but the distal internal carotid artery waveform is quite dampened beyond this area of calcification.
Marked atherosclerotic calcification involving the aortic arch, great vessels, and carotid arteries which are suboptimally evaluated without IV contrast.
Apparent severe stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.
Severe panlobular emphysema.
Carotid series [**2134-5-26**]: Successful imaging of the elevated velocities seen previously in the right internal carotid artery.
Extremely elevated velocities consistent with high-grade 80-99% stenosis in the distal right ICA.
Thoracic aorta: Aortagraphy revealed a Type II arch without critical lesions.
The ICA has heavy calcification with serial 80 and 90% lesions in the proximal and mid segments.
Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no residual stenosis.
No neurological sighns or symptoms at end of procedure.
Severe stenosis of right ICA with heavy calcification 2.
Resting hemodynamics on dopamine 12 mcg/kg/min demonstrated initial right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP 5 mm Hg, PCW mean 7 mm Hg), with markedly decreased pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation of 33% and a depressed cardiac index of 1.64 l/min/m2.
After further administration of 250 cc 0.9% saline (total 500 cc), there was marked abnormal elevation of pulmonary pressure (mean 36 mm Hg) and PCWP (mean 22 mm Hg), and a decrease in the cardiac index to 2.01 l/min/m2.
Decreased LV and RV filling pressures consistent with hypovolemia.
Specifically, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.
Renal Ultrasound [**2134-5-28**]: No hydronephrosis and no cysts or solid masses identified.
Multiple non-obstructing small renal stones.
There is streaky opacity seen at the left base which may represent atelectasis or early infiltrate.
Attention to this area is recommended on subsequent examinations to exclude underlying infiltrate.
There is again seen some vague density at the left CP angle, which may be secondary to atelectasis or early infiltrate, but again this is unchanged from prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 83yo gentleman with h/o CAD, chronic systolic heart failure with EF 15%, AFib not on coumadin, s/p PPM admitted with recurrent episodes of transient neurological deficits.
Patient's episodes were felt to be due to his significant carotid stenosis.
The CCU team placed a Swan Ganz catheter to assist with management given the difficulty of clinically assessing his volume status given his severely depressed systolic function and underlying pulmonary disease.
Swan ganz demonstrated that the patient was dehydrated and he was given fluids for volume resuscitation.
He was also put on broad spectrum antibiotics in case he was developing sepsis with hypotension.
Dopamine was weaned, but the patient developed acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.
Renal was consulted and felt that the patient would likely require hemodialysis if his renal function did not improve soon.
He developed uremic symptoms and expired on [**2134-5-31**] with his family at the bedside.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p PPM: Digoxin was held given recently elevated levels, but digoxin levels trended up in the setting of his heart failure.
Although pt had wide complex tachycardia on presentation, his baseline EKGs prior to PPM placement demonstrated LBBB.
He was felt to be in sinus tachycardia with aberrant conduction.
# Chronic BOOP: Prednisone was stopped after discussing the matter with his pulmonologist.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: Patient's oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] made aware of patient's admission and death.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine  # Code:  DNR/DNI  # Communication: with son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31460**]  Patient expired on [**2134-5-31**] with his family at the bedside.
