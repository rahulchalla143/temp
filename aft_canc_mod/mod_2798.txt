The patient reports fatigue and anorexia since previous admission with decreased taste sensation.
On review of systems, he denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, SOB, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, abdominal pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling.
He reports anxiety and fear entering transplant, but he has accepted that it is the next step in his therapy and he is ready.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia (diet controlled) S/p tonsillectomy CLL (see below) .
Past Oncologic History (Per [**Hospital **] Clinic Note): Pt presented with his disease back in [**10/2119**] with an elevated white count and LDH.
He did have some bulky lymphadenopathy.
Over the course of six months, his white count began to rise and essentially doubled to approximately 130,000 with a rising in his LDH of up to 1400, and he also was noted to have worsening palpable lymphadenopathy.
He then presented in [**7-/2122**] with a rising white count, approximately 50% lymphocytes, and a mildly elevated LDH.
He also had some mild worsening palpable lymphadenopathy.
He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy.
This, however, ultimately was cut short on [**2123-7-7**] due to question of an infection versus PE for which he was ruled out.
He again had normalization of his white count and also no longer had any lymphocytosis.
He then eventually had developed an enlarging left cervical node which was biopsied and was found to have [**Doctor Last Name **] transformation.
Reinitiated therapy due to [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation with [**Hospital1 **] treatment (Continuous infusion of etoposide, Adriamycin, and Vincristine on days [**11-21**], Oral prednisone on days [**11-22**], and Cytoxan on day 5) in 02/[**2123**].

[**2124-7-21**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-12**], there is a slightly better inspiration with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and widening of the mediastinum due to extensive mediastinal lipomatosis.
Lungs are clear and there is no vascular congestion.
[**2124-7-19**] Doppler u/s abdomen FINDINGS: Transabdominal ultrasound with Doppler demonstrates patent hepatic veins including the right middle and left hepatic veins.
No thrombus is seen.
Patient evaluation is limited due to patient's inability to breath-hold.
Moderate ascites throughout the abdomen, unchanged from prior study.
Hepatic veins are patent with appropriate direction of flow with no thrombus seen.
[**2124-7-18**] CT abdomen pelvis   FINDINGS: The lung bases demonstrate increased atelectasis when compared to prior study of [**2124-5-11**].

There is no mass effect or midline shift.
The remaining images are limited by motion demonstrate no obvious midline shift or hydrocephalus.
There are no obvious areas of enhancement seen on motion limited axial images but evaluation is limited.
Subtle areas of high signal on both basal ganglia region on post-gadolinium axial images are artifactual from pulsation artifacts.
Diffusion images which are adequate for interpretation demonstrate no acute infarct.
Other images, which are limited demonstrate no obvious abnormalities, but for better evaluation if clinically indicated, a repeat study can be obtained with sedation.
The vein is distended with echogenic clot and demonstrates absence of flow and compressibility.
The axillary vein is now only partially thrombosed, with minimal flow seen around the echogenic clot.
There is partial compressibility.
One of the paired brachial veins remains thrombosed with echogenic clot distending the lumen and absence of flow and compressibility.
The cephalic vein remains completely thrombosed without compressibility or flow.
Interval improvement in degree of the right upper extremity thrombosis, now with only partial clot in the right axillary vein, and flow in the basilic vein.
Persistent thrombosis of the superficial veins of the right upper extremity, with thrombosis of one of the paired brachial veins and the axillary vein.

INTERPRETATION   Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts or sample preparation.
[**2124-7-20**] FLOW CYTOMETRY ASCITES FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 38, 45.
INTERPRETATION  Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts or sample preparation.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Skin, right forearm, biopsy (A-B):  Interface and superficial perivascular dermatitis with marked dyskeratosis, dermal melanophages, and extravasated erythrocytes, see note.
Skin, left upper back, biopsy (C):  Interface and superficial perivascular dermatitis with marked dyskeratosis, dermal melanophages, and extravasated erythrocytes, see note.
The crystalline material is morphologically consistent with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), which is reported to be associated with gastrointestinal tract ulcers.
Reactive atypia is noted within the granulation tissue, however, no definite viral inclusions are identified.
Severe acute graft versus host disease cannot be excluded based on the morphologic findings.
[**2124-3-30**] - PATHOLOGY - GI BIOPSIES (2 JARS) DIAGNOSIS: Colonic mucosa biopsies, two: A.  Sigmoid: Colonic mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
B.  Rectum: Colonic mucosa with rare crypt cell apoptosis, see note.
[**2124-4-12**] - PATHOLOGY - Skin, abdomen: - Interface dermatitis with dyskeratotic keratinocytes, and mild superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with graft versus host disease, see note.
Note: The histological differential diagnosis includes a reaction to drugs.
The current specimen shows lymphocyte-keratinocyte satellitosis and marked apoptic bodies at the interface level, and no eosinophilia is noted.
The keratinocytic dyskeratosis is predominantly seen at the basal keratinocytes level, and no dermal edema is seen.
Overall, a diagnosis of graft versus host disease (GVHD) is favored, if compatible with the clinical presentation.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male with history of CLL with large cell transformation who was admitted for a scheduled allogeneic MUD SCT on [**2124-3-10**].
His course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and acute GVHD involving the intestinal tract, liver and skin.
He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] in stable condition with symptomatic improvement.
The patient underwent a Busulfan/Cytoxan conditioning regimen which did not cause neutropenia and he tolerated it with only mild diarrhea.
His initial transplant proceeded without incident.
Methotrexate was given per protocol on Days +1, and then again on Day +7 (delayed due to concern of transaminitis - see below), and day +11.
Fungal prophylaxis was switched micafungin while the patient had fever & neutropenia.
# Acute GVHD - The patient course was complicated by acute GVHD which started as a blanching rash on [**3-20**].
The patient was treated empirically for GVHD with steroids, which improved his rash, but when the steroids were tapered the patient developed severe watery diarrhea, up to 2L a day at times.
The gastroenterology service was consulted and on [**3-30**] the patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy.
Biopsies of the sigmoid and rectum were non-diagnostic but consistent with GVHD.
Stool cultures for bacterial and viral pathogens and for C. diff were negative.
The steroids were again tapered as the patient's diarrhea improved, however, the patient developed a morbilliform rash and his diarrhea worsened.
Dermatology biopsied the rash, and the pathology was consistent with GVHD.
His skin rash evolved into desquamation and bullae and his diarrhea symptoms flared when steroids doses were tapered.
He also developed liver involvement with GVHD.
After his second dose of remicade, his symptoms improved and a very slow steroid taper was reattempted.
Derm took a biopsy which showed results consistent with GVHD and unlikely for drug reaction.
# Fevers and neutropenia - The patient developed fevers in the setting of neutropenia post transplant on [**3-13**] and was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage.
# VRE bacteremia - The patient developed bloody diarrhea and underwent colonoscopy for evaluation ([**5-18**]).
The following evening the patient developed a fever to 102 and blood cultures grew VRE bacteremia.
# Fevers - The patient again became febrile on [**5-31**].
He had no symptoms and his vital signs remained stable.
# HHV6 infection:  The patient spiked a fever [**3-27**] when he was no longer neutropenic and he developed a splotchy and evanescent rash, which disappeared within 24 hours.
A serum HHV6 viral load was eventually positive, and HHV6 was felt to be the likely cause of the patient?????
# Strept Milleri Bacteremia: On [**4-15**] blood cultures were drawn as the patient appeared unwell and had borderline low blood pressures.
The patient was not neutropenic at this time.
Blood cultures eventually grew Strep milleri.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
# BK virus: In early [**Month (only) **], while the patient was on multiple immunosuppressant medications for GVHD, he developed dysuria, difficulty voiding and hematuria.
There was initially concern about urinary retention; however, once the foley was placed the patient only had a small amount drained from the bladder.
The patient suffered from painful bladder spasms as a result of his BK virus.
ID was consulted and they recommended treatment with intravesicular cedofivir.
Urology recommended an outpatient cystoscopy after discharge for further evaluation of microscopic hematuria.
# Decreased Mental Status - In Mid [**2124-5-17**], patient had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status: AOx2, missing date, with a mild decrease in his mental status.
He was also complaining of some visual halluciantions and made some coherent but nonsensical statements.
An MRI was conducted which showed no pathology that would account for the mental status change.
It was thought that the most likely cause was metabolic encephalopathy secondary to one of his medications.
In the past he has had similar symptoms in response to cyclosporin.
At that time he was given a cyclosporin holiday and changed to tacrolimus with a recovery of his mental status to baseline.
On [**6-11**] nifedipine was stopped due to low blood pressures.
The patient developed severe anascarca and ascites and had an approximately 40lb weight gain secondary to GVHD.
Once his GVHD stabilized, he was diuresed with lasix which at one point caused prerenal acute renal failure with a creatinine peak of 1.7.
Patient currently has 1+ edema bilaterally in both legs, but no other symptoms of fluid overlaod.
#) Superficial venous clots: On [**4-14**], the patient developed superficial venous clots in his left cephalic and basilic veins near a PICC line site.
#) GERD: The patient was started on a PPI on [**3-28**] due to increased symptoms of "heartburn" in the setting of high dose steroids.
#) Access: The patient had multiple central lines at various times during this hospitalization, which were required as the patient was unable to take POs.
He currently has no central access.
# Hypothermia / MS changes: Multiple possible etiologies in the immunocompromised pt s/p BMT,  concern for sepsis given elevated lactate (although unclear as to what pt's baseline lactate level is given malignancy and adenopathy, was stable at 3.0 on transfer) and resp alkalosis.
Pt had recent VRE bacteremia, after central line placement, the midline was removed and sent for culture.
MRI shows possible embolic infarcts which raises concern for endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis.
TSH was low normal ruling out hypothyroid myxedema.
Concern for meningitis or other central process given persistent resp alkalosis.
Additional concern for med toxicity given hx of MS changes with cyclosporine.
ID recommended coverage for empiric HSV with foscarnet (due to better coverage of HSV 6).
ID also recommended, f/u galactomannan, B-D-glucan as another survey for invasive fungal infection without need for broader fungal coverage now.
We initially placed the patient on Linezolid, cipro, Meropenem, flagyl, Micafungin, foscarnet and Atovaquone (pt not taking since NPO), but then d/c'd cipro once it was felt that pseudomonas was unlikely.
The pt reported having some loose stools but C. diff was negative and empiric flagyl treatment was d/c'd.
Otherwise, with this treatment the patient became normothermic with temps >96, with improved mental status, and hemodynamically stable (never with need for intubation/pressors).
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to blood draws vs bleeding.
Hemolysis/DIC labs negative.
Upon discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: [**2124-6-20**]: #GVHD - The patient continued to have copious diarrhea since his discharge from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
#MS changes - The patient had multiple episodes of hypothermia to as low as [**Age over 90 **]F, with associated mental status changes.
However, it was thought that the daptomycin was potentially causing a further elevation in his bilirubin, and this was stopped on [**7-15**].
#Adenovirus - The patient was found to have >100,000 copies of adenovrius in his blod on [**6-28**].
CSF was sent from [**6-26**] which also showed evidence of adenovirus.
However, repeat level on [**7-6**] showed decreasing adenovirus levels and cidofivir was not started.
GVHD: By the beginning of [**Month (only) **], the pt did not have any GVHD associated rash and he was not having any significant amount of diarrhea, however he did have increases in his LFT's and total bilirubin (as below) that were associated with altered mental status, increased somnolence and decreased responsiveness (see below, AMS).
Enterecept was eventually discontinued and doses of other immunosuppressive were readjusted in accordance with liver function.
The amt of diarrhea changed from day to day but was typically [**12-22**] loose stools per day, occasionally with frank blood, and occasionally with guiac + but not frankly bloody.
The Tbili steadily increased in late [**Month (only) 216**] until early [**Month (only) **], when it peaked at 9.6 and this was concurrent with his altered mental staus (as below).
Pt was to get an MRI abdomen but was unable to sit still long enough to get it, therefore was sent for CT abdomen with and without contrast [**2124-7-18**], which showed an interval increase in his ascites, increase in his pleural effusions L>R, and chronic ileal wall thickening c/w GVHD.
Hepatology was consulted and a paracentesis was performed in early [**Month (only) **] that was essentially non-diagnostic, ascites cultures were negative, and the picture was essentially consistent with portal hypertension.
Rifaxamin was stopped without consequence.
Concurrent with this was hypothermia and hypotension.
This was thought to be mostly due to hepatic encephalopathy.
His mental status steadily cleared up although it was noted that he would have occasional delirium, would be a little restless at night (he had actually pulled out a central venous line one night, another was placed, but he then pulled that one out several days later), saying odd things in the morning before he fully woke up, and sundowning a little at night.
Hypothermia and Hypotension--Seen to be occasionally hypotensive to the 90's, which responded to fluid boluses, and hypothermic to a low of 93.8.
By the time the pt's mental status improved, his blood pressures and hypothermia were no longer an issue.
In fact, the pt's blood pressure and heart rate began to increase the week after Metoprolol was d/c'd and was added back in with a decrease in bp and pulse seen.
He was d/c'd on Metoprolol 12.5 TID with steady vitals.
GIB--While he was AMS, pt was not having active GI bleed or diarrhea issues, but after he woke up he began having loose BM's with obvious dark red blood.
He also received occasional platelets --> During [**Month (only) **], the pt required 6U of PRBC's and 5 of platelets.
GI was consulted but felt the pt not stable for colonoscopy as the large ammount of ascites fluid would lead to infection.
By the time of discharge the pt's Hct was stable, he was having occasional guiac + stools but not felt to be compromised by them.
Repeat level on [**7-6**] showed decreasing adenovirus levels at approx.
RUE clot: Found to have RUE clot of several months duration but not anti-coagulated due to h/o GIB's.
On [**2124-7-24**] pt's R hand and forearm seen to be acutely grossly swollen, L hand normal, however by the afternoon the pt's R arm returned to its normal size without any interventions.
Given recent complaints of dysuria, another BK virus was sent and results are pending.
Mood: The pt had appropriately depressed moods at various points and was very desolate that he had been in bed 5 mos, couldn't move his legs, and didn't feel he was making progress.
He was never tried on any other stimulant or antidepressant.
Disposition: The pt basically needs aggressive rehabilitation at this point, as he has major proximal LE muscle wasting and myopathy likely due to long term steroid use.
