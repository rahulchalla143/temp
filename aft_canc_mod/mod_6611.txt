He was seen and evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had placement of a biliary stent.
Past Medical History: A-fib, staging laparoscopy [**1-21**], ERCP w/stent placement, eye surgery, tonsillectomy  Social History: Engaged Retired insurance executive  Physical Exam: Gen: Thin, healthy man with profound jaundice and scratching.
No peripheral lymphadenopathy CV: Atrial fibrillation Chest: Clear on auscultation Abd: Soft, no massess, nontender Ext: full range of motion, +pulses bilaterally.
Chronic cholecystitis.
No calculi or tumor.
Marked atrophy, with fibrosis and chronic inflammation.
Obstruction of the common bile duct, due to invasion of the wall by tumor.
Marked fibrosis and atrophy of the pancreas.
Separate small adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic body, 1.5 cm in diameter.
c.  No tumor at the inked outer margin.
Marked fibrosis/atrophy of the pancreas with dilated pancreatic duct.
Multiple microscopic foci of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), ranging from low to high grade.
No lymph nodes in this segment.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2154-2-9**]  1:27:34 PM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Poor R wave progression suggest prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-1-24**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Some prominence of the cardiac silhouette and interstitial markings is again seen.
The increased opacification at the left base is again consistent with some atelectatic change in the retrocardiac region.
Large bibasilar effusions with increased interstitial markings and ground glass opacities throughout both lungs suggestive of pulmonary edema from fluid overload or CHF.
No central or segmental pulmonary emboli, however, given the extent of effusions and passive atelectasis, subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes cannot be excluded.
Abdominopelvic ascites with no evidence of abscess.
Postoperative changes in the upper abdomen in keeping with recent laparotomy.
Stable pneumobilia and intra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver and left kidney likely represent cysts or hemangiomas.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-2-18**] 9:04 AM IMPRESSION: No significant changes in moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Bilateral parenchymal opacification predominantly apical distribution is atypical for pulmonary edema and pneumonia is another consideration.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 74 year old male with painless obstructive jaundice.
Pain: He had an epidural for pain control.
His abdomen was soft and nontender.
He was on TPn for nutritional support.
He received several fluid boluses without immediate effect.
His HCT was stable and he did not appear to have a bleed.
He was switched to PO Lopressor for rate control.
He continued to have elevated HR.
Post-op Orthostasis: On POD 8, when working with PT, he continued to be unsteady and orthostatic with a drop in BP to 80's.
Acute CHF: On POD [**10-26**], he developed CHF and had some respiratory distress.
At time of discharge he still had significant LE edema, and his weight was near his baseline.
Sepsis: When he decompensated on POD 10, with CHF and possible sepsis, he was started on Vanco, Flagyl and continued on Cipro.
Furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): continue for LE edema and pleural effusion.
monitor potassium level.
