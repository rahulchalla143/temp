Admission Date:  [**2101-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-2-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Direct current cardioversion Transesophageal echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: Pt is an 89F with history of HTN, hypothyroidism.
She was hospitalized at [**Hospital **] rehab for a femur fracture [**1-21**].
She had been doing well until this evening at approximately 9-10pm when while resting she noted acute onset respiratory distress.
When EMS arrived she was hypoxic to 82% on RA, this improved to 100% when placed on a NRB, she was also noted to be hypertensive in the field to 233/96.
She had a CXR which showed CHF and cardiomegaly and had a CTA due to concern for PE which was negative for PE, showed CHF and cardiomegaly.
Minimal UOP at this point.
Became hypotensive on nitro gtt necessitating 500 IVF bolus, in addition to pre-contrast hydration, at which point she put out ~500cc urine.
She was started on a heparin gtt for her AF with a bolus.
On floor, pt reports her breathing is much improved, she is sleeping comfortably sitting up with mask around her neck.
No recent illnesses or medication changes.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:: Diabetes + , Dyslipidemia +, Hypertension- 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: DM Hypothyroidism Osteoporosis ?
COPD Hypercholesterolemia (previously on lipitor, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 39449**]) Glaucoma Hearing loss Macular degeneration Anxiety h/o perforatic gastric ulcer   Social History: Lived alone prior to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab admit.
Sclera anicteric.
Irregularly irregular rhythm.
Nl S1/S2, no murmurs audible.
Large reducible ventral hernia.
No high pitched BS EXTREMITIES:Asymetric pitting edema R>L of b/l ankles, per daughter this is chronic.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Shoulder x-ray - FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the humeral fracture is again seen with marked overlap of the head with the proximal shaft.
It is unclear whether this is related to the previous fracture or to some other pathology involving the joint.
INDICATION: Check for fracture progression.
FINDINGS: There are no old films.
There is a fracture at the surgical neck of the humerus.
There is overlap of the humeral head with the proximal shaft.
Based on these views, I cannot completely determine the seating of the humeral head within the glenoid.
TEE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
No central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and reflux of intravenous contrast into the hepatic veins.
The constellationo of these findings is suggestive of congestive heart failure.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Small nodules in the right upper lobe measuring up to 6 mm.
# RHYTHM:  Suspect that atrial fibrillation is new as never documented before and pt markedly symptomatic.
Likely she was dependent on her atrial kick in setting of probable depressed cardiac function.
For infectious wrk-up patient had CTA which demonstrated effusions but no obvious infiltrate.
Patient without fever, elevation in white count or other localizing symptoms to suggest infection.
Patient did convert to sinus briefly and then went back into atrial fibrillation on [**2101-2-11**].
# PUMP:  On admission exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP, crackles, some mild LE edema.
At risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN.
Echo on admission demonstrates mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Right ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
ECG without acute ischemic changes.
Patient is a diabetic which is a coronary artery equivalent.
No evidence of echo abnormalities which would be consistent with CHF.
# Hypertension ??????
# Acute vs. chronic renal failure ??????
Initially held ACE inhibitor in the setting of elevated creatinine which was restarted and Cr remained stable.
Sent active type and screen while in house, given fluid overload and lack of acute ischemia would not tranfuse for crit less than 21.
# Hx humerus fx: Pt was at rehab s/p humerus fx prior to admit.
Repeat films as above and ortho saw patient and felt that fracture healing well, reccomended weight bearing as tolerated and outpatient orthopedic follow up in 3 weeks.
#Lung nodule - incidentally noted lung nodule (small in right lung) on CTA.
# Adrenal Adenoma - noted incidentally on CTA chest.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Travoprost 0.004 % Drops Sig: One (1)  Ophthalmic 1 drop () as needed for qhs.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Atrial fibrillation .
You were admitted with shortness of breath and was found to have an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You were treated with medications and cardioversion, or shocking of the heart.
The cardioversion resulted in sinus rhythm which unfortunately was not sustained and your rhythm returned to atrial fibrillation.
You  had a shoulder x-ray taken which demonstrated a right proximal humerus fracture which appears to be progressing well clinically.
You were started on metoprolol for both hypertension and atrial fibrillation 5.
You were started on amiodarone for rhythm control of your atrial fibrillation .
On the CTA of the chest you were noted to have an adrenal adenoma as well as a small nodule in the right upper lobe of your lung.
You should undergo repeat CT at 6-12 months to ensure stability of these lesions.
