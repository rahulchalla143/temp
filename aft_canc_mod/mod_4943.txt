Pt was on warfarin for a PE recently diagnosed and INR was 6.7.
Pt received FFP and vitamin K and had an IVC filter placed.She was also started on decadron and dilantin.Her mental status improved significantly and repeat CT scan on [**2104-10-1**] shows no progression of bleed.
On arrival, pt c/o hiccups and rt rib pain which she attributes to intractable hiccups.

Past Medical History: Oncology history: 1.Diagnosed with stage IIIa melanoma in [**10-24**] excisional biopsy showed invasive malignant melanoma with a depth of 2.1 mm, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV, no ulceration and 2 mitoses per 10 high-powered fields.
She then underwent a wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy on [**2102-10-3**] and there was no residual melanoma identified.
In the wide local excision specimen, there was a metastatic deposit in the sentinel lymph node.
Imaging showed no areas of metastatic disease.
[**2104-8-27**] presented to OSH with acute SOB and found to haev a PE, pulmonary nodules, and mult bone lesions on bone scan , CT guided biopsy of vertebral body lytic lesion was c/w metastatic melanoma.

Lymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular or axillary LAD.
CV: S1S2, reg rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
RESP: Good air movement bilaterally, no rhonchi or wheezing.
[**10-3**] MRA BRAIN- IMPRESSION: Although no vascular occlusion or abnormal vascular structures are seen.
Slight protuberance in the region of anterior communicating artery is seen which likely is due to a vascular loop.
[**10-3**] MRI T Spine- IMPRESSION: Bony abnormalities at the T6-7 and T10 levels, suspicious for bony metastasis.
Similar degree of bilateral pulmonary metastases.
Probably similar appearance to metastatic involvement and vertebral body height loss of T6-T7 vertebral bodies, though direct comparison is not possible to the outside films provided.
Osseous destruction within the left hemisacrum, which is also probably similar compared with prior, though is incompletely imaged on the comparison study.
Hypodensities within the liver and spleen are stable but highly suggestive of metastatic disease.
No left-sided DVT.
Expected post-operative changes status post resection of right frontal hemorrhagic mass with some blood products in the surgical bed.
3 mm hemorrhagic mass abutting the body of the left lateral ventricle, as seen previously.
Other small intracranial masses were better seen on the recent MRI  WBC RBC Hgb Hct MCV MCH MCHC RDW Plt Ct [**2104-10-10**] 06:05    13.4* 3.47* 9.9* 28.5* 82 28.6 34.8 14.7 163  [**2104-10-9**] 05:20    15.6* 3.80* 10.7* 32.1* 84 28.2 33.4 15.1 175 [**2104-10-8**] 16:05    20.7* 4.20 11.8* 35.9* 85 28.1 33.0 15.0 239  [**2104-10-7**] 08:30    21.0* 4.22 12.1 34.6* 82 28.8 35.1* 14.5 237  [**2104-10-7**] 04:17    21.9* 4.37 12.5 35.7* 82 28.5 34.9 14.8 264 Source: Line-aline [**2104-10-6**] 08:54    14.0* 4.55 12.9 37.6 83 28.3 34.2 14.0 252 [**2104-10-5**] 07:21    13.2* 4.75 13.4 40.0 84 28.3 33.6 14.5 233 [**2104-10-4**] 07:47    10.6 4.72 13.1 39.0 83 27.7 33.5 13.8 247 [**2104-10-3**] 08:10    12.2* 4.57 12.8 37.8 83 28.0 33.9 13.9 267 [**2104-10-2**] 17:45    10.9 4.47 13.0 36.9 83 29.0 35.1* 14.0 244  Glucose UreaN Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap [**2104-10-10**] 06:05    157*1 26* 0.7 137 4.0 103 26 12 [**2104-10-9**] 05:20    146*1 28* 0.6 140 4.1 106 26 12 [**2104-10-7**] 08:30    164*1 20 0.7 142 4.1 106 25 15 [**2104-10-6**] 19:25    212*1 21* 0.8 136 3.6 102 21* 17 Source: Line-Aline [**2104-10-6**] 08:54    981 20 0.6 139 3.8 104 26 13 [**2104-10-5**] 07:21    821 19 0.7 137 3.8 101 22 18 [**2104-10-4**] 07:47    [**Telephone/Fax (2) 84431**] 3.7 103 25 14 [**2104-10-3**] 08:10    [**Telephone/Fax (2) 84432**] 3.6 104 26 15 [**2104-10-2**] 17:45    118*1 18 0.6 142 3.8 105 27 14  TotProt Albumin Globuln Calcium Phos Mg UricAcd Iron [**2104-10-10**] 06:05          9.8 2.1* 2.0 [**2104-10-9**] 05:20          10.0 2.2* 2.1 [**2104-10-7**] 08:30          10.2 3.4 2.1 [**2104-10-6**] 19:25          9.7 3.6 1.9 Source: Line-Aline [**2104-10-6**] 08:54          10.3 2.7 2.0 [**2104-10-5**] 07:21          10.5* 2.9 2.1 [**2104-10-4**] 07:47          10.2 2.8 1.9 [**2104-10-3**] 08:10      4.1   9.7 2.5* 1.9 [**2104-10-2**] 17:45      4.0   10.3 2.1* 2.0 NEUROPSYCHIATRIC Phenyto [**2104-10-2**] 17:45    9.0*  Blood Gas BLOOD GASES Type Temp Rates Tidal V PEEP FiO2 O2 Flow pO2 pCO2 pH calTCO2 Base XS [**2104-10-6**] 17:12    ART             123* 32* 7.43 22 -1 WHOLE BLOOD, MISCELLANEOUS CHEMISTRY Glucose Lactate Na K Cl [**2104-10-6**] 17:12    149* 0.8 128* 3.2* 100 HEMOGLOBLIN FRACTIONS ( COOXIMETRY) Hgb calcHCT [**2104-10-6**] 17:12    10.9* 33 CALCIUM freeCa [**2104-10-6**] 17:12    1.20   Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo woman with recent diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with lung and bone mets and recent diagnosis of PE on anticoagulation presented to OSH with an right frontal intracranial hemorrhage and right pathological hip fracture admitted to the Hem/Onc service on [**2104-10-2**].

#Met melanoma: Results of B-Raf mutation status pending.
-Will need x-rays of bilateral femurs to asses stability/risk of fracture as well as likely MRI of spine to better evaluate spinal mets.

-start metoprolol 25 mg po bid and will monitor pulse and BP closely.
#Hypercalcemia: Mild hypercalcemia at OSH.
