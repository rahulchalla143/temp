She was recently admitted in [**2136-3-28**] for congestive heart failure.
She has a h/o urinary retention for which she has an indwelling foley.
Per VNA she had been having foul smelling urine for two days prior to her admission.
On the morning of her admission she had shaking chills, unable to take temperature due to shaking and was brought by family to ED.
At that time noted to have temp of 105 rectal, initial BP 158/80, and noted to be volume overloaded.
She denies any SOB, CP, or abdominal pain.

Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 5.
Hypertension 6.
Multiple myeloma (has continued to defer treatment) 7.
Bilateral adrenal adenoma 8.
Iron deficiency anemia 9. s/p cholecystectomy [**39**].
Right-sided carotid stenosis 12.
Urinary retention (eval with cystoscopy - found to have excessive trabeculations c/w poor emptying) - requires straight cath 13.
CHF (systolic dysfunction, MR, TR)   Social History: She lives with her son.
Mother with MI and uterine cancer.
Physical Exam: VS 96.0 124/64 80 16 95% RA GENERAL: elderly female in NAD HEENT: EOMI, MMM NECK: JVP ~12 level of ear, supple, no LAD, no thyromegaly, RIJ CDI CARDIOVASCULAR: S1, S2, reg, III/VI systolic M at apex LUNGS: Good air movement, no wheeze or crackles ABDOMEN: Soft, ND, obese, Slight RLQ tenderness on palpation.
There is suggestion of worsening fluid balance.
If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views for more optimal evaluation.
[**2136-4-21**] CT Torso Lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon of indeterminate etiology without bowel obstruction.
Possibilities include a carcinoma, plasmacytoma or lymphoma, but given the clinical presentation of sepsis, infectious process is in the differential.
Enlarging bilateral adrenal masses.
New bilateral pleural effusions Anasarca.
No evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct, hemorrhage, or enhancing lesions.
Myelomatous involvement of the skull, with no epidural or other associated soft tissue mass.
[**4-24**] CXR: Compared with [**2136-4-21**], the pulmonary edema has resolved.
There is persistent retrocardiac atelectasis/opacity.
Cardiomegaly with reflux of contrast into enlarged hepatic veins suggestive of right heart dysfunction.
Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent relaxation atelectasis, right greater than left, unchanged.
Filling defects within the right colon seen on prior examination no longer visualized and likely represented stool that has passed in the interim.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
79 y/o female with a h/o CAD s/p CABG, T2DM, MM, and CHF who presented with sepsis.
She was found to have a lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon on CT torso and [**2-12**] blood cx bottles growing G+ cocci.
Her abdominal CT showed lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon concerning for carcinoma.
She has been seen by the GI team who suggested the possibility of plasmacytoma and lymphoma in the differential.
Of note she was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs for Hct of 24 with minimal response but no evidence of acute blood loss/hemolysis.
# Sepsis/bacteremia.
The patient declined TEE to rule out endocarditis, so she will be treated with a six week course of vancomycin to empirically treat endocarditis.
# Lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon.
First CT showed a lobulated mass that was concerning for plasmacytoma vs. lymphoma vs. primary colon CA.
However, on repeat CT, there was no mass, and the initial mass was likely intracolonic fecal matter.
# CHF.
Fluid overloaded on exam (increased JVP, lower extremity edema, bibasilar crackles on lung exam).
Blood pressures have been within normal limits; will slowly add back cardiac medications (atenolol, furosemide) and *gentle* diuresis as blood pressure tolerates.
- Oral furosemide according to home regimen - Start [**Last Name (un) **] .
# Coagulopathy.
# Diplopia.
CT head showed no evidence of mass, infection, or infarct to explain the findings.
She was seen by ophthalmology consult, who noted microvascular changes consistent with the patient's known diabetes and recommended outpatient follow-up.
# Hyponatremia.
Chronic problem, possibly secondary to multiple myeloma +/- CHF.
No interventions during this hospitalization.
Most likely multifactorial in etiology (with history of multiple myeloma).
Last iron studies ([**2136-3-8**]) consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Had elevated troponin T on admission with flat CK (attributable to MI in setting of sepsis).
EKG showed resolution of T-wave and non-specific EKG changes.
# Multiple Myeloma.
Plasmacytoma previously identified on sternal biopsy; she was noted on skeletal survey to have additional lesions in [**2133**] w/ R humerus lesion, L mid femur.
Renal function has been stable, UPEP in [**Month (only) 404**] showed trace IgG band.
No interventions during this hospitalization.
# Diabetes.
Cardiac and diabetic diet.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for iotching.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Bacteremia/sepsis Systolic congestive heart failure Coagulopathy, malignancy-related Anemia, chronic Multiple myeloma   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating PO   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers and were found to have positive blood cultures.
You were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and should remain on IV antibiotics for six weeks' duration given concern for infection of the heart valves.
