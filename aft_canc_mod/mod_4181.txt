Admission Date:  [**2133-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-4-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation IVC filter placement Chest tube placement Tracheostomy PEG placement  History of Present Illness: 57yoF w/extensive CA burden in lungs from metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma, on 4L of O2 at home, who p/w acute SOB and hemoptysis after cyberknife treatment.
Two hours into her treatment the day of admission, she experienced worsening dyspnea and coughed up phlegm and approximately 30cc of blood.
She apparently had been having episodes of hemoptysis every few days.
A CT chest was performed showing multiple bilateral subsegmental PEs.
IP was consulted for PEs and recent h/o hemoptysis.
Past Medical History: Primary oncologist- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69068**] at MSK - mesonephric adenocarcinoma dx [**2125**] s/p TAHBSO - [**2125**] chemotherapy with platinum and 5-FU and with radiation therapy to the pelvis - [**2126**] VATS wedge resections of the right middle lobe and left lower lobe for pulmonary mets - [**2128**]-[**2130**] several different chemotherapeutic regimens including avastin and gemcitabine most recently in [**3-16**] - PET-CT [**8-15**] showed at least 5 FDG avid lung nodules compatible with metastases - cyberknife therapy for palliation of SOB [**6-15**] - most recent chest imaging [**2133-1-5**] CT chest showed worsened mediastinal and pulmonary disease with 6x12cm right hilar mass that invades the posterior [**Last Name (un) **] of the left main PA. Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: [**Doctor Last Name 13534**]-Parkinson-White syndrome hepatitis C diagnosed in [**2104**] ganglion cyst removed many years ago laparoscopic fallopian tube surgery many years ago   Social History: Married with two teenage boys, one of whom is adopted.
Stable large metastatic lesions throughout the lungs.
Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary emboli.
New left lingular atelectasis.
Worsened right upper lobe ground-glass and airspace patchy opacity which could represent developing infection, post-inflammatory changes, or atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage.
Cannot exclude small subarachnoid or extraaxial hemorrhages.
No obvious evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Renal US [**1-23**]: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm in its long axis and the left kidney measures 12.7 cm.
The left collecting system shows mild hydronephrosis.
No focal mass lesions or calculi identified.
There is an indwelling Foley catheter in the urinary bladder which was empty at the time of the examination.
A new large left pneumothorax causes some tension as evidenced by slight tracheal buckling to the right and hyperlucency of the right medial costophrenic angle.
The massive pulmonary metastases are unchanged; right lung shows no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Slight decrease in the overall size of the multiple soft tissue masses with multiple areas of internal air within the mass, most likely related to recent treatment.
Small loculated left apical pneumothorax that might be related to air- collections in the left upper lobe mass.
New small left pleural effusion.
Mild left hydronephrosis.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the adjacent left chest wall is stable.
No right pleural abnormality.
CXR s/p chest placed to water seal [**2133-2-2**]: There is no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is stable.
Large lung masses show little interval change except for recent cavitation.
Left PIC line tip projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
Patient had multiple blood, sputum, BAL, and urine cultures sent during her admission.
Brief Hospital Course: 57yoF w/ adenocarcinoma of the cervix w/known extensive lung metastases who p/w respiratory failure in the setting of hemoptysis at cyberknife therapy, found to have new bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Respiratory failure Felt to be multifactorial, including very large pulmonary masses with possibility of bleeding or inflammation from radiation, PE, post obstructive pneumonia, and anxiety.
Bandemia on presentation suggestive of possible infection.
Ms. [**Known lastname 69069**] was treated with a burst of steroids for possible post-radiation edema as well as a course of antibiotics (vanc, zosyn, and flagyl) for possible post-obstructive pneumonia; antibiotics were stopped when the team decided she did not have an infectious picture.
She receives frequent lidocaine to suppress her cough, and she has done well for extended periods on her trach collar using the passy muir valve.
Pulmonary emboli No anticoagulation as discussed above.
# Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia: Patient had an acute drop in her platelets from 200s to 95 about 10 days after admission.
Pt was not felt to be a candidate for systemic anticoagulation because of the high risk of bleeding from her pulmonary mass as discussed above.
# Tension Pneumothorax: Patient developed worsening of her tachycardia, with HR in 130s.
CXR revealed a left-sided pneumothorax with evidence of some tension.
Repeat imaging after catheter was clamped was difficult to interpret because of her extensive tumor burden, and a chest CT was obtained to better clarify the extent of her pneumothorax.
The read is suggestive of a fistula from the tumor creating a pathway for air to extend into her pleural space.
(see results section for details)  # Leukopenia: Patient developed leukopenia late in her course.
Nadir WBC was 3300 with no evidence of neutropenia.
In the setting of worsening tachycardia, there was concern that she might be developing sepsis, and a pulmonary source of infection was felt to be most likely.
Moreover, the tachycardia improved with the placement of the pigtail catheter for her pneumothorax.
# Renal failure: During her second week of admission, patient had decreased urine output and Cr increased from 0.6 to 1.0.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated mild left hydronephrosis.
# LE edema: Patient has developed b/l pitting LE edema during her course due to a positive fluid balance every day over 3 weeks.
Lidocaine HCl 1 % (10 mg/mL) Solution [**Month/Day (2) **]: 2.5 MLs Injection Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for ETT ajdustment or discomfort.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Month/Day (2) **]: Two (2) ml PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis:  Respiratory Failure Secondary Diagnoses:  Cervical cancer, Pulmonary embolism, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, Tension Pneumothorax   Discharge Condition: With trach, on mechanical ventilator but able to tolerate periods on her trach collar.
Extravascular volume overload with bilateral pitting edema.
Extravascular volume overload with bilateral pitting edema.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 69069**] was admitted with respiratory failure from her underlying pulmonary metastases.
