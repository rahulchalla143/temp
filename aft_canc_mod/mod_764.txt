Celiac plexus block was done on [**10-21**] for chronic pain.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx: diagnosed with rcc in [**5-/2147**] when he presented with hematuria and abdominal pain.
The CT showed a large right renal mass and he underwent nephrectomy on [**2147-6-6**].
His preoperative workup had revealed pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation.
CT scans following nephrectomy showed recurrence in the nephrectomy bed site as well as increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Interval increase in size of the right lower lobe consolidative process now encompassing the previously noted ground-glass opacity.
Also interval development of air bronchograms.
These findings raise the suspicion for right lower lobe pneumonia.

Pt with consolidation on CT chest consistent with pneumonia.
Pt remained afebrile with improving leukocytosis - continued on vanc & zosyn for 72h, then vanc discontinued.
# Respiratory Failure/pneumonia: Pt with hypoxia, tachypnea and increasing O2 requirement as above.
Pt with consolidation on CT scan, CTA negative for PE.
He was weaned off O2 to room air without difficulty.
# Pancreatic mets s/p biliary stent with perc.drainage: Cholangiogram done on admission, with external drainage bag placed per surgery.
