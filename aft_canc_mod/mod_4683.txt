calTCO2-28 Base XS-1  Chest X-ray [**2199-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-9**] through [**9-3**]:  Moderate left pleural effusion is reaccumulating relative to [**9-1**].
There is no pneumothorax.
Right pleural effusion including a fissural component is chronic.
No pulmonary edema.
Presence of small pulmonary nodules would be obscured by the extensive overlying pleural abnormalities.
Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, though with common bile duct within normal limits in size.
MRCP could be performed to assess for relationship of hepatic metastases to intrahepatic ducts if intervention is planned.
Multiple known hepatic metastasis is incompletely evaluated on this study.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Similar extent of mild left hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Retained contrast within the left kidney, likely from recent CT two days prior, is compatible with obstructive nephropathy.
Similar extent of bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis and right middle lobe collapse.
Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with unchanged omental and hepatic metastases.
Increased anasarca, pulmonary edema, and size of abdominal ascites, suggestive of volume overload.
[**2199-8-31**]: ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2199-8-30**] MRI HEAD: MPRESSION: Multiple small acute infarcts are identified in both parietooccipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres without definite acute infarct within the brainstem.
Small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
Possible perfusion defects concerning for infarct within the brainstem; however, CT perfusion is suboptimal for the evaluation of the posterior circulation.
Extensive focal atherosclerosis with marked narrowing of the left subclavian artery just proximal to the takeoff of the left vertebral artery.
No other areas of significant stenosis or aneurysm formation are seen.
Basilar stroke: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-8-30**] for acute stroke.
He was transitioned from a heparin gtt to lovenox given recent embolic stroke and hypercoaguable state in setting of malignancy.
Right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm: Patient s/p mechanical and chemical thrombectomy via right common femoral artery puncture, and was found to have small right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.
He had a repeat ultrasound on [**2199-9-6**] which showed the pseudoaneurysm had slightly increased in size from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only.
Hypoxia: Likely secondary to pleural effusions (malignant).
CXR on [**2199-9-3**] had shown stable reticular nodular pattern in right lung likely representing lymphatic obstruction, a stable right pleural effusion, and increased opacification in left lung likely representing increased atelectasis and increased pleural effusion.
Repeat CXR on [**2199-9-8**] showed increased pleural effusion and patient had a repeat thoracentesis on [**2199-9-11**] prior to discharge.
A post-procedure chest x-ray was done and there were no complications from the procedure.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Patient has h/o bilateral hydronephrosis, likely secondary to obstructive uropathy.
His left stent showed hematuria and had poor output in setting of creatinine increase from 1.3->1.7, his left nephrostomy tube was placed.
Stage IV gastric CA: Patient recently diagnosed with gastric cancer, and gastric biopsy returned positive for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating through the deep mucosal layer.
Cytology from the peripancreatic lymph nodes was also positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Given recent complications in course, chemo currently on hold.
His cell counts were monitored closely in setting of recent chemo.
Coumadin had been held initially for thoracentesis, and was not restarted in setting of stroke and low platelet count.
Patient will need long-term anticoagulation in setting of recent embolic stroke and hypercoagulable state.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location (un) 5165**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cerebral Vascular Accident  Secondary: Metastatic Gastric Cancer w/ obstruction of left ureter Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Stroke: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of your acute stoke.
You had a procedure to remove a clot from a major artery in your brain.
Cancer: You have been diagnosed with metastatic gastric cancer.
Atrial Fibrillation: You have atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm.
Pleural effusion: You had a thoracentesis (Draining of fluid from around the lung) on two occasions during your hospital course.
