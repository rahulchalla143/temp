Mild effacement of the cerebral aqueduct with associated mild ventriculomegaly, however, no associated transependymal migration of CSF is noted.
Low lying cerebellar tonsils though foramen of magnum is patent.
Persistent vasogenic edema of the left temporal lobe and cerebellum.
No definite focal lytic or sclerotic lesion identified in the lumbar spine.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with stage IIIA breast cancer admitted with headache,nausea, vomiting, malaise, found to have new brain metastses.
(1) Metastatic Breast Cancer:  Patient was discovered to have new brain metastases per CT with increased cerebral edema.
A ventriculopeitoneal shunt was placed on [**2158-7-14**] for decompression and follow up head CT showed mild decrease in ventricular size, after which she received her first of 5 scheduled whole brain radiation treatments.
She was then transfered from Neurosurgery to OMED for further care, where she received the remaining 4 treatments without complication.
She tolerated the treatments well with mild nausea controlled with antiemetics.
At no point did she have severe pain.
Instead she received a lumbosacral CT which showed no evidence of leptomeningeal disease.
