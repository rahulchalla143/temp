Mild pulmonary edema has decreased.
Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar pulmonary opacities are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: 1) Decreased mild pulmonary edema.
2) Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities.
[**2192-12-5**] Echocardiograph Poor echo windows.The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Basal to mid antero-septal and inferior hypokinesis is suggested, but not confirmed.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion appear normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
He was hydrated with NS and then developed fevers and was noted to have LLL opacity.
He was initially given cefepime, fluconazole (concern for esophagitis), flagyl.
He had frequent desaturations that were found to be secondary to mucus plugging and which resolved with deep suctioning.
CXR's have also shown progressive pulmonary edema  In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt.
It was felt his resp distress was secondary to pulm edema/volume overload and we was therefore diuresed with PRN lasix 40 mg.  Over LOS in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was roughly -1.2 L.  An echocardiogram revealed the patient had deteriorated LV function and new wall motion abnormalities.
He had been afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable and was therefore transferred back to the floor.
felt his breathing had improved and he had no fevers, chest pain, or cough.
Repeat CXR revealed stable lower lobe infiltrates but almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.
Aggressive diuresis was no longer pursued.
On discharge, the patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
He was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital to enable further improvement of his respiratory status and for reconditioning.
In summary, this is a 71 year old gentleman with oral squamous cell carcinoma on radiation therapy who was admitted for fever and finding of lower lobe lung infiltrates.
He developed respiratory distress from a combination of pneumonia, new CHF seen on echocardiography, and mucus plugging and required a brief stay in intensive care but not intubation.
He did well with diuretic therapy for his CHF, antibiotics for his MSSA pneumonia and was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital to enable further improvement of his respiratory status.
- Chest PT, aggressive suctioning as needed - Aggressive diuresis no longer needed.
now with apparently worsened EF, new wall motion abnormalities - Will need oupatient follow up with Cardiology.
- Watch for signs of overload (weight gain, edema) .
Also satrted on levofloxacin and flagyl for possible aspiration PNA after developing RLL opacity.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Congestive Heart Failure Left Lower Lobe pneumonia Hypoxia from mucus plugging  Secondary diagnosis Oral squamous cell carcinoma on radiation therapy.
Chronic G-tube   Discharge Condition: Fair.
Otherwise afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please return pt to hospital if respiratory status begins to deteriorate or if chest pain starts to develop.
