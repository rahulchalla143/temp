He had a TTE which did not show signs of endocarditis and a dilated eye exam which did not show [**Female First Name (un) 564**] endophthalmitis.
There was also concern for a multifocal pneumonia in the RUL on chest imaging during the [**Date range (1) 73067**] admit.
Lastly, he was found to have a transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia of unclear etiology during his last admission (ALT 226, AST 235, T Bili 11.3).
These lab abnormalities resolved without GI intervention.
The patient reports initially feeling well, but then over the last five days, started to experience decrease appetite and fatigue.
He denies any fevers, chills, vomiting, new rash, blurry vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, or headache.
He has chronic nausea and diarrhea, which have continued.
He has also noticed a new pain below his right rib cage which is worse with inspiration.

Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: BS+, soft, minimal RUQ tenderness to palpation under the last rib, no rebound/guarding.
Patient has dressing covering abdominal wound, which is < 2cm.
He has a colostomy bag in the R abdomen with liquid stool.

Transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia of unclear etiology (ALT 226, AST 235, T Bili 11.3) resolved without GI intervention.
# Weakness/fatigue: Possibly due to dehydration vs. progressive disease vs. infection (recurrence of recent multi-organism sepsis) vs. post-chemo effect (unlikely with decitabine).
He was treated with empiric antibiotics and his weakness appeared to improve.
However, his weakness waxed and waned thoughout the hospital course, and did not completely resolve by the time of discharge.
# Abdominal pain and diarrhea:  The patient presented with high ostomy output.
He was started on IV hydration and a low residue diet.
He also complained of RUQ pain, with positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
However USS and HIDA scan only showed gall bladder sludge and GI and surgery were reluctant to place a percutaneous biliary drain or perform ERCP given the high risk of sepsis int his frail neutropenic patient.
In addition to the focal RUQ pain, the patient also complained of diffuse, migratory abdominal pain.
He was treated with empiric antibiotics to treat for gram negative, positive and fungal infections, and his symptoms improved.
CT abdomen also revealed epiploic appendagitis, which may have been the cause of his diffuse abdominal pain.
# Urinary tract infections: Urine cultures from [**2135-7-16**] grew MRSA and klebsiella pneumoniae; urine cultures from [**2135-7-23**] grew enterococcus, and the patient presented with abdominal pain and hypotension.
On both occasions, appropriate antibiotics were started, and the patient's urinary symptoms and culture positivity resolved.
Respiratory distress: On admission, the patient had CXR and CT findings of a diffuse infiltrative process.
Over the course of his hospitalization, the patient had variable degrees of respiratory distres; sometimes requiring increasing amounts of oxygen for satisfactory blood oxygen saturation.
He frequently developed pulmonary edema, which was however responsive to lasix.
He underwent a thoracentesis to drain pulmonary effusion on [**2135-8-3**].
However, he became tachypneic and desaturated and was transferred to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema.
On the floor he developed some pleuritic chest pain, but this resolved with oxycodone and cardiac enzymes were negative.
# MDS: s/p decitabine finished cycle #1 [**2135-6-9**].
Nevertheless, over the course of this hospitalization, the patient continued to have non-specific weakness, and remained pancytopenic.
Bone marrow biopsy was repeated on [**2135-8-11**] and showed a hypercellular marrow consistent with RAEB-2.
# Anemia and thrombocytopenia: likely secondary to MDS and chemotherapy.
