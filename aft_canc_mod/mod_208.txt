On detailed questioning, she reports that this pain has been gradually getting worse over time, perhaps for over a year now.
She reports that while getting up out of bed recently she felt a sharp stabbing pain in the right lower quadrant that essentially left her immobilized.
This included a CT scan, which revealed a complex solid, cystic adnexal mass measuring 21.8 x 17 x 21.7 cm.
However, a pedunculated fibroid or even leiomyosarcoma could not be excluded as a potential etiology.
She denies any shortness of breath, difficulty with gastrointestinal functioning, abdominal bloating.
She has no family history for ovarian cancer and no history of adnexal masses.
She denies recent fever, and there is no indication that this growth is of the appendix or intestinal in origin.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Mellitus, Type II Hypertension Asthma OSA Obesity Migraine headaches Lower extremity cellulitis GERD Arthritis  Social History: She denies tobacco, drug, or alcohol use.
Father with h/o HTN and CAD, died at age 53.
She also has a niece with MS.  She reports her mother developed lung cancer and had extensive cancer and progression of the disease as reason for her death.
She has no other family history of cancer and has no family history of thromboembolic disorder.
Oral mucosa without evidence of thrush or mucositis.
Neck:  Supple, there is no mass.
Lymph node survey, negative cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
Back:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
Pannus is quite pendulous, and around the umbilicus and inferiorly, there is a woody edema identified.
There is no palpable mass; however, given her morbid obesity, it is extremely difficult to feel anything beyond the pannus.
Extremities: There is no calf tenderness to palpation.
Bimanual exam is limited due to her obesity.

I do not appreciate any nodularity in the posterior cul-de-sac.
I do not appreciate a mass on the left side.
There is no parametrial nodularity.

She tolerated surgery well with 400 cc blood loss, but had reduced urine output requiring 4l NS.
She was briefly hypotensive and hypertensive in the OR, requiring transient phenylephrine.
She arrived in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] ventilated, still paralyzed with epidural anesthesia.
This raised the question of acute hypoxemia vs. long standing (e.g.
secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA).
Her CXR demonstrated decreased lung volumes on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decreased ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
Respiratory acidosis on ABG led to initiation of Bipap as needed.
After developing a fever overnight on POD#[**1-4**], a consultation with the infectious disease team was obtained given concern for aspiration pneumonia.
Vancomycin and zosyn were initiated on POD#2, and ciprofloxacin was added on POD#3 for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Hypotension Given hypotension intraoperatively and the evening of POD#0, the decision was made to hold home antihypertensive medications.
Pain control Pain was controlled with epidural, managed by the acute pain service until discontinuation on POD#2.
Morphine PCA was instituted but later discontinued given low renal clearance.
Renal failure - The patient had significantly decreased UOP during her stay in ICU that was not responsive to IVF.
Renal service was consulted and concluded that ARF was due to ATN precipitated by transient hypotension peri-operatively.
Elevated TSH - On POD#18 ([**11-24**]) the patient was found to have TSH elevated to 7.6 and her cortisol was elevated to 28.
This represents subclinical hypothyroidism that may be due to her multiple acute illness, including recent pneumonia, influenza A infection, and renal failure requiring dialysis.
Diabetes - Patient was on an insulin sliding scale with relatively adequate glycemic control until POD#17.
On POD#23-26 she became hypoglycemic.
An endocrine consult was obtained and they diagnosed iatrogenic hypoglycemia due to glyburide in the setting of renal failure.
DVT -  A DVT of the left lower extremity was diagnosed after swelling was noted on the patient's left leg.
Lovenox was not used due to patient's BMI and renal failure.
Infectious disease:  Patient complained of flu-like symptoms after discharge from the ICU associated with fevers.
She was started A flu swab was obtained and she was diagnosed with influenza A, likely H1N1.
When these antibiotics were discontinued after resolution of the pneumonia, Kefzol was again restarted and discontinued on [**2154-11-30**] when the JP drain was discontinued by plastic surgery.
Postoperatively, she had anemia with hematocrits stable at 22-24%.
The anemia was thought to be due to anemia of chronic disease.
The patient was started on iron TID with colace even though iron studies did not reflect iron deficiency anemia.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
