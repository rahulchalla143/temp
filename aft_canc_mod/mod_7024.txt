Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  --The operation you have experienced is a "scraping" operation; that is to say, the bladder tumor or biopsy sample was "scraped" off the bladder wall.
Because of this tendency for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) must be avoided for 2 weeks following your operation (Tylenol is okay).
If bleeding occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear impairing your stream, call your urologist.
If you develop a fever over 101?????
This can be done by any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners which have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle laxatives such as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at your local drug store.
