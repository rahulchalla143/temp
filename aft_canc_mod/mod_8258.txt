Umbilical hernia repair.
History of Present Illness: 82yoF with AFib on coumadin, CKD, and DM with recent hospitalization [**5-12**] - [**2200-5-16**] for obstructive jaundice, found to have a pancreatic head mass with FNA positive for adenocarcinoma, now returns with cholangitis and biliary stent migration.
Initially, she presented in early [**Month (only) 547**] with painless obstructive jaundice in association with 25lb weight loss over the past 8 months.
She had no other symptoms, including no fevers/chills, N/V/D/C, no change in appetite, no abnormal bowel movements.
During the workup at that time, she was found to have intra/extra hepatic biliary dilatation on ultrasound, from likely extrinsic compression of the pancreatic mass.
She underwent an ERCP which demonstrated probable tumor infiltration into the duodenum with distal CBD stricture and subsequently underwent biliary stent placement, following which her LFTs improved.
She had done okay until symptoms of fever, nausea, and abdominal pain prompted return to the hospital and readmission earlier today ([**2200-5-30**]).

[**2200-6-6**]: PATHOLOGY: Pending    Brief Hospital Course: 82yoF with h/o Afib on Coumadin, CKD, tDM2, PMR, recently diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma (per report pt does not know) s/p ERCP with CBD stent placement 2 weeks ago, who presents with epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, hematemesis x1, ALT/AST > 1000, and acute cholangitis .
# Cholangitis: Initially presented afebrile and looking well, though after admission quickly became febrile and peri-septic, w/ labs indicating cholangitis.
Biliary tree complicated by previous cholangitis, s/p stent placement in early [**Month (only) 547**], and by pancreatic adenocarcinoma in head of pancreas.
She remained afebrile for at least 72 hours prior to discharge.
# Upper GI bleed: The pt has a known pancreatic cancer known to be invading duodenum.
# Pancreatic cancer: pt knows she has a pancreatic mass, but has not yet been told she has cancer on admission.
# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS score is 2.
Her coumadin held on admission for a possible GI bleed, and then reversed w/ FFP for the ERCP.
Amiodarone was held initially due to tranaminitis but given improvement in her LFTs after the drain was place, it was restarted for better rate control.
She did develop some afib with RVR but was asymptomatic.
#Acute on chronic renal failure: baseline Cr 1.7-2.1, on admission 2.4 with elevated BUN likely prerenal azotemia in setting of recently being restarted on lasix, and being peri-septic.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was given IVF but became overloaded and diuresis was initiated in the ICU and continued on the floor.
Reviewed with radiology  and they feel that it is more consistent with atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
Given that her CXR on [**5-29**] was clear, it was more consistent with atelectasis and edema rather than a post obstructiv pneumonia.
They perihilar opacity could reflect edema as well and the pt improved with diuresis.
While on the floor she maintained good oxygen saturations without supplementation.
The patient was transferred to the HBP Surgical Service on [**2200-6-3**] for elective possible Whipple resection.
On [**2200-6-6**], the patient went in OR and during the case she was found to have locally advanced cancer and Whipple was aborted.
The patient underwent open pancreatic biopsy, open cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy and umbilical hernia repair, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
In The PACU patient received one unit of pRBC and several fluid boluses for low urine output.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with NGT, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural for pain control.
Epidural was d/cd on POD # 2 and she was given Dilaudid PCA for pain control with good effect and adequate pain control.
After surgery (on POD # 2) patient developed rapid A-fib with HR 120-140.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
She underwent 2 weeks treatment with IV Cefepime for her blood infection with ENTEROBACTER and CITROBACTER, which was discontinued prior to discharge.
Her wound was evaluated daily and no signs and symptoms of infection were noticed.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; she received one unit of pRBC post op for low urine output.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diabetic diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
