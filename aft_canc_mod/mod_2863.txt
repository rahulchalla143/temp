Admission Date:  [**2152-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Asparagus  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for pericardiocentesis with pigtail catheter placement.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right heart catheterization Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement [**2153-1-1**] Right thoracentesis [**2153-1-3**] Left thoracentesis [**2153-1-5**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with history of hyperlipidemia and GERD, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] for urgent pericardiocentesis with drain placement.
His symptoms began 1 week prior to admission, when he awoke with malaise, cough, and sore throat.
His malaise became worse through the week, and he complained of fevers/chills, as well as n/v/d the day before presentation to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2152-12-30**].
A CXR revealed RLL and RUL infiltrates, and his wbc count was 13.2 with mild L shift.
An echo done later that night showed a large pericardial effusion, and decision was made to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis and pigtail catheter placement.
They deny that he complained of any previous cough, no previous n/v/d, no anorexia or weight loss.
He did have hematochezia approximately 3 weeks ago, however attributed it to a hemorrhoid, and it resolved.
Unsure if he has ever had a PPD test.
Abd: NABS, soft, obese, no dullness to percussion.

Baseline right atrial pressure was markedly elevated with a mean pressure of 30 mmHg.
A promenent pulsus paradoxus was noted in the femoral  arterial tracing, all signs consistent with pericardial tamponade.
Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of approximately 800 cc of grossly bloody fluid.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated minimal luminal  irregularities, with no obstructive lesions in the LMCA, LAD, LCX, or RCA.
Post-pericardiocentesis hemodynamics demonstrated marked respiratory variation in the intracardiac pressure tracings, with pericardial pressure of 10mmHg, and RA pressure remaining elevated.
The PCWP was elevated at 18mmHg, and the cardiac index was low-normal.
Effusive constrictive syndrome.
Chest Portable [**2153-1-1**]:  IMPRESSION: Widened mediastinum and rounded enlargement of the right hilar contours, concerning for lymphadenopathy from a neoplastic process.
Multifocal pulmonary opacities most prominent in the right upper lobe and retrocardiac portions of the lower lobes, which may be due to the history of pneumonia.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small echodense pericardial effusion located and anterior to the left ventricle and extending around the left venticular apex with minimal effusion anterior to the right ventricle.
No evidence for tamponade or constriction are seen.
Right upper lobe lung mass with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, suspicious for primary lung cancer with extensive nodal spread.
No pulmonary embolism.
Small low attenuation lesion in the liver too small to characterize.
No lymphadenopathy within the abdomen or pelvis.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with lower lobe consolidation and collapse.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT head [**2153-1-6**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial metastases.
Bone Scan [**2153-1-8**]:  IMPRESSION: No foci of osseous metastatic disease.
PATHOLOGY:  Pericardial fluid [**2153-1-1**]: DIAGNOSIS: Positive for malignant cells, consistent with poorly   differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
A few atypical but degenerated epithelial cells present in a   background of pulmonary macrophages, bronchial cells,   squamous cells and inflammatory cells.
Suspicious for metastatic non-small carcinoma.
Rare highly atypical epithelial cells present, especially in   additionally prepared cytospin slide and Heme slide (1403D;   [**2153-1-3**]).
Note: Immunostains performed on cytospin slides including   monoclonal CEA, calretinin, CK7 and CK20 are not   contributory due to scant atypical cells and high background   staining.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old male ex-smoker with hyperlipidemia and GERD, who presented to OSH with multilobar pneumonia, large pericardial effusion, desaturation requiring extubation, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement.
1) Hypotension, shock:  Thought to be cardiogenic in nature, secondary to tamponade as demonstrated on echo and confirmed in the cath lab.
He received fluids and his hemodynamics markedly improved after drainage of his pericardial effusion.
2) Pericardial effusion:  On arrival, 850 cc of hemorrhagic fluid were drained in cath lab.
Given the patient's bilobar pneumonia, mildly elevated calcium at OSH, and heavy smoking history, there was concern for bronchogenic carcinoma.
3) Non-small cell lung cancer:  A CT of his chest demonstrated a 3.5 x 3.5 cm mass within the right upper lobe medially; areas of collapse/consolidation adjacent to this; extensive lymphadenopathy within the prevascular, pretracheal, subcarinal, and right hilar regions, the largest lymph node conglomerate measuring 2.3 x 5.8 cm in the subcarinal region; no pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes; 3.1 x 2.7 cm right paratracheal lymph node as well as a 2.4 x 2.9 cm left prevascular lymph node; right hilar lymph node measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.7 cm.
As above, the cytology from his pericardial effusion was consistent with a poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, making bronchoscopic biopsy unecessary.
A staging workup was negative for brain or bone metastases, and the remainder of his CT did not show intra-abdominal metastases.
He was comfortably breathing room air on discharge, and had been afebrile for days.
found to have elevated creatinine on presentation to OSH - thought to be pre-renal from dehydration in the setting of infxn, nausea and vomiting.
6) Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  He had a gap acidosis on arrival, thought secondary to his lactate of 14, which trended down concurrent with gap closure.
7) Elevated LFTs: His transaminases were in the thousands on arrival, with elevated PT, thought secondary to shock liver.
Troponin was elevated at 0.13, however given his normal CK-MB, this was attributed to impaired clearance with renal failure, and the stress on the heart given his effusion and cardiogenic shock.
To facilitate extubation and improve oxygenation, the patient had bilateral thoracenteses prior.
Both taps yielded 1L of sanguinous fluid, positive for atypical cells.
10) Anemia:  His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-small cell lung cancer Pericardial effusion Pleural effusions bilaterally Pneumonia Acute renal failure, now resolved   Discharge Condition: Good, stable.
Seek medical help if you become more short of breath, or develop lightheadedness or chest pain.
You may need to contact your primary care doctor to obtain a referral for the oncology and pulmonary appointments.
