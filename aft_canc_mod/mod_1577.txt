CTA - no PE  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with pacemaker, active at baseline, presents with 5 days of dyspnea on exertion and found to have RUL pna.
She was improving with decreased O2 requirements and decreased symptoms.
4 hours later the patient became tachypneic.
(Previously 92% on 2 L NC)  At the time, she denied CP, abd pain, cough improved, no sputum.
On exam elevated JVP and diffuse crackles.
An echo revealed new wall motion abnormalities and a decreased EF to 40% compared to [**2098**].
She developed hypotension/renal failure from diuresis and severe pulmonary edema from hydration.
This was weaned and the patient was given hydral and nitro for afterload reduction.
During her cardiac event, she also developed acute on chronic renal failure with a creat peaking at 2.1 (baseline 1.4).
This was likely pre renal [**1-11**] diuresis and low BP.
With decreasing diuresis and stabalized BP her Cr has been improving.
With any hydration, the patient would develop significant pulmonary edema/effusions thought to be secondary to her new heart failure.
Her effusion was tapped on [**2102-3-18**] revealing a exudative effusion (LDH 287).
CXR was consistent with volume overload however she was going into renal failure and thus difficult to diurese.
She was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a natrecor trial.
