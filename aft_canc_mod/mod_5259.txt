Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: neurosurgical biopsy   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 69633**] is a  56 year-old left-handed woman with a PMH of mitral valve prolapse, migraines, parotid gland tumor s/p excission 30 years ago, and sciatica who presents from an outside hospital after presenting with poor balance and lesions found on MRI.
She initially presented to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2144-5-31**] after finding herself weak, poor balance, and 'dizzy.'
In the past few weeks, she had also felt mildly unsteady, tipping over when she walked.
Last week, she developed a severe migraine, typical of migraine headaches she has had in the past.
In the Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 **], she was noted to have right arm weakness.
A noncontrast head CT showed evidence of a left frontal mass.
MRI with and without gadolinium showed 3 ring enhancing lesions in the left frontal lobe with no edema or midline shift.
These were initially felt to be likely metastatic lesions.
Subsequently, the official [**Location (un) 1131**] on the MRI indicated that the lesions appeared more consistent with tumefactive multiple sclerosis, as a number of apparent demyelinating lesions were seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter.
She has had migraines for many years, with fairly intense headaches that occur without visual or neurologic aura.
In addition to migraines, she has a history of lower grade muscle contraction-type headaches for many years.
In retrospect, however, she believes that she had had more of these headaches in the past several months.
She has had no fevers.
There has been no change in appetite or weight.
She has had no nausea.
Before the past few weeks, there has been no focal weakness.
She denies any prior history of transient weakness or visual loss, sensory loss or other symptoms to suggest attacks of demyelinating disease.
She has had no recent travel.
There have been no rashes, shortness of breath or chest pain.
While inpatient she had an MR spect which demonstrated an area of elevated choline /creatinine ratio of 2.6; elevated ratio of greater than 1.5 has been reported in tumors.
Differential including metastatic disease versus tumafective MS;  A lumbar puncture was done which was reportedly negative for any infection.
Neurosurgery saw the patient and thought a brain biopsy would be quite a high risk and could cause further motor deficits.
She was also found to have intermittent left bundle branch block found on her EKG.
Echo done demonstrated an EF of 60% and trace TR and PI.

You are currently on steriods to help reduce the swelling postoperatively.
