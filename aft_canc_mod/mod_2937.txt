The patient is a [**Hospital 4820**] nursing home resident who reports a 3 day history of increased malaise and fatigue.
This was accompanied by left-sided flank pain radiating to her groin and nausea but no emesis.
She had a NGL that was negative, but was noted to have gross blood in the rectal vault.
A CTAP demonstrated a 3 mm right mid-ureteral stone with dilation of the proximal ureter but no hydronephrosis.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without complaints.
Past Medical History: - Schizophrenia vs schizo-affective disorder - Hypertension - CKD III, baselien 1.5-1.7 - DVT - left leg (pre-[**2194**]) unclear associated factors - Right knee periprosthetic undisplaced medial condyle fracture of the femur ([**11/2199**]) - Dementia - major depressive disorder - osteroarthritis both knees - PVD - Parkinsons?--resting tremor - ?p Afib-daughter thinks - Diabetes Insipidus [**12-23**] lithium   Social History: Long-term resident of [**Hospital1 **] Seniior Care of [**Location (un) 55**].
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: on discharge Vitals: 98.6  178/100 72  18  95%RA good UOP-incontinent Pain: denies Access:  PIV Gen: nad, off O2 HEENT: mm dry, no tenderness along temporal region or jaw Neck: able to flex neck-no nuchal ridigity CV: RRR, no m appreciated Resp: CTAB,+ bibasilar crackles, improved with coughing Abd; soft, obese, nontender, +BS Ext; no edema GU: foley removed Neuro: A&OX3, grossly nonfocal, bedbound chronically Skin: no new changes psych: appropriate, pleasant, cooperative .
Imaging/results: GI bleeding study: [**6-3**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
Blood flow images show no active bleeding.
Dynamic blood pool images show no bleeding after 90 minutes.
IMPRESSION:1.No evidence of active GI bleeding.
Non-visualization of kidneys and bladder could relate to chronic renal failure.
Impression: Polyps in the stomach body-->needs f/u for biopsy Erythema in the cardia .
C-scope: [**6-2**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon.
no active bleeding.
3 mm right mid-vreter stone with dilatation of very proximal ureter, but no dilation immediately upstream of the stone.
Probable left internal iliac artery aneurysm.
Aneurysmal dilatation of the right common iliac artery at the bifurcation.
Lung with bibasilar Atx.
Renal US [**6-2**] CONCLUSION: Echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic medical renal disease.
No other abnormality identified by ultrasound of the kidneys.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or other abnormality.
Changes consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Increase peri-hilar fullness.
no infiltrates .
No ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old female with schizophrenia, HTN, CKD III (1.5-1.6), h/o DVT and ?afib on couamdin, chronic DI, PAD admitted for malaise found to have a hct of 19 and active GI bleeding with hypotension/ARF in setting of elevated INR.
Showed pan-diverticulosis with blood in ascending colon but they couldnt identify exact source).
Given HCT still downtrending at that time, ordered bleeding scan on [**6-2**], which was done when pt finally stopped bleeding on [**6-3**], thus was negative.
In total, has required 9U prbc, with HCT now stable X3days w/o any evidence of further bleeding.
Thought is that this was either diverticular bleed or bleed from AVM.
Hospital course complicated by Acute on Chronic renal failure, improved with IVFs.
Of note, pt is very sensitive and easily becomes hyperNa if not give access to adequate free water, thus should have large water available at bedside at all times.
Her CT scan showed b/l iliac aneurysm, she has known vascular disease and is followed as outpt, she can f/u with vascular on nonurgent basis.
Many medications have been held or changed: coumadin stopped as no clear indicaiton.
Acute GI Bleeding: in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
marroon stools ongoing until [**6-2**] night, finally no further marroon stools, now dark/black stools, likely old blood.
s/p 3U ffp/Vit K. On [**6-2**] EGD with nonbleeding polyps, c-scope with diverticulsosis but no bleeding identified, though blood seen in ascending colon.
GI bleeding scan [**6-3**] was negative for acute bleeding, but clinically patient has stopped bleeding as well.
Suspect that this was a diverticular bleed in setting of elevated INR.
-note, needs repeat EGD and c-scope for biopsy of polyps on discharge.
Acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to low-flow state/prerenal/volume depletion.
Renal US no hydro.
UTI: Diagnosed at nursing home, completed 7days of cefpodoxime on [**6-3**].
-foley has been removed -no urinary complaints .
Given long hospitalization and MMP concerning for early infection.
However, has remained afebrile and no leukocytosis, which is comforting.
-UA not sent for some reason.
will defer as no leukocytosis or fevers or urinary complaints.
-repet CXR prelim no infiltrates -likely malaise due to long hospitalization.
Likey component of dehydration as HA seem worse when sodium is high.
Ureteral stone: No signs of hydronephrosis on CT. Urology per urology, no surgical indication at this time.
- Have discussed risks/benefits of ongoing coumadin therapy with daughter (HCP), esp in setting of possible parox Afib (none documented here, per report only, but may be mis-diagnosed given artifact with tremor).
incentive spirometer .
: Patient is currently taking sinemet 25/100 and has a resting tremor, but with unclear diagnosis of Parkinsons.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed s/p 9U blood coagulopathy due to coumadin Hypernatremia due to DI and dehydration Acute on chronic renal failure Ureteral stone, incidental UTI, treated iliac aneurysm, incidental finding   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable, tolerating normal diet  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with GI bleeding in the setting of an elevated coumadin level.
your toprol dose is decreased due to bradycardia.
your lisinopril can be increased if you have uncontrolled HTN .
you finished course of Abx for UTI .
Your CT scan showed incidental finding of ureteral stone, you are started on flomax until [**6-4**].
you had no consequence from this stone (asymptomatic, no hydro).
you are very sensitive to dehydration, you should drink plenty of water daily  Seek immediate medical care if you develop abdominal pain, fevers, or recurrent bleeding.
