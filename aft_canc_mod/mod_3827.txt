Anemia: He presented with a hematocrit drop and had guaiac positive stools.
The most likely source of his bleed is his known gastric mass.
He received 5 units of packed red blood cells and had an appropriate hematocrit response.
H. pylori antibody test returned positive; however, GI recommended that we should not emperically start treatment yet before a final path diagnosis of the gastric mass.
He had no further episodes of melena or bleeding.
He was advised on the warning signs of a recurrent bleed and was told to return to the hospital if any of these events occured.

The lesion is highly suspicious for malignancy.
He will be tentatively scheduled for an endoscopy with ultrasound next week if deeper biopsies are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Low Albumin/Elevated INR: Signs of possible liver disease/liver failure or poor nutrition from poor PO intake prior to admission.
Based on CT scan torso, there is a mass in the liver, likely hemangioma, with recommendations for MRI for further classification.

Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital because of extremely low blood counts.
These blood counts increased appropriately after you received 5 units of red blood cells.
