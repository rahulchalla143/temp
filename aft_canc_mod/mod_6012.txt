Admission Date:  [**2194-7-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-7-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetanus Toxoid / Vasotec / Neomycin / Adhesive Tape / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Cough / shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Dr [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 83 year old [**Hospital1 18**] surgeon, on disability since [**Month (only) 116**] with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
He presents today with worsening O2 sats both at rest and exertion (he keeps an O2 sat monitor at home), worsening cough, and increasing shortness of breath.
Although he has not felt altogether well for the past six months, he had been feeling better since his original admission in [**2194-4-1**], for community-acquired pneumonia, in which he was diagnosed with MM.
Prior to that [**Month (only) 116**] admission he had also been having worsening cough, SOB and DOE.
Three or four weeks ago by his account, he began having cough again, although a CXR was negative for pulmonary process.
He came to the [**Hospital1 18**] and is now admitted for diagnosis and management.
Per heme/onc fellow: "HEMATOLOGIC HISTORY: Dr. [**Known lastname 3314**] was diagnosed in [**4-7**] when he presented with a multilobar PNA and worsening renal function and was found to have serum monoclonal IgA of 2.8 gm.
His renal fxn has generally been stable since admission (creat 2.6->2.1-> 2.4).
Anemia is mild and no hypercalceia.
His skeletal survey did not show lytic lesion but no fx or impending fx.
Beta-2 Microglobulin was elevated but hard to interpret in face of renal insufficiency.
"He was initially treated with Decadron alone and then with Decadron and Thalidomide, however, this was stopped in the setting of disequilibrium and peripheral edema.
The peripheral edema was ultimately thought to be related to some right-sided heart failure and he was thought to be hypervolemic.

GEN: Elderly man in NAD breathing with nasal cannula; sitting forward with arms on knees; ruddy face.
Minimal crackles.
Discoloration at the shins c/w chronic edema.
No petichiae.
EXT: 2+ pitting edema at the ankles.
Mild tremor of hands when extended, less at rest.
[**2194-7-12**] CXR: Development of patchy opacity in the right middle lobe, compatible with atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
[**2194-7-15**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.
Small vessel ischemic changes and calcifications of the left temporal and occipital lobes.
At least two lytic lesions of the skull which likely represent known multiple myeloma.
[**2194-7-15**] TTE: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis.
Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
[**2194-7-16**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of sharply contoured waveforms seen bifrontally and more often with a rightsided predominance in the setting of a slow and disorganized background rhythm.
The significance of the first finding is not entirely clear as there were no frank epileptiform discharges seen.
The second finding is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy suggesting the presence of deeper midline dysfunction.
Medication, metabolic disturbances, infections, or anoxia are among the most common causes but there are others.
There were no clearly epileptiform discharges noted.
No electrographic seizure activity was seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 83 yo [**Hospital1 18**] surgeon with h/o Multiple Myeloma s/p decadron/revlimid therapy, COPD, CHF, afib on coumadin, who initially presented on [**7-12**] with fatigue, low grade fever, and increased productive cough from his baseline.
He noted decreased 02 saturations at home on his pulse ox with increased DOE (92% -> 88%).
He denied any chest pain, pleurisy, orthopnea, n/v/d, or increased LE swelling during that time.
In the ED, he was found to have a RML infiltrate on CXR.
On the morning of transfer, the patient was found unresponsive in his room at 7AM with blood coming from mouth.
He then presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after suffering cardiac arrest in the setting of RML PNA and Staph bacteremia.
Most likely the cause of arrest was felt to be secondary to a poor conduction system given periods of prolonged asystole without capture rhythms and spontaneous return to NSR on telemetry in the MICU.
head CT. MI was unlikely given TTE findings of mild global hypokinesis without focal deficits.
Infection was also in the differential as the patient had a RML PNA and coag neg.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient did not complete artic cooling protocol s/p arrest given periods of prolonged asystole (up to ~10seconds).
On [**7-16**] an EEG was performed, which showed evidence of moderate encephalopathy consistent with deeper midline dysfunction.
The patient did not meet criteria for brain death.
Neurology was consulted to further assess encephalopathy and long-term prognosis, and they corroborated a poor prognosis with low likelihood of a meaningful neurologic recovery.
# Renal failure: rising cre from baseline of 2.0 to 3.3 to 3.9 to 4.6, most likely due to hypoperfusion - either from the initial asystolic arrest or subsequent periods of asystole.
There was concern for arrhythmias given increasing potassium and acidemia.
also found to have coag neg.
staph bacteremia = MRSE.
staph (=MRSE) on admission blood cultures, which was concerning for endocarditis given the patient's immunocompromised state.
This was weaned as tolerated, with anti-hypertensives held.
