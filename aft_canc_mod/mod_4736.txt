She had a CTA, which demonstrated a small outpouching of soft plaque of the aortic arch, which could represent a penetrating ulcer in the wall.
Of note, in [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient had an episode of syncope when walking to the bathroom.
She thereafter developed stridor and was found to have a large mass compressing the distal trachea and mainstem bronchi.
Physical Exam: PE on admission: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Bronchial breath sounds on left.
ronchi at right base CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
PE on discharge: O: Tcurr 97.3 BP 100/48, 82 96 20 98% 2L General: Alert, oriented, mild respiratory distress, thick, raspy cough HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Diffuse ronchi bilaterally CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: .
Known left lung cancer with persistent left upper lung collapse and hazy opacity at the lung base could be from radiation or aspiration.
Right basal atelectasis or aspiration.
No pulmonary embolus.
Incidental small outpouching in the aortic arch likely ulcerated plaque.
Persistent occlusion of the superior segmental bronchus of the left lower lobe and left upper lobe bronchus.
Persistent opacities in the left lung, could be aspiration or radiation changes.
RLL opacities less apparent could be atelectasis or aspiration.
Multiple intercostal branches seen arising from the aorta.
Right intercostal bronchial trunk angiogram reveals a branch supplying the left lung.
Selective left intercostal bronchial trunk arteriogram and embolization using 300 to 500 micron Embospheres.
No anomalus bronchial arterial supply arising off the left subclavian or left internal mammary arterial branch is seen.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
CXR [**1-14**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2102-1-13**]: Greater consolidation in the left lung is probably due to worsening aspiration, although new edema is seen in the right lung.
Large post-treatment atelectasis in the left lung and residual left hilar mass are more prominent, probably because of differences in positioning.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 69 yo woman with h/o end-stage NSCLC s/p XRT and radiation and recent tracheal and bilateral mainstem bronchi stents who presented from home with large-volume hemoptysis, now s/p embolization of right and left mainstem bronchus.
Her Hct has remained at her baseline of 33, and she had no further episodes of hemoptysis while in the ICU.
Interventional pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy, which revealed a large volume of blood in the left lung that coould not be interevened upon.
She had no further episodes of bright red hemoptysis.
Her cough was prdocutive of rust-colored sputum and she had no signs/symptoms of active bleeding for the remainder of the admission.
In order to help her SOB and thick  secretions, she was started on morphine liquid 5 mg as needed, which greatly improved her symptoms.
Symptoms of SOB improved with morphine liquid 5 mg as needed along with albuterol nebulizers PRN.
4. morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Five (5) mL PO Q 2-4 hours as needed for difficulty breathing or pain.
6. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for anxiety.
Tessalon Perles 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every four (4) hours as needed for cough.
18. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Miralax 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 packets* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Hemoptysis Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED Aspirin, this likely put you at higher risk for bleeding in your lungs.
STOPPED Flovent STARTED Morphine Sulfate solution 5mg/10mL every 2-4 hours as needed for shortness of breath STARTED Colace to be taken every day to prevent constipation STARTED Senna and miralax to be taken as needed for constipation .
