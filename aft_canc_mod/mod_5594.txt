He was admitted to the ICU for requirement for NRB and trop of 8.
ECG showed Mobitz I AV block and 0.5-1mm ST depressions in V2-V5.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bilateral crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Bilateral crackles, at bases, no wheezes.
No HSM or tenderness.
Right groin site ecchymoses SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
P-R interval prolongation and type I second degree A-V block is most likely.
However, there is considerable artifact making interpretation difficult.
Somewhat early R wave progression.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Ventricular premature beats are now not seen.
Atrial premature beats are also probably not seen.
TTE [**2137-4-12**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akiensis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe native 3-vessel CAD, with old occlusion of the LAD, RCA, and OM1 proximally, and new 95% proximal and 70% mid stenoses of the LCX.
Patent SVG-OM1, but with proximal filling defect suggestive of a thrombus.
Patent SVG-AM-RCA, but with severe diffuse atherosclerosis (cannot rule out in-stent restenosis) with possible thrombus present.
Stenting of a focal thrombus in the proximal portion of the SVG-OM1.
Angioseal closure of the left femoral arteriotomy site  Brief Hospital Course: 81M with CAD (s/p PCI in [**2129**], CABG in [**2118**]), HTN, HLD, metastatic lung CA, and COPD (on home O2), with NSTEMI s/p cath found to have significant CAD.
# NSTEMI: Pt was transferred from OSH with NSTEMI and EKG revealing new Mobitz type 1 AV block.
He underwent cardiac cath on [**2137-4-11**] which revealed severe 3-vessel native coronary artery disease with several graft stenoses.
The procedure was complicated by a right groin hematoma and brief hypotension to systolic 70s that was felt to be a vasovagal response during closure of sheath.
He initially was not started on a beta blocker due to his AV block.
His AV block was assumed to be due to ischemia from his NSTEMI but pt should follow-up with his cardiologist regarding Holter monitor testing for further evaluation of nodal disease.
His lisinopril was held given his hypotension and worsening renal function.
# SYSTOLIC CHF: ECHO with mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akiensis.
He was diuresed periodically with IV lasix and discharged home on half dose of his home lasix due to worsening renal function.
Lisinopril was held due to low BPs (90s to 110s systolic) and worsening renal function.
He had been started on coumadin at OSH due to concern for PE but this had been discontinued when CTA ruled out PE.
# HYPOTENSION: The patient was briefly hypotensive (systolic 70s) following the first cardiac catheterization, felt likely to be a vasovagal response.
# LUNG CANCER: Pt with history of lung cancer with known mets to liver.
# TRANSAMINITIS: LFTs were elevated at 253/76 on admission and downtrended to 96/51.
Transaminitis may be due to known liver metastases or medications or shock liver.
Iron was borderline low, TIBC low, and ferritin high, indicating anemia of chronic inflammation.
# GERD/BARRETT's: Currently asymptomatic.
# Confusion: Per nursing, pt was mildly confused at night.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 38296**], You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac catheterization because you were found to have a heart attack at an outside hospital.
This medication was held because of your low blood pressures and because of your worsening kidney function -Please talk to your cardiologist about the initiation of a beta blocker -Please speak with your oncologist about whether you should remain on fluconazole as your liver enzyme tests were elevated  Followup Instructions: The following appointments have been scheduled for you:  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-22**] at 9am With:[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Name Initial (MD) **]  [**Name8 (MD) **],MD Address: [**State **], STUITE 245, [**University/College **],[**Numeric Identifier 3471**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98031**]  Hematology/Oncology Appointment:  Thursday, [**4-25**] at 1:15pm With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18365**],MD Location: [**Hospital **] CANCER CENTER Address: [**2137**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 8934**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83767**]  Cardiology Appointment: Tuesday, [**5-21**] at 2pm With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 98032**], MD Location: HEART CENTER OF [**Hospital1 **] Address: [**Location (un) **],2ND FL, [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 7398**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6256**]    Completed by:[**2137-4-17**
