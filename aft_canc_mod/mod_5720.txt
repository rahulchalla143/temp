The patient had been lost to medical follow up for 40 years until he presented to [**Hospital3 **] previously with black stools, anemia to 20.4, early satiety and 20lb weight loss.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where repeat EGD revealed a gastric mass that was positive for moderately differentiated gastric adenoma with lymphatic invasion.
CT torso revealed suspicious hilar lymph nodes and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
The patient had been doing well since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] until he developed fatigue and SOB and presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2136-1-21**] with initial VS 66 152/60 RR 33 91% on NRB.
He also was noted to have a fib with RVR and hypotension to 80s systolic; was given adenosine without improvement.
He was started on dilt gtt and became hypotensive to 70s; dilt was stopped and pressures improved to 100s-110s.
He was started on IV heparin (not thrombolytics because of his recent GIB), nexium IV gtt for PPX and admitted to the [**Location (un) 5353**] MICU.
The patient developed acute SOB and became hypoxic requiring 100% NRB and was nearly intubated, however, a blood gas was reassurring and he settled out to 100% on 70% FIO2 at 45L/min high flow mask.
On the floor, he reports mild pleuritic chest pain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: 1) Lost to medical care for 40 years until [**12/2135**] when dx with gastric adenocarcinoma 2) Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed on EGD biopsy with likely diffuse pulmonary metastasis and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Inferior Q waves and slight ST segment elevations consistent with inferior myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-12-27**] the rate is faster and lateral ST-T wave changes are present.
Right-sided DVT involving the distal superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein, and posterior tibial veins.
[**2136-1-23**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Q waves with mild  ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in leads II, III and aVF with T wave abnormalities in leads I, aVL and V6.
Since the previous tracing  of [**2136-1-23**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**2136-1-23**] CXR: Moderate right pleural effusion is probably larger today than it was on [**1-21**] and the opacification in the right lower lobe is atelectasis, explained by the large ipsilateral pulmonary embolus.
There is no appreciable left pleural effusion.
Heart is normal size, but the azygos vein is dilated suggesting there may be elevated central venous pressure due to right heart strain.
[**2136-1-24**] TTEcho: Severely dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2136-1-24**] CXR: Moderate right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis are improving.
No pneumothorax.
[**2136-1-26**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities.
Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-1-23**] inferior and anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities persist.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo man recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after new dx of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma [**2135-12-31**] who was transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] ICU with saddle PEs and for evaluation for emergent embolectomy.
#) Massive saddle pulmonary embolism: Patient with severe hypoxemia, extensive thrombus in most major pulmonary arterial branches bilaterally per CTA, and evidence of RV strain with S1Q3T3, elevated troponin, and RV dilation on CTA, which are 3 major indications for thrombolysis or embolectomy.
Thrombolysis was not pursued given patient's metastatic carcinoma and recent internal bleeding.
Patient underwent b/l LENIs which showed b/l thrombi, R>L (right distal superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein, and posterior tibial veins, left popliteal vein).
Patient underwent echocardiogram which showed severely dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, as well as mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
#) Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma: Patient with severe metastatic disease; was scheduled to start chemotherapy but has not yet received treatment.
Hilar lymphadenopathy noted on CT. CT of the head did not demonstrate any metastases.
Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 116**], most recent plan has been for palliative chemotherapy.
In anticipation of chemotherapy, patient transfused 1 unit PRBCs prior to discharge, given persistent anemia during his hospital course.
#) Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient had episode of AF with RVR and was started on metoprolol and digoxin.
#) Elevated transaminases: Patient presented with transaminases in the 1000s, with acute increase from 60s, highly suggestive of shock liver and/or passive congestion from his significant RH strain.
Elevations may also be secondary to liver metastases.
#) Anemia: Likely multifactorial in setting of GIB and anemia of chronic disease (metastatic gastroadenocarcinoma).
#) Nutrition: Diminished PO intake secondary to early satiety.
In speaking with the outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 116**], she did not recommend placement of feeding tube, given that goal was for palliative chemotherapy to reduce gastric tumor burden, potentially allowing patient to tolerate increased PO intake.
#) Probable CAD: Patient with inferior Q waves that correlate with inferior wall motion abnormality on stress imaging; echo with mild left regional systolic dysfunction.
Had a troponin leak on admission that was attributed to right heart strain +/- demand in the setting of hypotension.
Held ASA given recent GI bleed and simvastatin given shock liver.
#) GERD: Patient was initially on Protonix 40mg IV BID per above in setting of recent GIB, and he was transitioned to an oral PPI prior to discharge.
-Patient discharged on lovenox with [**Hospital1 **] dosing, will likely need assistance with finding additional resources to help him pay the expensive co-pays -Patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored  Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 20mg daily (recently stopped) Metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily Protonix 40mg PO daily Acetaminophen 500mg PO TID Prn pain Zofran 4mg PO Q6H prn nausea   Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Pain.
Disp:*60 syringes* Refills:*2* 9. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety.
Activity Status: Ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 3142**],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] after you were found to have a large blood clot in your lungs.
Studies showed that you have blood clots in both of your legs, and you have a filter placed to help prevent these clots from breaking off and going to your lungs.
The blood clot in your lung caused you to develop a fast, abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, that was controlled with new medications.
STARTED lorazepam to use as needed for anxiety  We did not make any other changes to your medications.
You should continue to take tylenol as needed for pain and ondansetron as needed for nausea.
