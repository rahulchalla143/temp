There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
There is a gallstone within the gallbladder.
There are multiple left renal cysts and a right renal lesion that is too small to characterize, that probably represents a cyst.
There is dilatation of the cecum with diameter measuring up to 12.3 cm.
No dilated loops of small bowel are seen.
Note is made of subtle pneumatosis of the cecum with no wall edema.
The transverse colon measures up to 7.8 cm, only mildly dilated by size criteria with no wall edema or pneumatosis.
There is a focal narrowing of the lumen of the sigmoid flexure with adjacent peritoneal metastasis producing a low-grade obstruction at this location.
There is an inflammatory mass located at the mid-upper pelvis (series 5, image 69).
Rectal contrast material passes freely through the rectum and sigmoid colon to the level of this inflammatory mass (series 7, image 24).
There is no intra-abdominal free air.
There is no mesenteric or portal venous gas.
There is no pelvic free fluid.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION: 1) Dilatation of the cecum with measurement up to 12.3 cm, and only mild dilatation of the transverse colon, with the descending colon being of normal diameter.
There is a focal area of mild luminal narrowing at the splenic flexure with adjacent mesenteric/serosal metastasis.
More inferiorly, in the mid pelvis there is an ill-defined mesenteric metastatic lesion, with rectal contrast noted to clearly pass from the rectum through the sigmoid colon up to the level of this mass.
Notably, there is residual stool present within the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Taken together, findings are suggestive of at least a partial large bowel obstruction.
Complete or high-grade obstruction cannot be excluded as rectal contrast material was not noted to pass through the level of this inflammatory mass.
Further evaluation could be performed with a barium enema to assess for passage of contrast through this level.
2) Pneumatosis is noted of the cecum, without associated wall edema.
It is not felt to be likely due to ischemia.
There is diffuse distention of the large bowel to the level of the distal sigmoid colon, at which point there appears to be an abrupt cut off which corresponds to an area of serosal implant seen on the prior CT of [**2183-10-30**].
Overall, the findings are highly concerning for distal large bowel obstruction.
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
IMPRESSION: Findings highly suspicious for distal large bowel obstruction.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on [**2173**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
There is no sizeable pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2183-11-30**] Chest Xray FINDINGS: Compared with [**2183-11-22**], there has been partial interval clearing of the left lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate/effusion.
No infiltrates are seen in the left mid/upper and right lung fields.
CT scan and KUB showed evidence of large bowel obstruction.
She was taken to the operating room on HD 1 where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, abdominal colectomy, sigmoid mucous fistula and ileostomy,  transgastric gastrojejunostomy, tube placement and splenic flexure takedown.
At POD 1 she was tachycardic and with low urine output.
Blood pressure was elevated and continued to be controlled with IV metoprolol.
At POD 4 tube feedings continued with reports of high residuals.
A KUB was completed without evidence of obstruction.
At POD 7 she had high ostomy output.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for slow ostomy output.
