She was reportedly doing well until rehabilitation until the am of admission when she had a witnessed aspiration event and then was subsequently asystolic, hypotensive, cyanotic.
She was noticed at the [**Location (un) **]to have no pupillary reflexes, vestibulo-ocular reflexes or spontaneous respirations at the time.
Bipolar disease.
Diverticular disease.
Staph bacteremia as in previous discharge summary.
There is no dolls eyes.
There is some spontaneous pupillary oscillation.
Decerebrate posturing was elicited to painful stimuli, no deep tendon reflexes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable on the ventilator.
Bronchoscopy was done to rule out a foreign body which was negative.
Neurology consultation was obtained for continued myoclonus and for evidence of hippus.
Broncoscopy was done to rule out foreign body.
MRI was obtained which was negative for mass and showed possible enhancement of the caudae nuclei on preliminary read thought consistent with anoxic encephalopathy.
It was initially thought secondary to propofol.
After discussion with the daughter, there was some evidence of a gag and evidence of spontaneous respirations and she was extubated.
Per Neurology, this was actually a sign of poor prognosis, but after further discussion with the daughter, we elected to treat with the Dilantin load and see if there is any improvement in response.
The next day an electroencephalogram still showed some seizure activity after Dilantin load, but at this point given no significant response of the patient to any stimuli, no signs of any neurologic recovery, it was elected to make her comfort measures only, and she expired the next day with her daughter at the bedside.
Asystolic arrest secondary to aspiration.
Metastatic ovarian cancer.
