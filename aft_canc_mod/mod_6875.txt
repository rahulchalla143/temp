Admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] [**2-26**] with Hgb/Hct 1.9/6.1 due to bleeding from mass.
He also had an initial leukocytosis of 69 thouusand.
He was evaluated by oncology who recommended palliative radiation, but he was unable to tolerate it due to claustrophobia.
He states that the mass grew to its current size approximately 1 year ago and has been constant since then.
It has been bleeding slowly for several months.
More recently, he went to [**State 792**]Hospital and had a biopsy which showed squamous cell cancer.
Due to inability to stop the bleeding, multiple teams were called for evaluation and treatment, and he was transferred to the ICU.
Past Medical History: Facial squamous cell carcinoma for which pt has intermittently refused medical care x 4 years.
?Psychiatric history- seems to have features c/w schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder.
Family History: Sister died of uterine cancer in her 50s.
Physical Exam: Physical exam on discharge: Tm 97.3 Tc 97.1 BP 106/74 HR 80 R 20 O2 Sat 99% on RA Gen- NAD, cachectic, comfortable in bed but occassionally picking at face and wound dressing Skin- erythema and swelling around right eye HEENT- large, fungating, purulent and foul smelling mass on left face with serosanguinous drainage.

Has persistent delusions re: being a miracle and at times states that he thinks his prognosis is good.
Head CT [**3-3**] at OSH: Large right facial mass with involvement of right orbit, right maxillary sinus, right mandibular condyle.
14 cm mass involving the right side of face with destruction of much of the right maxillary sinus, involvement or right orbit, right mandible, and surrounding musculature and superficial right parotid 2.
2.5 cm cystic area anterior to the right maxiallary antrum adjacent to the lateral aspect of the right side of the nose, possibly hematoma, necrosis, or infection 3.
Asymmetry of the soft tissues along lateral posterior aspect of the right side of the tongue, possibly with local tonsillar enlargement or soft tissue mass.
Bilateral submandibular and upper julular region adenopathy.
Imaging: [**2198-3-14**] CT Head and Neck: IMPRESSION: Large fungating/necrotic right facial mass which, although extensive, does not appear to have intradural involvement despite bony erosion.
[**2198-3-20**] CXR: Imaged left lung widespread opacities are unchanged, except increasing left retrocardiac opacity, could be atelectasis.
There is no right pleural effusion.
[**2198-3-22**] Video oropharyngeal swallow test: IMPRESSION: There is gross aspiration of both puree and nectar thick liquid boluses.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57M with squamous carcinoma involvement of right face and hostory of facial bleeding, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with active facial bleeding.
#.Facial Mass: From large fungating growth of squamous cell carcinoma, requiring 6 units pRBCs in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Medical Oncology was consulted and felt there to be no indication for systemic therapy.
He was subsequently transferred to the Medicine service where his hematocrit remained stable until the evening of [**3-24**] when he again developed a brisk bleed from his facial mass.
Repeat embolization procedure was discussed with Neuro IR, but the decision was made not to proceed with the procedure as the patient would again have to be electively intubated for the procedure and the bleeding had subsided with conservative measures.
A meeting was held involving the ICU team, Ethics, Social Work and Palliative Care where it was decided that there would not be any more interventions for this mass and that it was within the province of the physicians treating the patient to decide not to intervene in this situation.
Following embolization, patient became hypoxic and self-extubated.
Subsequently, he was found to have total collapse of his left lung, likely secondary to the interval development of copious secretions and a presume VAP.
With concern for VAP during his mucous plugging event, his antibiotics were changed to vanc/zosyn, which covered his wound culture from OSH by sensitivities.
At the time of discharge, he is no longer on any antibiotics for his wound as he is CMO.
# Hypercalcemia:  This was presumed secondary to PTH-rP secretion by squamous cell tumor.
# Nutrition:  Following extubation, patient failed his speech and swallow evaluation.

We embolized part of your tumor to stop some of this bleeding.
We also intubated you for this procedure.
While you were intubated, you developed pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics.
Please talk to your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] doctor about any concerning symptoms you have.
