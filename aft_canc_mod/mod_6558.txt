+Bronchial breath sounds at left base.
There is a firm, nontender subcutaneous nodule in the LUQ and what feels like gas-filled bowel loops in the RUQ.
No tenderness to palpation, no distention.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis on left and 1+ on right.

Right bundle-branch block.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Echo [**2176-11-21**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: dilated, hypocontractile right ventricle without evidence of major pulmonary hypertension (although pulmonary artery pressure may have been underestimated), tricuspid regurgitation, or pulmonic valve dysfunction  Chest Xray [**2176-11-21**] Extensive left lung changes including interstial opacity, effusion and hilar enlargement as well as right pulmonary edema.
No hemorrhage or areas of significant vascular stenosis or occlusion.
Left pleural effusion and soft tissue density along the left pulmonary artery, incompletely assessed.
Left hilar mass with upper lobe lymphangitic spread concerning for a primary lung malignancy.
Left greater than right pleural effusions.
Numerous diffuse metastases within the liver and right adrenal gland.
Diffusely infiltrated liver with innumerable nodules, concerning for diffuse metastatic disease.
Small perihepatic ascites, and as well as right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old woman with history of dementia and CHF who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock and found to have metastatic cancer.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure.
She originally presented with hypoxia and dyspnea, likely related to an underlying lung malignancy.
# Septic Shock: She presented with hypotension requiring pressors.
She was started on Vancomycin and Meropenem, as well as Levaquin for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
She was later found to have a left hilar lung mass that may have been contributing to a post-obstructive pneumonia.
# Metastatic Cancer: She was diagnosed with metastatic cancer during this admission of unknown primary.
She had subcutaneous nodule on her abdomen and elevated liver enzymes and was found to have a left hilar lung mass suspicious for a lung cancer primary on CT scan.
She was also found to have multiple metastases to her liver.
# Congestive Heart Failure:  She had some evidence of volume overload on exam and chest xray but was not diuresed due to likely septic shock.
She had a TTE on admission that showed a preserved EF but hypocontractile right ventricle with severe pulmonary hypertension.
# Weakness on neurologic exam: She had right lower extremity weakness that was felt to be due to her prior hip fracture.
# Elevated INR: She had an INRo on admission that was felt to be both nutritional and due to her substantial liver disease due to metastases.
