HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old male who presents with a left neck mass that was initially noted in [**2140-3-30**] and has become progressively larger.
The neck mass has been worked up to be a paraganglioma located at the carotid bifurcation.
The patient has had a magnetic resonance imaging with angiography preoperatively as well as a fine-needle aspiration which revealed no malignancy.
The magnetic resonance imaging identified findings were significant with a large paraganglioma.
The patient denies any symptoms other than pain and discomfort.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father has a history of coronary artery disease and has had a coronary artery bypass graft.
He was admitted in [**2139-3-31**] to the [**Hospital1 69**] following a drug overdose during which he was found unresponsive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation, the patient presented as a pleasant 49-year-old male in no acute distress.
His oropharynx was clear with no masses or lesions.
There was an obviously palpable large mass overlying his left neck anterior to his sternocleidomastoid.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
He also had fine-needle aspiration.
The tests demonstrated findings consistent with a benign paraganglioma.
He tolerated the procedure well, and his mass notably shrank following embolization.
The patient tolerated the procedure quite well; however, his paraganglioma enclosed both his internal and external carotid and was difficult to resect.
Resection of the tumor required a transection of the carotid artery below the level of the bifurcation.
Postoperatively, however, the patient had a noted defect in his hypoglossal nerve.
This was manifested by left axis deviation and inability to move the tongue toward the left.
His neck incision remained clean, dry, and intact with no hematoma.
