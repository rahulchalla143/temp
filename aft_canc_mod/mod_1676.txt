Admission Date:  [**2194-6-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-4-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cyclophosphamide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: transient CP found to be hypotensive with evidence of UTI --> code sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 63f with cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic RCC with known liver involvement who presented to ED with c/o CP found to be hypotensive and jaundice.
Pt reports 4 days of worsening jaundice and abdominal pain.
Pain is poorly described without clear localization.
Most recent BM several days ago was normal in color without evidence of bleeding.
No hematemesis.
Pt describes a 30 minute episode of CP in the setting of nausea that resolved on its own.
No LE Edema.
Mild dry/unproductive cough.
Given BB and ASA for CP protocol and became transiently hypotensive.
Pt not tx candidate, being seen by hospice.

Multiple heterogeneous masses in the liver, representing known cholangiocarcinoma.
Bilateral mild intrahepatic ductal dilation.
Widespread liver metastases, with findings more suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma than metastatic renal cell cancer.
Findings consistent with extrinsic compression of the extrahepatic common hepatic duct by a large metastasis in the caudate lobe, including associated intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Smooth appearance of the intra- and extra-hepatic ducts without strictures or areas of focal abnormality.
Layering sludge within the gallbladder, but no evidence of sludge or stones in the bile ducts.
Low signal lesion in the left kidney, previously characterized as most likely representing a renal cell carcinoma.
Renal US: No hydronephrosis.
This cystic structure projected within the renal sinus on some of the sagittal images is consistent with the previously known large renal cyst.
No definite hydronephrosis.
CXR on admission: Consolidation in bilateral lower lobes, which may represent pneumonia or aspiration superimposed upon underlying chronic lung disease.
A component of pulmonary edema is also possible.
Note is made of increased faint opacities in left lower lobe, with interstitial opacities, which may represent pulmonary edema, however, superimposed pneumonia especially in left lower lobe is also a possibility if the patient has infectious symptoms.
Note is made of opacity in right lower lobe as well, which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Possible small pleural effusion is seen.
Lung volumes are small due to low inspiratory level.
Note is made of somewhat prominent colon gas with elevated left diaphragm.)
Sepsis: On admission the pt was noted to have a lactate of >4, tachycardia, hypotension and a UA that was suggestive of infection.
The preliminary read of the patient's CXR was atelectasis, however, subsequent read suggested bibasilar infiltrates that could be consistent with pneumonia.
On arrival to the ICU, the pt was afebrile without tachycardia or tachypnea.
The sepsis protocol was discontinued on HD#2 as the pt was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Zosyn was continued to cover uti, possible cholangitis (though unlikely), and possible aspiration pneumonia.
# Jaundice: The pt had a bilirubin that was elevated markedly from baseline, though alkaline phosphatase remained only somewhat elevated from baseline.
This raised concer for extrinsic compression of the biliary tree from tumor.
MRCP was obtained and showed extrinsic compression from a mass in the caudate lobe of the liver.
# ARF: FENA was low, renal US was negative for hydronephrosis.
# CAD: CP was not felt to be cardiac in nature.
The pt had a fixed defect on MIBI but initial enzymes were negative by CK.
# CHF: reported EF 50-65% ([**2192**]).
Diuretic and Aldactone were held given volume status and ARF.
# HTN: as above held anti-HTN .
# Pain control:  One of the patient's main complaints was pain.
She described diffuse pain that was bothersome constantly.
# COPD/pulm fibrosis: Felt to be stable.
Pt became progressively more dyspneic and after extensive discussion with the family, the patient was made comfort care only.
Family was present and requested an autopsy   Medications on Admission: Bumetanide 3mg [**Hospital1 **] ASA 325 Aldactone 25 qd Lipitor 20 Protonix 40 Toprol XL 25 KCL 180 MEq [**Hospital1 **] Colace Ambien 10mg qhs Azathioprine 10mg qd Oxycodone 5mg q4hr prn   Discharge Medications: n/a  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: urosepsis pneumonia cholangiocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: n/a  Followup Instructions: n/a   Completed by:[**2194-6-25**
