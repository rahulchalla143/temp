He has been experiencing DOE for the past year but has never experienced symptoms at rest before.
He reports that in the last three days, he has had two meals of Chinese food as well as soup and a sub.
He did not experience chest pain or pressure and did not feel that his heart was racing.
He was scheduled to undergo AVR in [**2-/2180**], but this was placed on hold due to an unexplained leukocytosis.
During his pre-op workup, he noted pain and a "bump" in his right sholder/axilla.
He recently underwent a skin biopsy and ultrasound guided LN biospy which was c/w melanoma.
The full work up and management plan of his melanoma is pending.
His CXR was c/w pulmonary edema for which he was given lasix 20 mg IV x1, but unfortunately UOP was not recorded.
He was given metoprolol 2.5 mg IV x2, without significant improvement in his rhythm or his rate.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Aortic stenosis (valve area 0.6, awaiting AVR) -Hypertension -Benignprostatic hypertrophy -Prostate cancer- s/p cryotherapy -Bladder cancer- s/p chemoteherapy -Atrial Fibrillation - dx ~7-8 years ago (warfarin held due to plan for surgery) -HLD -GERD -s/p Back surgery -s/p Appendectomy -right arm melanoma with possible metastasis to the right axilla (recently dx)  Social History: Married for 57 years, retired firefighter after 35 years.
No tattoos, no pets.
[**Name (NI) **] history of a PPD placed.
Father died of an MI at age 51.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular rate, nl s1, very soft s2, high pitched systolic murmur heard throughout, most prominent in b/l sternal borders.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
+Bibasilar crackles (~1/4 up the lung fields), limited scattered wheezes, slight decreased BS in right base, but no egophony was appreciated.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Trace to 1+ b/l LE edema, no clubbing noted.
No evidence of metastatic disease to the brain.
Abnormal signal at the level of the posterior aspect of the clivus as well as involving the dens and C2 vertebral body suspicious for metastatic disease.
No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology.
Interval increase in size of the right axillary mass, multiple mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules, concerning for metastatic disease.
Extensive calcification in the aortic annulus, likely resulting in aortic stenosis.
Severe coronary arterial calcification.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with bibasal opacities, which may represent infection or aspiration.
[**4-5**] URINE CYTOLOGY - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo M with severe AS (valve area of 0.6) awaiting AVR, known afib (previously on warfarin/now on lovenox), dCHF and recently diagnosed melanoma presenting with acute onset of shortness of breath at rest.
# Dyspnea / Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] admits to occasional dietary indescretions leading to heart failure exacerbations, and most recently over the weekend he had chinese food.
He was noted on admission CXR to have pulmonary edema with bibasilar crackles on exam.
His dyspnea improved with continued diuresis and he was discharged home on 40mg lasix PO daily.
# Critical aortic stenosis Valve area of 0.6 with gradients around 40.
Further evaluation revealed melanoma and a large axillary mass of unknown etiology.
Given his poor prognosis if he does have metastatic disease, the decision was made to pursue symptomatic treatment of his AS with valvuloplasty.
# Melanoma He recently underwent a skin biopsy which was consistent with melanoma.
He also underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of an axillary lymph node.
A CTA showed interval enlargement of the axillary lymph node, as well as possible lung mets.
# Atrial fibrillation with borderline RVR He had previously been treated with atenolol.
# CAD: Pt is s/p MI in [**2169**] and [**2177**], most recent PCI in [**2177**] (BMS).
Pt denies CP during this admission.
With negative troponins and no evidence of ischemia on ECG.
He denies recent fevers.
He was recently evaluated by ID, but the etiology of his rising white count remains unclear.
His differential is currently left shifted without abnormal cells noted.
Unlikely to be caused by his recently dx malignancy and there is no current evidence for a hematologic malignancy.
# HTN The patient reported that his BP meds other than atenolol were recently stopped in preparation for his upcoming surgery.
