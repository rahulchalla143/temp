Admission Date:  [**2197-4-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-4-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-8-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old woman with history of Alzheimer's disease and hypercholesterolemia who has had two to three months of 25 pound weight loss, anorexia and dysphagia.
She also reports increased burping.
This was thought initially to be a side effect of Aricept, which was started approximately six months ago, however, with persistence of these symptoms, she reported to her primary care physician's who initiated a malignancy work-up.
She was found to have pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray suspicious for lung metastases, guaiac positive stools, anemia, increased LFTs and also a bone scan positive for metastatic disease.
There were no clots and no sputum.
She had no other associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, chest pain, lightheadedness, melena, bright red blood per rectum or abdominal pain.
The patient was sent from the Emergency Room where her vital signs were stable to the Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Suite where it was revealed an abnormal mucosa in the esophagus from 30 cm to 22 cm distally with adherent clot and moderate oozing.
Colonoscopy was not performed at that time secondary to active bleeding and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for one night for observation.
Weight loss, dysphagia, anorexia, pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray guaiac positive stools, metastatic bone lesion on bone scan, increased LFTs, 3.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease.
Father with duodenal/stomach cancer.
Mother with question of mass in chest.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or chest pain.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly, no axillary lymphadenopathy.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, dry mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  No edema.
Left lower extremity greater than right lower extremity weakness, [**2-28**] on the left and [**4-30**] on the right.
WORK-UP PRIOR TO ADMISSION ON [**3-23**]:  Sedimentation rate 68, ALT 33, AST 71, alkaline phosphatase 296, T bilirubin .8, GGT 81, albumin 3.8, total protein 6.9, globulin 3.1, calcium 9.9, TSH 2.6, iron 3, total cholesterol 218, TIBC 280, B12 984, folate greater than 20, ferritin 245, TRF 215, HDL 65, cholesterol to HDL ratio 3.4, SPEP abnormal band in gamma region 2% of total protein, IgG 698, IgA 318, IGM 214, IFE monoclonal IgM cap was seen.
CT of the head without contrast [**2196-6-26**]:  Moderate atrophy without significant abnormalities.
Mammogram [**2196-12-27**]: No evidence of malignancy.
Chest PA and lateral [**2197-2-24**]: Extensive pulmonary and right hilar metastases.
Bone scan [**2197-4-7**]:  Positive for multiple foci of increased activity, most likely secondary to metastatic disease, particularly in the right iliac crest within parietal region of calvaria.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**2197-4-10**]:  Normal stomach, normal duodenum, esophagus with abnormal mucosa with bleeding in esophagus from 30 cm where the TE junction is seen to 22 cm proximally, adherent clot, active bleeding and friability.
Lumen narrowed with ulceration and irregular mucosa.
Biopsy performed at lower [**12-29**] of esophagus and middle [**12-29**] of esophagus.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 74-year-old woman with metastatic cancer of unclear etiology, although esophagogastroduodenoscopy results reveal bleeding ulcerations along the esophagus suggesting primary adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Patient had no more episodes of hematemesis or any other signs of active bleeding.
On the second day of admission, she was noted to have increased coagulation factors.
The biopsy taken during esophagogastroduodenoscopy was nondiagnostic as it was mainly clot and necrotic tissue.
However, a CT scan was done of her torso showing mediastinal lymphadenopathy, right hilar adenopathy, dilation of esophagus with air fluid level in the distal esophagus and distal esophageal wall markedly thickened beyond TE junction suspicious for malignancy.
Innumerable pulmonary metastatic lesions and metastatic liver lesions, little normal liver tissue left,  right adrenal mass likely metastases, renal cyst bilaterally, no free fluid or free air in the peritoneal cavity or pelvic cavity, no lytic or blast lesions seen in the bone.
Of note, cavitary metastatic lesions in lungs suggestive of squamous cell primary.
Given this, result of her CT scan, as well as what was done prior with definite metastatic disease, the patient's husband was seen by the Home Hospice Service and choose this as the next route management.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her oncologist also felt that were no aggressive therapeutic measures to be done at this point, however, at a later time, if she becomes more symptomatic in terms of her swallowing or breathing, there may be room for palliative radiation or stenting placement in her esophagus.
Metastatic cancer, possibly of eosphageal origin.
