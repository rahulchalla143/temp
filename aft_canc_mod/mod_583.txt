Positive nausea and vomiting times two; no shortness of breath.
He never has had chest pain like this prior.
No fever or chills, no cough.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems reveals two months of increasing fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance.
No abdominal pain, no change in bowel movements.
In the Emergency Department, the patient had a temperature of 95.6 F.; heart rate of 60; blood pressure of 160/110; respiratory rate of 16, saturating 100% O2 on two liters nasal cannula, in moderate distress with several episodes of vomiting.
EKG showed new T wave inversion in II, III and AVF with no ST elevation or depression.
The patient was given Nitroglycerin, Lopressor, aspirin, heparin, morphine with decrease in the chest pain to five out of ten.
Cardiology was consulted for question of ischemia.
Prior to Cardiology consultation in the Emergency Department, the patient then developed change in his characterization of pain to the epigastric area.
CT scan was done which showed a Type B aortic dissection originating at the left subclavian to the level of the diaphragm.
The patient at that point resumed on his intravenous blood pressure medications with a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to 120s and heart rate to the 70s.
At that point, the patient was transferred to the floor during which he was lying more comfortably and states that chest pain had decreased.
Positive nausea and complaint of increased thirst.
Type 2 diabetes melitis with last hemoglobin A1C of 5.2; history of increased fingersticks secondary to dietary indiscretion.
Metastatic prostate cancer status post radiation therapy with radiation proctitis with resistance to androgen therapy.
HCV positive with low viral load, increased liver function tests at baseline.
History of RPR positive with treponemal antibody positive ([**2098-5-1**]).
Orbital cellulitis ([**2100-1-1**]).
ALLERGIES:   He has an allergy to Niferex which causes anaphylaxis and an allergy to ACE inhibitors which causes angioedema.
On general examination, this is an elderly male who looks uncomfortable but is in no acute distress.
Head and Neck examination: Pupils are minimally constrictive, but equal.
No jugular venous distention.
Carotids are two plus with no bruits.
Extremities with no lower extremity edema.
EKG shows T wave inversions in II, III and AVF with normal sinus rhythm at 60.
Extra-luminal contrast within a mural hematoma associated with dissection at the level of the aortic arch.
Emphysematous changes in the lungs.
Scattered mediastinal nodes.
New minimal left basilar atelectasis.
Abdominal ultrasound with fatty infiltration of the liver, hyper dense focus in the gallbladder wall with no stones.
On the third hospital day, both the Nitroprusside and Labetalol drips were turned off secondary to low systolic blood pressure and heart rate.
Cardiology was re-consulted to follow-up with request for recommendations of blood pressure control.
Hytrin was also started at 5 mg twice a day given the patient's history of benign prostatic hypertrophy as well as anti-hypertensive effect.
The patient developed pain secondary to bladder irrigation and his systolic blood pressure would rise during his spastic pain episodes.
On the above medications, the patient had adequate blood pressure and heart rate control, however, his systolic blood pressure then began to fall; the patient was given repeated fluid boluses with minimal improvement.
At this point, evaluation for change in his blood pressure was undertaken and the patient was found to have Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, explaining the hypotension.
When the patient's blood pressure began to rise with clinical improvement of his sepsis, he was restarted on low dose Metoprolol and adjusted accordingly for elevation in his heart rate and systolic blood pressure.
When the patient left, his systolic blood pressure was within goal range, between 120 to 130 and his heart rate was less than 70; however, it is not known HOSPITAL COURSE:w his blood pressure will change as he continues to improve from his sepsis and as he begins to have increased activity.
During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he was monitored closely for evidence of worsening aortic dissection.
He had a repeat CT scan during his hospital course secondary to decreased urine output, which showed no change in the aortic dissection since presentation.
The patient developed sinus arrhythmia, during which he was asymptomatic.
Repeated electrocardiograms showed no ST wave changes.
The patient then continued to have normal sinus rhythm with occasional PACs.
Urinalysis showed increased white blood cells and many bacteria, but also squamous epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray showed new bibasilar bilateral increased opacities, left greater than right with pleural effusions.
Differential diagnosis was atelectasis versus infiltrate.
His blood cultures then came back with four out of four bottles of Gram positive cocci.
His right radial arterial line and right femoral lines were both pulled secondary to erythematous appearance and likely source of bacterial infection.
Sensitivities on the blood cultures came back with Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
Discussion with Infectious Disease regarding whether the patient should follow-up with echocardiogram:  Given that the source of infection was likely line and it was removed, they did not feel that an echocardiogram was required.
Also, they recommended that given that the patient has a fibrin clot with the aortic dissection, it would be prudent to do four weeks of p.o.
RENAL:  The patient had decreasing urine output with very dark urine.
This was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia, but there was concern for renal artery ischemia secondary to presence of aortic dissection, decreasing renal clearance secondary to intravenous contrast dye insult.
The patient was given fluid boluses with minimal increase in his urine output.
At that point, the patient was reevaluated via CT scan for ischemia to the renal artery which was negative.
The patient's urine output improved, but then the patient developed frankly bloody urine with clots.
The Foley was removed, but then the patient had minimal urine output.
This caused considerable pain to the patient and the irrigation was discontinued with the occasional flushes p.r.n.
He had evidence of bladder spasm with episodic pain for which he was given morphine.
His bladder spasm symptoms resolved and his hematuria improved, but did not resolve.
At the time of discharge, the patient had a condom catheter, without any evidence of urinary retention symptoms.
The patient was continued on his Ketoconazole 400 mg twice a day for his prostate cancer therapy.
The Zedronic acid was held, however, given his decreased urine output.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had elevated blood sugars at the time of admission.
His NPH was withheld secondary to bouts of hypoglycemia during his sepsis because of somnolence and decreased p.o.
The patient has a history of Ketoconazole induced borderline Addison's Disease.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has baseline elevated liver function tests with fatty liver and history of HCV.
PULMONARY:  The patient had tobacco history with evidence of emphysematous changes.
Given the chest x-ray findings which were felt to be likely secondary to atelectasis, given that the crackles on his lung examination cleared with the coughing, the patient was started on incentive spirometry.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had a change in mental status during his sepsis.
It was felt that his increased somnolence was likely secondary to his infection as well as morphine administration secondary to pain.
The patient had an episode of agitation for which he was started on Zyprexa.
He had consistently low magnesium levels for which he was started on magnesium oxide standing at 800 mg p.o.
DISPOSITION:   The patient stated that he needed to leave the hospital secondary to issues at home which he needed to take care of.
The patient understood that he was taking a risk with his health, but refused to stay, stating that he needed to attend to these personal matters at home.
He was instructed to return to the Emergency Department immediately for symptoms of chest pain or fever.
Type B aortic dissection.
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
Diabetes mellitus.
Metastatic prostate cancer.
