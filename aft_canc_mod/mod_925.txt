HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36-year-old white female with Down syndrome, VSD with Eisenmenger's syndrome, chronic hypoxia, secondary polycythemia requiring prn phlebotomy, pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytopenia, who presents with bright red blood per rectum and bloody diarrhea.
The patient has a distant history of CHF as a child but no recent problems.
As per mother, the patient may have a complaint of abdominal pain for the past few months.
She has had chronic NSAID use for back pain secondary to spondylolisthesis and scoliosis.
She has recently been on Vioxx which was discontinued one month ago secondary to concerns over elevated creatinine.
Two days ago the patient notes an onset of diarrhea followed by dark stool and then last night noticed bright red blood per rectum.
NG lavage was refused by patient and mother secondary to concerns of a hypoxia and necessary sedation.
By mother's report, the patient has had episodes of hypoxia with sedation in the past.
The GI fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and by report stated a planned EGD and colonoscopy in the morning but this was also refused by patient and family over concern for hypoxia.
History of echocardiogram in [**2119**] by report with no mitral regurgitation, mildly decreased bilateral ventricular function.
4) Secondary polycythemia with baseline hematocrit 65-75 and prn phlebotomy at hematocrit greater than 74.
5) Pulmonary hypertension.
9) Chronic headache secondary to polycythemia, relieved by phlebotomy.
16) History of multiple GI infections.
17) History of multiple respiratory infections.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with endometrial cancer and arrhythmia, father with CAD.
In general this is a frightened, cyanotic white female in mild distress with malar and nasal cyanosis.
Mucus membranes cyanotic but moist.
Heart tachycardic with a [**3-7**] holosystolic ejection murmur at left sternal border radiating across precordium.
Abdomen is soft and non distended with a question of right upper quadrant tenderness, normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities are with soft calves, marked peripheral cyanosis in all digits in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
Skin with bluish nodules on abdomen.
Chest x-ray in the Emergency Room demonstrated cardiomegaly but no pneumonia or intrapulmonary pathologic processes noted.
Bleeding scan negative for any active bleeding.
GI:  The patient had no further episodes of GI bleeding after being admitted to the medical ICU.
The patient and family refused colonoscopy and NG lavage for fear of desaturation with sedation.
Stool studies were sent and were negative for C.diff and E. coli but three PMNs were noticed on fecal leukocyte exam.
The differential diagnosis for her bright red blood per rectum included an infectious colitis or an ischemic colitis from her hyperviscosity.
Pulmonary:  The patient maintained her baseline saturations in the 70's during this admission with no further issues.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was noted on admission to be tachycardic and orthostatic which improved with IV fluids.
Heme:  The patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 75 upon admission which dropped as low as in the 60's during her hospitalization after her episode of GI bleeding.
An arbitrary decision was made to transfuse the patient if her hematocrit dropped below 60 as she typically runs in the mid 60's and a lower hematocrit would be more of a stress for her heart but this never occurred.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**10-25**] and was stable for the next 24 hours with a guaiac negative stool.
