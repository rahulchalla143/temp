Increased abdominal pain 2.
[**2182-4-23**]: UGD [**2182-4-25**]: Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 8430**] is a 66 year-old gentleman with duodenal carcinoma causing biliary obstruction who underwent placement of a percutaneous biliary drain for decompression on [**2182-3-27**].
Pathology revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with pancreatic or biliary origin.)
He was seen in Dr. [**Name (NI) 60612**] clinic today for scheduled consulation for possible tumor resection.
He reported a [**5-14**] day history of increasing abdominal pain, fevers, and rigors.
His abdominal pain, fevers, and chills continue  Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease and remote history of myocardial infarction Hyperlipidemia Tobacco use Anxiety   Social History: Married and lives with wife in [**Name (NI) **].
Family History: Father with duodenal ulcer, died of renal ca metastatic to lungs.
One sister with cardiac disease; no other siblings.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of function of the inferolateral and anterolateral walls (LVEF = 30-35 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular cavity dilation with global systolic dysfunction.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Post-procedure cholangiogram demonstrates flow into the duodenum and opacification of the intrahepatic ducts.
No other blood or stigmata of recent bleeding noted otherwise in the stomach.
There was again a compressing mass at the duodenal sweep and the gastroscope could not be passed through.
No active bleeding noted in the visualized duodenum.
[**2182-4-25**] COLONOSCOPY: Impression: No blood or bleeding was seen.
A tiny raised area was seen and thought to be a small polyp, however upon further examination could not be found.
This could represent and fold or a small polyp.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with biliary obstruction secondary to duodenal mass was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2182-4-12**] with symptoms of cholangitis.
After the procedure, patient was noted to have hypotension/tachycardia, chest pain, and elevated cardiac enzymes.
CV: Initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST segment depressions in high lateral leads concerning for possible myocardial ischemia.
The patient was treated as NSTEMI per Cardiology recommendations, although this EKG may represent stable angina/demand ischemia in the setting of SIRS response.
On [**2182-4-15**] (HD # 5), the patient underwent echocardiography, which demonstrated global systolic dysfunction with LVEF = 30-35%.
On HD # 7, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization, with demonstrated two vessel disease (LAD and RCA) with good collaterals.
After cardiac catheterization, patient was continued on ASA, Metoprolol and statin, ASA was discontinued on HD # 12 secondary to active rectal bleeding.
Cholangitis/ID: On admission the patient was found to have leukocytosis with WBC max 19.4.
Blood cultures were positive for E-coli and bile culture was positive for multiple organisms.
The patient remained afebrile with WBC wnl.
On HD # 13, the patient continued to have bloody stools (850 cc total), PTBD drainage was bilious, the patient received 2 units of RBC for HCT = 26.4.
The patient's GI bleed was thought to be caused by his duodenal mass secondary to PTBD manipulation.
Acute renal failure/GU: On HD # 9, patient's Cr was elevated to 2.3, and FeNa was 3%.
The patient complained about poor appetite and his PO intake was noticed to be inadequate.
He was made NPO for procedures and secondary to acute GI bleed.
The patient reported poor appetite and TPN was continued.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a small amount of regular food and TPN, ambulating with assist, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
2. alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
5. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
