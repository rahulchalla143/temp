Admission Date:  [**2158-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Lisinopril / Cefepime / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**] Chief Complaint: fever and hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: placement of Triple Lumen Catheter / central line (ICU) PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58 year old gentleman with a past medical history of suspected sarcoidosis vs autoimmune granulomatous disorder, prior splenectomy, PCV, recurrent diverticulitis leading to sigmoid resection with a complex course of anastomotic leak requiring multiple surgical interventions and prolonged antibiotic therapy who presented for a planned abdominal CT today.
He was noted to be febrile to 101, c/o chills and found to be hypotensive to 90/60 and was referred to the emergency department.
The CT was performed as previously planned without contrast given recent new renal faillure.
Admission was planned for the floor, however given his persistent hypotension an ICU bed was requested and a central line was placed for pressors though after 5-6L IVF he had no pressor requirement.
ID called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and recomended Meropenem and linezolid and this was passed on to us.
EKG was checked with a sinus rate of 96 ST depressions in II rSR'.
CXR was checked and revealed no acute source of infection.
The patient was last hospitalized in [**5-3**] after being found to have a recurrent leak with intra-abdominal abscess requiring drainage.
He was treated with vanco/ertapenem until [**6-28**] when a repeat scan on [**6-28**] showed resolution of the previous colonic anastomotic leak, complete collapse without residual fluid involving both abscess cavities.
He was c/o left shoulder which he attributed to a shoulder injury he sustained while at physical therapy and has noted left shoulder pain with movement since that time.
Past Medical History: (1) Splenectomy in [**2151-11-24**] when he had resection of a pancreatic mass at [**Hospital1 2025**].
No clotting or bleeding.
bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-3-1**] consistent with myeloproliferative disorder...abnormal karyotype with deletion 20q in 3 out of 20 metaphases.
(3) Immune-mediated granulomatous disease.
(5) Chronic renal insufficiency of unclear etiology.
(6) High-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy on [**2151-5-31**], with no evidence of disease  recurrence since that time.
(7) Diabetes mellitus.

CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2158-10-20**]: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Centrilobular nodular densities are again seen in the right middle lobe of the lung, unchanged compared to [**2158-5-5**] and gradually increasing in conspicuity since [**2157-12-10**].
This may represent chronic infectious or inflammatory change.
The linear atelectasis or scar at the right lung base laterally, which has been previously described, is stable, and there is slight left posterolateral atelectasis or scarring.
A nodular density adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm measuring 5 mm is also stable (2:22).
The non-contrast appearance of the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable except to note coronary artery and mitral annular calcifications.
Lobulated soft tissue density in left upper quadrant measuring 5.8 cm, most likely represent splenosis in this patient with history of prior splenectomy.
A couple of nodules adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach, one of which is calcified (2:31), also unchanged, may represent calcified lymph nodes or small splenules.
The kidneys appear lobulated consistent with scarring.
A 9-mm hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney measures 5 Hounsfield units consistent with a cyst.
There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air or abnormal dilation of bowel to suggest a bowel obstruction.
There is a ventral abdominal wall defect, with close protrusion of multiple loops of small bowel beneath the cutaneous surface and diastasis of the rectus musculature.
The urinary bladder and rectum appear unremarkable.
A few loops of small bowel in the upper pelvis protrude toward the skin surface at the site of a ventral abdominal wall defect.
There is no free fluid or free air and no evidence of organized collection in the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
Degenerative change of the lumbar spine with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.
No evidence of bowel perforation or obstruction, or of intra-abdominal abscess, as questioned.
The collapsed cavity of a previously drained abscess is again seen in the left mid abdomen appearing stable.
Centrilobular nodular densities in right middle lobe of the lung, present over multiple previous examinations, may represent chronic atypical infectious or inflammatory process.
Non-contrast CT findings are suggestive of cavernous transformation of the portal vein.
Prior splenectomy with soft tissue nodule in the left upper quadrant, felt likely to represent splenosis or accessory spleen.
Left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.
Opacity at the left costophrenic angle is not fully evaluated, but a small pleural effusion is not excluded.
No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
MRI Cervical Spine ([**10-22**]): FINDINGS: On the sagittal images, there is no malalignment or loss of vertebral body height.
There is a retention cyst in the sphenoid sinus.
Axial images at C2-C3 demonstrate no significant abnormality.
At C3-C4, there is a disc osteophyte complex with mild right foraminal narrowing.
At C4-C5, there is a disc osteophyte complex with severe bilateral foraminal narrowing and moderate to severe canal stenosis and mass effect on the thecal sac.There is stable mild increased signal in the anterior disc space at C4-C5 which is unchanged from [**2158-1-17**].
Degenerative changes appear to have progressed slightly since the previous examination of [**2158-1-17**].
On the STIR images, however, no significant marrow edema is noted and there is no progression of increased signal within the anterior disc to suggest that this represents infection rather than DJD.
At C5-C6, there is a left eccentric disc bulge with severe left foraminal narrowing and mild-to-moderate central stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is mild left foraminal narrowing.
At C7-T1, there is mild left foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative changes are relatively stable compared to the previous examination.
There are no associated findings to suggest that this is infectious in etiology; however, clinical correlation is advised.
No epidural abscess is noted.
There is no axillary, supraclavicular, hilar, or mediastinal adenopathy.
There is dense atherosclerotic calcification in the LAD and circumflex arteries.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
Centrilobular nodular densities are again seen in the right middle lobe and are unchanged from most recent comparison.
Left basal nodule is not well seen on the current study likely due to slice selection.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver is normal in attenuation without focal lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The splenic and superior mesenteric veins appear patent.
There is focal hyperdensity within the gallbladder lumen, which could reflect a tiny gallstone.
The pancreas is relatively atrophic but otherwise unremarkable.
The patient is status post splenectomy with lobulated enhancing structure in the left upper quadrant likely reflective of splenosis.
Free flow of contrast is seen into the ileostomy without evidence of obstruction.
There is no free intraperitoneal air or fluid.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal pathologic adenopathy with scattered nonenlarged nodes noted.
There is no focal fluid collection.
The abdominal wall defect is again noted with close proximity of multiple loops of small bowel beneath the cutaneous surface and diastasis of the rectus musculature as previously mentioned.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
There is no pelvic or inguinal pathologic adenopathy though the patient is status post pelvic side wall lymph node dissection.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion concerning for osseous malignant process.
No evidence of obstruction, perforation or intra-abdominal abscess.
Centrilobular nodular densities in the right middle lobe are again noted and present over several examinations that could reflect chronic infectious or inflammatory process.
Portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation of the portal vein.
No vegetations seen.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pneumonia or other explanation for patient's fever.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple abnormal foci of muscular FDG-avidity, including in the right gluteus maximus muscle adjacent to the coccyx and at the inferior aspect of the left rectus abdominus muscle just superior to the pubic symphysis with associated small nodular hyperdensities.
These could represent an infectious or inflammatory process and may be amenable to biopsy.
Additional focus of FDG-avidity within the left serratus anterior muscle is also present although no corresponding CT abnormality is definitively seen.
Small focus of increased FDG-avidity at the inferior aspect of the thyroid isthmus corresponding with a 7 mm nodule, concerning for thyroid malignancy.

medical including a history of complicated abdominal abcesses and presumed sarcoidosis presenting with fever, hypotension and leukocytosis.
#Fever with hypotension - In a gentleman with a history of immunocompromise and a complex history of intrabdominal infections and a fever, concern for sepsis was high.
Pt did not meet criteria for adult Stills disease.
There were obvious signs of malignancy other than (Thyroid nodule-see below).
Therefore, it was decided that patient would be treated with IV meropenem and PO linezolid for a 14 day course of therapy to treated suspected bacteremia from an intraabdominal source given his prior complicated abdominal anatomy and history of abdominal abscesses/infection with MDR organisms.
PET scan was performed as well showing FDG avidity in the thyroid nodule as well as some areas of musculature (rectus, serratus, gluteus).
ID, rheumatology, and radiology discussed extensively these radiographic findings and decided that that areas of avidity were unlikely to be infectious and have unclear if any clinical significance.
In addition, he will follow up with rheumatology to continue evaluation for his underlying granulomatous disease ?sarcoid and to continue to consider whether this process is involved in current presentation.
He carries a diagnosis of PCV, however there was no evidence of leukemia on peripheral smear.
Urine lytes c/w Pre-Renal etiology.
Did receive IV contrast for CT scan on this admission and was given pre- and post-hydration with sodium bicarbonate.
He was seen by Rheumatology Consult, and in reviewing his case, they suggested  to consider a pulmonary or renal biopsy to attempt to confirm  his diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
His diagnosis had previously been based on the constellation of uveitis and granulomas seen on prostate biopsy from his radical prostatectomy.
There were some superficial appearing areas of muscular avidity which may be associated with ???sarcoid.
He became supratherapeutic again and coumadin was held on [**2158-10-30**].
#L.shoulder tendonitis-Pt reported history of L.arm weakness since a recent rehab stay.
He developed pain in the last few weeks.
However, outpt MRI did not suggest infection and PET did not suggest infection of this area.
Pt did not have erythema or other suggestion that this was an infected joint.
No signs of active bleeding.
DM diet.
