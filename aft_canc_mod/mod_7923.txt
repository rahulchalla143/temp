Admission Date:  [**2155-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-7-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right sided craniotomy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 87072**] is a 47 yo Right handed man with a PMH signifiant only for mild hyperlipidemia and gout.
He also, at that time, had the first of what would be a few episodes of "light-headedness."
He denies a crescendo increase in HA over the past few weeks and denies any other associated neurological sx such as unilateral weakness, numbness, ataxia, seizures, diplopia, dysarthria.
Today, he began to have nausea associated with the HA so presented to the ED.
Here, a head CT showed a large R temporal mass with a hypodense center and surrounding vasogenic edema.
Also, while in Aruba about two years ago both he and his son contracted a diarrheal illness and was told it was a "parasite."
Family History: No neurological or oncological history   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.2 P: 101 R: 16 BP: 129/83 SaO2: 100% General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: No scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity  Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  On discharge: left nasolabial fold flattening, otherwise intact  Pertinent Results: [**3-15**] CT Head Large cystic mass in the right temporal lobe with surounding vasogenic edema and mass effect causing 9-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
[**3-15**] MRI Brain Solitary right temporal lobe mass concerning for high-grade glioma or metastatic lesion.
Right temporal mass, similar to the recent MRI with marked mass effect and vasogenic edema; the overall appearance is highly suspicious for a high-grade primary glial neoplasm.
Expected mass effect upon adjacent vessels particularly right MCA and PCA branches to the temporal lobe.
No evidence of flow-limiting stenosis and no aneurysm greater than 2 mm.
2.Splenic hemangioma or cyst.
3.No evidence for primary malignancy.
[**3-16**] MRI Brain Rim-enhancing right temporal lobe mass, similar to recent examinations with marked adjacent mass effect including uncal herniation and deviation and deformity of the midbrain.
This examination was limited and done only for preoperative planning.
The appearance is most suspicious for a high-grade primary glial neoplasm.
[**3-18**] CT Head Expected post-surgical changes s/p right temporal resection.
Unchanged right hemispheric vasogenic edema and essentially unchanged supratenorial mass effect.
Slighly decreased mass effect on the midbrain.
Post-surgical changes in the right temporal/parietal lobe with decreased but persistent FLAIR/T2 abnormality and decreased contralateral midline shift.
Right fronto-parieto-temporal extra-axial collection with fluid and air is likely postoperative.
27 x 18 mm (CC x TV) area in the posterior fossa which was present on the prior examination now demonstrates change in signal intensity(hyperintense) likley hemorrhage in an arachnoid cyst.
He underwent an MRI which showed large cystic comparing mass in the right temporal lobe with irregular rim enhancement and mild nodular components appear inferiorly measuring 2.7 x 5.2 cm with significant surrounding vasogenic edema.
A CTA of his head did not show any vascular abnormalities or potential vessels that could complicate the surgery.
On [**3-17**] he underwent a right side cranitomy for mass resection as well as temporal lobectomy.
On [**3-18**] he was stable in the ICU however he was hypertensive requiring Nipride.
He reported severe headache as well which initially responded to IV Dilaudid and PO Fioricet.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
?Please return to the office in [**8-24**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
