History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 26241**] is a 68 year-old woman with left breast cancer diagnosed in [**7-/2161**], history of polio and osteoporosis, transferred from OSH ER after presenting with cough and fevers for 2-3 days, and then found to be pancytopenic.
She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2166-12-29**] for fevers (102.4 at home), cough and malaise, she was initiated on levofloxacin.
A chest CT was performed to evaluate her cough and fevers and noted a consolidative opacity at the lingula of the left upper lobe consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
She was started on Zosyn and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for direct admission for possible acute leukemia diagnosis.
Currently, she feels fatigued, continues to have some chest discomfort with coughing, not short of breath.
ROS: She denies bruising, bleeding, pain other than mild headache at the end of the day.
No nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or other new symptoms.
History of tumor on spine 4.
Sinus cyst removed, which was benign  <b><i>ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</i></b> Ms. [**Known lastname 26241**] was diagnosed in [**7-/2161**] after seeing a left sided mass on a mammogram on [**2161-8-11**].
An ultrasound confirmed that the mass was solid, and an U/S guided biopsy found a 3.7 cm grade 3 infiltrating left ductal cancer with clean lymph nodes, ER positive, HER-2/neu negative, and negative LVI.
She was switched to tamoxifen in [**2166-2-23**] due to bone density thinning.

STUDIES: ======== CT chest ([**2166-12-31**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital) 1. consolidative opacity at the lingula of the left upper lobe consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Partial visualization of a right renal cystic mass.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2166-12-31**] IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2164-10-15**], there is a newly appeared 3.2 cm big mass at the upper aspect of the left hilus.
This mass has to be considered as malignancy unless proven otherwise.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that approximately 57% of the analyzed events isolated from this peripheral blood are in the CD45 (dim) blast region.
In the lymphoid gate, B-cells comprise approximately 21% of lymphoid-gated events, and do not express aberrant antigens.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: Acute myelogenous leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY [**2167-1-1**] DIAGNOSIS: Acute myelogenous leukemia with monocyte differentiation, see note.
There is some background dyspoiesis noted in the scant residual hematopoiesis including occasional hypogranular neutrophils; the possibility that this acute leukemia arose from an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome cannot be entirely excluded.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-2**] IMPRESSION: No complication of insertion of the right central venous catheter.
New volume overload/pulmonary edema.
Persistent left upper lobe consolidation, which is difficult to precisely assess in the presence of overlying pulmonary edema.
Followup after resolution of pulmonary edema with chest radiograph is recommended for documentation of improvement of this consolidation.
Multifocal consolidations and ground-glass opacities, most consistent with an infectious etiology.
The configurations of the opacities, in particular the wedge-shaped consolidation in the left upper lobe, suggest the possibility of angioinvasive aspergillosis or mucormycosis.
Interval enlargement of the partly visualized left kidney with surrounding fat stranding, although no hydronephrosis.
We recommend that this appearance be compared to the recent outside hospital CT and/or evaluated with a renal ultrasound, if clinically indicated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There has been interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Left perihilar consolidation is stable.
Low lung volumes persist.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-6**] IMPRESSION: No significant change in mild pulmonary congestion.
Somewhat more prominent appearance of left upper lobe consolidation.
Interval improvement of left upper lobe consolidation, although a smaller area of consolidation persists.
New multifocal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities throughout both lung fields could indicate an ongoing, atypical infectious process.
New small bilateral pleural effusions with septal thickening, likely reflecting an element of pulmonary edema or fluid overload.
A right internal central jugular venous catheter again terminates in the upper atrium.
There is minimal persistent interstitial edema, but the lungs are better expanded.
Also, a left upper lobe consolidation has mostly resolved.
No pneumothorax or effusion.
[**2167-1-20**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis have completely resolved.
A focal consolidation in the left upper lobe which had been prominent on the initial CT has also continued to resolve.
On the other hand, diffuse mixed ground glass and consolidative opacities, which are predominantly peripheral and bronchovascular in distribution, are more extensive than on the most recent CT from [**2163-1-8**].
The appearance includes a new peribronchovascular consolidation in the right upper lobe, although patchy lower lobe consolidations appear little changed.
Lingular ground glass opacities appear more extensive.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no lesions suspicious for malignancy or infection.
More extensive peripheral and peribronchovascular ground-glass and consolidative opacities.
Differential diagnosis includes a pneumonitis related to a drug reaction, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, a new opportunistic infection (viral, PCP), and, less likely, hemorrhage.
Continued interval resolution of left upper lobe consolidation.
Resolution of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
[**2167-1-27**] CT CHEST FINDINGS: Over a period of at least seven days there has been a significant worsening of the ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and a new pleural effusion.
The ground-glass opacities have increased predominantly in the ventral portions of the lung while the consolidations have predominantly increased in the dependent portions of the lung.
A focus of consolidation seen separately from the other consolidation is still seen in the left upper lobe getting smaller on today's examination.
There is no axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The osseous structures do not show any lesions suspicious for malignancy or infection.
Although the examination is not tailored for the evaluation of the abdominal structures yet there is persistent stranding around the left kidney; however, this is difficult to interpret today because of the motion at the lung bases.
Further extensive and rapid increase in the ground-glass opacities, consolidation and recurrence of a small pleural effusion.
In general, the appearances are in favor of an ARDS and less likely a cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or drug reaction or an atypical opportunistic infection.
Continued interval resolution of the left upper lobe consolidation.
[**2167-1-28**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are the sequelae of a chronic small vessel infarction.
There is a small layering fluid within most of the visualized paranasal sinuses.
There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells as well.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-1-2**], left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous, but remains in the normal range.
Worsened mucosal thickening and fluid within the sphenoid sinus.
Resolved mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.
Persistent near complete opacification of the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities bilaterally.
No evidence of cord signal abnormality.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative changes, most prominent at C5-6, and C6-7, where there is mild neural foraminal narrowing on the left secondary to uncovertebral joint osteophytes.
No evidence of brain infarction or other acute abnormality.
Fluid opacification of the sphenoid sinus and bilateral mastoid air cells, most likely related to the patient's intubated status.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-1-27**], no change.
[**2-24**]: EMG Complex, abnormal study.
The electrophysiologic evidence is most consistent with a generalized, severe myopathy with prominent denervating features, as can be seen in critical illness myopathy.
The findings do not support the presence of a subacute demyelinating polyneuropathy (as in Guillain- [**Location (un) **] syndrome) as an explanation for the patient's weakness.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 26241**] is a 68 year-old woman with left breast cancer diagnosed in [**7-/2161**] and s/p AC, h/o polio and osteoporosis, who was transferred from OSH ER after presenting with cough and fevers x 2-3 days with reported LUL opacity, then found to be pancytopenic with a new diagnosis of AML.
# AML: The patient initially presented with pneumonia in the setting of pancytopenia.
She was not started on chemotherapy until her pneumonia improved.
Day 14 bone marrow was performed on [**1-19**] demonstrating a markedly hypocellular bone marrow (consistent with chemo-ablative therapy) with increased interstitial blasts, comprising approximately 7% of aspirate differential.
By CD34 immunostaining, increased interstitial blasts are seen comprising nearly 40% of the marrow cellularity of this markedly hypocellular marrow (less than 5% of inter-trabecular space).
In addition, flow cytometric studies showed a small population of immature cells with an aberrant phenotype.
The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are worrisome for minimal residual disease.
No further treatment was pursued during this hospitalization due to her unstable clinical status (see below).
At some point in the future, a bone marrow biopsy may be completed for further information, but this would be pursued once the patient is more stable.
[**Hospital1 18**] CXR and OSH CT showed a LUL infiltrate.
CT chest on [**1-2**] showed progression of her LUL infiltrate compared to the OSH CT, concerning for angioinvasive fungal infection.
She developed an O2 requirement of  3.5 L NC, which was weaned down to 1.5-2 L NC.
CT chest on [**1-8**] revealed decreased LUL opacity but more tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, likely secondary to pulmonary edema (given that the patient had gained >15 pounds while on continuous fluids).
She continued to spike fevers daily and began developing an increased O2 requirement to 4L.
She was informed of the risks of her pulmonary conditioning worsening as no source of her pulmonary infection had been identified.
Her cefepime was changed to meropenem to cover a possible Nocardial or anaerobic infection and levaquin was added for additional atypical coverage.
Repeat Chest CT on [**1-27**] demonstrated extensive and rapid increase in the ground-glass opacities, consolidation and recurrence of a small pleural effusion.
She was difficult to wean with persistent tachypnea despite adequate oxygenation.
Meropenem and vancomycin were discontinued for concern for drug fever with new rash on lower extremities with no change in fever curve or rash.
Chest CT revealed a cavitating lesion in left upper lobe where a formerly solid nodule had appeared.
The differential included pneumatocele versus infection, possibly fungal, though all fungal markers were negative.
The lung cavitary lesion was then thought to be a pneumatocoele, and not infecious.
She remained afebrile for about 48 hours, from [**2086-2-16**], and then spiked a fever.
A chest x-ray was checked prior to discharge to assess for any changes and showed no evidence of any acute cardiopulmonary process, but persistence of pre-existing opacities.
# Acute renal failure (ARF) - As the patient's pulmonary status worsened she developed ARF with a rise in serum creatinine from 1.1 on [**1-22**] to 3.4 on [**1-27**].
Given her worsening respiratory status, she was diuresed with IV lasix.
Clinical picture was consistent with ATN.
The patient developed renal falure requiring dialysis.
She had muddy brown casts in her urine suggesting a diagnosis of ATN.
She became extremely oliguric at approximately ICU day 14 which is atypical for an ATN picture, however.
# Mental status Changes - On [**1-28**] the patient developed an acute MS change, she became more confused but continued to follow commands.
A stat CT Head was performed and demonstrated no evidence of bleed.
She had worsening confusion, likely due to hypoxia and toxic/metabolic causes and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as above.
# Weakness: She also developed generalized weakness, most likely due to a combination of ICU myopathy and a history of polio.
EMG was most consistent with a generalized, severe myopathy with prominent denervating features, as can be seen in critical illness myopathy, with a likely underlying, generalized, predominantly axonal polyneuropathy.
# Incontinence: Due to the patient's history of stress incontinence, a Foley was inserted during chemotherapy.
