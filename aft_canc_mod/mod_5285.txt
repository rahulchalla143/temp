No localizing symptoms.
In ER, Found to be neutropenic (ANC 180) and low hct (21) with suspected bleeding into hepatocellular carcinoma lesion.
He did have fevers following first cycle, but was not neutropenic.
At that time, no source of fever found and he improved post-IVFs.
no sick contacts, no recent travel.
no children or pets at home.
Past Medical History: Hepatocellular Carcinoma: In [**2151-5-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname 69343**] developed some abdominal pain and he was found to have a mass in the left lobe of the liver.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10595**] at [**Hospital1 3372**] who deferred surgery due to the extent of this tumor and the underlying state of his liver due to his hep B chronic carrier status.
He then saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who wished to check a CT scan again before surgery and this showed multiple lesions in the right lobe as well as a large lesion replacing the left lobe .
In Mid-[**2151-7-31**], he was seen in the [**Hospital3 2358**] emergency room  due to rapid and acute onset of right upper quadrant pain.
A CT scan was done and this showed new high-density fluid consistent with ruptured hepatoma and intraperitoneal bleed with new blood in the  pelvis.
No therapy was done and his symptoms resolved .
Family History: no significant family history  Physical Exam: VS afebrile VSS gen: sleepy, but well appearing, non-diaphoretic, no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP w/ no thrush; mild mucositis posterior pharynx Neck: supple, no LAD CV: tachy, I/VI RUSB, lungs: CTAB; no r/r/w abd: hepatomegaly, palpable below RCM, w/o tenderness to palpation, soft, active BS, no splenomegaly; no caput; no ecchymosis ext: no c/c/e neuro: CNII-XII intact.
The lung volumes are low, but there is no definite consolidation.
No vascular congestion.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Fluid collection at the lateral aspect of the left lobe of the liver with intermediate density material layering dependently.
This is consistent with hemorrhage in/from a hepatocellular carcinoma lesion.
Hemorrhage shape suggests subcapsular bleeding from a tumor.
No definite active arterial extravasation is identified within the collection, though this evaluation is difficult given that HCC arterially enhances.
Extensive multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma .
MICRO DATA: ============ [**10-8**] Blood Culture: No growth to date [**10-8**] Urine Culture: No growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 34y/o M w/ chronic hep B, HCC, on chemotherapy, who presented with febrile neutropenia and anemia.
Pt was initially hospitalized in the ICU for one night given the signs of hepatic hemorrhage and febrile neutropenia.
Febrile neutropenia- Pt initially presented with febrile neutropenia, and was started on cefepime.
The cause of the fever was unclear with blood cultures x2 and urine cultures all negative.
CXR negative for infiltrate.
Cefepime was discontinued when the patinet was no longer neutropenic.
Subcapsular bleeding from HCC- As per abdominal CT it appears that there is hemorrhage at the site of a neoplastic lesion.
Mental status changes- On admission, the patient had a slow decline in ability to be alert and follow conversation per familiy.
Cause for this was likely delerium due to fever and infection.
Physical exam was non-focal and showed no deficits.
There was a question of facial twitches and non-voluntary hand movements.
Their evaluation showed no signs of neurologic deficit and and MRI of the head was negative.
These changes may be consistent with clinical depression.
Tooth pain- No current signs of caries or abscess on mouth exam, but does have one loose tooth.
Pt was given oral lidocaine mouthwash prn with some relief.
