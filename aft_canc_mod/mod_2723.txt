Admission Date:  [**2185-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-10-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: transferred 2/2 L main stem bronchus occlusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thoracentesis (left)  History of Present Illness: 67 yo m w/ h/o squamous cell ca of the lung s/p stenting of the L main stem bronchus at [**Hospital6 **], who initially presented to an OSH on [**2185-8-2**] with an acute GI bleed.
In OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt unresponsive (VS unknown), noted to be in respiratory distress with a sat of 77%.
He was given 5 units PRBC's, 2 units FFP, and intubated for metabolic acidosis and airway protection in the setting of acute blood loss anemia and a GI bleed.
During his MICU course, he had an EGD showing multiple small duodenal ulcerations without adherent clot.
He was given an additional 2 units of PRBCs in the ICU, and did not have signs of active bleeding throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy, which revealed complete occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus, as well as secretions and mucus plugs in the right lung, which were cleaned out and sent for culture.
In addition to these issues, the patient also had an episode of rapid A fib which required IV lopressor and amiodarone.
He was also in acute renal failure, thought to be ATN secondary to hypotension on presentation.
Given his h/o mass compressing the LA, emergent bedside TTE was done, which showed a normal EF without evidence of tamponade.
Bronchoscopy was performed which revealed 95% occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus by extrinsic tumor.
Secretions were sent for culture.
Past Medical History: - Left lung squamous cell carcinoma: diagnosed in [**2184-10-15**]; s/p stenting to the left mainstem bronchus because of occulsion, as well as radiation therapy.
- Post-obstructive pneumonia - A Fib (on coumadin): with several episodes of RVR, requiring cardioversion on one occasion.
- compression of the left atrium (?
tumor vs. LAD) - transfusion dependent anemia - hypertension.
By report from the daughter, the patient has a wife who he has not been living with for many years.

Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo m w/ h/o squamous cell ca of the lung s/p stenting of the L main stem bronchus, who initially presented to an OSH on [**2185-8-2**] with an acute GI bleed, now transferred from OSH for possible stenting of left mainstem bronchus occlusion.
warm extremities, low grade fever, and recent respiratory failure point to septic shock as etiology.
Other possibility includes hypovolemia from GIB, however, Hct stable and no evidence of blood loss.
Potential sources of infection include post-obstructive pneumonia (most likely), C. diff, line infection, or hepatobiliary source (elevated LFTs, but more likely [**2-16**] to hypotension).
patient also with VRE on blood cx's at OSH, but thought to be contamination, so not covered with abx.
2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE: patient was intubated at OSH for airway protection and respiratory failure due to acidosis.
Resp failure likely multifactorial: left mainstem obstruction, pneumonia, and acidosis.
Pt underwent thoracentesis of left lung [**8-10**], 2+ liters fluid removed, pleural fluid transudative by LDH (fluid to serum ratio 0.55).
3) GI BLEED: patient presented to OSH with acute GIB, Hct=10 on presentation in setting of supertherapeutic INR.
EGD at OSH showing duodenal ulcers.
No further bleeding and Hct stabilized in low 30's.
Potential sources of infection described above, include post-obstructive pneumonia, C. diff, line infection, or hepatobiliary source (elevated LFTs, but more likely [**2-16**] to hypotension).
- Zosyn continued for ?post-obstructive pneumonia, will Linezolid started instead of vanco to cover resp organisms, as well as VRE bacteremia.
6) ARF: patient also with ARF, likely [**2-16**] to ATN from hypotension on arrival to OSH.
7) A FIB: pt has h/o A fib with RVR requiring cardioversion in the past.
- Amiodarone 400 mg PO TID continued - lopressor, coumadin held since hypotensive and recent GIB .
8) TRANSAMINITIS: elevated LFTs, ?secondary to shock liver given recent hypotension.
cholestatic picture, so also concerning for hepatobilliary obstruction.
- RUQ U/S [**8-9**] showed no cholelithiasis or cholecystitis; also an echogenic mass in regional of right adrenal gland but unclear whether it originated from adrenal gland or liver itself .
- IVF w/ bicarb as above .
Recognizing the advanced stages of malignancy and progression despite attempted treatments, the decision was made to focus on comfort.
