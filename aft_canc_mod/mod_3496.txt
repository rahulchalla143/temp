PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 79 year old M with chronic urinary retention secondary to prostate cancer (diagnosed in [**2186**], grade 7, stage t-3, r seminal vessicle involvement at diagnosis).
Had TURP [**2193**], did well following this and self-cathed for urinary retention.
In [**9-16**] had foley placement complicated by false passage.
Saw his urologist prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 26615**] [**12-15**] and was noted to have fecal material in his urine after a foley was passed.
Due to suspicion of enterovesical fistula the patient was admitted.
A gastrograffin enema and a cystogram was done showing a large filling defect involving the bladder, but no frank fistula.
Due to hyperkalemia is was ultimately admitted to the ICU.
A temporary dialysis line was placed and he was dialyzed for hyperkalemia.
Of note, the patient was also noted to have lytic lesions of the spine and has been recieving radation to his lumbar spine.
A biopsy has shown squamous cell carcinoma.
Pt is a vague historian, but accurate with most details.

STUDIES ------- [**2196-12-19**] Renal ultrasound The right kidney measures 12.6 cm.
Moderate hydronephrosis is seen within bilateral kidneys.
No definite renal stone or mass is identified.
Bladder measures 11.3 x 7.7 x 7.5 cm and contains a large heterogeneous mass with internal vascularity consistent with tumor.
Large heterogeneous mass filling the bladder lumen consistent with tumor.
The bladder also contains numerous small gas pockets, likely related to either the Foley catheter placement, biopsy or other reasons; GI tract is not excluded, though none is demonstrated.
There is ill-defined haziness in the adjacent fat of the prevesicular space of Retzius, superficial to the air pockets, no definite extravesical extension is demonstrated.
There is no adenopathy, and no other pelvic adenopathy is seen.
Since the previous studies, bilateral nephrostomy tubes have been placed, with pigtail loops in both renal pelves, draining externally and the previously-demonstrated hydronephrosis is no longer seen; there is persistent right more than left hydroureter, incompletely characterized.
There is relatively slight perinephric soft tissue stranding, unchanged, and no significant air is identified in the upper urinary tract, though there is a small pocket of air in the left posterior pararenal space, likely related to the recent tube placement.
There is no free retro- or peritoneal _____ air, and the small and large bowel loops are relatively well-opacified and not distended, with transit of contrast material into normal-appearing large bowel, and no extraluminal contrast to suggest bowel perforation.
There is extensive, circumferential calcification of the thoracoabdominal aorta and its branches; the abdominal aorta measures some 2.9 cm in maximal diameter (2:46), without frank aneurysmal dilatation.
There is no intramural hematoma or discrete peri-aortic fat-stranding to suggest "leak" limited evaluation of the _____.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
There is extensive diffuse coronary arterial calcification.
There are small-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated passive atelectasis.
There is also some interlobular septal thickening with patchy ground-glass opacity, as well as prominence of the more-anterior vessels, all consistent with underlying CHF.
A focal consolidation at the _____ aspect of the left lung base cannot be excluded.
No pericardial effusion is seen.
Destructive process involving the right L5 vertebral body, extending into and largely replacing the cortex and right posterior elements _____ a large soft tissue component, displacing the thecal sac to the left, and deforming it.
Though there are multilevel degenerative changes elsewhere, no other destructive lesion is identified.
There is anterior wedging of the T7 vertebral body, with a mixed sclerotic appearance which may represent a previously-treated metastasis or, alternatively, ______ hemangioma.
Markedly abnormal appearance to the bladder, which is distended and may be largely filled with apparently-known soft tissue mass.
Status post interval placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes with external drainage, and virtual complete resolution of hydronephrosis.
Unremarkable large and small bowel, with no evidence of perforation, and no free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.
Extensive destructive lesion involving right lateral aspect of the L5 vertebral body and its posterior elements, with large epidural soft tissue component thecal sac in exiting right L5 nerve root.
Abnormal appearance of the T7 vertebral body, which could represent previously-treated metastasis and should be correlated with other clinical information.
Multi-chamber cardiomegaly with dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker, and evidence of CHF with bilateral pleural effusions and passive atelectasis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Obstructive nephropathy with acute renal failure.
After re-evaluation of his obstruction, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies were placed with very rapid resolution of his ARF to a serum creatinine at his baseline.
Subsequently, a rigid cystoscopy was performed by Urology which demonstrated fibrinous material in the urethra and large fibrinous mass adherent to the bladder wall, consistent with old clot material.
Initial gram stains and studies demonstrated gram positive and gram negative bacteria and antibiotics were continued, and later tailored based on sensitivities.
Pathology demonstrated a poorly differentiated malignancy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The patient developed bursts of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The patient developed a 30% drop in his platelets upon transfer, after significant exposure to heparin during dialysis and for DVT prophylaxis.
Left basilic vein deep venous thrombosis.
The patient was restarted on warfarin anticoagulation with a goal INR [**2-13**], and covered with unfractionated heparin infusion on a weight based protocol with PTT monitoring.
Possible enterovesicular fistula.
Numerous studies done at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and direct cystoscopy by Urology here at [**Hospital1 18**] failed to demonstrate a fistula; however, the enteric organism leading to his urinary tract infection argued for a fistula.
Pseudomonal urinary tract infection.
A PICC catheter was placed, and the patient is to complete a total 4 weeks of imipenem therapy.
Attributed to mult stool softeners as well as charcoal given for enterovesicular fistula evaluation (twice).
