Admission Date:  [**2116-9-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2116-10-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-1-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY, BLUE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right-sided abdominal pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 49-year-old man with hypertension and diverticulosis who presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2116-9-24**], with an acute onset of right lower quadrant pain and fever to 102??????.
He began having fevers to 102-103??????
It was felt that he had bronchitis which was treated first with Ceclor for a 10-day course.
The patient still complained of mild stomach pains in the upper abdomen prior to this antibiotic treatment and then stated that after Ceclor, he began having diffuse abdominal pain with tenderness and nausea but not vomiting.
He felt better with decreased abdominal pain.
On the day of admission while at work, the patient noted increasing abdominal pain, acute onset on the right side, with sharp "explosive" pain.
In fact, he complained that he was unable to move secondary to this increased pain.
He also noted constipation for quite a while and significant distention of the abdomen, as well as decreased appetite, associated with a small intentional weight loss.
The patient presented to an outside right after the increased abdominal pain and was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**].
At the outside hospital, he was noted to be tachycardiac with shortness of breath, unable to take a deep breath secondary to pain, as well as being febrile.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  The patient was afebrile at 99.2?????
He was tachycardiac at 102.
General:  The patient was in no acute distress.
Abdomen: Obese and distended abdomen with tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant.
No guarding noted.
LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation to [**Hospital6 649**] his white blood cell count was 12.8, 53% neutrophils, 27% bands, 10% lymphocytes, hematocrit 38.3, platelet count 610; PT 15.2, PTT 26.2, INR 1.5; sodium 133, potassium 4.9, chloride 99, bicarb 24, BUN 19, creatinine 1.8, glucose 132; ALT 61, AST 79, alkaline phosphatase 139, total bilirubin 0.9, amylase 22, albumin 2.3; urinalysis on [**9-25**] showed a large amount of blood with trace amounts of protein, ketones and leukocytes.
CAT scan at the outside hospital showed free fluid in the abdomen, liver, spleen and in the pelvis.
There was a 4 x 4 cm round collection in the left lobe of the liver with mass formation about the anterior left lobe and transverse colon.
No free air.
The patient was considered to have a liver abscess/phlegmon involving the left lobe of the liver and perhaps the transverse colon.
Subsequently this liver biopsy revealed a significant amount of fibrosis and inflammation but no tumor etiology.
At this point, the patient was either deemed to have liver abscesses or metastasis, and the patient was managed expectantly over the next few days.
It was noted over the next few days, that the patient began to have some mental status changes.
These were noted to coincide with an increased ammonia level but also increasing white blood cell count levels.
Based on this lab value, the slowly deteriorating mental status, the slight tachycardia and the persistent low-grade fevers the patient had on the first few days of admission, the patient was taken for paracentesis on [**9-27**] prior to going to the Operating Room.
The paracentesis revealed purulent fluid within his peritoneal cavity with increased white blood cells and increased red blood cells.
The patient was noted during this surgery to have 4 L of pus within his abdominal cavity, as well as three large hepatic abscesses.
The patient was left packed, and drains were placed to allow drainage of the abscess cavities.
During the rest of the Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was again monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter for volume status and hemodynamics.
He had fluid repletion for his hypervolemia and also had electrolyte repletion multiple times for hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
Cultures taken during the operations revealed scant growth of Streptococcus milleri, on the 26th, Streptococcus it was revealed that there was scant growth of Corynebacterium and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**].
A transesophageal echocardiogram on [**10-1**] revealed no vegetations consistent with endocarditis.
There was no mass or vegetations seen on any of the valves.
There was pericardial effusion.
On [**10-5**], the patient was noted to be draining some frank blood from his fourth suction bulb drain.
A CAT scan on [**10-6**] revealed a new left rectus sheath hematoma.
Since the patient's hematocrit at this time was stable, this hematoma was managed conservatively and subsequently continued to drained out blood but soon dried up, and the drain was removed shortly after on [**10-6**].
He still has a drain that is putting out serosanguinous fluid with a slight greenish tinge that may be bilious, and we will therefore keep this drain in.
On discharge exam, the patient is alert and oriented, sleeping comfortably without his BIPAP machine.
Status post peritonitis and sepsis.
Multiple liver abscesses.
Status post unroofing of hepatic abscesses.
Chronic blood loss anemia requiring multiple red blood cells transfusions.
Hypovolemia requiring fluid resuscitation.
Hypokalemia requiring Potassium repletion.
Hypomagnesemia requiring Magnesium repletion.
Sleep apnea requiring BIPAP.
