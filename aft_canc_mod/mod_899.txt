[**8-17**] IMPRESSION:  Positive GI bleeding study at 60 minutes with findings highly suggestive of small bowel bleeding, likely related to known midline duodenal/pancreatic metastasis.
The transverse colon is noted to positioned more superior (on prior CT's) then site of bleeding on current study.
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the pancreas and liver as well as known duodenal/ampullary mass presents with BRBPR x 2 days.
He called his oncologist who recommended bowel prep in anticipation of colonoscopy today given known side effect of bleeding with sutent.
Pt has colonoscopy this am that showed blood in colon but no identifiable source.
There, they couldn't find any obvious source of bleed, but was consistent with a small bowel source.
On admission, he denies fast heart rate, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest or abdominal pain, tenesmus.
Past Medical History: # GIB [**2184**], EGD revealed duodenal ulcer c/w malignancy # Hypertension.
# No cardiac problems, diabetes, or cholesterol.
# Traumatic fracture of the right fibula which require open reduction.
# RCC in [**2167**], treated with IL 2/LAK and was disease free until  [**2181**], now with metastatic disease to pancreas and likely liver.
Recurrence in the left renal fossa and pancreas in [**4-/2182**] 5.
His course has been complicated by a GI bleed with possible small bowel obstruction, and an admission to [**Hospital3 **] in [**8-/2185**] for anemia and acute renal failure while on full dose Nexavar 400 mg given twice daily.
following CT in [**9-/2186**], which showed progression of pancreatic metastases.
ERCP on [**2187-6-20**] showed a malignant appearing mass in duodenum, pathology consistent with metastatic renal cell Ca.
Perifosine held due to elevated LFTs on [**2187-7-25**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory   Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITALS:  HR 89  BP 145/92  RR 15  Sat 99 (intubated) GENERAL:  Well-appearing in NAD HEENT: NC/AT CARD:  RRR, nl s1 s2, no m/r/g RESP:  CTAB ABD:  Soft, Non-tender, Non-distended, with scattered nodules.
No CVA tenderness.
[**8-17**] Bleeding study: Positive GI bleeding study at 60 minutes with findings highly suggestive of small bowel bleeding, likely related to known midline duodenal/pancreatic metastasis.
The transverse colon is noted to positioned more superior (on prior CT's) then site of bleeding on current study.
[**8-17**] Arteriogram: Arteriogram of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery with no extravasation.
Origin of the bleeding appears to be just to the left of midline in the epigastrium.
[**8-19**] IR study: Gastrointestinal arteriogram and embolization of metastatic pancreatic tumor feeding arteries with no immediate complications.
[**8-20**] Femoral ultrasound: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is most likely atelectasis.
[**8-24**] Knee X-ray: Mild patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis.
Mild ascites.
Mild interval increase in size of a right hepatic mass, allowing for differences in technique.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Small pericardial effusion.
Mild edema of the colonic wall could reflect a mild portal colopathy.
No significant change in multiple areas of metastatic disease, including multiple large masses of the pancreas.
Status post left nephrectomy.
Portal vein thrombosis with innumerable coallaterals.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
[**8-27**] Abd Ultrasound for diagnostic paracentesis: Very small amount of ascites adjacent to the liver dome.
Given the small amount of fluid and resolution of patient's symptoms, no paracentesis was performed at this time.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 21223**] is a 67yM with metastatic RCC, h/o GIB c malignant ulcer, p/w BRBPR for 2 days and admitted to MICU for careful hemodynamic monitoring.
GI Bleed: Likely related to a metastatic lesion, complicated by starting Sutent.
Patient has a history of bleeding GI masses, and had been temporarily stopped in Atrasentan trial for anemia.
EGD showed no bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.
He thus likely has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood throughout.
Pt had RBC scan w/ bleeding at 60min and nothing on angio, then had more BRBPR in the MICU, was re-RBC scanned w/ bleeding at 7 min, and was re-angioed this am, where they embolized feeding arteries around tumor, but did not see any large bleeds.
He developed a gout flare during admission (despite being on allopurinol), confirmed by arthrocentesis.
An ultrasound identified mild ascites and increased bowel gas, and a CT abd/pelvis was performed, demonstrating pleural effusions and mild ascites.
His outpatient regimen was initially held in the setting of lower GI bleed.
He had low grade temperatures for several days during the admission but no sources were identified.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Gastrointestinal Bleed   Discharge Condition: The patient was hemodynamicall stable, afebrile and without pain.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding which required ICU care.
Your bleeding was determined to be caused by a mass in your intestine.
You underwent endoscopy and blood vessels in your tumor were treated.
You received several blood transfusions but have had not evidence of bleeding for several days.
In addition, you developed a gout flare of your right knee.
If you develop any concerning symptoms, such as more bleeding from your rectum, vomiting any blood, increasing abdominal fullness or abdominal pain, dizziness, numbness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.
Followup Instructions: Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after your radiation is finished; his office will contact you for an appointment.
