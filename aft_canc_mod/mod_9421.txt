On a head CT scan there was evidence of an old right frontal infarction with associated encephalomalacia and a new left parietal occipital region of edema within the white matter as well as evidence of a central abnormality suggestive of a  On MRI there was T2 hyperintensity in the same region as the edema seen on head CT scan, but there was also a well demarcated, heterogenous lesion in the medial parietal occipital region without evidence of susceptibility.
MRA demonstrated a left internal carotid artery occlusion and right internal carotid artery stenosis.
Impression:  The patient is a 76 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin, prior right frontal hemorrhage and prior seizure, who presents with convulsions requiring Ativan and intubation.
Examination demonstrated decreased withdrawal of her right upper extremity which suggested a left hemispheric lesion.
This is likely due to the left occipital parietal mass surrounding edema noted on MRI.
Left parietal occipital mass:  A Neurosurgical consultation was obtained and the patient's left parietal occipital mass was resected on [**5-12**].
After the resection, the patient was noted to have a right foot drop which is likely due to the removal of her mass.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions were also noted as well as evidence of emphysema.
A small amount of free fluid was noted in the pelvis.
After transfer to the floor, the patient complained of right hip pain which led to plain films of the right hip, that demonstrated diffuse osteopenia as well as a 4 centimeter by 1 centimeter region of lucency in the right subtrochanteric femur.
The presence of this lucency led to a bone scan that did not demonstrate evidence of metastatic disease.
The patient had also complained of pain her right heel and plain films of the heel were obtained that did not show evidence of metastatic disease.
The patient should undergo an outpatient mammogram to help exclude breast cancer as a possible etiology, even though there is evidence of a mass in the left lung.
An EEG was obtained that demonstrated slow and disorganized background activities with bursts of generalized slowing, as well as prominent focal high voltage sharp wave discharged in the left posterior quadrant that occasionally extended more generally.
This was thought to represent widespread encephalopathic condition as well as a focal left posterior quadrant abnormality.
There was no evidence of repetitive discharges to suggest ongoing seizure activity.
Her liver function tests and amylase were followed intermittently through her hospital stay since she is taking Depakote; this should continue to be done as an outpatient to insure that there is not evidence of transaminitis or pancreatitis.
Her ammonia was also followed and there was no evidence of hyperammonemia.
With regard to her elevated troponin on admission, the patient was continued on Lopressor, however, at the time of discharge her Lopressor dosage was decreased to 25 twice a day to prevent hypoperfusion of her brain given her carotid stenosis.
Any platelet agents are currently being held, both because of her recent intracranial surgery and also because of the presence of metastatic intracranial disease.
The patient should have her stool guaiac closely monitored.
NOTE:  This is an addendum to one of the prior paragraphs where I discussed the patient's intracranial lesions and her surgeries:  To continue, the patient has been evaluated by Radiation Oncology and is to begin radiation therapy for additional intracranial lesions.
In addition to the left parietal occipital lesion, the patient was also noted to have additional lesions, including a 5 millimeter contrast enhancing lesion in the right superficial parietal lobe.
A left upper extremity ultrasound was obtained that did not demonstrate evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
She was also noted to have decreased movement of the left upper extremity and, although the etiology is not demonstrated on her prior imaging studies, this may reflect a small subcortical infarction.
An ENT evaluation was obtained to insure that the patient did not have evidence of vocal cord paralysis.
From a respiratory perspective, the patient had undergone extubation after her hospital stay, but failed secondary to increased secretions.
While intubated, she was noted to have excessive secretions and this led to a bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage that demonstrated many PMNs and Gram positive cocci.
Cultures subsequently demonstrated Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was placed on Oxacillin for a 14 day course to treat possible Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
This is particularly important given the patient's past history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and her current diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
On admission, it was felt that the patient's Coumadin was likely present because of her prior deep vein thromboses and her primary care physician was attempted to be contact[**Name (NI) **] at the time of this dictation to help clarify the need of continued anti-coagulation with Coumadin.
Given her metastatic adenocarcinoma within the brain, she would be at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage.
A repeat head CT scan was obtained to rule out possible mass effect from edema, and there did not appear to be increased mass effect to account for her slightly increased lethargy.
An infectious work-up was obtained for additional causes of her lethargy and there is no evidence of ongoing infection.
While to patient is receiving steroid treatment she should have her fingerstick blood glucose levels closely followed and covered with an insulin sliding scale.
Papillary adenocarcinoma of likely lung primary, metastatic to brain.
Coronary artery disease.
High grade carotid stenosis.
History of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
