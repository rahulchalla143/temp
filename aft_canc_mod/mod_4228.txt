Admission Date:  [**2170-4-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-4-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea, Tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: A 82-year-old female with a history of recurrent large cutaneous B-cell lymphoma in complete remission, CAD, AS, A-fib, who presented to urgent care today for diarrhea and weakness and was sent to the ED for tachcardia.
She developed shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, post nasal drip and cough.
Her temp was 100.5 and given her cough she was thought to have a bacterial infection and was given augmentin 10 day course, and 4 day course of prednisone 40mg daily.
She completed her prednisone but while on the augmentin she developed 3-4 episodes of diarrhea per day.
She reports poor po intake over this time.
No chest pain, Shortness of breath.
This caused her to have symptoms of lightheadedness and a holter revealed runs of A-tach (question flutter).
In the ED initial vital signs were:  96.2 148 104/80 18 90% 2L L.  Her exam was significant for tachycardia.
A chest X-ray showed "Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild right basilar atelectasis".
A CT of the abdomen showed diffuse colitis.

Diffuse ST-T wave changes are primary and non-specific.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2170-4-4**]):       Positive for Respiratory viral antigens.
Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence.
**FINAL REPORT [**2170-4-8**]**     FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2170-4-7**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2170-4-8**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.

FECAL CULTURE - R/O YERSINIA (Final [**2170-4-8**]):    NO YERSINIA FOUND.
[**4-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild right basilar atelectasis.
Diffuse colonic wall thickening suggestive of pancolitis etiologies are ischemic/infectious/inflammatory.
Ischemia should be a strong consideration given the heart disease and extensive ASD involving the celiac and SMA.
Enlarged right atrium with retrograde opacification of IVC and hepatic veins with bilateral pleural effusions, ascites and body wall edema suggestive of right heart failure.
Unchanged bilateral renal cysts and left adrenal nodule.
ECHO: IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with severe LV systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior wall, septum and inferolateral wall suggesting either multi-vessel CAD or infiltrative process.
Calcified aortic valve with probable moderate to severe stenosis (low-output/low-gradient AS).
Mild aortic and at least mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Hypertrophied, dilated and depressed right ventricle with evidence of pressure-volume overload and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
No DVT in the left or right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old female with multiple medical problems including CAD, AS, [**Name (NI) 17584**] who presents with diarrhea in the setting of antibiotics for a UTI and found to be dehydrated and tachycardic.
On CT in ED patient was found to have pan-colitis and had elevated lactate of 5.7.
Patient also had tachycardia to 150s.
# Diarrhea: In ED patient had CT consistent showing pan colitis, which was thought secondary antibiotic associated diarrhea vs inflammatory vs ischemic.
Review of CT abd shows tapering of intra-abdominal vessels with atherosclerotic disease concerning for chronic ischemia, supported by guaiac + stool.
Per radiology, ischemia is strong consideration especially given heart disease and extensive ASD of celiac and SMA.
Patient was treated for infectious colitis with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.
Surgery was consulted to evaluate patient and felt that colitis was more likely infectious rather than ischemic given that the patient had a pan-colitis involving the rectum and her lactate had trended down.
# Acute on chronic heart failure ??????
Patient had TTE demonstrating EF 25-30% with right and left sided dysfunction and moderate/severe AS of 1 cm2.
Continues to be clinically volume overloaded with hypotension at 100s/50s improving with rate control.
No regional dysfunction to suggest recent ACS and negative cardiac enzymes.
Echo in [**5-27**] showed mild c.LVH with EF 55-60%, [**Doctor Last Name **] and mild RVE, mild-mod AS with peak/mean grad 24/13 and [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 cm2, mod MR, mod-severe TR with stable pulm art HTN (PAp=46).
Viral cardiomyopathy vs. missed acute coronary event vs. volume overload may be the etiology of heart failure.
There was concern for infiltrative disease on ECHO.
Her current tachycardia is likely related to volume depletion from poor PO intake and diarrhea.
Did not respond to esmolol given hypotension and was loaded with amiodarone which improved rate to 95-100.
Digoxin was stopped in the context of acute renal failure.
# Parainfluenza: Sputum cx positive for parainfluenza consistent with recent upper respiratory symptoms.
Pulmonary edema may also be contributing to dyspnea.
Ig panel with slightly decreased IgG and normal IgM/A.
# Elevated lactate: In the ED, lactate was initially 5.7.
Thought secondary to dehydration vs. poor perfusion [**12-20**] heart failure vs. ischemic colitis vs. infection.
Surgery was consulted for possible ischemic colitis as above and infection was treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics in ICU.
# Acute renal failure: At this point given history likely related to dehydration, pre-renal/ATN.
FeNa is 0.03% suggesting pre-renal etiology likely due to poor forward flow [**12-20**] CHF vs. dehydration.
# Supratherapeutic INR: INR was supratherapeutic on admission which places patient at risk for bleeding.
Patient had INR elevated as high as 17 during admission.
# Mild transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia: Mild elevations of AST and ALT with normal Alk phos and elevated total bilirubin.
Infection and shock liver also possibilities given parainfluenza and hypotension.
# Carotid Artery Stenosis: [**10-27**]: 50-69% R.ICA stenosis on u/s in '[**66**], with <50% stenosis in R.ECA/L.ICA/L.ECA.
+Hollenhurst plaque OD and long hx of visual blurring.
Medicine Floor Course: # Atrial fibrillation with tachycardia: Atrius cardiology service consulted and provided management recommendations throughout.
Metoprolol initially titrated up to 37.5 mg TID but patient became bradycardic and hypotensive.
Amiodarone was stopped due to concern for amiodarone-induced hepatic toxicity.
# Chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Echocardiogram showed depressed LVEF of 25% to 30%.
Recent lipid profile was normal so no statins were started.
Lisinopril was initially added but patient became hypotensive so it was stopped.
Etiology thought to be combination of congestive hepatopathy with ?
RQU showed patent hepatic vasculature with signs consistent with heart failure.
Diarrhea resolved.
Respiratory status was impaired with 4 Liter oxygen requirement on transfer.
# Parainfluenza: Supportive care.
Patient continued to have dry cough without sputum profuction.
Pt developed swelling and pain in the arm and LENIs showed non-occlusive thrombus in the brachial vein.
# Asymptomatic funguria: Patient had multiple negative urine culture and one culture positive for yeast.
Given patient was asymptomatic, there was no indication for treatment.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 64073**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] because you had diarrhea and cough and weakness.
We found that you had parainfluenza as well as inflammation of the colon (colitis) which was causing the diarrhea.
You developed a small clot in your right arm where you had a long IV.
