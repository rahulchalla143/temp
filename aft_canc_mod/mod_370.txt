Subtle opacity is noted at the left lung base which may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
Elsewhere, the lungs are clear noting minimal biapical scarring.
EGD [**2172-2-7**]: -Esophagus: Mucosa: Erythema was seen at the GE junction consistent with esophagitis.
-Stomach:  Mucosa: erythema and petechia were noted in the funus and cardia of the stomach.
There was contact bleeding but no single clear place to intervene upon and the abnormalities were diffuse.
The GJ anastamosis site was without ulceration or breakdown, although there was some congestion in the area of cancer recurrence.
Brief Hospital Course: 73F with history of recurrent gastric cancer, who presented with fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness in setting of 21 point drop in Hct, likely secondary to slow upper GI bleeding in setting of known gastric cancer with EGD this admission showing diffuse contact bleeding of gastritis.
# Iron deficiency anema/upper GI bleeding: Patient presented with symptomatic anemia and Hct 15.1, with guiac positive stool.
Her labs were suggestive of iron defiency anemia, with iron level 9 and ferritin 2.8, likely secondary to slow upper GI bleeding in setting of known recurrent gastric cancer.
Labs were not consistent with DIC or hemolysis.
EGD demonstrated esophagitis, as well as erythema and petechiae in stomach with contact bleeding but no single place to intervene upon.
The GJ anastamosic site was without ulceration or breakdown.
She will need Hct checked 1-2 times per week, as she is likely to have chronic slow GI bleeding.
She did not have evidence of metastatic disease on recent CT torso/PET CT.  Is followed closely at [**Hospital1 18**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**].
Transitional issues: -Patient's code status was FULL code this admission -Patient will need monitoring of Hct 1-2 times per week, as she will likely continue to have slow, ongoing blood loss.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 10594**],  You were admitted because you were lightheaded and short of breath.
We looked at your stomach with an endoscope (esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, or EGD).
We found that your esophagus and stomach were inflamed.
