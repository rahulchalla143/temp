MRI repeat([**9-21**]): 1) Unchanged appearance of rim enhancing mass within the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in a large amount of vasogenic edema with leftward shift of the mid-line by approximately 1.5 cm.
This finding does not appear neoplastic, as there is no associated contrast enhancement of a definable mass.
Chest CT ([**9-25**]): 1) Interval progression of metastatic disease with increase in size of left lower lobe pulmonary masses, interval development of new bilateral adrenal masses, and new 5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
2) No evidence of pneumonia.
3) New low attenuation lesion within the left kidney, which is only partially imaged on this study, concerning for a metastasis.
Head CT [**11-4**]: There are multiple masses in the brain parenchyma with associated surrounding vasogenic edema, most pronounced in both cerebral hemispheres.
There is no evidence of a metastatic lesion to the skull.
There are post-operative changes from a right temporal craniotomy.
The following issues were addressed druing this admission:  1.Neuro: An ititial MRI showed a significant amount of edema surrounding a hemorrhagic brain met s/p SRS.
This included a L facial droop, slurred speech, weak L shoulder, almost totally plegic L upper extremity, weak LLE, position sense and light touch impaired in L arm, leg spared.
He also had other mild deficits.
A repeat MRI was obtained which showed no cahnge in the edema or midline shift.
He then began to turn around, and his symptoms on exam began to slowly improve.
He was also having trouble ambulating due to a persistent lean to the left.
He did have periods of clarity though, and could carry on a conversation and answer normally.
A head CT was performed which was ultimately read as worsening edema and possible herniation, but was initially ambiguous.
He also had 2-3 episodes of tonic seizure activity followed by post-ictal nonresponsiveness.
He then proceeded to have a unilateral dilation of his right pupil which indicated acute herniation.
Before this was totally in, he also had dilation of his left pupil.
He had to be sedated on a propofol drip due to constant rigors, and was sent for immediate neurosurgery.
He went for right frontal craniotomy with resection of tumor to treat uncal herniation of right insular mass with edema.
At the time when he was transferred back to medicine he was having fevers and tachycarcia.
He was afebrile on antibiotics and they were continued for 3 days.
He was noted to have a decrease in his mental status.
After the third dose of XRT he had some improvement of his mental status, however it decreased again after his 4th dosage of XRT.
A repeat head CT showed increased edema and increased midline shift.
He was started on Megace for treatment of his renal cell carcinoma.
He had daily levels checked, with a goal of 15 or greater.
4.Nausea:He experienced some nausea on and off during the admission.
It became less of an issue later in the admission, as it had resolved.
5.Pain control/HA: He had a severe headache due to his edema.
He had some additional pains in his back and neck as he nearly slipped in the bathroom and feels that he pulled a muscle in his back.
The neck tension is probably a combination of HA pain and anxiety.
We continued to treat his pain with Oxydodone as needed.
However, he had a low grade fever and a CXR followed by chest CT were obtained.
They were negative for pneumonia, but did show a new lung met as well as bilateral adrenal mets.
It is felt that this is due to a combination of seizure effect, brain metastasis, and brain edema from WBXRT.
There is some hope that his mental status changes may resolve over time.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 54351**] - [**Location (un) 5503**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cerebral edema after stereotactic radiosurgery resulting in multiple neurological deficits, headache, and nausea/vomiting.
Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to lungs and brain.
Hypertension Seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Patients mental status has deteriorated markedly from admission.
He does moan frequently but has no verbarl responses and does not follow basic commands.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any fevers, hypotension, or uncontrollable pain.
