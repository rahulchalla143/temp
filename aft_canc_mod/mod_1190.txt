Admission Date:  [**2192-6-11**]       Discharge Date: [**2192-7-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-4-11**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL ONCOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Neurosurgery on [**2192-6-11**], for a cerebrospinal fluid leak from her Ommaya reservoir site and then transferred to O-Med on [**6-25**] after the leak had resolved, for further care for a methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection, hyponatremia secondary to serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and neutropenia.
Briefly, her course during her Neurosurgery admission, according to the transfer note and discussion with her attending, was as follows:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old right-handed Indian woman with metastatic breast cancer to the brain (parenchyma and leptomeningeal).
She returned to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**6-11**] with a cerebrospinal fluid leak from the site, and had a stitched placed, with no further leakage until [**6-22**], after receiving her most recent IT thiotepa (second dose).
This has not leaked since, but she does have a lodged area under her scalp which is most likely cerebrospinal fluid, which required no further treatment at that time.
She developed a methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection and a full workup for this also revealed positive methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in her right eye.
She has been on bed rest, and not able to actively participate in physical therapy or occupational therapy.
Upon transfer to O-Med on [**6-25**], her history is as follows: Her history is now most significant for neutropenia (white blood cells of 0.4 with an absolute neutrophil count of 320), methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection on intravenous vancomycin, and hyponatremia secondary to serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
The patient is unable to give a history secondary to her mental status changes and language barrier.
Breast cancer, metastatic to brain and leptomeninges; diagnosed in [**2192-2-3**] when she presented with arm cellulitis that did not respond to intravenous antibiotics.
An excisional biopsy was performed that revealed a 3 cm lesion consistent with both ductal and lobular cancer on pathology.
Pathology was consistent with a Grade II lobular carcinoma in situ.
In [**2192-5-2**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented with frontal headaches, nausea and vomiting.
An MRI showed metastases to the brain (the right posterior temporal lobe and right cerebellum and leptomeninges).
In this month, she also was diagnosed with serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone associated with mental status changes.
A lumbar puncture was done which showed equal opening pressures at the ventricle.
A head CT on [**5-22**] performed because the patient was somnolent as well as to assess changes in the patient's condition for possible chemotherapy, showed progression of hydrocephalus, but the fourth ventricle was not blocked and with equal opening pressures.
A gastrojejunostomy tube was also placed, and she received her second dose of intrathecal thiotepa on [**6-25**].
Hypertension 3.
Status post a motor vehicle accident in [**2181**] where she lost her left thumb, suffered a right eye corneal abrasion resulting in right eye blindness.
Gastrojejunostomy tube placement on [**5-21**] or 21 for inability to take food by mouth 6.
Atypical chest pain with two cardiac admissions since [**2192-2-3**] that have had negative workups  ALLERGIES:   Augmentin was documented previously, but son denies this is a true allergy.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her brother died of cirrhosis not associated with alcohol use, and there is no history of cancer in the family.
Zofran 2 mg twice a day intravenously as needed for nausea 6.
Hydrocodone/acetaminophen one tablet every four to six hours as needed for pain by mouth 10.
Urinalysis on [**6-21**] was yellow and hazy with a specific gravity of 1.01 and a pH of 7.5.
Micro on [**6-18**] blood cultures (two sets) had no growth.
[**6-21**] blood cultures (two sets) also had no growth.
[**6-21**] urine culture showed methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus greater than 100,000, gram-positive bacteria greater than 100,000, alpha hemolytic, consistent with strep or lactobacillus species.
[**6-24**] throat culture was negative for strep, and gynecologic culture was negative for N. gonorrhoeae.
CT head without contrast performed on [**2192-6-10**]: a.  Interval development of 5 mm wide water density subdural collection in the left frontoparietal region with associated effacement of the sulci without shift of midline structures.
Moderately prominent panventricular dilation not significantly changed compared to the prior examination.
The pattern is consistent with communicating hydrocephalus.
Chest x-ray performed on [**2192-6-12**]:  No evidence of congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or pleural effusion.
Ultrasound Doppler of the upper extremities performed because of an arm swelling with a right-sided PICC line showed no evidence of a deep venous thrombosis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism  5.
New left-sided subdural fluid collection which was not present on the prior examination and could be related to recent shunting c.  Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement along the cerebellar folia and vermis in addition to intra-axial enhancement within the right cerebellar hemisphere and the right inferior temporal lobe.
The posterior right temporal lobe appears to be slightly smaller in size on today's examination.
The patient's mental status has varied from not being able to open her eyes and communicate, to being able to follow simple commands and answer yes/no questions, to sometimes being responsive and interacting with the physicians, but this is rare.
This should improve the wound healing around the previous Ommaya site, gastrojejunostomy tube site, and buttocks decubiti, as well as decrease blood sugar.
Her hyponatremia resolved in one to two days, and has been stable ever since.
Cardiovascular:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was continued on metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day by mouth for her history of hypertension.
There are no other issues.
Pulmonary:  This was stable until [**7-6**], when she desaturated to 88%, new crackles were heard on examination, she had a temperature of 100.4 while on Tylenol, and a chest x-ray revealed some ill-defined patchy opacities consistent with an early pulmonary infection in the left middle lobe to left lower lobe as well as some right middle lobe atelectasis.
Thus ceftazidime and Flagyl intravenous was begun for a question of a possible aspiration pneumonia vs. hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Hematology/Oncology:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was begun on G-CSF for neutropenia and ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.
The neutropenia resolved by [**6-28**], and the ciprofloxacin was discontinued at that point.
Heparin subcutaneously was used for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Procrit weekly was begun for her anemia on [**6-29**], and she got a transfusion on [**7-3**].
Restaging MRIs of the head and spine as well as a bone scan are planned for either Monday, [**7-9**], or Tuesday, [**7-10**], in order to assess the direction of any further treatment in this patient.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also had occasional bouts of water diarrhea during her admission that were always C. difficile negative and treated with good response to Lomotil.
Pain management:  Several different pain regimens were used to help control constant pain that the patient was experiencing that she usually couldn't specify where it was.
Sometimes she complained of pain everywhere in her body.
In general, though, her pain has been poorly controlled, but the son objects to frequent narcotics, especially a patch, which does not clear the system quickly, as she becomes drowsy on these medications.
Her left arm cannot be used, as the tumor burden was high there, and the risk of clot is great.
Intravenous ceftazidime and Flagyl was started on [**7-6**] for a question of an early left middle lobe or left lower lobe pneumonia.
A full Infectious Disease workup was done at that time as well, and blood and urine cultures were negative.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  On [**7-9**], Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 28099**] care was transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a new O-Med team, and the rest of the hospital course and the discharge medications will be dictated as an addendum to this discharge summary by her.
Toradol as needed for pain 21.
