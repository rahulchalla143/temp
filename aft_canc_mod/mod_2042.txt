Admission Date:  [**2154-11-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2154-11-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-3-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  OBMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old female with a history of M4 AML who, on day 16 of status post ARA-C daunorubicin chemotherapy at [**Hospital 45098**] Hospital in [**State 2748**], was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of refractory thrombocytopenia resulting in a right frontal and mid-brain intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage.
About one month prior to her admission, the patient was noted to have fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue and weight loss, with a workup which showed leukocytosis of 25,000, with 58% blasts and flow cytometry consistent with AML M4.
She was treated with hydroxyurea, ARA-C, daunorubicin and this course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, for which the patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for her FNN.
At the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have blurry vision in her right eye, and was found to have fixed and dilated right pupil and changing mental status, and an MRI of the brain showed a 2 cm hemorrhage in the mid-brain and frontal lobe, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].
Marked thrombocytopenia requiring multiple transfusions (greater than 20 bags of platelets), packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma, which brought her platelets up to 134.
Febrile neutropenia 3.
Neurogenic bladder with a post-void residual initially of greater than 2300 cc 5.
Lesions in her spleen seen on MRI of the abdomen and CT of the abdomen 6.
At this point, she had had her platelet counts increasing to 274, and had a stable head CT and improving mental status.
This was thought to be a question of secondary to her intracranial bleed vs peripheral or spinal cord lesion.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Single woman with one child, no alcohol, no tobacco.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, no rubs, gallops or murmurs.
Cesarean section scar noted.
Extremities:  Pneumo boots in place, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologic: Bilateral ptosis, pupils as above, left hemiparesis with left upper motor neuron signs, increased tone in left upper extremity, brisk reflexes on left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 48-year-old female with AML status post ARA-C and daunorubicin one month ago, with intracranial bleed in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
The patient's other problems are febrile neutropenia, splenic lesions on abdominal imaging, difficult to replete electrolytes, residual neurologic deficits from her intracranial bleed, and her AML.
She is not yet in any state for any bone marrow transplant with her occasional confusion and residual neurologic deficits from her intracranial bleed, and will require a good deal of rehabilitation before this is done.
Neurology:  Status post her right mid-brain and right frontal lobe intracranial bleed, the patient slowly recovered some degree of mental status.
However, she did have a large degree of frontal disinhibition and did require a 24 hour sitter for her stay in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit because she often would get out of bed, saying that she needed to go home.
She remained having a right dilated and fixed pupil of 3 to 4 mm with bilateral ptosis and in inability to open her eyes.
She had initial left-sided weakness that gradually improved and, upon discharge, she had a mild defect of left pronator drift, but 4+/5 strength on her left upper and lower extremities.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also developed a neurogenic bladder.
This occurred in the setting of her having some mild urinary incontinence and a post-void residual of 2300 cc and bilateral hydronephrosis on abdominal CT.  A Foley was placed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and this remained in until the patient self-discontinued the Foley.
At that time, her Foley was left out, and she did not have post-void residuals after that.
Initially, the neurogenic bladder was thought secondary to most likely her CNS lesions, although on MRI of the spine, she did show a C5 through C7 T2 hyperintensity in a poor quality study.
Infectious Disease:  This woman with AML and initially with neutropenia did not spike any more fevers while on our service.
Her vancomycin and ceftazidime were discontinued at this time, however, her AmBisome was continued to treat the question of fungal lesions that appeared in her spleen.
This showed the multiple splenic lesions unchanged in size and distribution, with subtle peripheral enhancement which was thought to most likely represent infection, although foci of leukemic infiltration could not be excluded.
The patient also had a left upper pole renal cyst with separation.
She had a complex liver cyst and bilateral pleural fluid collections as other incidental findings.
They have been in contact with the Infectious Disease staff at [**Hospital 45098**] Hospital, but in brief their concern is that her splenic lesions suggest a splenic candidiasis.
They also recommended a CT of the chest to rule out any source of aspergillosis.
The Infectious Disease team felt that fungal disease should be ruled out before initiating her possible future bone marrow transplant.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Her potassium and magnesium were difficult to replete, most likely secondary to her AmBisome therapy.
She did pass a speech and swallow study on admission to the Intensive Care Unit, and had no trouble eating during her stay with us.
Cardiovascular:  Ms. [**Known lastname **], in the Intensive Care Unit, had what was initially thought to be a short run of ventricular tachycardia but was later thought to be just artifact by the Cardiology team.
She had mild 1+ aortic regurgitation, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, and a small pericardial effusion.
She had no other cardiovascular events during this hospitalization.
DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred back to her primary care team at [**Hospital 45098**] Hospital when there is a bed available.
Intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage in the setting of thrombocytopenia 3.
Febrile neutropenia 4.
Frontal inhibition, right ptosis and bilateral inability to open eyes secondary to her hemorrhage  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
