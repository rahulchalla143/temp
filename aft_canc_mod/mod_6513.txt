Pt was talking to friend, when noted to be stammering, having difficulty getting words out.
he had acute onset facial droop (unclear on what side), and then had bilateral extremity shaking, biting of tongue and ?
or urinary incontinence (his pants were wet by arrival to ED).
en route, he had another generalized tonic clonic event lasting about 5 minutes for which he received rescue medicine (unclear what amount/what medicine).
CTH was performed which demonstrated evidence of prior resection of mass.
He was unable to be taken to [**Hospital1 336**] (where he has received all his care for his GBM) [**2-23**] ICU bed availability and was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
he received an additional 50 fentanyl and 1 versed for CTH and received another identical dose of fentanyl and versed upon his return for sedation, after which he was seen by the neurology service.
ROS: Gen:  No fevers/chills/sweats, CP, SOB, palpitations, N/V, URI, cough, abd pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR, rash, travel  Neurological:  No deficits noted in:  memory, personality, vision, hearing, language/speech, swallowing, coordination, writing, walking, bowel/bladder function.
recurrence of mass in [**Month (only) 205**], repeat resection in [**8-29**].
resection complicated by wound infection and subsequent renal failure attributed to vancomycin treatment.
he also developed pulmonary emboli for which he was started on lovenox in [**10-29**].
pt with residual expressive aphasia.

No acute hemorrhage or evidence of herniation.
MRI: [**3-9**]: Postoperative changes in the left temporal region with a postoperative cavity containing blood products and marginal increased T2 signal.
Minimal mass effect on the atrium of the left lateral ventricle is seen.
EEG: [**3-9**]: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of runs of focal slowing involving both anterior quadrants with extension to the left posterior temporal lobe.
No sharp features were seen, and no apparent clinical correlate was noted with these.
These findings can be seen in dysfunction of sleep or midline structures, though the extension into the left temporal lobe suggests subcortical structural abnormalities in these areas.
No evidence of epileptogenesis was seen at the time of this recording.
MRI was obtained and demonstrated post surgical changes with residual enhancement.
EEG without epileptiform activity, although slowing was noted and found to be consistent with L temporal abnormality/resection.
Upon transfer to the floors, his clinical status gradually returned back to baseline, and he had no further seizure activity.
He was discharged to home after  demonstrating the ability to ambulate independently  MRI ([**2126-3-9**]): IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes in the left temporal region with a postoperative cavity containing blood products and marginal increased T2 signal.
Minimal mass effect on the atrium of the left lateral ventricle is seen.
Early R wave progression  CXR ([**2126-3-10**]): There are low lung volumes.
Aside from discoid atelectasis in the left mid-lung, the lungs are clear.
There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusions.
EEG ([**2126-3-9**]): This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of runs of focal slowing involving both anterior quadrants with extension to the left posterior temporal lobe.
No sharp features were seen, and no apparent clinical correlate was noted with these.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizures Glioblastoma s/p resection, on chemo   Discharge Condition: Good - near baseline with regards to known transcortical sensory aphasia   Discharge Instructions: You have had a series of seizures; you are now on a medication called Keppra to help prevent seizures.
