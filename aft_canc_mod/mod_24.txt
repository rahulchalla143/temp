Admission Date:  [**2158-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-3-6**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: transferred for seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation    History of Present Illness: 86y M with PMH significant for HTN, CAD s/p CABG, afib (now on warfarin), stroke 2y ago, and a seizure disorder on Keppra (previously seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 619**].
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
who presents with left ear pain.
His ear pain continued and this past Friday his PCP prescribed [**Name9 (PRE) 621**] gtt for presumed otitis externa.
Per his son, he developed progressive confusion and imbalance.
He returned to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] in the evening of [**2158-2-13**] (1d prior to transfer here), where his VS were notable for fever to 102.2F (after arriving afebrile) and tachycardia (normalized with 1.5 L IVF), and exam was notable for somnolence.
His WBC was elevated at 14.9.
ENT was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the following morning and switching to CTX (2gm IV) for mastoiditis Tx.
His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a very tiny focus of hemorrhage (hyperintensity) was seen at the posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle (~trigone).
There was also also a call of hyperintensity in the interpeduncular fossa (which would, if true, suggest subarachnoid blood, but on reviewing the images I think this is an overcall).
Finally, there was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks old, and could be the "old stroke" seen on MRI in [**2156**] on OSH workup in [**State 622**] for his only previous GTC seizure (see PMH, below).
The OSH physicians thought he may have hemorrhagic conversion of an acute stroke in the Right temporal lobe (despite a lack of any evidence for this on the NCHCT), and held his warfarin, which was a good idea anyway because he had a supratherapeutic INR at the time of 3.7.
After discussing the case with a Neurologist here at [**Hospital1 18**], they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy with vitamin K or FFP.
A TTE was obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did not show valvular vegitations, but did show several thickened/diseased valves.
He was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output (and urine was dark on arrival here).
Atrial fibrillation, lonstanding, now on warfarin (started [**2157-12-6**], see OMR Cardiology note)   4.  h/o stroke seen on MRI at OSH (in [**State 622**], on presentation for stroke, see below) > or = 2y ago, details unknown to me at this point other than an OSH MRI from [**2156**] showed an "old stroke," which seems like the most likely culprit for his subsequent memory deficits and the seizure in [**2-/2156**] (and now) and the old Right-temporal abnormality seen on HCT at the OSH.
Seizure disorder -- first seen by a Neurologist in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 623**] here @[**Hospital1 18**] in early [**2156**], seen two subsequent times through 9/[**2156**].
CAD s/p 3v CABG [**2143**]   8.  h/o SBO after knee surgery, details unknown to me at this point   9.  h/o "knee surgeries" (R-knee replacement)   10.
12.  h/o partial bowel resection (?no cancer found), temporary colostomy, reconnected; details unknown to me at this time, now c/b chronic diarrhea 2-3x per day.
13.  h/o prostate cancer s/p XRT, details unknown to me at this time   14.  unsteady gait, walked with cane at home   Social History: Former Navy engineer, retired >20y ago, [**2139**].
Functionally limited by depression and memory difficulties since stroke/seizure in early [**2156**].
No scleral icterus.
No carotid bruits appreciated.
No lymphadenopathy was appreciated.
Non-labored breathing with ventilator; when I changed vent from CMV to CPAP, the patient breathed regularly and appropriately in the [**11-28**]/min range with good tidal volumes (400-600mL) on [**5-18**] and 10/5 CPAP.
No masses or organomegaly were appreciated.
Extremities: Warm and well-perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Grimaces to pain and moves all four extremities spontaneously.
No papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages on fundoscopic examination.
-Motor: No tremor or fasciculations were observed.
Muscle bulk and tone are grossly normal, without any hypertonicity or spasticity that I can appreciate in UEs/LEs.
-Sensory: Minimal withdrawal to noxious stimuli (pinch, nailbed pressure) in all four extremities.
Biceps (++;++) brisk Triceps  (++;++) Brachioradialis (++;++) Quadriceps / patellar (++;++) brisk Gastroc-soleus / achilles (+;+) Plantar response was indeterminate bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: Current Labs:  WBC 6.2 Hb 11.4 HCT 34.6 Plt 161 Na 139 K 4.8 Cl 109 CO2 22 BUN 23 Cr 0.6 Glu 108 INR 1.4  EEG ([**2-15**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a poorly maintained 6.5 Hz background which appeared only briefly and due to generalized delta slowing which predominated the record.
This  represents a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
It is also abnormal due to the presence of right temporal slowing and lower voltage activitiy which indicate focal subcortical dysfunction.
Occasionally, left  fronto-temporal broad-based sharp waves were seen although they were not clear spikes, but may indicate a propensity to focal cortical irritability.
If the clinical suspicion for seizures is high, prolonged bedside EEG monitoring may helpful for further diagnosis  MR head: No acute infarction; Redemonstration of susceptibility and fluid-fluid layering within the bilateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] consistent with a scant amount of intraventricular hemorrhage; Opacification of the left mastoid which given the central diffusion abnormality may represent acute mastoiditis as there is no evidence that this is chronic, recommend clinical correlation.
CT abd ([**2-20**]):  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with no discrete transition point and an uncomplicated small bowel-containing left inguinal hernia, most likely represent ileus or enteritis  CT head ([**3-3**]): No acute abnormality is seen.
Old right temporal lobe infarction   Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 627**] is an 86-year-old man with a complicated past medical history that includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2143**], atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with a prior stroke and right temporoparietal encephalomalacia, history of small-bowel obstruction with a partial colectomy, temporary colostomy, and subsequent reanastomosis, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 628**] for a complaint of jaw pain and subsequent mastoiditis.
Seizures: He has had known seizure disorder since [**2156**] and was treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 629**] on Keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **].
At the OSH he had another GTC in the setting of lowering his AED to 250 [**Hospital1 **] and a fever (unknown origin).
He had MR imaging of his head to make sure there was no new process contributing to his change in status; MR imaging (including MRI/A/V) was normal.
He had Strep pneumoniae otitis media and mastoiditis complicated by bacteremia.
ENT felt the opacification was a chronic inflammation and that no surgery was indicated at this time.
ID consult was obtained and they suggested a TEE which was performed that showed no cardiac vegetations.
A BAL culture grew only Commensal Respiratory Flora.
He was started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl for his strep bacteremia and fevers and continued on this therapy until [**2-24**].
This was then changed to Ceftriaxone 2gm Q24h for 4 more days to complete a 2 week course of abx for Strep pneumo bacteremia.
Ileus: During hosptialization, he developed loose stools and abdominal distention.
KUB and CT scan suggestive of an ileus.
He had NG placed to wall suction for decompression.
It was held on day 1 of his hospitalization as it was supratherapeutic at 3.3 and there was concern of a small area of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Wound Care: He was found to have sacral coccyx tissue breakdown as was seen by wound care.
Determined to be severe fungal rash related fecal incontinence, no pressure related breakdown.
2. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for fungal rash.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Highgate Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: seizure d/o mastoiditis a.fib Strep bacteremia Ileus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions:   You presented to a hospital with a generalized tonic clonic seziure in the setting of a lowered AED dose and a fever.
They felt that this was chronic inflammation and no current intervention was reccommended at this time.
During hospitalization, you were having abdominal pain and distention; there was concern for a small bowel obstruction so you were seen by the surgery service.
