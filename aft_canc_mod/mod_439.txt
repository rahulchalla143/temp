Admission Date:  [**2110-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-4-8**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Benadryl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy  History of Present Illness: 84 year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension, long-standing diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (not on anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding), and chronic kidney disease (creatinine baseline ~[**1-14**]) who presented earlier today after a fall with left hip pain; a code stroke was called at 8:13 pm, after concern for a right MCA infarction on CT of the head.
At that time, he reported difficulty seeing multiple objects in the kitchen, including a kettle on the stove as well as a cup.
He did not have any clear weakness, difficulty with speaking or comprehension.
He has chronic tingling in his fingers related to diabetes, though no new sensory changes.
There was no observed head trauma nor loss of consciousness.
He reported pain in the left hip and was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Once at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent a trauma evaluation for his fall.
He was reporting pain and given 4 mg of morphine  at 5:55 pm for his discomfort, then 50 mg bendadryl at 6:04 pm for subsequent itchiness.
An attempt to perform CT scan was made around this time (~6 pm), but the patient was sent back as he was becoming increasingly confused and unable to sit still.
He received the CT of the head at 7:45 pm and a code stroke was called at 8:13 pm after a preliminary read of a right middle cerebral artery stroke.
Review of Systems: Unable to obtain at this time due to confusional state.
Past Medical History: Chronic Systolic CHF - Echo [**3-20**] with EF 25% Hypertension Dyslipidemia Afib not on Coumadin CKD IV, baseline 2.1-2.5, sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**] Anemia - likely mixed, CKD and Iron Deficiency, baseline 35-39 DM, on insulin, hgb A1c 9.2 [**3-20**] Gastritis - hematemesis [**2109-7-12**].
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.6 F  BP 133/75   P 84    RR 14    SaO2 100 RA General: Thin, elderly gentleman - mildly deshevelved appearing.
Mildly dysarthric speech but fluent.
Eyes move to the left and right, but no gaze deviation.
Tongue midline and palate elevated evenly.
Sensorimotor: Normal bulk throughout, though tone is difficult to assess given active movement.
He had mild L pronator drift but full strength otherwise.
Coordination and gait: Mild dysmetria with FTF more on L likely reflecting weakness.
Ambulatory with minimal assistance.
Acute infarct of the distal right MCA (M3) distribution.
No intracranial hemorrhage at this time.
Carotid US [**3-31**]: No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis in their extracranial portion.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending and descending thoracic aorta are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
In the absence of a history of marked hypertension, the findings are suggestive of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid, Fabry's etc.)
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension, long-standing diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (not on anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding), presented to ED after a fall and left hip pain.
Code stroke was called after a head CT concerning for R MCA infarct and his examination was limited, given an acute confusional state with left upgoing toe is the only clear localizing finding at the time.
He was out of the window for intervention and vessel imaging and contrast studies were risky given his degree of renal failure.
Patient was admitted to neurology service and he underwent pelvis study to rule out hip fracture and renal US to rule out renal obstruction.
His left lower back pain most likely spasm s/p fall since he responded very well to small dose Valium and analgesics.
Although, he initially was quite confused, he improved significantly with near full strength on his left side except for mild left facial, left pronator drift and some dysarthria.
Given that patient has Afib and this is most likely cardioembolic stroke given the risk factors, GI was consulted about his hx of gastritis and possible duodenal AVM.
GI recommended colonoscopy for risk stratification - bowel prep was extremely difficult.
He has hx of several failed colonoscopies in the past due to poor prep.
Also, given his CHF hx and Afib, cardiology was also consulted who recommended changing Coreg to Metoprolol since it is less hypotensive and he was instructed to restart low dose ACEI per PCP as outpatient.
He had repeat echocardiogram that showed even more reduced EF of 20~25% and signs of infiltrative disease hence SPEP and UPEP were checked that appeared within normal range.
He will be following up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] at the heart failure clinic.

[**Last Name (STitle) **]:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnoses: right middle cerebral artery cardioembolic stroke uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (A1C 9.7) systolic congestive heart failure (EF 20-25%) left lower back strain  secondary diagnoses: atrial fibrillation chronic renal insufficiency mildly elevated ammonia hypertension anemia, secondary to iron deficiency and chronic kidney disease  Discharge Condition: mild left sided neglect with mild left facial droop  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a right middle cerebral artery territory stroke that was likely cardioembolic.
On echocardiogram, you were found to be in worsened congestive heart failure (EF 20-25%) and were seen by cardiology who recommended that you follow-up in heart failure clinic as an outpatient.
Because of atrial fibrillation, stroke and heart failutre, you were started on a blood thinning medication called Warfarin which will need close blood checks after undergoing colonoscopy to assess for gastro-intestinal bleeding risk.
Given your heart failure and low ejection fraction, please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Also please adhere to 2 gm sodium diet and fluid restriction: 1.5 liters  Please call your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 911 if you have new weakness/numbness, visual problems including transient blindness and/or speech problems including slurring of speech.
