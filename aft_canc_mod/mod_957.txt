Admission Date:  [**2198-1-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-11-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Neutropenic fever, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p IVAC D11 who presents with fever, nausea and vomiting of 1 day duration.
He was feeling overall well until this morning when he developed a fever of 102.
Denies abdominal pain or diarrhea.
Denies cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea or headache.
Denies shortness of breath or chest pain.
Does report increased urinary frequency but no dysuria.
Yesterday he went to his outpatient oncology appointment, received 1 unit platelets with no complications and felt well enough to walk home.
He was noted to be in AFib at a rate of 135-160 which improved without intervention.
Hospital stay was also complicated by Atrial Fibrillation treated with metoprolol and digoxin.
Patient also has history of pulmonary embolism ([**10-15**] admission) felt to be secondary to right atrial catheter-associated thrombus complicated by likely TIA/amaurosis fugax.
Patient was treated with fondaparinux but this was then stopped last admission due to thrombocytopenia.
ROS: The patient denies melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
During the preceding six months, he reported a history of the generalized body pain as well as fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite.
He also reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats, and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months.
Marked improvement of both his musculoskeletal and constitutional symptoms after prednisone treatment.
He then presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
He has had a history of PAF in the past.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys with characteristics felt atypical for lymphoma.
A follow-up MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] then underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by a high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a "double hit" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma.
TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right atrial catheter, with no PFO.
He was discharged on [**2197-11-18**] with no further episodes.
Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.
Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening and admission for neutropenia.
During admission, noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125 mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily.
Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension and cough.
A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin.
Follow up PET scan on [**2194-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central lucencies most of which were new.
He underwent CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli.
Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high-dose cyclophosphamide.
Admitted on [**2198-1-15**] for IVAC (originally admitted for high-dose MTX, but PET scan showed progressive disease).
He has had recurrent disease within 2 - 3 months of his last treatment.
Patient recently admitted [**Date range (3) 21959**] for CNS prophylaxis with high-dose MTX for his aggressive lymphoma.
However, PET scan prior to admission was concerning for rapidly progressive disease and CT torso on admission agreed with these findings and his LDH continued to rise.
PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in the past several months.
He had no history of treatment with anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in [**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and digoxin.
Pulmonary embolism, currently receiving treatment with fondaparinux.
Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed in [**2197**] and managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], although further treatment on hold while getting treatment for lymphoma and unclear if his symptoms were related to lymphoma and not PMR.
Recent probable TIA with from thrombus on right atrial catheter tip  Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is married and lives in [**Location **].
Family History: Father had an MI in his 70s and his paternal grandfather had an MI in his 40s.
His younger brother had probable schizophrenia and died from suicide at age 18.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T: 98.8 BP: 100/53 HR: 64 RR: 18 O2Sat: 94% 2L GEN: Pale, thin, no acute distress.
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear, pale conjunctiva NECK: No JVD, COR: Irregular rate, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, ND, +BS, mild tenderness on LLQ and RUQ but described as "tightness" and not overt abdominal pain, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
[**2198-2-12**] Right lower lobe biopsy: Acute and organizing pneumonia with abscess formation.
No fungal organisms identified on GMS and PAS stains.
[**2198-2-12**] Lymph node biopsy right, level 12: No carcinoma identified in three examined lymph nodes.
IMAGING: [**2197-1-27**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared right basal and perihilar opacity with subtle air bronchograms, in continuation with the inferior hilar structures.
In the setting of neutropenia and fever, a newly appeared pneumonia must be suspected.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Mesenteric edema and ascites may reflect third spacing.
Sequence of radiographic findings to suggest pneumonia present on [**1-28**] worsened in the right lower lobe on [**1-29**] and then the patient subsequently developed pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions remain.
[**2198-2-8**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis w/ con: Large area of consolidation within the right lower lobe now has a new area of cavitation.
This could represent progression of known pneumonic consolidation or be representative of fungal disease.
[**2198-2-13**]: CXR: Moderate right pneumothorax has changed in distribution, with a change in posture from supine to erect, now visible in the upper hemithorax.
There is substantial atelectasis at the base of the postoperative right lung and perihilar consolidation which could be atelectasis.
Obviously follow up will be careful for possibility of postoperative pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 59M with Burkitt's-like DLBCL s/p R-[**Hospital1 **], high-dose cytoxan, and recent IVAC for progressive disease, initially admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, found to have pneumonia.
# Neutropenic Fever: The patient presented on [**1-26**] with neutropenic fever to 102 and nausea/vomiting.
He became hypoxic requiring oxygen, and hypotensive requiring Levophed, and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
CXR and CT showed RML/RLL pneumonia (management of pneumonia is discussed below) and micafungin was added.
# Pneumonia: Patient was found to have a RML/RLL pneumonia on CXR, confirmed by CT chest.
He improved clinically, though continued to have intermittent low-grade fevers and productive cough.
There was concern for aspiration so he underwent a video-assisted swallowing study which did not reveal any aspiration, though he was switched to thin liquids and soft solids with aspiration precautions.
A repeat CT chest on [**2-8**] showed new cavitary lesion within the pneumonia.
Antibiotics were switched to vanc/zosyn for better anaerobic coverage out of concern for aspiration pneumonia.
At this point the patient was due for another round of chemotherapy, which could not be initiated in the setting of active pneumonia.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] took the patient to the operating room on [**2-12**] where he underwent right thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with buttressing of bronchial staple line with intercostal muscle, and bronchoscopy with BAL.
The patient remained in the ICU POD 1, to monitor atrial fibrillation.
# Increased stool output: Unclear etiology, but all of his stool studies negative, including numerous C. diff toxins.
# DLBCL: Burkitt's-type lymphoma, previously on R-[**Hospital1 **], high-dose cytoxan, and IVAC with continued anemia and thrombocytopenia s/p chemo.
# Atrial fibrillation: His HR was poorly controlled despite uptitrating the digoxin and metoprolol.
Oxycodone 5-10mg PO Q4H prn pain 9.
Guaifenesin-DM NR 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) mL PO twice a day as needed for cough for 5 days.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Pneumonia - Atrial fibrillation .
Secondary diagnosis: - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics and the surgeons then removed part of your infected right lung.
