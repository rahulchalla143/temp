Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2174-1-14**]: Left VATS converted to left thoracotomy, basilar segmentectomy of the left lower lobe.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a woman with metastatic colon cancer to the left lower lobe.
The patient had limited pulmonary reserve due to longstanding bronchiectasis in the lingula.
Given the size of the tumor we felt that local control would be best achieved by surgical resection.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known firstname 4134**] [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2174-1-14**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a left VATS converted to left thoracotomy, basilar segmentectomy of the left lower lobe and mediastinal lymph node dissection for metastatic colon cancer.
She recovered in the PACU, where anesthesia placed an epidural for better pain control.
She was subsequently transferred to SICU for close observation of respiratory function.
Below is a systems review of her hospital course:  Neurologic/Pain: The patient was given an epidural with bupivicaine and dilaudid postoperatively in PACU for pain relief which was effective, but the patient become more sedate, therefore dilaudid split and then dc'd.
The patient was intubated [**2174-1-16**] for pneumonia and while intubated was sedated on propofol and prn fentanyl.
On date of discharge the patient denies pain, off all pain medication.
The patient had agitation requiring initial versed, then olanzapine, queitapine, then geriatrics was consulted on [**2174-1-28**] to assist in managment.
Pulmonary: Pulmonary toilet was instituted post op, she was noted to experience desaturations and intraoperative bronchoscopy showed purulent fluid in the left upper lobe.
BAL grew 4+ PMNs and 4+ GNR and she was started on antipseudomonal coverage in PACU.
She was subsequently transferred to SICU for close observation of respiratory function.
A repeat bronchoscopy was done on [**1-20**] with thick secretions on left around stump and right middle lobe.
Cardiovascular: The patient developed postoperative atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled initially with diltiazem drip, after diltiazem 5mg IV x 2 and then metoprolol 5mg IV.
Lasix drip was started [**1-20**] for volume overload which adequately diuresed the patient, then changed to 20mg IV BID on [**1-23**].
Hematology: CBC and fevers curves monitored closely.
Heparin gtt was started [**2174-1-23**] for persistent atrial fibillation with goal PTT 50-70.
Coumadin was started on [**2174-1-26**] for persistent atrial fibrillation.
VAP + antipseudomonal coverage: cefepime + tobramycin, vanco was started [**2174-1-16**].
