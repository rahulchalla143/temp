Rectal: Heme Negative Musc/Extr/Back: No edema Skin: Warm and dry .
No new or worsening lung abnormalities to suggest pneumonia.
CT head [**2144-3-12**] - No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Post-surgical changes in the right frontal lobe, with mild leftward shift and moderate vasogenic edema and mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, with improvement compared to the prior CT study of [**2144-3-1**].
Consider followup as felt necessary, with MR, to assess for post-surgical changes/tumor.
KUB [**2144-3-12**] - No evidence of small/large bowel obstruction.
Pneumoperitoneum seen consistent with prior imaging.
CT torso [**2144-3-10**] - Moderate pneumoperitoneum is unchanged from two hours prior, however extent of portal venous gas is improved.
While no oral contrast was administered to assess for leak, no fluid collection is seen within the abdomen.
Atherosclerotic disease, with normal enhancement of mesenteric vessels.
No secondary findings of bowel ischemia as cause for portal venous gas.
No cause identified for portal venous gas, which may also be iatrogenic ad has been decribed following NG tube placement 3.
Small bubble of gas in the urinary bladder, probably due to recent catheterization; correlation with history of such is recommended.
EKG [**2144-3-10**] - Sinus rhythm.
Modest low amplitude T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2144-3-1**] sinus tachycardia is absent, delayed R wave progression pattern is less prominent and ST-T wave changes have decreased.
No focal liver lesions are seen.
No biliary dilation is seen.
A trace amount of ascites is present within [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Bilateral LENIs: negative for DVT  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought into the Emergency Deptarment after having coffee grounds from his PEG tube on [**2144-3-8**].
The PEG had been placed on [**3-4**] for swallow failure and need for enteral feeding.
There did not appear to be any bleeding related to the recent PEG tube placement.
He had an EKG which was unchanged from prior and he had a CTA Chest which showed no PE, but did reveal moderate pneumoperitoneum and portal venous gas likely related to recent gastric insufflation for PEG placement.
He became less tolerant of his tube feeds and had an increasing WBC#, as well as persistent orhtostatic hypotension on hospital day 4.
Had been on Dexamethasone since the frontal cranial resection but leukocytosis was new.
No diarrhea but possibility of CDiff given high white count and recent hospitalizations/rehab placement.
Aspiration pneumonia and microperforation given persistent pneumoperitoneum also on the differential.
Increased lethargy since transfer out of the SICU also concerning for encephalitis/meningitis and abscess in setting of recent instrumentation of the central nervous system.
Serial KUBs showed slow resolving of pneumoperitoneum.
CTA torso did not show any pathology in the liver parenchymal or biliary tree.
RUQ ultrasound with dopplers were also negative for any acute processes.
It was felt that the patient likely had transient liver damage in setting of hypotension from hypovolemia.
Leukocytosis and general physical status improved with starting Zosyn.
# ORTHOSTATICS: Concerning for sepsis (infectious etiology) vs. hypovolemia.
More likely the latter given poor Gtube absorption and response to intravenous fluids.
Physical therapy worked closely with patient who was no longer orthostatic by day of discharge.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Concerning for infection/abscess vs. microperforation given recent instrumentation.
Patient was started on metoclopramide, antibiotics and a bowel regimen with resolution of his symptoms.
# NSCLC with brain metastasis: Radiation oncology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13014**]) saw patient in-house and felt he would benefit from some adjuvant radiation therapy to be started early next week.
# DM: Made NPO due to high residuals from Gtube flushes upon transfer to the Medicine Service.
# Anoxic brain injury/dementia: Mildly confused at times, requiring orientation.

# Elevated LFTs: Patient had elevated ALT.
Liver ultrasound and CT A/P without obvious metastatic lesions.
he should have repeat CXR in [**2-5**] days ([**Date range (1) 88312**]) to assess for any evidence of recurrent aspiration in which case may need to modify diet or make patient NPO with re-initiation of tube feeds.
