Admission Date:  [**2164-12-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-3-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-4-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: ED admit to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for status epilepticus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: A-line placement Endotrachial tube placement NG tube placement   History of Present Illness: 26yo woman with polysubstance abuse who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for status epilepticus, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] intubated for further evaluation.
Per pt's sister's, pt was in USOH, without complaining of fevers, chills, headaches, or other symptoms.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: LP obtained without meningitis.
Pt was followed by the neurology team who initially felt that her seizures were due to substance toxicity, however, after review of EEG, felt that there may be an aspect of epileptiform changes.
She was initially on broad spectrum antibiotics, but after CSF showed no meningitis and all other cultures remained negative, these were discontinued.
Of note, cxr on [**12-24**] was consistent with an aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
Past Medical History: - one febrile childhood seizure (age 2; chickenpox) - seizures after shooting cocaine (during the past year) - hep C for few years - s/p C-section 4wks ago; baby was addicted - three pregnancies   Social History: + heroin, intravenous cocaine, smoking, oxycontin Recent time spent in jail for one week, released [**2164-12-18**] (unclear which charges--mostly drug related and shoplifitng) Three children with three fathers [**Name (NI) 32007**] 4 weeks ago Currently without a home; stays at others' places or on the street  Family History: Family History: - nephew with seizures - no sudden death - both parents with etoh abuse  Physical Exam: VITALS: T102.3 HR144 BP116/81 RR15 sO295 GEN: intubated, feels warm, sedated HEENT: mmm; PERRL, mildly injected, unable to assess oropharynx NECK: in hard collar, trachea midline, no LAD LUNGS: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes HEART: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and physiologically split S2, no murmur or rub ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended; scar of C-section looks clean; some vaginal bleeding EXTREMITIES: no clubbing, cyanosis, ecchymosis, or edema; no petechial rash or vesicular rash MENTAL STATUS: intubated; currently not on any sedatives (but s/p ativan, fosphenytoin, PB and vecuronium-this was given 1.5 hr prior to this exam).
Not responding to voice or noxious.
Disc margins sharp, no pappilledema.
V: No corneals or response to nasal tickle VII: Face symmetrical VIII: - IX: no gag XII: - [**Doctor First Name 81**]: - MOTOR SYSTEM: Normal bulk.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no clonus.
No spontaneous movements and no response to noxious.
No clear infiltrate or effusion.
[**2164-12-22**] CT Head: No evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute ischemic changes.
Bilateral air fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses may be secondary to intubation, however, could also represent acute sinusitis .
[**2164-12-22**] CT Cspine: No fracture or dislocation .
Probable aspiration left upper lung lobe vs consolidation; 2. mildly dilated fluid filled loops of small and large bowel throughout abd/pelvis; 3. peri-portal vein edema which can be a CT sign of liver disease;  4.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
The first abnormality of bilateral central sharps is consistent with cortical irritability in these regions.
The generally slowed background and suppressed background would be suggestive of medication effect.
If clinical  suspicion for seizures remains, intermittent EEGs or bedside telemetry would be suggested.
[**12-24**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-21**] through 26: Mild vascular congestion and small regions of peribronchial opacification have developed at the lung bases since [**12-23**] and may represent volume overload and early pneumonia, respectively.
No pneumothorax.
[**12-27**] EEG IMPRESSION: Minimally abnormal EEG due to the occasional generalized slowing in wakefulness.
This suggests a disturbance in midline structures but is not specific with regard to etiologies.
Some might even be due to drowsiness, possibly in turn the sign of a mild encephalopathy.
Nevertheless, the background rhythm reached normal frequencies at times, and there were no areas of focal slowing or any epileptiform features.
[**12-31**] CT head FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or acute territorial infarction.
There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
There are no pleural effusions.
The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable aside from mild thoracic scoliosis.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary infiltrates.
[**12-31**] Upper arm U/S FINDINGS: In the left upper arm medially, there is a subcutaneous collection measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm with well-defined margins, without vascularity, but with echogenic debris within it.
In the mid upper arm, there is a 1.1 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm thick-walled noncompressible collection without vascularity.
[**1-2**] Video Swallow FINDINGS: Barium of varying consistencies was administered to the patient under fluoroscopic guidance in conjunction with the speech pathologist.
There was no evidence of aspiration with any consistency barium.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 70746**] is a 26 female with history of polysubstance abuse who has suffered anoxic brain injury on account of drug-induced seizures.
Her mental status remained depressed, with slurred speech, thought to be from expected prolonged post-ictal state [**3-1**] status.
Patient was extubated without event and her new baseline functional status is likely secondary to anoxic brain injury sustained during seizures.
# Thrombocytosis: Resolved.
Could also have been due to inflammation from hypoxic encephalopathy.
# Hypoxic encephalopathy: Improvement from admission, although patient has suffered anoxic brain injury thus limiting her ADLs.
She has been seen by Speech Pathology and has had improvement in ability to speak.
Most likely secondary to cocaine use, given pt's history of cocaine-induced seizures.
No further seizures since admission.
# Transaminitis: Resolved.
Likely secondary to hypotension in setting of status epilepticus superimposed on underlying HepB sAb and cAb positive.
Patient did not experience withdrawal symptoms while on the floor.
# Possible suicide attempt prior to admission: Psychiatry evaluated patient and believe that she is not at current risk for suicidal gestures given her poor functional status and greatly diminished executive function.
