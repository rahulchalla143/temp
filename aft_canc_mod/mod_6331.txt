# Septic Shock - Source likely pulmonary vs. GI.
Unable to trend SvO2 or CVP 2/2 SVC syndrome and inability to place upper extremity central line.
Stool was negative for cdiff.
Her condition was noted to improve with a resolution of her sepsis.
# Febrile Neutropenia - s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/gemcitabine treatment [**2-2**].
She had no other signs concerning for infection.
SBO vs. ileus - thought to to be infection associated ileus, as pt was putting out stool, had bowel sounds, and admission CT abdomen not convincing of SBO.
On [**2-12**] she had leaking around her G-tube site, and she had excess residuals and tube feeds were held, and gradually restarted without difficulty.
# Loculated Right Pleural Effusion - IP drained 400cc of fluid from the pleurix catheter which when analyzed was found to be consistent with an exudative process, most likely her underlying NSCLC.
Cultures of pleural fluid were negative.
# Oliguria - Persisted despite adeqate IVF resuscitation and stabilization of her renal function.
IVF boluses of NaHCO3 transiently improved UOP but patient remained oliguric and was ~14 liters positive.
# Pancytopenia - Patient with low blood counts secondary to chemotherapy on admission.
This resolved on [**2-13**] with recovery of her cell lines.
