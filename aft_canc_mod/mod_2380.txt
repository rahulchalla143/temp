He is readmitted today for fevers up to 101.6 at rehab.
Please see discharge summary from 7/210, [**2162-6-3**] and [**2162-5-19**] for details of his previous hospitalizations.
In brief, the patient had pseudomonal infection of his lungs, he had been treated with 21 day course of Colistin and Meropenem, and was on Colistin IH for suppression.
Additionally, he had an upper extremity DVT that was treated with fondaparinux 2.5mg, which was discontinued on last admission.
CXR showed bilateral pneumothoraxes (moderate on right, small on left).
In addition, it showed multiple nodular bilateral opacities improved since prior but persistant suspicious for infection.
He remained stable there and on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] vital signs were T- 98.4, HR- 94, BP- 110/81, RR- 23, SaO2- 100% on MV with no respiratory complaints whatsoever.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant pseudomonas.
Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo SCT 2.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.
