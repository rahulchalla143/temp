Admission Date:  [**2183-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-12-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-1-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Morphine And Related  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**] Chief Complaint: IP evaluation with collapsed L lung due to lung cancer/mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, tumor resection and argon plasma coagulation   History of Present Illness: HPI: 53 yo F with NSCLC diagnosed on [**2183-11-16**] transferred from OSH for evaluation by IP for a mass obstructing her left main stem bronchus.
At the time of her original diagnosis, the patient had presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a left lung mass.
Further workup revealed poorly differentiated NSCLC.
An MRI of the brain and bone scan were reportedly negative but PET scan showed increased uptake in the left lung as well as numerous chest lymph node regions.
There was also mild uptake in the left adrenal (unclear if this is metastatic disease).
On the evening of [**2183-12-12**] she had chest tightness and was admitted to the hospital on [**2183-12-13**] with a collapsed left lung.
She developed hemoptysis yesterday while on the medicine floor at the OSH and was transferred to their ICU.
A bronchoscopy was performed this afternoon prior to transfer and showed a large area of endobronchial mass and obstruction.
She currently denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or any difficulty breathing.
NSCLC dx [**10/2183**] - stage IIIB versus IV (unclear if uptake in adrenals is metastatic disease).
Hypothyroidism 4.
Meningioma s/p removal in [**5-4**] 5.
Family History: Father died of prostate cancer (metastatic to bone); morther died of stroke at age 66   Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals - BP 104/70, HR 82, RR 19, O2 94% RA HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, oropharynx clear Neck - supple, no palpable lymphadenopathy Heart - RRR, no murmur appreciated Lungs - decreased breath sounds throughout left lung Abdomen - soft, NT/ND Ext - no edema, pulses 2+ bilaterally   Pertinent Results: OSH Imaging: [**2183-12-13**] CTA Chest - No evidence of pulmonary embolism; Near complete collapse of the left lung.
This is likely due to left hilar mass encasing the distal left main stem bronchus.
[**2183-12-15**] CXR - complete opacification at the left hemithoax is again seen with shift in the mediastinum to the left consistent with obstuctive pneumonitis with collapse demonstrated on recent chest CT scan.
OSH Micro: [**2183-12-13**] Blood - no growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo F recently diagnosed with NSCLC in [**11-5**] now with obstructing mass in left brochus.
Transferred for evaluation by interventional pulmonology.
# Left lung collapse - bronch today at OSH showed near complete collapse of left lung with mass obstructing the left main stem bronchus.
# NSCLC - plan per oncologist after IP workup; had port place today.
# Hypothryoid - continue levothyroxine 75mcg daily .
The interventional pulmonologists performed a rigid bronchoscopy and debridement of the left mainstem bronches under general anesthesia.
On the 21st Flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, mechanical resection of tumor, covered metal stent placement in the left lower lobe/left mainstem bronchus and balloon dilation were carried out, and the patient demonstrated no adverse sequelae from the procedure.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
