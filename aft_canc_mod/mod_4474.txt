Admission Date:  [**2136-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-11-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-5-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: Nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Video swallow study EGD Insertion of Pigtail catheter in R pleural space   History of Present Illness: 74 year-old man with glottic squamous cell carcinomal s/p chemo and XRT as well as T3N0Mx poorly differentiated carcinoma of the lung in remission presenting after a recent hospitalization for dysphagia with continued dysphagia and poor PO intake leading to weakness.
He had dilation of a relativley quite minor esophageal stricture during that hospitalization and afterwards improved and was discharged.
In the context of this poor intake he reports he has gotten very week and though he reports a month or so ago he could walk several blocks over the last weeks he does not think he could do this.
Aside from his weakness and poor intake he reports chronic back pain on his left side, where he had a previous surgery.
He has subjective fevers and chills and reports chronic cough but this is nonproductive.
He does have chronic production of sputum in his mouth that he does not feel he can handle and swallow and spits in a basin throughout our interview.
He denies odynophagia.
He also endorses chronic anorexia and more recently having had some subjective fevers or chills though he reports dysuria or localizing singns except for his chronic, nonproductive cough and approximately two episodes of loose stool a day, which he reports are immediately after he eats.
He has mild headache.
He denies abdominal pain, dysuria, or flank pain.
He denies dyspnea at any other time.
Because of inability to manage these symptoms at home he presented to the ED.
He had labs and cultures, which revealed a leukocytosis but UA and chest radiograph were both without signs of acute infection and he was afebrile.
Currently, he discusses his litany of complaints and is very irritated by how poorly he is feeling.
He does ask for supplements, however, and is very concerned with his PO intake.
Notably negative for abdominal pain, shortness of breath (except immediately following emesis), and vomiting with liquids.

No infiltrate or pulmonary edema appreciated.
There is a circular lucency of the left clavicle that appears new from previous chest radiographs though radiograph from [**Month (only) 216**] shows a circular lucency likely linked to the lung.
No acute intrapulmonary process, ?
lytic lesion in left clavicle.
Bed Side Swallow Study SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Known lastname 84573**] is well known to me from previous swallowing evaluations.
We repeated his video swallow after that procedure before d/c but swallow function was c/w previous exams and he remained safe for thin liquids and soft foods with extra sauce and gravy.
It is unlikely his oral and pharyngeal have changed since [**Month (only) 205**] when we did his last video swallow and he has been recently dilated which rules out the possibility he restrictured.
We will plan to f/u with him after treatment for H pylori to see if he feels his oral and pharyngeal swallow has improved further.

Fluid distends esophagus and aerosolized material in lower lobe airways and extensive aspiration pneumonitis.
Bilateral pulmonary nodules some pleural based.
Right apical paraseptal emphysema.
Trace pleural effusions.
Left 7th rib sclerosis, probably post traumatic.
CLINICAL INDICATION: 74 year old man with metastatic lung cancer, glottic cancer, presumed aspiration pneumonia, and acutely worsening SOB.
CHEST FINDINGS:  There is no central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Evaluation of distal subsegmental branches is slightly limited secondary to incomplete opacification with contrast.
The previously described subtle filling defect involving the right middle lobe subsegmental branch is favored to be artifactual.
No additional filling defects are identified.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Loculated fluid in the left anterior hemithorax with peripheral enhancement is unchanged.
There are small, left greater than right, bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis at the bases.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, predominantly involving the prevascular space/anterior mediastinum, is unchanged in size.
A small right pneumothorax is new from the prior examination.
There is underlying centrilobular and periseptal emphysema.
There are new and worsening areas of scattered ground-glass opacities with septal thickening, predominantly involving the right lung.
Patchy parenchymal opacity in the medial base is noted.
There is a new subpleural nodular opacity measuring 6 mm in the left upper lobe (3:12).
A pleural-based nodule at the left base measuring 10 x 12 mm is essentially unchanged.
The esophagus is newly distended and fluid filled.
Atherosclerotic changes are present within the normal caliber aorta.
There is focal narrowing of mild degree in the left main pulmonary artery, unchanged from prior examinations (3:16).
An enlarging liver lesion in the left hepatic lobe measures 6.1 x 8.2 cm.
There is abdominal ascites.
MUSCULOSKELETAL FINDINGS: There is asymmetric left greater than right subcutaneous fat stranding in the chest wall.
Post-surgical changes are present in the left posterior ribs.
Incompletely healed fracture with callus formation is present in the left fifth lateral rib.
New small right pneumothorax.
No definite evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Stable pleural/parenchymal nodules, left hydrothorax and small left pleural effusion.
New areas of scattered ground-glass opacities with septal thickening, predominantly on the right, related to inflammatory or infectious etiology.
Bronchial wall thickening at the left base with patchy consolidation, minimally progressed, possibly secondary to aspiration.
Fluid-filled and dilated esophagus, new from the prior examination which may relate to esophagitis or possibly early stricture formation.
Please correlate for symptoms of esophagitis.

DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7722**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7723**] Approved: TUE [**2136-11-13**] 5:09 PM  	Imaging Lab  Brief Hospital Course: 74 year-old man with laryngeal cancer and NSCLC s/p chemo and XRT, history of chronic dysphagia (to solids), and H.pylori infection presents with progressive nausea and resulting decreased PO intake.
#ICU course #1: He was first admitted to the ICU shortly after admission when he looked very sleepy, with tachypnia and labored breathing.
He was evaluated by ENT who placed tracheostomy on the day of the admission with no complications.
CXR post trach showed no complications with larger lung volumes.
During this stay, he complained of persistent dyspnea and CXR showed a new worsening pleural effusion on the right.
CT of the chest on [**10-26**] showed multiple liver mets, T6 collapse, enlarging rt upper pulm nodule, new LLL nodule, equivocal lft pleural based nodule, prominent mediastinal nodes, and moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
Heme/onc was consulted who did not feel chemotherapy or further imaging was indicated.
Diagnostic thoracentesis of rt pleural effusion was considered, but patient could not be properly positioned.
Additionally, radiation oncology was consulted for palliative XRT, but again, patient positioning limited treatment options.
# Metastatic disease: Patient with glottic SCC (T3N0)s/p chemoradiation in [**2134**] and stage IIB NSCLC s/p left upper lobectomy in [**2136-5-13**].
Patient developed persistent dyspnea during hospital stay, and CXR noted bilateral pleural effusions.
CT of the chest on [**10-26**] showed multiple liver mets, T6 collapse, enlarging rt upper pulm nodule, new LLL nodule, equivocal lft pleural based nodule, prominent mediastinal nodes, and moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
Heme/onc was consulted who did not feel chemotherapy or further imaging was indicated.
Diagnostic thoracentesis of rt pleural effusion was considered, but patient could not be properly positioned.
Additionally, radiation oncology was consulted for palliative XRT, but again, patient positioning limited treatment options.
EGD showed stricture in his upper esophageal sphincter, abnormal mucosa in the esophagus, erythema in the stomach, medium hiatal hernia.
He also had heartburn, which was treated as above and with zofran, which would aid in gastric motility given his lack of a LES.
# CDiff: During his hospital course, he began having low grade fevers and diarrhea.
# Dysphagia: He has history of glottic cancer s/p chemo XRT, s/p trach with course complicated by chronic dysphagia with dilation esophageal stricture [**2136-9-16**].
Pt had an EGD approximately one week prior to admission that did not show a significant narrowing and patient had dilation with improvement and even acknowledges this improvement in the dysphagia component of his symptoms.
To ensure that esophageal stricture was not still contributing to his symptoms, he had a video swallow study which was none revealing of contributory pathology.
He was supplemented with nutren given his risk for malnutrition.
However, as his hospital course prolonged, his dysphagia progressed and he failed a second video swallow study on [**10-25**].
#Chronic pain, like post-thoracotomy pain: He was seen by the chronic pain service as well as the pain and palliative care service.
Plain films of right ribs were negative for fracture.
CT scan of thorax to eval progression of pleural effusion noted compression fracture of T6.
Given newly found metastatic disease, may also consider bone scan to r/o mets as outpt.
# Atrial fibrillation: He was noted to have asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**10-11**].
TSH was checked and normal; TTE showed elongated LA but was unchanged from prior TTE.
On [**10-23**], he again developed RVR and attempts to control with IV nodal agents resulted in decreased blood pressure.
#Normocytic Anemia: Pt with poor po may also be component of iron deficiency although normocytic.
He may also have some mild gastric blood loss due to his severe gastritis.
Studies included levated ferritin, ESR, CRP markedly elevated, pointing to anemia of chronic disease.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plt count began trending down from 403 on [**10-21**] to 120 on [**10-30**].
Etiology was thought to be due to platelet clumping seen on smear, although CDiff infection and amiadarone therapy could not be ruled out.
Status: full code  OMED COURSE ([**10-31**] - [**2136-11-15**]): # fevers/PNA: Pt febrile on [**11-11**] with CXR concerning for pneumonia, witnessed aspiration of bilious content.
Zosyn coverage obtained because of risk for aspiration pneumonia and better coverage of anaerobes.
Furthermore, prior pseudomonas cultures were intermediate to cefepime and sensitive to zosyn.
IV zosyn and bactrim discontinued on [**2136-11-15**] due to renal toxicity and worsening thrombocytopenia, levofloxacin started for pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas coverage.
# Dyspnea: A pigtail pleural drain was placed by IR on [**11-12**] for palliation of shortness of breath.
1200 cc of pleural fluid was drained.
# AF with RVR: rate was well controlled eventually on amiodarone 200mg daily.
# Anasarca: Likely secondary to hypoalbuminuria.
However hypotension from [**11-7**] to [**11-15**] made diuresis impossible during these dates.
Albumin administration from [**Date range (1) **] did little to improve anasarca and pulmonary edema.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Mr. [**Known lastname 84573**] developed renal failure on [**11-12**] with progressive worsening over the next 4 days.
Given his hypotension, he was not a candidate for hemodialysis.
Metastatic disease (Glottic SCC and NSCLC; s/p trach): Pt has two underlying malignancies and evidence of likely metastatic disease with liver lesions and spine lesions.
# C diff: Mr. [**Known lastname 84573**] was maintained on PO vanc/IV flagyl with persistent diarrhea.
# Anemia: Given guiac positive bilious secretions and stool, coupled with slow drop in hct, likely slow bleeding from glottic carcinoma.
# Thrombocytopenia: Drop to 90s by date of demise from 600 on admission.
Likely [**2-15**] tumor invasion, but initially could not rule out HIT given heparin use.
On [**11-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 84573**] complained of acute worsening shortness of breath.
The CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, and the HIT antibody was negative.
# Gastritis: Continue PPI and sucrafate, triggered [**2136-11-9**] for emesis of bilious secretions with aspiration.
Guiac positivity is expected given gastritis/SCC.
# Penile lesion: On [**11-12**], a stage 3 penile ulcer was noted.
Likely secondary to anasarca and paraphimosis.
-Colace 100 mg PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
-Senna  8.6 mg :  1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
