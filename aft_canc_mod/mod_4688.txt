Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent placement  History of Present Illness: 57 y/o M with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to liver and lung p/w obstructive jaundice .
He was referred in to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP for evaluation of obstructive jaundice.
Currently he feels lethargic as he has intermittently for the past few days, no nausea or vomiting, no pain anywhere, no constipation or diarrhea, good PO intake normally but decreased PO intake yesterday.
No fevers, chills, rigors or sweats.
No chest pain or SOB, rest of review of systems is negative.
Past Medical History: h/o ETOH abuse and polysubstance abuse history of PE (noted incidentally on a CT, anticoagulated on coumadin) Metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, diagnosed [**10-7**], metastatic to liver and lung  Social History: h/o ETOH abuse and polysubstance abuse (opiates / heroin) denies IVDU, 60pk yr history of smoking  Family History: - Brother with GERD - Denies any FH of cancer or heart disease - Extensive family history of EtOH abuse  Physical Exam: Upon admission: VS: T 98.0  HR 87  BP 75/46  RR 12  O2 sat 97% on RA GEN: NAD, AOX3 HEENT: MM Dry, JVP flat at 30 degrees, sclera icteric CARD: RRR, no m/r/g PULM: CTAB ABD: soft, enlarged firm nodular liver, non tender, non distended EXT: WWP, no c/c/e NEURO: AOx3, able to move all 4 extremities, very soft spoken and at times very mildly confused.
At discharge: GEN: jaundice, cachetic without acute distress HEENT: EOMI, icteric, MMM, no jvd, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout, decreased BS throughout CV: RRR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: distended, typanic, +b/s, nontender EXT: 3+ edema to above knees SKIN: diffuse jaundice.
no rashes no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
A severe diffuse dilation was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct and upper third of the common bile duct with the CBD measuring 18 mm in maximal diameter.
There was also moderate dilation of the intrahepatic ducts as well.
[**2-22**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**2133-10-30**], there is large area of opacification with apparent cavitation in the left mid zone.
An area of patchy opacification at the right and left bases also are seen, raising the possibility of multifocal infection.
There are some patchy areas in the right lung that could also represent foci of infection.
[**2-24**] Chest CT: There are multiple pulmonary arterial filling defects, which appear acute.
These include filling defects to the right middle lobe (2:28), right lower lobe (2:39), right upper lobe (2:27), lingula (2:33), left lower lobe (2:35) and possibly the left upper lobe (2:17).
However, no definite pulmonary infarcts are identified and no evidence for right heart strain is present.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
In the left upper lobe is a thin-walled space, 4.1 x 3.8 cm, containing no fluid or debris, surrounded by a 9 x 6.5 cm region of consolidation.
Additional areas of consolidation or developing abscesses are present in the right middle lobe (2:32) and right lower lobe (2:41, 42).
Mild apical emphysema is present.
Millimeter sized pulmonary nodules described on the prior examination are less evident on this study, probably subsumed in consolidations.
Debris in the right main stem bronchus (2:25), documents aspiration.
Left paratracheal lymph nodes measuring up to 11 mm.
Although, this study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic region.
There is heterogeneous attenuation of the liver, suggestive of diffuse metastatic disease.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions are present.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
The patient has reported history of pulmonary emboli, but no prior imaging available at [**Hospital1 18**] to permit assessment of the progression.
No evidence for heart strain, or pulmonary infarct.
Multifocal consolidation and developing abscesses including a probable pneumatocele in the left upper lobe, are probably due to aspiration.
These findings suggest a multifocal infection, which could bacterial or tuberculous, although no signs of prior tuberculosis are present.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Biliary stent which does appear kinked in its mid section but unchanged from the earlier study.
Marked esophageal thickening at the GE junction with gastroesophageal stent now in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o with metastatic esophogeal adenocarcinoma on pallative chemotherapy presented for jaundice and biliary obstructon for ERCP.
Post operative course complicated by transient hypotension and mental status changes.
#Hypotension: Resistant hypotension with transient AMS after ERCP was concerning for severe sepsis / septic shock.
However, his hypotension quickly resolved and his mental status improved.
#Cavity pulmonary lesion: Pt complains of cough with brown sputum and small hemoptysis for two weeks.
In setting of his lung metastases the differential includes post obstructive abcess vs multilobar pneumonia vs malignancy.
#Coagulopathy: INR elevated to 2.7 likely secondary to nutritional deficiency.
2. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety or nausea: do not take if driving or drinking alcohol.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal Cancer Pulmonary Embolism Cavitary lung lesion secondary to pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were noted to have an abnormality on your CXR thought to be an infection, you will need to complete your course of anitbiotics.
