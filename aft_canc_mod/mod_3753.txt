Culture Data: UCX [**2141-3-7**]: No growth BCX [**2141-3-7**]: No Growth Catheter tip CX [**2141-3-4**]: no growth Peritoneal fluid [**2141-3-1**]: enterococcus, [**Female First Name (un) **] Peritoneal Fluid [**2141-2-3**]: haemophilus (sparse), bacteroides fragilis .
Rectal contrast is seen within the peritoneum around the mucous fistula, tracking up to the open abdominal wound and down to the sigmoid.
8 x 6 cm fluid collection inferior to the greater curvature of the stomach, location is not amenable to percutaneous radiology-guided access.
Moderately distended gallbladder with wall edema.
No gallstones.
In the setting of a known low albumin, these findings are nonspecific, although it is not possible to exclude acalculous cholecystitis.
Echogenic liver lesions consistent with hemangiomas as seen previously on MRI of [**2140-12-28**].
CT Abd/Pel [**2141-2-22**]: Three small fluid collections within the abdomen: a) along the greater curvature of the stomach, b) in the right lower quadrant and c) along the left iliopsoas muscle.
The small size and inaccessible locations makes these unsuitable for percutaneous drainage.
Scattered ill-defined hypodensities in the right and left lobes of the liver (segment II, II/III, V, VI) concerning for parenchymal infection/abscess given time course of appearance.
No areas of drainable fluid are identified within the lesions at this time.
In the setting of low albumin these findings are not specific but remain compatible with acalculous cholecystitis.
Would recommend HIDA scan for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Tunneled line placement [**2141-3-1**]-->removal [**2141-3-4**] Tunneled line placement [**2141-3-6**]     Brief Hospital Course: Severe Crohn disease with chronic obstruction from ileosigmoid fistula with perforation and terminal ileum at the fistula site.
On [**2141-2-2**] Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 70136**] was taken emergently to the operating room for acute onset of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting secondary to his longstanding Crohn's disease.
The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, resection of terminal ileum, end ileostomy and mucous fistula for severe Crohn disease with chronic obstruction from ileosigmoid fistula with perforation and terminal ileum at the fistula site.
However, on the morning of [**2-4**] he  developed increased pressor requirement, much more tense abdomen with a drop in urine output consistent with compartment syndrome.
He then underwent a decompressive laparotomy with an abdominal washout.
He also had bilateral chest tubes placed for effusions so large that there were causing cardiac compromise.
Pt required bilateral chest tubes for bilateral layering pleural effusions, with subsequent improvement.
[**2-6**]: milrinone weaned off, started TPN [**2-7**]: weaning hydrocortisone, no acute vents.
[**2-9**]: L chest tube removed originally placed on [**2-4**] for increasing pleural effsusions bilaterally.
[**2-10**]: Also 8x6cm fluid collection inferior to the greater curvature of the stomach.
And thought due to his previous hemodynamic instability this was likely ATN, supportive measures were deemed most important and dialysis was going to be necessary.D5W was continued at 75cc/h to replace insensible free water losses.
We discontinuefd the flagyl on [**2-23**] but the next day his LFTs rose with alow grade temp prompting another U/S which showed hepatic abscesses flagyl was restarted.
HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.25 mg IV Q3H:PRN pain 16. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for thick secretions.
You have a new ileostomy and it is important that the output is monitored.
It is important that you are monitored for signs and symptoms of dehydration and symptoms of constipation.
