The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
[**2105-9-11**] Chest xray: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
There is significant interval improvement in widespread parenchymal opacities consistent with interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
Still significant abnormalities within the parenchyma are seen, widespread.
The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 17437**] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o M with prostate CA, borderline DM, CKD, who presented with dyspnea likely [**12-23**] pulmonary edema v. PNA, also found to be anemic likely [**12-23**] GI bleed.
#) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially admitted with shortness of breath.
He was intubated on hospital day 2 for increased work of breathing.
He was also treated for possible PNA with Levquin/Ceftriaxone.
Pt likely had cardiac event at home prior to admission, resulting in worsening diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation, leading to pulmonary edema.
Pt was extubated on [**2105-9-10**] without complication and was satting well on NC at the time of transfer out of the MICU.
Pt continued to have mild leukocytosis and a CXR on [**9-15**] showed residual pulmonary edema though improved as well as some concern of bony lesions possibly related to his rostate CA.
On [**9-16**] pt continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint.
#) Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive initially, which improved with diuresis.
No evidence of septic physiology.
He was also started on Amlodipine for afterload reduction.
Likely source was GI bleed, as patient had melanotic, guaiac+ stools initially.
