Admission Date:  [**2196-11-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-11-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-7-21**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome that has transformed to acute myelogenous leukemia, and coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times two with an ejection to [**11-1**] for shortness of breath of unclear etiology.
At that time he refused a lung biopsy after diffuse nodular infiltrates were wound on chest CT and decided to be do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
He was discharged home on home oxygen and was able to get by, but has noted an increased shortness of breath and lower extremity edema times one week.
His Lasix dose was briefly increased, but he did not continue paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and hemoptysis (which is chronic).
He was admitted for workup of his shortness of breath for cardiac versus pulmonary causes.
Despite his reluctance in the past to undergo a workup of pulmonary process, the extent of his symptoms at this time have made him inclined to pursue a diagnostic workup.
Myelodysplastic syndrome with smoldering acute myelogenous leukemia that was diagnosed in [**2196-2-4**].
Diffuse pulmonary disease of unclear etiology diagnosed by chest CT in [**2196-10-6**] with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement.
Coronary artery disease with 2-vessel disease; namely, 50% left main and 100% right coronary artery.
History of gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
History of bladder cancer, status post tumor excision in [**2196-4-5**].
History of increased prostate-specific antigen of 8.7.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His mother developed diabetes in her 80s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed an elderly man who was slightly short of breath at rest.
He was afebrile with a temperature of 97.6, a blood pressure of 122/58, pulse of 67, respiratory rate of 24, satting 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula.
His lungs were clear, and his heart was regular with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base, and a 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex.
He had 2+ pitting edema to his knees.
His skin revealed petechiae along his bilateral lower extremities.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His chest x-ray showed an increased alveolar and interstitial markings bilaterally; especially, in the left middle and left lower lobe, corny background of chronic lung disease with question of alveolar hemorrhage versus multifocal pneumonia versus asymmetric congestive heart failure.
He also had small bilateral pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and diuresed around 4 liters with improvement in his shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
He expressed an interest in further workup of his pulmonary process found during his last admission when he refused workup at that time.
His CT revealed worsening diffuse interstitial an alveolar lung disease with progression in the left upper lobe, periphery of the right apex and right middle lobe, as well as in the anterior and lateral left lower lobe.
His differential diagnosis included infection, vasculitis, bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.
Also noted on the CT was a slight increase in his bulky mediastinal lymph node enlargement and increased size in the bilateral pleural effusions.
The Pulmonary consultation team stated that the lesions seen on CT could be biopsied by bronchoscopy.
However, his echocardiogram revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with PAFP of 50 mmHg to 61 mmHg.
He had no change in his ventricular function.
As his pulmonary hypertension was so severe, transbronchial biopsy would be dangerous as an accidental injury to the pulmonary artery to lead to exsanguination.
GIven the underlying MDS, cardiac disease and progressive infection the patient wanted the emphasis to be on supportive care and going home.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Myelodysplastic syndrome transforming into acute myelogenous leukemia.
