Colonoscopy confirmed a near obstructing lesion of the descending colon at approximately 50 cm.
The patient's past surgical history is noteworthy in that she had undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer as well as a cystectomy and ileal conduit for bladder cancer.

Pertinent Results: [**2122-2-1**] 03:00PM   WBC-3.3* RBC-3.59* HGB-8.9* HCT-28.8* MCV-80* MCH-24.9* MCHC-31.1 RDW-19.0*  GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2122-2-3**] No definite evidence of GI bleeding.
Colonoscopy [**2122-2-4**] Colonic mass @ 50 cm, mucosal biopsy: Adenocarcinoma  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C 1) Multiple, tiny hypoattenuating liver lesions, which likely represent simple cysts.
However, these should be followed on subsequent studies with this patient's history of colon cancer.
No definite metastatic disease.
2) Short segment stricture with wall thickening identified in the mid- descending colon consistent with mass seen on recent colonoscopy.
No other definite masses identified, although small polyps cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.
Known mass within the proximal sigmoid colon as described, with circumferential involvement of the colon, marked luminal narrowing, and suggestion of mild surrounding inflammatory changes and adenopathy, raising the possibility of transserosal tumor spread.
9 mm polyp within the hepatic flexure as described.
She underwent an emergent tagged red cell study after a supposed episode of bright red blood per rectum but which was eventually deemed falsely positive due to her ileal conduit.
She then went to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer hemodynamic monitoring and bowel prep for a colonoscopy.
The colonoscopy was done on [**2122-2-4**] and showed a large fungating mass in the descending colon which was partially obstructing the bowel at 50cm.
Biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma.
CT scan on [**2-5**] demonstrated a short segment stricture with wall thickening identified in the mid-descending colon consistent with mass seen on colonoscopy and without lymphadenopathy.
On POD 1, her temperature was 101.3 but decreased thereafter with encouraged incentive spirometry.
Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of paranoid schizophrenia.
This was the recommendation of the psychiatry service as it was likely that she would tolerate po medications within a week or so of her surgery.
She is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], General Surgery, in [**2-15**] weeks; Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Oncology, given her diagnosis of adenoCA;  and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 365**] in Urology for continued management of her urostomy/ileal conduit.
