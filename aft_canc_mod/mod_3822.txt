He is not adherent to a sodium-restricted diet and is unable to tolerate diuretics due to renal insufficiency.
He has since been on diuretic therapy with spironolactone 50 mg daily plus lasix 40 mg daily, though lasix was discontinued on [**2119-7-28**] due to elevated Cr and concern that it is exacerbating his chronic thrombocytopenia.
Hepatitis C virus.
Chronic kidney disease.
Family History: No known liver disease or cardiac disease.
Neck: Supple, no cervical LAD, mild JVD Heart: RRR, II/VI systolic murmur loudest at L lower sternal border.
No rubs or gallops.
Lungs: Clear except for decreased breath sounds at the bilateral bases.

R. LOWER LEG PUNCH BIOPSY: Increased dermal capillaries with red cell extravasation and extensive (pan-dermal) hemosiderin deposition (see note).
Note:  No leukocytoclastic or lymphocytic vasculitis is seen.
The changes are consistent with chronic stasis, and in the context of the described clinical lesion, suggest acroangiodermatitis of [**Country **].
No concerning liver lesions.
Multiple hepatic hemangiomas and a single segment II liver cyst are unchanged.
Cirrhotic liver, with stigmata of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, ascites, and numerous splenorenal shunts and varices.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Cirrhosis with ascites, splenomegaly, and gastroesophageal varices.
Brief Hospital Course: 45yo male with Down syndrome, hep C with cirrhosis currently undergoing evaluation for transplant who presents volume overloaded with ascites and lower extremity edema.
# Cirrhosis: Patient presented very fluid overloaded with ascites and lower extremity edema.
He was found on recent CT to have indeterminate lesiosn in his liver with elevated AFP and currently undergoing transplant evaluation.
Labs on admission significant for transaminitis, bili of 3, low albumin, thrombocytopenia and elevated INR.
Fluid overload likely secondary to absence of diuretics for several weeks.
Repeat CT showed lesions likely hemangiomas.
Diagnostic paracentesis showed no evidence of SBP.
Renal was consulted for further management and question of possible ultrafiltration (please see below).
He was also started on cipro for SBP ppx.
# LE skin changes and lesions - Pt has chronic venous stasis changes.
Also has large violaceous plaque on RLE.
No fever or leukocytosis.
Derm consulted for violaceous plaque.
Results c/w venous stasis change called acrodermatitis of [**Country **].
Initially he was started on vancomycin for possible cellulitis but this was discontinued as infection was unlikely.
Wound care and dermatology made specific recommendations for dressing changes while in house.
#acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr around 1.3 with recent jump to 2.1 likely in the setting of diuresis and contrast from recent CT.
He had a 24 hour urine collection to calculate GFR and a cystatin C level.
Patient then spiked fever and Cr jumped from 2.2 to 3.7. .
# Fever - Patient spiked fever up to 103.4 with chills.
Also with cough and dyspnea.
CXR concerning for pneumonia.
Peritoneal fluid with no evidence of SBP.
CXR showed LLL pneumonia and worsening pulmonary edema.
He was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, although around the time of transfer, blood/urine/sputum cultures and stool samples and broncheoalveolar lavage grew no pathogen.
On [**2119-9-17**], he was started on CVVH for renal failure, and he became hypotensive requiring norepinephrine gtt.
His medical condition continued to deteriorate and ICU, hepatology, and liver transplant surgery teams agreed his medical derangements were unlikely to be reversed sufficiently to allow him to tolerate liver transplantation, to treat his underlying decompensated cirrhosis.
