[**2169-4-12**] Open tracheostomy.
History of Present Illness: This patient is a 48 year old male with a past medical history of hepatits C and herniated lumbar disc who was found to have biliary obstruction during work-up for right upper quadrant pain with jaundice.
The stricture was biopsied and showed chronic infalmmation with fibrosis.
The patient now presents for hepatic resection with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
Extremeties warm/well-perfused  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital and was taken to the operating room on [**2169-3-3**] for a cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, left hepatic lobectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
The case was complicated by hepatic artery dissection and required repair of right hepatic artery with inferior mesenteric vein interposition and graft.

His pain was controlled with morphine.
Following return to OR for wound dehisence, post-op pain was controlled with morphine.
POD [**9-4**] patient noted to be anxious but responsive with well-controlled pain.
No neurological sequelae from fall.
POD 16/9/1 morphine stopped, dilaudid started for improved pain control.
Cardiovascular: Patient was tachycardic immediately post-op, and was felt to be septic secondary to pancreatitis.
POD 6 beta blockade started for mild hypertension/tachycardia.
POD [**10-6**] sustained tachycardia w/o changes on EKG noted, likely secondary to anxiety and pain.

POD 46/39/31/7 TTE demonstrates no evidence of vegetations in heart.
POD [**11-6**] patient noted to have some respiratory distress though responsive to diuresis.
POD 18/5 noted to be short of breath and diaphoretic shortly before emergent return to OR [**2169-3-18**] for GI bleeding.
Later that day, due to increased work of breathing and fatigue, patient was re-intubated.
Daily chest xrays continued to demonstrate atelectasis with pulmonary edema.
POD 28/21/13 CT guided thoracocentesis performed due to difficulty weaning from vent.
POD 54/47/39/15 patient in septic shock with large right plerual effusion found on CXR.
Patient remains ventilator dependent until death on [**2169-5-6**].
On post-op day #2, ultrasound showed patent hepatic artery and vein.
On examination, found to have intraluminal clot, dilated stomach and proximal small bowel, marked ascited and approx.
500cc old hematoma.
POD [**12-8**], ultrasound noted to show patent hepatic flow.
POD 18/5 taken to OR on [**2169-3-18**] for continued GI bleeding.
On POD 21/14/6, CT scan obtained, showing moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites, patchy areas of nonperfusion involving segments 5, 6 and 8 of the liver, and a patent right portal vein.
POD 25/18/10 CT abdomen failed to demonstrate evidence of intra-abdominal infection.
POD 37/30/22 CT scan obtained which showed unchanged appearance of the hepatic parenchyma with areas of infarction and unchanged size and appearance of three intraperitoneal fluid collections.
POD 42/36/28/3 CT scan performed, showing little change in the appearance of multiple fluid collections and drains.
Cholangiogram performed, which showed existing right biliary internal external drain in place with tip in the jejunum, no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and contrast leak seen at the anastomotic site.
Transaminases noted to be rising as well.
The catheter is exchanged and there is found to be large persistent leak at the anastamotic site.
Patient expires next day due to multi-system organ failure.
ASA/plavix held post-op.
After falling, serial HCT showed drop from 32 to 26.
POD 32/25/17 CT scan demonstrated left inferior epigastric artery pseudoaneurysm, which was injected with thrombin.
CT scan obtained to r/o hemorhage and failed to show evidence of bleed.
POD 40/34/26/1 transfused 1 unit PRBC's for persistent ooze around tracheostomy collar.
TTE obtained, demonstrating mild LVH.
POD 57/50/42/18 in the setting of multi-system organ failure, diffuse bleeding noted.
On post-op day #2, the patient spiked a temperature and was pan-cultured.
Blood culture showed [**2-5**] positive for gram positive cocci.
POD 5, levofloxacin and fluconazole started for coag negative staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] growing from peritoneal fluid.
POD 20/13/5 gram positive rods found in sputum cx.
POD 26/19/12 paracentesis performed, fluid growing lactobacillus.
POD 32/25/17 patient underwent CT guided drainage of a left subdiaphragmatic and left lower quadrant collection.
POD 37/30/22 subdiaphragmatic fluid collection aspirated via CT guidance.
POD 41/34/27/2 ambisome started for disseminated fungal disease.
