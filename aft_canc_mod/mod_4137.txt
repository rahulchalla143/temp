Note:  Nodal architecture is diffusely effaced by a proliferation of large atypical cells with round-to-convoluted nuclear outlines, dispersed chromatin, and one-to-several small nucleoli.
There is prominent apoptotic debris and brisk mitotic activity.
Focal areas of geographic necrosis are seen.
By report, flow cytometry performed at [**Company 2475**] (NY-05-[**Numeric Identifier 62875**]), showed a kappa-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Given the brisk mitoses and reported questionable CD10 positivity by flow cytometry, the differential diagnosis includes a high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus an atypical Burkitt lymphoma.
The block will be requested for additional immunohistochemical and possible FISH studies, and the findings reported in an addendum.
CD3 stain reveals scattered mature T-lymphocytes.
This consternation of immunophenotypic findings supports the diagnosis of a high-grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
And would be atypical for Burkitt's lymphoma (whether morphologically typical or atypical).
-------- Cardiac info:  EKG: 1426 sinus tachycardia at 115bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, low voltage in limb leads, no ST changes, q waves, TWI  ECHO: ([**8-25**]) Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the distal half of the septum, distal third of the anterior and inferior walls, and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD lesion; if no significant CAD, c/w Takasubo's cardiomyopathy).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of the lower half to [**12-24**]'s of the left ventricle .
3.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
5.There is no pericardial effusion.
There is both ascites and a large left sided pleural effusion present.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of 10/605, no change.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient revealed no angiographically significant coronary artery  disease.
The LAD had a myocardial bridge with minor systolic compression.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severe elevation of right and left sided filling pressures with mean RA 19 and mean PCWP of 28 which increased to almost 40 when repeated at the end of the case.
A bedside echo showed anterior and apical akinesis with severely depressed EF of 25%.
No coronary artery disease.
Severely elevated filling pressures and LV dysfunction possibly due to sepsis with acidosis or Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy as echo in cath lab showed apical ballooning.
-------- Imaging: OSH: [**8-19**]: No DVT in bilateral femoral popliteal vv CT [**8-19**]: No PE, +axillary, mediastinal, hilar, external iliac, L inguinal LAD.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR [**8-25**]: atelectasis vs consolidation of lower lobes with bilateral pleural effusions  [**Hospital1 18**]: Abd u/s: IMPRESSION: Patent portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries.
Multiple hepatic cysts and right renal cyst.
Gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid, likely related to the patient's underlying hepatic failure, but correlate clinically.
These could represent pulmonary edema.
Other differentials include aspiration or infection.
Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
No evidence of bowel pathology.
Multiple liver cysts.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Possibly mildly echogenic renal cortices, suggestive of medical renal disease.
CT head: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Left basilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion were noted.
No significant change is noted compared to the prior study done on [**2140-9-2**].
KUB ([**9-2**]): History of renal failure with abdominal distention.
Tip of NG tube is in region of pyloric duodenal junction.
A vascular access catheter overlies the region of the left common iliac vessel.
There is persistent bilateral nephrogram and splenomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 75yo woman with HTN, hypothyroidism, recently admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] for work-up of lymphadenopathy, found to have aggressive diffuse B-cell lymphoma, transferred here for cardiac catheterization for ST elevations on EKG, and found to have clean coronaries but elevated SVR, low cardiac output, anterolateral hypokinesis, and lactic acidosis, concerning for septic and cardiogenic shock.
This seemed consistent with [**Last Name (un) **]-Tsubo syndrome, as she had STE on EKG with clean coronaries, apical ballooning with anterolateral hypokinesis, and a recent stressor.
However, she spiked temperatures, her Swan-Ganz catheter showed lower SVR (500s) with increased cardiac output to 8, less concerning for cardiac etiology and more concerning for sepsis.
She was initially started on antibiotics (zosyn, levo, and vanco), but these were stopped per ID recommendations, as there was no source for infection.
Lactic acidosis - The patient was noted to have significant lactic acidosis that was uncontrolled.
The team became unable to stabilize the pt's acid-base status - attempts to keep pt from acidemia were counteracted by low pCO2.
The underlying etiology was unclear, thought to be secondary to either sepsis (no source identified) or more likely tumor load/lysis.
Renal failure - The patient had steadily increasing creatinine without any clear cause.
Renal ultrasound ruled out a post-renal obstruction.
It was possible that it was secondary to third spacing and therefore prerenal, though would not expect persistent worsening with this etiology.
She was started on dialysis for uncontrollable acidemia, fluid status, and uremia without improvement.
Pulmonary function - The patient had to be intubated for acid-base control.
B cell lymphoma - The patient was diagnosed with aggressive B cell lymphoma by slides and flow cytometry, possibly infiltrating her liver.
She also demonstrated a DIC picture, which may also be associated with lymphoma and/or sepsis, however she did not have signs of significant bleeding.
Liver dysfunction - She had transaminitis on admission, which may have been secondary to sepsis vs. lymphoma infiltration.
Her LFTs peaked, making an acute process more likely.
Hypoglycemia - She was noted to be hypoglycemic in the cath lab, most likely due to liver failure.
She had a HCT, which was negative for acute issues.
It was unclear what her neurologic status would have been if she was able to get better otherwise, but there was concern that she had a significant time when she was hypoglycemic and perhaps ischemic, and that she would not have recovery of her mental status.
