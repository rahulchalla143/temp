He recently completed a course of imipenem for UTI on [**2170-6-16**].
Repeat blood gas continued with combined respiratory/metabolic acidosis with pH 7.04.
He was intubated given acidosis and concern for mental status.
he has been given total of 8L of IVF, imipemen for UTI, vancomycin for respiratory coverage.

There is interval development of patchy increased density at the left lung base.
There is minimal streaky density, consistent with subsegmental atelectasis bilaterally.
The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged and unremarkable for technique.
IMPRESSION:  FOCAL AREA OF INCREASED DENSITY AT THE LEFT LUNG BASE, CONSISTENT WITH PNEUMONIA.
SUBSEGMENTAL ATELECTASIS.
ECHO ([**2170-6-26**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-3-14**], the right ventricle is now dilated, and moderate pulmonary hypertension is now present.
No obvious vegetations; dilated right heart with pulmonary hypertension .
RENAL US ([**2170-6-27**]): Overall, no change in bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, similar in extent to that characterized in [**2170-2-22**].
Echogenic kidneys compatible with known chronic medical renal disease.
Interval increase in left lung parenchymal opacities and left pleural effusion.
Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities.
Interval improvement of left hemithorax density, which can be explained by difference in patient's positioning and redistribution of the fluid.
Left pleural effusion, essentially unchanged from prior exam.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 40 year-old man with a history of C5-quadriplegia following a motorcycle accident at age 17 and a recent episode of ESBL UTI/urosepsis who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension concerning for pneumonia or urosepsis.
# UROSEPSIS/UTI: The patient was admitted to the ICU were he was treated with meropenem, levophed, and IV fluid resuscitation for preseumed septic shock.
Urine culture from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] grew out ESBL Klebsiella consistent with the patient's prior presentation (in [**2170-3-24**]).
He was continued on meropenem for a 9 day course, discontinued on day 9 because of an episode of pancytopenia (WBC 1.6; Hct 22.5; Plt 34), thought to be due to drug toxicity.
Throughout this process, there was concern that the sepsis may also have been due to a pneumonia because the patient was highly congested and demonstrated bilateral opacities on chest radiograph.
The patient has had recurrent UTIs and given his anatomy it is difficult to identify these early.
Symptoms tend to be detected late in his course when he is lethargic as he has a catheter and cannot sense burning or frequency.
He also is hypothermic at baseline with low WBC count due to his MDS.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was intubated given a combined metabolic/respiratory acidosis and concern for mental status changes.
When he was extubated, he complained of congestion and was rhonchorous at his lung bases, bilaterally.
Four days after he was extubated, he had an episode of oxygen desaturation down to the low 80s.
His oxygen requirement (typically 2-3 L during these acute episodes) would resolve after chest PT and active suctioning of his secretions.
Of note, due to his quadriplegia patient is at risk for aspiration.
He also is at risk for pneumonia given his ventilator use and hospital stay.
At the time of discharge we did not feel he had any acute respiratory infection, but it is important to note that he does not mount the typical signs of infection - i.e.
he is hypothermic at baseline with temperature around 94 and his white count is typically low, around [**12-29**].
# ELEVATED LFTs: On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, the patient was noted to have transaminitis (ALT 456, AST 760, LDH 558, AKP 441).
Hepatitis serologies were sent given his history of multiple transfusions and were pending on discharge.
LFTs should be rechecked on [**7-9**] to assess for improvement.
# MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME: Throughout this hospital stay, the patient demonstrated pancytopenia (consistently, WBC below 3, hemoglobin in the range of 8, and platelets in the range of 40s-50s).
He had been diagnosed in the past year with a myelodysplastic syndrome, and these values had been near his baseline.
He did not become neutropenic as his ANC was around 900.
# HYPERNATREMIA: Following extubation, the patient was noted to be hypernatremic to 150 on two occasions, due to lack of free water intake.
# SEIZURES: The patient has a seizure disorder that is controlled by levetiracetam and phenytoin.
# PROPHYLAXIS: Throughout the hospital stay the patient was on prophylaxis, initially with SQ heparin, which was d/c-ed when his platelets further dropped.
# FEN: While in the hospital, the patient was given IV fluids for resuscitation in the ICU.
As mentioned above, he was also given D5 water during episodes of hypernatremia while on the hospital floor.
Guaifenesin 600 mg Tablet Sustained Release Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for cough.
PO 3X/WEEK (MO,WE,FR) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Urosepsis Pneumonia  Secondary: C5 quadriplegia MDS OSA Seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with an infection of your urinary track.
