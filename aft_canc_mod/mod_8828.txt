Also with nausea and GERD for the past week.
She denies and bright red blood from above or below.
She was not having any abdominal pain until about an hour before admission to MICU when she reported LLQ pain for for the past week, but it appears in Atrius records this pain has been going on for at least half a year, see below.

Of note Atrius notes indicate pt has LLQ pain off/on for the past yr and was seen in PCP office in [**3-/2173**] for this.
Notices the pain more while at work (pushing/pulling, standing all day).

syncopal episode in the setting of hematemesis and later with melena.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia, GI bleed: Pt presented with 1wk h/o nausea and GERD, possibly consistent with PUD.
We did not suspect LLQ pain was relevant, given that these symptoms had been present for 6 mos to 1 yr. She received supportive care for GI bleed including PIV x3, Octreotide gtt, IVF's, 2u PRBC's and had EGD the day after admission which showed duodenitis in the proximal duodenum and small ulcer at GE junction.
Of note the pt became oversedated and had an apneic episode at the end of the EGD which was likely due to the Fentanyl/Versed; she received Narcan and Flumazenil, was bag-masked, and did not need to be intubated although a respiratory code had been called.
She had no further respiratory issues thereafter.
She continued to have lowish blood pressures and melena and received further IVF's.
Chest pain: She reported anginal history with occasional chest pain worsened while she was at work, and relieved with rest.
She has not had a stress test in "a long time."
Through her course, her EKG's had normalization of TW's laterally.
