On Wed she went to see her new PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 92442**] [**Name (STitle) 92443**], due to change insurance coverage, who obtained a CXR at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] which showed RML infiltrate and she was started on moxifloxin.
She denies having any fever or chills at the time and her cough seems to be improving on tessalon pearls and guaifenasine-codeine.
Her labs at the time were notable for WBC 8.4/Hgb 16.4/Hct 50.6/ MCV 98.2/ Plats of 257, no diff.
Her D.dimer of 0.8 (normal range of 0-0.49), so she had a CTA earlier in the day which showed no PE but a lung tumor pressing on right bronchial and pulmonary artery (prelim report).
ROS: As per HPI, she denies any fever, chills, no wt loss (wt gain in the last few months), baseline fatigue for the last few months.
Baseline SOB on home O2 at 2L N/c, + non-productive cough which is improving over the last few days with meds.
Decrease in appetite, no abd pain, no n/v, no change in her bowel movements.
No dysuria, no hematuria, no freq.
No muscle pain.
No HA, no dizziness, no visual or hearing changes, no gait disturbance.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY: -[**2169**] She was noted to have a 1.5-2.0 cm area of nodularity in the left breast on examination.
There was LCIS present.
There was no LVI.
This showed invasive ductal cancer, moderately differentiated in several foci around the biopsy cavity.
There was DCIS as well but the margins were negative for both invasive and in-situ cancer.
There was LCIS present.
-[**Date range (1) 92446**] She was treated with tamoxifen -[**Date range (1) 92447**] she completed a 5 year course of aromasin -[**Date range (3) 92448**] She was admitted to the [**Hospital6 **] for bilobar pneumonia and hypoxia.
She had a Chest CT on [**2178-1-9**] which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
There were enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with bronchial cutoff and RML collapse and partial LLL collapse, as well as bilateral adrenal masses and ?left hepatic lobe lesion.
An MRI of the abdomen on [**2178-1-13**] showed bilateral adrenal adenoma and focal fatty infiltration of the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver adjacent to the falciform ligament.
Residual atelectasis or small infiltrates right middle and both lower lobes.
No evidence of pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Enlarged bilateral adrenal lesions.
-[**2178-11-5**] seen by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1356**] and reported having noticed 3 firm masses in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen-one to the left of the umbilicus measured 4 x 3 cm, one in the epigastrium measured 1 x 2 cm and one in the later mid abdominal wall measured 1 x 0.5 cm -[**2178-11-6**] seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 92449**] who biopsied the mass in the epigastrium.
This showed metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Differential dx was either lung or breast cancer by morphology -[**2178-11-13**] CT scan of the head was negative.
Chest CT showed extensive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.
There was compression of the right sided bronchi with atelectasis of the RML.
Abdomen/pelvic CT showed no liver metastases.
Prior CT scans showed a 2.4 cm right adrenal nodule and this was without change.
However the left adrenal nodule is now significantly larger and more heterogenous appearing measuring 3.7 x 2.0 cm suggesting superimposed metastatic disease.
Another nodule is seen lateral to the left acetabulum measuring 1.7 cm, there is a right paramedian nodule posterior to the gluteus maximus measuring 1.8.
There are no bone lesions seen.
No increase in WOB CV: RRR, normal S1/S2, no murmurs ABD: soft, NT/ND, + BS, multiple palpable indurated nodules-largest on umbilicus (~ 4cm in diameter w/ erythema), multiple smaller ones on LLQ SKIN: as noted above with multiple indurated nodules on abd in addition to right shoulder area.
No rashes noted EXT: no edema, no cyanosis, + pulses Neuro: A+Ox3, CN II- XII intact, symmetrical strength on bil UE/LE [**4-3**], intact sensation   Pertinent Results: [**Location (un) 620**] from [**2176-12-4**]: WBC 8.4/Hgb 16.4/Hct 50.6/ MCV 98.2/ Plats of 257, no diff.
Her D.dimer of 0.8 (normal range of 0-0.49)  IMAGING: CXRAY FROM [**Location (un) 620**]: Chest x-ray shows a right hilar mass with a heat a right lower lobe or lateral subsegment of the right middle lobe infiltrate  CTA on [**2178-12-4**]: as per note- no PE, but a lung tumor pressing on right bronchial and pulmonary artery (prelim)  CT of head and Torso on [**2178-11-13**] (as per Atrius report)- Copy of the CD attached to chart, needs to be uploaded in our system).
Chest CT showed extensive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.

BCx X2 [**2178-12-4**] NGTD   Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo female w/ pmh significant for L breast CA-invasive ductal cancer in [**2169**], s/p lumpectomy with chemo followed by taxol and radiation tx, hx of 45 pack years of smoking, COPD, Polycythemia and recent dx of metastatic adenocarcinoma likely stage IV lung Ca who comes in today for hypoxia and increase in SOB.
# Hypoxia/SOB: These symptoms today were in the setting of not using oxygen for 2 hours, otherwise pt states that her cough was improving and she denies having any fevers.
So this is less like to be due to pneumonia, although it is possible that she could develop a post-obstructive pneumonia given her anatomy and tumor burden.
Her OSH CTA was reviewed by the Pulmonary attending and felt more consistent with tumor burden causing lung collapse and compression.
CTA from the OSH, preliminarily, remains negative for pulmonary emboli.
The patient also has baseline COPD which likely worsened her condition today.
She was continued on her home Advair diskus and provided symptomatic relief with tessalon perrles and codeine-guaifenescin PRN.
As the patient was very stable and Heme/Onc did not have any acute recommendations of work-up in-house over the weekend, the patient was discharged home with oxygen.
As the patient responded well symptomatically to low-dose ativan, she was given a prescription for this upon discharge, to help with anxiety and air hunger.
# Metastatic adenocarcinoma: This was found on biopsy of abdominal skin nodule, and is thought to be due to lung cancer.
She has significant smoking history and breast cancer history, although as per Atrius oncologist, the metastasis is unlikely to be due to breast cancer.
The patient also has mets to her left adrenal gland w/ mediastinal/hilar adenopathy, multiple skin nodules and large lung mass.
# Polycythemia: Patient with hx of polycythemia likely related to long term COPD and hypoxia  Medications on Admission: - home oxygen therapy 2liter nasal prongs - Folic Acid 1 mg Oral Tablet take one a day - Cyanocobalamin, Vitamin B-12, (VITAMIN B-12) 1,000 mcg/mL Injection Solution please give 1000 microgram IM x1 - Benzonatate (TESSALON PERLE) 100 mg Oral Capsule take one po tid - Codeine-Guaifenesin (GUAIFENESIN AC) 10-100 mg/5 mL Oral Liquid take one teaspoon every 6 hr prn cough - Fluticasone 50 mcg/Actuation Nasal Spray, Suspension Use 2 sprays in each nostril once daily - Fluticasone-Salmeterol (ADVAIR DISKUS) 100-50 mcg/dose Inhalation Disk with Device Use 1 inhalation twice daily and rinse your mouth thoroughly afterward - Albuterol Sulfate (PROAIR HFA) 90 mcg/Actuation Inhalation HFA  - Aerosol Inhaler Take 1-2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed - Ipratropium-Albuterol (DUONEB) 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Inhalation Solution for Nebulization 3cc via neb [**Hospital1 **] x 2 wks as needed for copd flare - CITRACAL TABLET 950MG PO (CALCIUM CITRATE) as directed   Discharge Medications: 1. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and low oxygen saturations.
We believe this is due to the effects of your lung cancer, rather than from an infection or clot in your lungs.
It is important from now on that you always bring your oxygen with you, even if you are only running errands, in order to help prevent low oxygen levels in the future.
