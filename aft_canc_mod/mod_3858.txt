Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CV: Distant hear sounds, III/VI holosystolic murmur.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, scattered bilateral crackles and expiratory wheezes Abd: protruberant, + ascites and fluid wave, hepatosplenomegaly, erythema around umbilicus.
cool to touch Skin: extensive bruising, irritated skin tag on back  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   WBC-4.7 RBC-4.46* HGB-13.1* HCT-40.5 MCV-91 MCH-29.3 MCHC-32.3 RDW-17.2* [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   PLT COUNT-187 [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   ALT(SGPT)-11 AST(SGOT)-23 LD(LDH)-214 ALK PHOS-225* TOT BILI-0.8 [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   ALBUMIN-3.7 CALCIUM-9.4 PHOSPHATE-4.9* MAGNESIUM-3.1* [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   GLUCOSE-90 UREA N-56* CREAT-2.2* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-5.3* CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-30 ANION GAP-17 [**2197-7-31**] 05:31PM   PT-17.5* PTT-32.9 INR(PT)-1.6*  Admission Echo: Biventricular hypertrophy with echogenic myocardium, restrictive  filling pattern, thickened valvular structures, and a large circumferential pericardial effusion without overt echo signs of tamponade (which may be masked in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy).
Findings consistent with amyloid cardiomyopathy.
Post Pericardial Effusion Drainage: There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-8-1**], a small circumferential pericardial effusion has reaccumulated; no evidence of cardiac tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 89 yo M history of CHF, afib, CAD, HTN, CRI, PAH, CMY (EF 25%), transferred from OSH with large ascites and significant left sided pleural effusion for therapeutic intervention.
CAD - h/o cardiac cath with occluded RCA, unable to recanulize - on ASA, BB and statin, no ACEI [**1-13**] hypotension .
Pump - h/o CHF predominantly right-sided failure secondary to probable cardiac amyloidosis - not biopsy-proven.
EF 40%, Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction with low cardiac output.
Major volume overload, pleural effusion and ascites on admission with pericardical effusion that responded well to pericardiocentesis.
Echo revealed a large pericardial effusion that was also noted in [**1-18**], although appeared larger.
Though no echocardiographic signs of tamponade were seen, it was thought that tamponade could be masked in setting of RV hypertrophy and pulmonary htn.
The pt was taken to cath lab and was found to have hemodynamics midly suggestive of tamponade with cvp 22, PA 67/29, wedge 28, pericardium 14, with mild improvement in CI from 1.42 to 1.48 after resolving tamponade.
Patinet initially on Lasix gtt for peripheral volume overload after the pericardiocentesis with good diuresis and transitioned to PO lasix with continued improvemnet.
ACE was held in setting of hypotension.
Rhythm - irreg, irreg, chronic afib - on BB, ASA - no coumadin [**1-13**] allergy/sensitivity .
Pleural effusion: Thoracentesis was done which revealed a transudate with WBC 615, RBC 1475 though gram stain showed no PMNs, no microorganisms.
Ascites: Patinet with ascites in absence of liver disease, likely due to poor cardiac output.
#.Renal Failure - likely acute on chronic.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) **] Center - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: CHF, pericardial effusions .
Secondary Diagnoses: CHF Right-sided heart failure Cardiac amyloidosis Mild pulmonary hypertension Moderate MR Hyperlipidemia CRI (baseline Cr 2.0) CAD s/p MI and s/p angioplasty in [**2191**] CLL diagnosed [**2169**] glaucoma Undescended testicle Hernia repair   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, stable vital signs, tolerating POs, ambulating with assistance.
