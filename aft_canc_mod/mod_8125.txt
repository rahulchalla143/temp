Admission Date:  [**2171-10-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-3-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Univasc / Celexa / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: brain tumor  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2171-10-16**]: Brain  biopsy Tracheostomy Placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80yo gentleman with h/o low grade brain tumor, transfusion dependent MDS, CAD, and AFib not on coumadin who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in the setting of hemorrhagic stroke at the site of his brain tumor.
On admission, his exam was notable for left sided weakness secondary to recent stroke.
He continued to require pRBCs and platelet transfusions on a daily basis for his MDS.
On [**9-25**], he was sent back to the MICU in setting of recurrent hypoxia and altered mental status.
He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure felt to be due to increased secretions in the setting of persistent MRSA pneumonia.
CT Head was obtained for further evaluation of mental status changes in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
CT revealed interval growth of tumor and new R hemorrhagic lesion.
It was unclear whether the bleed was acute or subacute.
Because of concern for possible C diff as well as persistently positive sputum cultures, the patient was continued on vanc PO, vanc IV, and zosyn.
Past Medical History: Brain tumor: MR c/w low grade glioma; has been followed since [**8-/2169**] without biopsy Hemorrhagic stroke [**8-/2171**] at site of biopsy CAD s/p CABG x 4 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM1, OM2, PDA) [**2168**].

Small area of layering of hyperdense material in the lesion consistent with postoperative blood products.
Mass effect remains similar when compared to prior scan.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The [**Month/Year (2) 8813**] valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but [**Month/Year (2) 8813**] stenosis is not present.
[**10-8**] LENIS: IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis.
Complex, multilocular right frontal intra-axial mass, now demonstrating a cystic hemorrhagic component, inferiorly, corresponding to the recent CT studies, but new in comparison to the most recent cranial MR of [**2171-7-15**].
The enhancing soft tissue nodular and cystic components are not significantly changed in comparison to prior studies, with no new enhancement.
Persistent opacification of the sphenoid sinus and mastoid air cells.
COMMENT: A primary differential diagnostic consideration for this tumor, based on the series of studies, is pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) which may have cystic cavities, hemorrhage and calcifications, and may undergo rhabdoid, teratoid or even anaplastic dedifferentiation.
Less likely would be subependymoma undergoing cystic and hemorrhagic involution or, even more remotely, highly unusual appearance of oligodendroglioma or vascular malformation.
[**10-13**] EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing, a few of these more evident just on the right.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
A bradycardia was noted.
There is no pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication.
Other remarkable findings are prominence of the central pulmonary vascular structures raising the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.
The next previous examination suggested atelectasis - density in the left base cannot be evaluated because of technical _____ of the present study (motion blurring).
No new parenchymal abnormalities in the accessible lung fields.
MICROBIOLOGY DATA [**10-8**] sputum cx: MRSA Blood cx [**10-7**], [**10-8**] No growth Urine cx [**10-8**] no growth C diff negative x 3   Brief Hospital Course: 80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and brain tumor (most likely low grade glioma) transferred intubated to [**Hospital1 18**] in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid overload vs atelectasis c/w findings on CXR.
He was initially treated here with Vanco/Zosyn for infiltrate on CXR and fever with hypoxia which was narrowed to Vancomycin when sputum cultures were positive for MRSA [**10-8**].
# Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Patient with known brain mass with hemorrhage on CT at OSH.
He had stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression, and post-op CT showing no new changes in lesion and no new hemorrhage with prelim finding of low grade glioma.
Pt had witnessed seizure [**10-13**] although EEG c/w global encephalopathy.
No abdominal pain.
#Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; PTH WNL.
Most likely etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as involvement of bone is unlikely.
# Acid Base/Volume status: Pt diuresed and negative 9 liters during LOS with slight bump in creatinine to 1.4 on [**10-20**], stable.
#Hypernatremia: Patient given free water flushes through NGT for hypernatremia, increased to 150ml on [**10-20**].
# MDS/HIT: Pt has h/o thrombocytopenia and anemia.
We attempted to maintain plt>50K [**1-26**] brain mass with hemorrhage and neurosurgical procedure.
He was found to be HIT positive with positive antibodies and serotonin release assay so all heparin products were avoided.
# CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia: Patient had echo which showed LVEF 60%.
# h/o DVT: Patient had LENIS which [**Last Name (un) **] no DVTs in LE BL.
No ASA or Coumadin given brain mass and h/o bleed.
# Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
.# Sacral Wound: Pt has sacral decubitus ulcer.
Wound care was consulted and patient had frequent position changes with Allevyn foam dressing over open tissues.
Also treated with Nystatin for possible fungal component and Zinc x 10 days starting [**10-20**] to promote wound healing.
# Gout: Stable.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Brain tumor, likely low grade glioma, final path pending 3.
Ventilator Associated MRSA Pneumonia 4.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia 5.
CAD s/p CABG 3. h/o DVT 4.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital 794**] Hospital for further evaluation of bleeding around your brain tumor that was seen on a CT scan.
You had a seizure during your hospital course so we started you on an anti-seizure medication called Keppra.
Upon initial transfer, you had low oxygen saturations, fevers and imaging consistent with pneumonia.
Return to the ER or call your primary care doctor if you develop fever >101, new numbness or weakness, change in mental status, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
