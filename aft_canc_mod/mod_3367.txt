Admission Date:  [**2116-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-8-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-3-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Metastatic Melanoma requiring IL-2 therapy Persistent acidemia, AG acidosis & ARF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Central line placement [**2116-8-7**] - Central line placement [**2116-8-8**] - CVVH dialysis beginning [**2116-8-8**]  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 60 yo man with history of metastatic melanoma (primary in foot, known mets in pelvis, liver, lungs who initially presented on [**2116-8-3**] to biologics service for IL-2 therapy.
Of note, hospital course to this point has been complicated by diarrhea, developement of acute renal failure with Cr increased to 2.8 from baseline of 0.9, felt secondary to IL-2 therapy.
During the day, he had been noted to have persistent acidemia (low HCO3) and had been treated with total of 5 amps bicarb throughout the day without much improvement of his HCO3.
At this time, pt c/o SOB, no other complaints.
Other labs drawn at this time as below - notable for worsening ARF (Cr 5.1), AG acidosis.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Melanoma S/p Appy Migraine   Social History: - Married with 3 children - He is a retired truck driver and lives in [**Location 74394**].
- He has an uncle with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and a brother with prostate cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T , HR 190, BP 73/37, RR 36, O2 99% on NRB -> AC/FiO2 1.0/TV 500/RR30/PEEP 5 Gen - awake, alert, able to answer questions, visibly tachypnic with use of abdominal muscles HEENT - scleral icterus Lungs - slight wheezing at bases, otherwise CTA b/l CVS - tachycardic, irregular Abd - soft, use of abdominal muscles with breathing, no noted tenderness to palpation; tympanic in upper region Ext - [**1-14**]+ LE edema b/l Neuro - A+O initially, became more lethargic Skin - cool extremities, flushed appearance to limbs   Pertinent Results: [**2116-8-8**] CXR - prelim read low lung volumes, ?
mild CHF [**2116-8-8**] Rpt CXR - prelim worsening CHF   Brief Hospital Course: This patient is a 60 yo male with h/o metastatic melanoma, who was undergoing IL-2 therapy (s/p 13 out of 14 doses), now with severe multi-organ failure; ?r/t to IL-2 toxicity.
There was a significant acidemia as well as CXR which indicated pulm edema.
Etiology was unlikely to be CHF as the patient had no history of CAD.
Presentation was more consistent with an ARDS picture, given bilateral pulm infiltrates as well as PaO2/FiO2 < 200, or IL-2 therapy adverse event as this can cause a capillary leak syndrome.
Other possibilities of pulm edema include volume overload [**2-14**] renal failure, less likely CHF related to heart disease/MI.
Hypoxia may be secondary to shunt ([**2-14**] likely atelectasis)  as well as likely increased intrathoracic pressures secondary to ascites.
The patient was maintained on CVVH to help with acid/base disorder with pt.
# Atrial Fibrillation: No known history of CAD; the patient had afib on admission to ICU but converted to NSR after shocks x2 & amiodarone IVP x1; o/n, converted back to Afib, requiring cardioversion as well as amiodarone without success.
Amiodarone infusion was not used because of hypotension as well as liver failure.
The patient was hypothermic and hypotensive, requiring 3 vasopressors with SBP still 90's; hypotension was thought to be a side effect of IL-2 therapy, unsure if it was related to IL-2 toxicity.
CT abd unremarkable for lactic acidosis or any ischemic process, however, clinical picture was consistent with shock liver.
It was attempted to wean vasopressors to keep MAP>60, especially levophed given dusky distal extremities.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient had rising Cr during hospital course, intially attributed to IL-2 therapy on the floor.
IL-2 known to cause renal failure, perhaps indirectly due to vasodilation/capillary leak and hypotension.
Creatinine had elevated to ~5, also with multiple electrolyte abnormalities & in the setting of not wean vasopressors to keep MAP > 60.
# Severe Acidemia/AG-Acidosis:  The patient had severe lactic acidosis in the setting of hypotension SBP 60's on arrival to ICU & occasionally overnights, also with triple vasopressor use-vasoconstriction, ?abd compartment syndrome (however CT scan does not support this), shock or ischemic liver were also included in the differential.
Acidemia is a known effect of IL-2 therapy/?toxicity, however unsure if it can account for the extent of acidosis in this patient.
Also the patient had evidence of renal failure.
# Fulminant liver failure: the patient presented with severely elevated transaminases, also with coagulopathy (see below).
Initially, mild transaminatis due to IL-2 therapy ?toxicity of IL-2.
# Coagulopathy: The patient appeared to be DIC based on labs, however difficult to differentiate in the setting of severe liver failure.
3units FFP were transfused with plan to transfuse if platelets < 20 without bleeding or platelets < 50 with bleeding.
# Metastatic Melanoma:Mets to multiple sites; s/p IL-2 therapy.
The patient was maintained on PPI and pneumoboots for prophylaxis (no SC hep b/c plt low).
During the admission a high-dose insulin drip was started up to 23 units/hr for FS up to 600s; however, the patient became hypoglycemic with FS (60s).
There was a concern for hypoglycemia in the setting of liver failure and possibly retained insulin given renal failure.
On [**8-10**] the team was called to the bedside for an acute change in VS: pt became tachycardic briefly before becoming bradycardic and hypotensive and ultimately going into asystole.
CPR was attempted with chest compressions for approximately 25 minutes without a return of pulse; the code was terminated because of persistent asystole with the time of death at 9:25pm on [**8-10**].
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic melanoma - s/p IL-2 therapy SIRS Respiratory failure Liver failure Renal failure DIC Acidemia   Discharge Condition: Expired
