Bilateral basal ganglial calcifications are noted.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells on both sides.
2.4 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm peripherally enhancing lesion, enhancing nodular component posteriorly with moderate vasogenic edema, mass effect on the fourth ventricle and mild obstructive hydrocephalus likely represents a metastatic lesion; less likely possibility of a neoplasm.
MRI HEAD without and with IV contrast per tumor protocol, is necessary for better assessment of the lesion and to exclude any associated lesions.
MRI Head [**9-16**]: FINDINGS: There is a heterogeneously enhancing lesion, with central nonenhancing necrotic areas and peripheral nodular enhancement in the right cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the tentorium, measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm in the AP, transverse and the CC dimensions.
There is moderate vasogenic edema and mass effect on the fourth ventricle, right side of the pons and inferior midbrain along with downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils on the right side.
The edema is seen to extend to the left side of the midline onto the left cerebellar hemisphere as well.
No other lesions are noted.
There is mild-to-moderate obstructive hydrocephalus, with dilatation of the temporal horns and the lateral ventricles.
The extent of dilatation of the ventricles has mildly increased compared to the most recent CT study.
The major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells on both sides.
2.5 x 2.5 x 2.6 cm heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere with moderate-to-marked vasogenic edema, mass effect on the fourth ventricle, right side of the pons and the inferior mid brain, along with extension of the edema to the left side of the midline into the left cerebellar hemisphere and downward displacement of the right cerebellar tonsils.
Mild-to-moderate obstructive hydrocephalus mildly increased compared to the recent CT study.
This likely represents metastatic lesion given the history of rectal cancer, less likely a primary neoplasm.
No other lesions noted.
Imaging of his head showed a t Rt cerebellar mass.
There was a good resection of the tumor with a good follow up MRI showing removal of the tumor.
He will follow up with [**Doctor Last Name 3929**] for f/u radiation treatment.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**7-18**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
