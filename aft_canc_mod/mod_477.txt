# Hypoxemia: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
Initial CTA was negative for PE and cardiac enzymes were negative for ACS.
SHe began to worsen clinically on the floor with development of ground glass opacities on CXR and drop in her sats to 70% on RA.
She had coverage for PNA broadened to vanco, cefepime, and azithro, as well as Bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 13874**] added for her history of coccidiomycosis.
She had a bronchoscopy with BAL performed which was negative for organisms.
She required high doses of sedation, SBP was high 80s-90s, so decided to put in CVL in anticipation of possible need for pressors.
Her BP improved with fluid boluses.
She was also started on Methylprednisolone 60 mg qday for empiriic treatment of gencitabine pneumonitis given the ground glass appearance on CT with lack of other systemic symptoms of infection.
Continued on the ventilator, switching to Precedex for sedation on ICU day #3 as Fentanyl/Versed combination was not adequate.
She was switched to po prednisone and will continue steroids with a taper as an outpatient for the question of gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity.
UOP was tenous with 20-40 cc's an hour in the face of multiple fluid boluses.
