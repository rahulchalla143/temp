Admission Date:  [**2179-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-10-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**] Chief Complaint: Sob  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 88 yo female with known history of CLL and melanoma complicated by pleural effusions was recently at rehab for six weeks and was discharged home 1 week ago.
She now presents with increasing SOB over the past week.
of note pt has history of chylous pleural effusion in the past.
Pt denies fevers but admits to yellow productive cough.
No chest pain, orthopnea or PND.
CXR revealed large increasd L effusion, increasing R effusion, spiculated unchanged opacity LUL.
labs revealed WBC of 14 and Lactate 1.1. cardiac enzymes were negative and ekg revealed no acute ischemic changes or right heart heart strain.
pt was pancultured and started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for community acquired, nosocomial and atypical pneumonia.
Past Medical History: ONC PMHx: 88 yo female with Hx of CLL, melanoma and bilateral pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology.
The patient had been initially evaluated at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**9-/2176**] for left inguinal adenopathy, which was biopsied showing melanoma with unknown primary.
At that time, a peripheral blood smear was also consistent with CLL.
Since that time, she has been followed by serial PET CT scans for her known CLL and pulmonary nodules.
She has not received any treatment for CLL and was not felt to be an appropriate candidate for adjuvant therapy for melanoma.
Her most recent PET/CT on 4/41/09 showed moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion as well as an interval increase in  size and FDG avidity of the left upper lobe nodules.
The fluid re accumulated and she had underwent RT VATS, thoracic duct ligation and talc pleurodesis on [**6-23**].
Her postop course was complicated by a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
She was seen as an outpatient on [**7-19**] complaining  of increasing weakness and shortness of breath.
A CT on [**7-19**] showed moderate bilateral dependent pleural effusions and multiple loculated collections of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax.
H. pylori infection in [**2172**].
She has no known asbestos exposure.
Family History: Mother has history of lung cancer and she was a nonsmoker, her maternal aunt who was a smoker, had a history of lung cancer.
Her sister also had a history of lung cancer and there is family history of second-degree relatives with history of melanoma.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 96.6 BP: 117/57 HR: 75/min RR: 16/min 02 sat 94% on 4L: GENERAL: NAD SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, MMM, good dentition, nontender supple neck, no LAD, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: bilateral reduced air entry in bases worse on left and inspiratory crackles bilaterally.
ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly Extremities: moving all extremities well, bilateral pitting edema to knee likely of venous insufficiency and is chronic.
PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: a&o x 3, CN II-XII intact stage 3 sacral pressure ulcer is present.
Slight interval increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
Interstitial opacity within the right lung, particularly within the right lung base is worrisome for lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Persistent dense consolidation within the retrocardiac region which could represent atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
Unchanged spiculated opacity within the left upper lobe, which on the prior CT was worrisome for malignancy.
No pulmonary embolism.
Increasing moderate left pleural effusion.
Increased extent and distribution of lymphangitic carcinomatosis on the right, as well as increasing mass lesions in both upper lobes.
New small focus of peribronchovascular consolidation in the right upper lobe (21, 2), concerning for an early focus of infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Unchanged conglomerate central and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Pleural fluid [**2179-10-1**]: Rare highly atypical epithelioid cells in a background of mesothelial cells and many lymphocytes, suspicious for  metastatic melanoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 88 yo woman with history of CLL and metastatic melanoma, bilateral pleural effusions and possible lyphangtic spread of malignancy transferred from ICU s/p thoracentesis and brief BiPAP course with improvement in respiratory status, now doing well on baseline O2 status at 3LNC.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure/somnolence - resolving with improvement in ventilation on most recent ABG.
Respiratory failure thought to be combination of HAP, possible worsening lymphangitic spread of cancer in lung, and baseline COPD.
However, patient remained with weak cardiopulmonary fx as would desat to mid 80s on 3LNC.
# Bacteremia: micrococcus not usually a pathogen.
Patient afebrile with no symptoms of systemic infection.
# Bilateral pleural effusions - Pleural fluid exudative, cytology suspicious for metastatic melanoma, not diagnostic.
# Leukocytosis/CLL - chronically elevated WBC likely [**3-1**] CLL.
No fevers or other signs of active infection.
# Melanoma - being managed symptomatically.
Not felt to be candidate for adjuvant therapy.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - recent diagnosis, has been in sinus rhythm since initial episode of afib.
# Hypothyroidism - s/p thyroidectomy for goiter.
No active issues.
# H/o tobacco Abuse - no prior diagnosis of COPD although it appears that she does have baseline CO2 retention, probably with PCO2 in the 60's.
No prior PFT's.
No exam findings to suggest acute COPD exacerbation.
Alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times  a day) as needed for anxiety.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Metastatic melanoma  Secondary: Healthcare associated pneumonia Malignant pleural effusion   Discharge Condition: Stable vitals, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.
It was believed that your shortness of breath was related to a combination of a healthcare associated pnuemonia and fluid building up around the pleural space surrounding your lungs.
During your stay, you developed respiratory failure and were transferred to the ICU where they assisted your breathing and tapped 1.5 liters of fluid from the pleural space surrounding the lungs.
The fluid in your lungs showed cells suspicious for metastatic melanoma, however, this is not diagnostic of certain metastatic disease.
There was some concern about your respiratory status during activity and this was the reason to discharge you to an acute rehabilitation facility.
We have made some changes to your medications: START taking Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB Inhaler every 6 hours START taking Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB Inhaler every 6 hours  DECREASE Diltiazem from 60mg by mouth four times a day to 45mg by mouth four times a day  If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or high fevers, please come to the emergency department.
