The patient was diagnosed w/ SCC in [**11-22**] at NWH, when he presented w/ SVC syndrome.
CT chest revealed large R lung mass which is 6cm in maximal dimension & paratracheal/RUL/RML in location.
(CT chest also showed R main pulm artery narrowed by mass and R pleural effusion).
The pt underwent bronchoscopy [**2162-12-1**], lesions in right and left lobe biopsied & established dx of SCC.
He subsequently developed worsening SOB & on [**2163-1-4**] was admitted to ICU at NWH w/ post-obstructive PNA (sputum grew MRSA & Acinetobacter Baumannii, which was tx'd w/ tigecycline & doxycycline).
He also had a bronchscopy, which showed significant airway edema above the vocal cords & complete obstruction of R bronchial tree due to edema & extrinsic compression.
In the setting of steroids, he was noted to have elevated Bld glucose & was started on Lantus & ISS.
Echo done showed EF >65% w/ mild concentric LVH.
Bilateral LENIs (done b/c of edema) were negative for thrombus as was RUE u/s.
During rehab stay at [**Name (NI) **], pt noted increasing swelling of b/l arms, neck, face, & LEs.
(Of note, he has been on 02 via NC over the last month--likely b/c of CA, underlying COPD & pl effusion.
There were repotedly no signs of acute bleeding.
He has reportedly had periods of hypernatremia (as high as 152 per notes).
It appears that he has had persistent sinus tachycardia, possibly [**1-17**] decreased cardiac filling from SVC syndrome.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] wards, pt is w/o complaints.
He gets SOB w/ ambulating a few feet.
Past Medical History: -SCC dx'd [**11-22**], c/b SVC syndrome.
NC   Physical Exam: VS: 98.2, 128, 138/80, 94% on 3L GEN: sitting up in bed, appears older than stated age, appears sl uncomfortable, though pt states that he is comfortable.
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP moist and without lesion NECK: swollen appearing b/l, JVP elevated above jaw, no masses felt CV: Distant hrt sounds.
EXT: [**1-18**]+ dependent edema in UEs (R>L), 1+ dependent edema in LEs.
Reported stage II pressure ulcer on buttock.
Rare atypical epithelioid cells in a background of   lymphocytes and macrophages; cannot exclude involvement by   carcinoma.
CXR [**1-30**]:  Compared to the film from earlier the same day, there is some new hazy opacity at the right heart border that could represent small area of infiltrate, volume loss.
Otherwise, there is no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo man w/ SVC syndrome due to malignant compression of SVC and continued respiratory distress.
# Respiratory distress: Pt stable while at rest, with considerable SOB with movement.
Flex bronch on [**1-28**] demonstrated considerable airway obstruction with no possibility for endobronchial stent placement, as well as a posterior wall defect in the right bronchus intermedius.
He was evaluated by IR for possible SVC stent placement as a palliative measure for his respiratory distress, however given his respiratory distress and inability to lie flat, a stent was not attempted.
# Neutropenic fever/hospital-acquired PNA: Pt developed fever to 104 with sBPs in 70s and HR 150s.
He was given 2L bolus of NS, Tylenol, Vanc & Cefepime for neutropenic fever.
He was then noted to develop worsening tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement.
Pt was transferred to ICU, where CXR ([**1-30**]) revealed some new hazy opacity at the right heart border that could represent small area of infiltrate, volume loss.
Pt was presumed to have post-obstructive pneumonia process for which he was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
His neutropenia resoloved shortly after recieving neupogen and he was not neutropenic at discharge.
Pt treated with filgrastim, which resulted in a bump in WBC to 15.1 on [**2-2**].
# SVC syndrome: Due to SCC mass encasing SVC.
Edema worsening s/p chemo and radiation treatments, for which these have been held.
SVC stent placement was considered, but after discussion with the patient, his wife and IR, it was felt that the risks of anesthesia would outweigh the potential benefits of the procedure.
The head of his bed was kept elevated, and lasix was given, if blood pressure permitted, to minimize fluid retention.
# Sinus tachycardia: Ongoing issue--noted on hospitalization at NWH in [**Month (only) 404**] as well as at rehab.
Morphine 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 1-5 mg Injection Q3-4H () as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-small cell lung cancer Superior vena cava syndrome Pneumomediastinum secondary to bronchus wall defect Resolved febrile neutropenia Acute on chronic renal failure Bacterial pneumonia, probable post-obstructive Anemia of chronic disease  Discharge Condition: Critical, transitioning to hospice care.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for complications pertaining to your squamous cell lung cancer, including SVC syndrome and pneumonia.
The SVC syndrome is the cause of the edema in your arms and neck.
Also, you developed a fever while in the hospital which is presumably due to pneumonia.
