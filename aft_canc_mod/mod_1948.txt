At time of discharge on [**1-24**], he had a rising WBC at 12.5. .
This gentleman has significant comorbidities including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased serum cholesterol, coronary artery disease status post prior myocardial infarction and severe peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity revascularizations.
He has no new pulmonary symptoms.
A preoperative evaluation showed no critical coronary disease and preserved ventricular function.
A renal ultrasound was done and showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Prior to coming up, the patient had respiratory compromise requiring Bipap thought secondary to acute pulmonary edema.
Past Medical History: - ESRD s/p living unrelated renal transplant (from wife) in [**9-/2105**] on multiple immunosuppressants -Adenocarcinoma of lung (T1N0M0) s/p VATs w/ wedge resection & lymph node biopsy on [**2112-1-20**] - CAD s/p myocardial infarction - Severe peripheral vascular disease s/p bilateral lower extremity revascularizations (and recent revision).
Pt is wheelchair bound b/c of this.
- 90 pack-year smoking history quit in [**2083**] - Diabetes x 25 years on home insulin - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - Severe osteoarthritis effecting the hips, shoulders, knees - Spinal stenosis which causes back pain   Social History: Smoked cigarettes until [**2083**].
No alcohol ingestion.
No history of coronary disease  Physical Exam: VS - Tm 100 Tc BP: 150/44 (137-172/42-86) HR: 75 (72-88) RR 21 O2sat 96% on 3L FSBS - 162, 188, 226, 168, 125 General: obese man, pleasant, comfortable, sitting up in chair HEENT: PERLLA, EOMI, anicteric, no scleral icterus, MMM, OP clear, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid Lungs: CTAB Heart: RR, Nml S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly Extremities: 2+ b/l LE edema, pressure dressing in place around calves.
Imaging: [**2112-2-1**] - Ultrasound of renal transplant.
INDICATION: Difficulty voiding.
FINDINGS: The transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant is visualized and measures 11.6 cm in maximum length.
No evidence of any perinephric collections.
IMPRESSION: Transplant kidney in left lower quadrant relatively unremarkable with significant post-micturition residual volume of 334 mL.
[**2112-1-27**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-15**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 72yo man with multiple medical problems including renal transplant, DM, severe PVD, CAD, recent dx of lung CA who p/w DKA & klebsiella.
#Klebsiella Urosepsis: on admission, pt found to have pan-sensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (2/4 bottles).
The trigger for his DKA was thought to be his infection along with his non-compliance with insulin during the days prior to admission.
# ARF: Pt had acute renal failure on admission that was thought to be due to pre-renal etiology in setting of DKA.
There was no evidence of pyelonephritis, nor hydronephrosis.
# Renal Transplant: Pt is s/p living unrelated transplant from his wife in 10/[**2104**].
# Urinary retention: Pt has a history of BPH.
During his recent admission, he had marked difficulty voiding after having foley removed.
Alpha agonists were started with minimal improvement.
Pt then underwent renal US which showed no evidence of obstruction/hydronephrosis; though it did reveal high post-void residual (334cc).
# CHF: Following administration of fluids on admission, the pt developed worsening LE edema.
# Lung CA: Pt recently diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung on [**2112-1-20**].
# LE wounds: Pt has multiple superficial wounds on his LE.
The pt was diuresed to minimize edema and promote healing.
# CAD: S/P angioplasty with stents in [**2103**].
MI in [**2104**].
Pt likely had mild demand ischemia w/ troponin leak in the setting of DKA.
Lasix 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QPM as needed for worsening leg swelling.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a urinary tract infection that spread to your blood.
You are having urinary retention, which needs to be further evaluated and treated by a urologist.
You will be taking NPH at home along with a humalog sliding scale and keep track of your blood sugar levels.
Please contact your doctor or call 911 if you experience fever, chills, rash, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning change in your condition.
You should have your Sirolimus level checked along with a CBC (your platelet count has been elevated and should be followed up).
Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 825**] office (urology) to make the nearest available appointment for urinary retention.
