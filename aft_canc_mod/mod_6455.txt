Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2137-8-29**]: FINDINGS: There is a right frontal lobe area of edema identified with a 2.5 x 2 cm mass and enhancing mass.
There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with minimum midline shift.
No hydrocephalus seen.
There are small foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity seen including at the medial left temporal lobe visualized on series 6, image 12.
No distinct enhancement is seen in this region, but as suggested above, the evaluation is limited.
There is additionally subtle increased signal seen within the brainstem nature of which could not be determined.
There is a focus of increased signal in the left inferior cerebellum which demonstrates subtle enhancement on T1 axial images and could not be confirmed on MP-RAGE images due to motion.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study by motion.
A 2.5 x 2 cm enhancing mass is seen in the right frontal lobe with surrounding edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
A second enhancing lesion is suspected in the inferior left cerebellum and a signal abnormality is seen at the left medial temporal lobe, but this could not be confirmed due to motion on the images.
CT Torso [**2137-8-30**]:  CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with the largest nodal conglomerate in the subcarinal station measuring approximately 3.0 x 2.8 cm, with a mass effect on the bronchial tree and possibly esophagus.
Smaller precarinal lymph nodes measure up to 13 mm in the short axis diameter.
There is no pathologic hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Small left hilar lymph node measures up to 7 mm in short axis diameter.
There is no pathologic axillary lymphadenopathy.
The thyroid gland enhances homogeneously.
There is no concerning pulmonary mass.
There is trace atelectasis at the bases bilaterally.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are bilateral enhancing adrenal masses, measuring 2.9 x 1.6 cm on the right and 2.8 x 2.0 cm on the left, consistent with metastatic masses.
There is no focal hepatic lesion and no biliary ductal dilatation.
There is an area of focal fatty infiltration adjacent to the falciform ligament.
There is mild nonspecific perinephric stranding.
Atherosclerotic calcifications in both aorta, which is normal in size.
The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable, there is no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
There is no free air, no free fluid, and no pathologic retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.
There is no free pelvic fluid and no pathological inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
In the common femoral vein on the left, there is an apparent filling defect (series 3, image 118), which is in the setting of malignancy, concerning for thrombus.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a 13 x 7 mm lucent lesion in the L1 vertebral body.
There is no vertebral body height loss, there is no pathologic fracture.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral adrenal masses.
A small lucent lesion in L1 vertebral body is indeterminate, however, suspicious for metastasis as well.
No definite primary malignancy identified.
Question of a filling defect in the left common femoral vein, worrisome for DVT.
Recommend further evaluation with vascular ultrasound.
Pathology from right frontal lobe tumor [**2137-9-2**]: Metastatic carcinoma  CT Head [**2137-9-2**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval right frontal craniotomy and resection of the dominant right frontal mass.
There is expected pneumocephalus within and overlying the right frontal lobe.
Right frontal lobe edema of the white matter is similar to slightly improved in comparison to the preoperative study, with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
The smaller right frontal and the left posteromedial temporal lesions described on MRI of the brain [**9-2**] are not appreciated on this non- contrast CT.
Linear high density within the surgical cavity may be small foci of blood or related to postoperative change.
There is no hydrocephalus or intraventricular blood.
Marked atherosclerotic calcifications in the cavernous carotid and distal vertebral arteries are noted.
Soft tissue swelling and subcutaneous gas overlies the craniotomy site.
Expected postoperative changes with resection of the dominant right frontal lobe mass.
Right frontal lobe edema with 5 mm leftward shift of midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, similar to slightly improved in comparison to the preoperative CT of [**8-29**], [**2137**].
No evidence of pelvic deep venous thrombosis.
Atherosclerosis with high-grade stenosis of the proximal left common iliac artery and moderate stenoses of the proximal right common iliac and right common femoral arteries.
Moderate urinary bladder distension suggests bladder outlet obstruction related to prostatic enlargement.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks and started on dexamethasone for the cerebral edema caused by the mass.
He went to the OR for mass resection on [**2137-9-2**].
The procedure went well without complications and a steroid taper to 2 [**Hospital1 **] was started.
The patient had an MRV of the pelvis to assess for DVT on [**9-5**].
There was no DVT but there was atherosclerosis and stenosis of the left common iliac, right common iliac, and right common femoral arteries.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: [**2-8**] Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office in [**8-16**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
