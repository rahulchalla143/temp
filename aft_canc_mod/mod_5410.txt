Severe left and moderate right hydronephrosis with bilateral hydroureter, left greater than right.
Multiple dilated loops of small bowel without a definite transition point and air/stool throughout the [**Date Range 499**] that could relate to an early or low-grade small-bowel obstruction, possibly secondary to adhesions.
There are no secondary signs of ischemia.
Small pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm should be followed up with a chest CT in 12 months if the patient is a nonsmoker and has no risk of malignancy.
Small hepatic hypodensity is too small to characterize, but is statistically a simple cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old woman with a past medical history of thyroid and metastatic [**Known lastname 499**] cancer currently undergoing current chemotherapy with FOLFIRI who presented with bilateral hydronephrosis and pyleonephritis, requiring brief MICU stay for septic shock.
# Septic Shock secondary to Pyelonephritis.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] previously had pyelonephritis secondary to pan-sensitive E. coli in early [**Month (only) 1096**] and was treated with 10 days of augmentin.
Following initial therapy, she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with 2 days of bilateral flank pain and chills.
E coli grew only from left nephrostomy tube during this admission, not right, though no definite stones seen on final read of CT abdomen/pelvis.
Positive UA on admission, hydronephrosis, fevers, leukocytosis and borderline hypotension to SBPs 100s-110s.
Ms. [**Known lastname 48642**] hypotension did not respond to 3L IV NS, and was transferred to the MICU where she was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin for [**Known lastname **] pressure support.
# Bilateral hydronephrosis: Likely secondary to obstructing adhesions from prior surgery.
There was question of non-obstructive stones seen on CT in left renal pelvis, but final report shows no definite stones.
# Metastatic [**Date Range **] cancer s/p resection Currently undergoing chemotherapy with FOLFIRI.
# Paroxysmal Afib: Coumadin held on admission prior to percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, then restarted at lower dose in setting of antibiotics.
TSH on admission was 0.29, which is difficult to interpret in acute illness but should be rechecked as outpatient to ensure proper suppression.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital because you were having flank pain and chills, which turned out to be from a very severe kidney infection.
You were also found to have obstruction in the ureters, which run from your kidneys to your bladder.
Your [**Known lastname **] pressures became very low after the procedure, so you were transfered to the intensive care unit, where you required medications to support your [**Known lastname **] pressure for 1-2 days, after which the antibiotics kicked in, and you improved.
