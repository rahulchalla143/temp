Admission Date:  [**2104-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-9-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2037-8-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital 11212**] [**Hospital6 733**] Firm  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral lower extremity rash and pain and cough.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old white male with an extensive past medical history including metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with metastases to the skull, status post radiation therapy times 18, and metastases to right iliac crest.
The patient was initially diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer after banging his head in [**2104-5-7**].
The incident led to a hematoma which was drained and found to have metastatic non-small cells which were later to be found from a lung primary.
Shortly after chemotherapy, the patient developed bilateral lower extremity pain and an erythematous rash.
There was some relief with Tylenol.
The rash is isolated to shins and ankles and is unchanged in size and distribution over the last few days prior to admission.
However, the patient notes an increase in the erythema of the rash.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems the patient also complains of a productive cough with yellow sputum times several weeks.
He has a history of significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with multiple flares and is currently on a number of inhalers at home.
He endorses increased fatigue and general malaise since chemotherapy was initiated.
During the first four days of hospitalization, the patient developed progressive azotemia, urinary retention, and hypotension with systolic blood pressures reaching the middle 70s.
The patient was also noted to have a deterioration of mental status over this time period.
His Intensive Care Unit course was unremarkable, and his hypotension and urinary retention resolved with intravenous fluid administration.
Rheumatic heart disease; status post aortic valve replacement.
Congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2102**] showing an ejection fraction of 20% to 30%.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Ablation for atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placed in [**2098**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Low back pain; status post L4-L5 laminectomy.
Bilateral cataracts.
Degenerative joint disease; status post cartilage tear.
History of melanoma diagnosed in the [**2062**].
Ventral hernia times two.
Bilateral hearing deficit.
Cervical spine radiculopathy.
History of carpal tunnel syndrome.
History of rectal fissures.
On physical examination the patient was in mild discomfort, in no apparent respiratory distress.
His scalp was notable for frontal prominence with cavitation.
His heart was regular in rate with occasional periods of irregularity with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
His abdomen was soft and nontender, with a large ventral hernia and two well-healed surgical scars.
He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses, and 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral left extremities.
His bilateral shins were notable for an erythematous maculopapular rash with shiny skin.
There were scattered petechiae in the area.
He had a scar on his left chest from prior melanoma excision which was atrophic with telangiectasia and a pigmented border.
PERTINENT STUDIES DURING THIS ADMISSION:  Bilaterally lower extremity Doppler studies revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
A chest x-ray on [**2104-9-12**] (on admission) showed increased opacity in the region of the right hilum consistent with known right lung mass.
Focal consolidation in the region could not be excluded.
A CT of the chest on [**2104-9-16**] showed interval enlargement of obstruction in the right lower lobe lung mass with a collapse of superior segment as well as interval increase in bulk in right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Low attenuation fossae in the liver which could represent metastatic disease.
A CT of the cervical spine, and lumbar spine, and thoracic spine on [**2104-9-17**] was without evidence of metastatic involvement of the spinal canal or stenosis.
Plain films of the bilateral left extremities showed no evidence of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 67-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2104-5-7**] with metastases to skull and possibly the liver; status post aortic valve replacement secondary to rheumatic heart disease, on Coumadin, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and a history of gastrointestinal bleed presenting with cough times two weeks as well as lower extremity rash and pain following chemotherapy treatment on [**2104-9-2**].
PULMONARY:  The patient with newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung carcinoma in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year with metastases to the skull, right iliac, and possibly to the liver.
Although the patient complained of a frequent cough, he had no respiratory distress on admission.
He was started on [**Month (only) **] for possible postobstructive pneumonia.
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2104-9-19**] which demonstrated complete obstruction of the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
No bronchial washings were performed.
Although the patient was admitted with oxygen saturations of 98% on room air, he developed a oxygen requirement which began just prior to Intensive Care Unit admission.
The exact etiology for his increased oxygen requirement was not known; however, it was thought to be related either to interval obstruction by lung cancer or decompensation from heart failure.
LOWER EXTREMITY RASH:  The patient's main complaint on presentation was a painful, erythematous, petechial rash in the bilateral shins; status post chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin approximately one to two weeks prior to admission.
Dermatology was consulted and felt that the rash was likely drug-related with underlying stasis-related changes.
Although the rash had scattered petechiae, there were no ecchymosis or purpura.
After resolution of rash, chronic venous stasis changes persisted.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with a low-grade fever on admission and was started on [**Year (4 digits) **].
With evidence of postobstructive pneumonia by chest x-ray and CT scan, additional antibiotics including clindamycin, Flagyl, and vancomycin were used intermittently.
The patient spiked through antibiotics, and it was thought that part of his fever was cancer-related.
No significant culture abnormalities were found with negative blood culture, sputum culture (which was contaminated), and a negative urine culture.
Although first in the setting of hypotension and acute renal failure, it was thought that altered mental status was secondary to metabolic etiologies.
Throughout his Intensive Care Unit admission, however, altered mental status persisted despite resolution of hypotension and acute renal failure.
A Neurology consultation was obtained secondary to altered mental status, as well as new onset urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.
A CT scan of the cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine was obtained and was found to have no evidence metastatic involvement or spinal stenosis.
A unifying diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis was proposed; however, they diagnosis could not be fully assessed, as a magnetic resonance imaging could not be performed secondary to hardware from pacemaker in aortic valve.
A lumbar puncture was attempted on [**2104-9-17**]; however, the patient refused, and due to the patient's body habitus, history of lumbar surgery, and increased INR, another attempt was not considered.
During his Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had an episode of agitation coinciding with the administration of Fentanyl which was relieved with Risperdal.
It was thought that metabolic factors were contributing in part, as well as the possibility of carcinomatous meningitis, as well as a viral etiology.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  During his hospitalization, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 25% to 35% with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
He has a history of congestive heart failure as well as atrial fibrillation, and aortic valve replacement status post rheumatic heart disease.
A contributing factor for his hypotension necessitating Intensive Care Unit stay was most likely congestive heart failure.
An adrenal insufficiency workup was started secondary to the hypotension and was found to be negative with a random cortisol level of 18.
RENAL:  A few days after admission, the patient developed progressive azotemia and urinary retention.
The patient's hypotension led to acute tubular necrosis which developed into acute renal failure with a creatinine reaching a high of 2.
With intravenous fluid resuscitation, the patient's creatinine trended back to baseline and was 0.9 at the time of discharge; reconfirming that the patient's acute renal failure was secondary to prerenal causes.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was guaiac-negative during his hospitalization, but has a history of rectal fissures as well as a slow gastrointestinal bleed though related to chemotherapy.
The patient was additionally thrombocytopenic on admission with platelets around 60,000 with unknown etiology, but suspected to be related to chemotherapeutic agents.
The patient was anticoagulated with Coumadin secondary to aortic valve replacement.
Encephalopathy; possibly carcinomatous meningitis.
Non-small-cell lung carcinoma obstructing the right lower lobe.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Acute renal failure; acute tubular necrosis.
