HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was emergently started on DHAP chemotherapy which he tolerated well; although, he did have significant tumor lysis, LDH peaked at 9 to 10 thousand, phosphate was elevated and uric acid was controlled with allopurinol.
On [**2131-7-6**] and [**2131-7-7**], the patient had increasing O2 requirement and on the afternoon of  [**2131-7-7**] at approximately 4 p.m., he acutely desaturated and had decreased blood pressure in the setting of Lasix; in addition to spiking a temperature to 102 and he was transferred to the Sennard ICU for further care.
