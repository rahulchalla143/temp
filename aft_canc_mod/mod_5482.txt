Pt has large back wound, which he has never actually seen, but has noticed over past 1-2mo draining fluid.
Pt states that he fell backwards ten feet into the foundation of a home in [**9-15**] and developed a wound in the back.
Since his fall, he has been packing the wound w/ a cut out square of a T shirt, paper towels, and Neosporin.
He has noticed pus dripping from the wound for the last month.
Given the complexity of the wound and exposure of spinous processes, he was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Currently, the patient denies pain (although visibly in distress when laying back in bed), and denies f/c/n/v/dizziness.
On ROS, the patient denies parasthesias/weakness in his extremities, no changes in bowel or bladder function.
He admits to a 20lb weight loss over 1 year but attributes this to new retirement.
Family History:  mom - cancer of unclear etiology  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.5; BP 81/39; P 82; RR 18; 98% RA General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple, no carotid bruit Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no m/r/g Carotids: no blood flow murmur Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Skin: ulcerating skin wound from ~ C7-T6 eroded through paraspinal muscles and exposes necrotic spinous processes.
Standard position of the right internal jugular line with no evidence of complications.
New large left lower lobe consolidation might be accompanied by pleural effusion.
Questionable left upper lobe nodule.
[**2135-6-16**]: TTE: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Multiple lung nodules, which may represent metastases or infection.
Open wound in left upper back and over the thoracic spine.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right and left loculated.
No suspicious sclerotic lesions seen in the bones.
[**2135-6-17**]: CT Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
[**2135-6-17**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2854**] - FINDINGS: There are extensive signal intensity abnormalities of all of the visualized vertebral bodies.
This finding is most strongly suggestive of diffuse metastatic disease.
There is no definite evidence of rupture of tumor through the cortex.
However, as noted below, there are areas where it is difficult to distinguish tumor from the infection.
There is a large defect in the skin and musculature posterior to the spine.
The superior extent of this defect appears to be located at approximately T1.
Throughout these levels, there also appears to be abnormal enhancement of the vertebral bodies themselves.
The spinous processes and lamina at T2 through T4 appear markedly hypointense on the MR images suggesting sclerosis due to chronic osteomyelitis.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left than right.
A right lung nodule is identified in the limited views of the lung included in this study.
There is a protrusion of the T7-8 intervertebral disc with indentation on the spinal cord.
The findings described above suggest both infectious and neoplastic pathology with the diffuse vertebral body signal intensity abnormalities, and the right lung nodule, characteristic of metastatic disease.
There may well be an intraspinal epidural abscess or phlegmon.
No drainable fluid collection is noted within the spinal canal.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggesting both metastatic disease and chronic infection with intraspinal enhancement most suspicious for epidural abscess or phlegmon.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
T7-8 disc protrusion.
Epidural abnormality which could represent phlegmon or early abscess, from the T3 through T5 level.
Foci of increased signal on the T1 post-gadolinium sequence at the T3-T4 level within the thecal sac which could represent enhancing nerve roots, vessels, or artifact.
Erosion of the spinous processes of T2 through T8 with extensive posterior soft tissue phlegmon and inflammation.
No cervical or lumbar epidural abnormalities, and no cervical or lumbar cord signal abnormalities.
Bilateral pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules, which are better assessed on the recent CT of the torso.
Multifocal signal changes within vertebral bodies in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine are most suggestive of multifocal osseous metastatic disease.
Metastatic carcinoma with squamous features (see Note).
Acute osteomyelitis with necrosis.
[**2135-6-20**]: EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Left atrial abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2135-6-21**]: Pleural Fluid Cytology:  Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2135-6-19**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).

Brief Hospital Course: 61yo M estranged from medical care for >35yr who presents w/ extensive back wound, pentrating to spinous processes, and smaller L back/axillary wound.
# Sepsis: When the patient was initially admitted, he was hypotensive with the obvious source being the large infected back wound with associated chronic vertebral osteomyelitis and possible epidural abscess.
Workup of his hypotension was unrevealing for adrenal insufficiency or cardiogenic source (EF>80%).
Likewise, TTE showed no gross evidence of endocarditis.
# Back wounds: wound culture grew MSSA and pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Plastic surgery and neurosurgery took the patient to the OR together on [**2135-6-20**] for initial debridement and was thereafter followed by plastic surgery who took him back to the OR on [**6-27**] for flap closure.
It was taken down on [**2135-7-2**], and because the flap didn't take, he needed to be taken back to the OR on [**7-6**] for a wound wash-out and another vac dressing.
# Osteomyelitis: because the wound had exposed vertebral processes (by definition osteomyelitis), ID recommended several weeks of IV antibiotics.
# Question of malignancy: MRI revealed extensive vertebral body changes throughout the thoracic spine that were suggestive of malignancy/metastatic disease.
Pan-CT scan notable for multiple lung nodules as well as left sided pleural effusion.
This effusion was tapped by Interventional Pulmonary, which showed predominant lymphocytosis with cytology negative for evidence of malignancy.
Hematology/oncology was consulted who felt that the prognosis was likely poor with an estimated lifespan of 8 months; they offered the patient palliative chemotherapy (which would not be able to be initiated until the ulcers healed) and the patient has initially refused but will arrange follow up in New [**Location (un) **] if patient is amenable.
# ARF: On presentation, the patient had a slight bump in his creatinine, thought to be prerenal azotemia versus contrast nephropathy versus ATN secondary to either medication or hypovolemic insult during sepsis and then again with second hypotensive episode following incomplete fluid resuscitation in the PACU following his second surgery.
Urine electrolytes indicated a FENa of 2.2, which indicates a more likely intrinsic mechanism for renal failure, such as ATN.
# However, despite multiple attempts by PT to encourage exercise and OOB activity, he has become deconditioned and at this point will need PT services at home.
Metastasis and osteomyelitis of thoracic spine.
Malignant back ulcer with superinfection - MSSA, Pseudomonas   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a large back ulcer that involved the bones of your spine.
Additionally, on imaging it was noted that you had evidence of malignancy in the bones of your spine.
A sample of bone was taken for analysis during surgery, which came back as non-small cell lung cancer metastasized to the bone.
