MRI of sella would be helpful for further evaluation.
Sellar mass with suprasellar extension and potential mass effect upon the optic chiasm.
Diagnostic possibilities include macroadenoma, with or without hemorrhage, and less likely a Rathke's cleft cyst.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Cards ECHO([**9-16**]) IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic function.
Mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mechanical mitral valve prosthesis with borderline-high gradients.
Normally-functioning tricuspid annuloplasty ring.
Mild pulmonary hypetension.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Subsegmental atelectasis left lung base.
Head CT [**9-21**]: NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: 1) No short-interval change in hyperattenuating, round primarily intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension, remodeling the dorsum sellae; dDx includes macroadenoma, perhaps with hemorrhage, as well as intrasellar craniopharyngioma or Rathke cyst.
2) Possibly low-lying cerebellar tonsils (unrelated), which should be clarified at time of MRI.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Posteroperative chcanges of trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary mass, with decreased volume of mass within the sella turcica.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted on [**9-15**] via ED with complaint of Nausea and vomiting for three days.
Head ct was performed and a pituitary mass identified.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
*Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
Please be sure to follow up with your PCP in the next couple days for blood drawing to ensure an appropriate blood level ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
