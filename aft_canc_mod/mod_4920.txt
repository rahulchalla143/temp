Past Medical History: SDH, bilateral wrist fractures Trach/PEG for AMS Parietal Lobe infarct incidentally found on MRI [**1-/2128**] Pineal schwannoma, s/p radiation - [**2104**] S/p VP shunt placement - [**2104**] Angioplasty [**2111**] TIA [**2125**], [**2126**] Seizure disorder   Social History: From [**Country 11150**], staying with family here.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, trach site c/d/i but draining purulent, foul smelling and thick secretions (foul smell persists but drainage resolved on discharge) Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, though persistent rhonchi at right bases for length of stay CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, PEG in place draining purulent, foul smelling secretions with palpable fluctuance around site GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Spontaneously moves right UE and Right [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] family not track past midline on left with eyes.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild mitral regurgitation is now seen and suggestive of papillary muscle dysfunction.
CT chest: New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities within the lower lobes bilaterally, with more confluent areas of consolidation in the lower lobes, new from the prior study.
Allowing for differences in head position, overall stable appearance to right extra-axial fluid collection, compatible with an evolving subdural hematoma.
Stable atrophy and periventricular chronic white matter changes.
EEG: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG in the sleeping states due to significant voltage assymetry and a mildly slow and disorganized background.
The mildly slow and disorganized background is suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
There were no epileptiform features on this study.
On the right, alignment is unchanged compared with [**2128-1-19**], with equivocal minimal callus formation.
On the left, the current exam shows mild ulnar positive variance, which is new and could reflect some interval impaction along the fracture site.
There is probably increased vertical lucency along the medial and lateral aspects of the distal radius, suggesting interval dispersion of the fracture fragments.
Argon plasma coagulation.
The posterior oropharynx was anesthetized using lidocaine 1% spray, as well as both nostrils using lidocaine 1% spray and lidocaine 1% being given through the tracheostomy tube for local anesthesia.
Upon entering the airway, there was a  significant amount of blood, but no immediate source of active bleeding was identified.
We evaluated the right bronchial tree where all segments of the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe appeared patent with no endobronchial lesions and no active bleeding, but there was amount of blood pooling, especially in the lower lobe that was suctioned with success with no further blood seen.
We then evaluated the left bronchial tree which again revealed patent segments in the left upper lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe with no endobronchial lesions or active bleeding seen and again we saw pooling of blood, especially in the lower lobe segments that was suctioned with success with no further active bleeding seen.
We then removed the flexible bronchoscope through the tracheostomy tube and advanced it through the right nostril all the way down into the airway where we first encountered severe supraglottic edema.
Then we were able to advance a flexible bronchoscope through the vocal cords where we saw significant degree of granulation tissue that was non- obstructing at that time, but causing significant narrowing of the tracheal lumen superior to where the tracheostomy tube stoma is.
The tracheostomy tube, at that point, was removed through the skin and full inspection of the area underneath was performed which did not reveal any active bleeding and the stoma itself appeared patent.
There was no more active bleeding at that time that was seen.
We then performed a bronchoalveolar lavage and the right lower lobe and then removed the flexible bronchoscope and the procedure completed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate complications.
Based on the appearance, as well as the patient's history, this is most likely consistent with suctioned trauma.
Successful coagulation and cauterization achieved with the use of argon plasma coagulation.
PLAN:  We would recommend that the patient be started on proton pump inhibitor for supraglottic edema.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Doctor First Name 494**]     Brief Hospital Course: # AMS: Highest on ddx is infection ??????
Also consider biliary source with rising transaminitis which was checked on prior admission [**1-16**] but not followed - was in 50's, now in 200's.
During MICU course, LFTs remained stable but lower suspicion for biliary source.
Patient also had thick secretions day of discharge from trach but now no e/o PNA on imaging and cx from secretions was oral flora/contaminated.
His hyponatremia appearrs to be chronic, like [**1-13**] SIADH in the setting of old pineal meningioma and radiation.
MRI obtained at last hospitalization with e/o small strokes but neurology didn't feel that they were the cause of his AMS.
Patient was initially covered broadly with Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo for pulmonary source - given concern for lowering seizure threshold with Aztreonam, patient was switched to Vancomycin/Cefepime for healthcare associated pnuemonia and possible meningitis coverage (given Neisseria meningitides in sputum).
# Fever: 102.8 rectally, no hypotension, sating well on 50% FiO2.
Likely [**1-13**] PNA given thick secretions, rhonchi on exam and CXR with ill-defined retrocardiac opactiy unchanged from CXR seen day prior to discharge.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or biliary dilitation.
His breathe sounds remained rhonchorous at the right base.
# Hemoptysis: Patient noted to have hemoptysis on arrival to the floor.
Tuberculosis was considered briefly however after bronchoscopy an obvious source for bleeding was found, and tuberculosis came off the differential.
Was in 50's on [**1-16**], in 200's on admission this time, no elevation in bili.
Viral hepatitis serologies were negative.
Could be [**1-13**] pulmonary process given retrocardiac opacity.
Was trending up prior to discharge, with leukocytosis but no labs checked the 2 days prior to d/c so more difficult to assess.
Likely [**1-13**] acute illness.
Likely [**1-13**] NSTEMI on last admission vs rate ralated.
Pravastatin (and other statins) were held in the MICU given elevated LFTs.
# Bilateral Wrist Fracture: Sustained in fall.
It was felt that patient's fractures were stable and they will follow.
# Seizure d/o: Was persisently subtherapeutic on dilantin while here, level corrects to 4.2 based on albumin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: [**Hospital **] Hospital acquired Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: unable to assess mental status Level of Consciousness:Lethargic but arousable Activity Status:Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: You were-admitted to the hospital with altered mental status, after an extended stay in the ICU, where you were treated for both meningitis and pneumonia you were transferred to the floor.
While on the floor you coughed up some blood from a small wound in your wind pipe which was cauterized under bronchoscopy.
