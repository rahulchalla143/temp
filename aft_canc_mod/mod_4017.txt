TECHNIQUE: Supine and upright abdominal radiographs.
No comparison.
Note is made of unremarkable bowel gas pattern with few air-fluid levels, without evidence of significant dilatation or obstruction.
No evidence of ascites is seen on this radiograph.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST  Reason: please eval pulmonary embolism with CTA, but please also inc Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with esophageal cancer, pleural effusions, worsening hypoxia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval pulmonary embolism with CTA, but please also include cuts to eval for worsening lung injury from chronic aspirations vs pneumonia, also eval size of pleural effusions CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Hypoxia, history of esophageal cancer.
CT OF THE CHEST: Bilateral hilar as well as mediastinal adenopathy is seen.
The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.
There is a dilated esophagus with a stent extending to the gastroesophageal junction.
The pulmonary arteries do not demonstrate any central or segmental filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are identified of simple fluid attenuation, which were not present on the [**1-25**] study.
There has been new development of extensive ground glass and consolidative opacities involving the majority of the upper lobes bilaterally, as well as the lingula, right middle lobe, and lower lobes to a lesser extent.
In the visualized abdomen again seen are multiple low-attenuation masses within the liver, which appear to be increased in size and extent since the prior study of [**1-25**].
The osseous structures demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Bilateral ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving multiple lobes, but most notably the upper lobes.
These findings are most consistent with aspiration pneumonia, though there may be an element of superimposed pulmonary edema.
Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions have also developed in the interim.
Dilated esophagus with a stent extending to the gastroesophageal junction.
Multiple liver hypodensities consistent with metastatic disease.
No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: Esophageal stent in lower esophagus and GE junction.
PREVIOUS BIOPSIES:  [**2141-8-25**]   [**-4/3463**]   MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE   REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2437**]  DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial lavage:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with   adenocarcinoma   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 55 yo male with metastatic esophagel cancer, recent ARF [**1-18**] dehydration who was transferred to ICU for increased oxygen demand, Lactic Acidosis, and Elevated WBC Count: .
Despite this measures, patient continue to be febrile, with elevated lactic acidosis and high WBC.
Fevers and elevated WBC: Initially treated as a pulmonary source.
Last blood cultured showed Gram positive cocci.
Elevated Lactate.
Persistent elevated lactate despite adequated CVP and Mix venous saturations.
Acute renal failure: thought to be secondary to prerenal azotemia in setting of sepsis.
The clinical situation was explained to the family worsening ARDS, severe dead space ventilation, worsening leukocytosis and fevers, associated with metastatic esophageal cancer gave him very low possibilities of recovery.
