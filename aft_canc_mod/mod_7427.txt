Admission Date:  [**2158-9-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-7-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64725**] Chief Complaint: leaking fluid  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: stat classical cesarean section  History of Present Illness: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 40 y/o G1P0 at 24+6 weeks gestation with [**Last Name (un) **] [**2158-12-16**].
Pt reports vaginal leaking of clear fluid that began at 0700 this AM and again several times.
Pt reports occasional contractions, and is noted to have a large lower uterine segment fibroid (10 x 9 x 9 on [**5-29**]).
She denies any vaginal bleeding.
Active fetal movement.
She had no signs or symptoms of infection or chorioamnionitis.
An [**Doctor Last Name 13675**] consult (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was obtained and ultrasound revealed EFW 931g, vtx, AFI 13.6, and large uterine fibroids obstructing the lower uterine segment.
She was started on a course of antibiotics for latency, as well as betamethasone for fetal lung maturity (complete on [**2158-9-3**]).
She was counseling about the possible indications for delivery, including any signs or symptoms of chorioamnionitis, non-reassuring fetal testing, and was aware that she would need a cesarean section (likely a classical) due to her large fibroids in the lower uterine segment.
Mrs [**Known lastname **] was on bedrest and had extensive monitoring with three times daily fetal heartrate tracings, twice weekly BPPs, and a growth scan on [**2158-9-22**] which showed an EFW of 1182g(51%).
Her fetal tracings would tyypically have moderate variability with small accelerations and an occasional quick variable.
She had no associated abdominal pain, tenderness, foul smelling discharge, or contractions.
She was placed on the monitor and had a baseline of 120 with minimal variability with a deceleration to the 80-90s for approximately 2 minutes.
Upon arrival, there was difficulty obtaining a continuous tracing and a bedside ultrasound revealed a fetal heartrate in the 60's.
She had an EBL of 3000cc and she received 7L of crystalloid, 4U PRBCs, and 2U FFP, therefore there was concern for fluid overload and airway edema.
The infant grew gram negative rods which eventually was identified as E. coli (pan-sensitive to antibiotics).
She was discharged on post-operative day 7, tolerating PO diet, passing flatus, and ambulating and urinating without problems.
