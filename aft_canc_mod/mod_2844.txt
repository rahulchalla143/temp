Admission Date: [**2190-7-4**]        Discharge Date: [**2190-7-13**] Date of Birth:  [**2134-1-24**]        Sex:  M  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 56-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome which has progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia complicated by pancytopenia, absolute neutropenia, and chronic infection involving his lungs (presumptively fungal).
The patient denied any other acute complaints.
In the Emergency Department, he was noted to be tachycardic and febrile to 102.
Acute myelogenous leukemia diagnosed in [**2189-8-21**]; status post induction with 7+3 which was completed on [**2189-10-21**] with overall poor response complicated by chronic fungal pneumonitis - question Aspergillosis.
Negative bronchoalveolar lavage in [**2190-1-21**] and in [**2190-1-21**] for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and neuro fungi.
[**2190-1-21**] - right palate lesion consistent with chloramine pathology.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of partial small bowel obstruction.
Coronary artery disease.
History of diabetes insipidus; status post lithium.
Chronic hyponatremia felt to be secondary to lithium.
First heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the bases.
No rales or rhonchi.
Right Port-A-Cath with granulation tissue and foul smelling.
RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray revealed no focal pneumonia, persistent right-sided effusion.
A computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed no pulmonary emboli, right pleural effusion, multiple nodular densities throughout parenchyma.
ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA:  The patient's treatment has    been limited by persistent infection involving old line    infections and pulmonary issues.
The patient had been on    Synercid two weeks prior to admission for persistent line    infection and a known history of vancomycin-resistant    enterococcus.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was notable for an increased level of blasts in circulation.
The patient was persistently febrile and was treated broadly for his known pulmonary infection as well as other possible sources.
He did not have any evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or tumor lysis during this hospitalization.
HISTORY OF VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCUS STATUS POST    LINE REMOVAL:  The patient has a history of old line site    infection with granulation tissue.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from    Surgery evaluated the site and felt that the line site was    not infected, and most likely his fevers were attributed    to his known pulmonary infection.
The patient had a bronchoscopy without any    evidence of a fungal or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or    bacterial pneumonia.
A repeat chest computer tomography revealed slightly worsening bilateral infiltrates, pulmonary edema, and stable left-sided pleural effusion.
The patient did not have an oxygen requirement during his hospitalization, and his breathing was stable.
He had a nonproductive cough.
TYPE 2 DIABETES:  The patient was maintained on twice per    day fingerstick glucose checks and a regular insulin    sliding scale.
The thought was that    imipenem would give no Cardia coverage.
However, despite    broad coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative rods as    well as fungal organisms with both caspofungin and    voriconazole, the patient remained febrile.
HYPONATREMIA:  There was no evidence of hyponatremia    during his hospital course.
MYOPATHY:  The patient developed right hip flexor weakness    on [**7-10**].
A magnetic resonance imaging of his    lumbosacral spine revealed a L4-L5 disc herniation as well    as a right inferior ramus fracture.
It was unclear    whether or not this was a new or old fracture.
There was no evidence of cord compression on his magnetic resonance imaging.
The patient denied any hip pain or pelvic pain, and overall right hip flexor strength was [**3-26**].
