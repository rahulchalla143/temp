-Small right and trace left pleural effusions.
-Unchanged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Cholangiogram was performed on [**2187-3-1**] showing a persistent bile leak from the free edge of the residual liver (as previously), and small amount of contrast seen tracking along the insertion tract of the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**] tube.
Due to poor nutritional status and decreased calorie counts the patient had a PICC line placed and started TPN.
The initial PICC line had to be removed due to swelling in the arm with the finding by ultrasound of Thrombus within the right basilic vein with no flow detected and nonocclusive thrombus seen in the right IJ.
There is no evidence of leak of contrast outside of the bile duct.
There is no intraluminal opacification of jejunum.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] [**Location (un) 19843**] demonstrates extravasation out of the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] [**Location (un) 19843**] into a perihepatic collection along the inferolateral liver edge.
There is no intraluminal opacification of bowel.
There was no post-obstructive dilation.
In addition on the same day he underwent paracentesis by Ultrasound-guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, with drainage of 1 liter of clear dark yellow fluid.
Chest xray was done on [**3-11**] showing increased opacity at the right lung base.
[**Month (only) 116**] be due to a combination of right lower lobe atelectasis, pleural effusion, or subpulmonic fluid.
Increased amount of air in subdiaphragmatic perihepatic air-fluid collection when compared to the prior examination.
New small-to- moderate degree of pneumoperitoneum.
If there has been no history of recent manipulation to account for these findings, anastamotic dehiscence cannot be excluded.
Stable small right loculated pleural effusion.
Stable spiculated left upper lobe nodules.
He spiked a fever on the evening of [**3-16**] and was taken back to the OR on [**3-17**] with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, drainage of intra-abdominal abscess.
Postoperative diagnosis was Retroperitoneal sepsis.
The small bowel and colon were reported  as plastered to the anterior abdominal wall.
The liver was then pulled off the anterior abdominal wall and the large retroperitoneal space seen on CT scan filled with air and pus was found.
ID was consulted, who recommended the initiation of Gentamycin and the discontinuation of Cefepime due to resistance.
Patient had been maintained nutritionally on TPN, and on [**3-26**] an attempt was made to pass a nasoduodenal tube for enteral feeding.
Cultures taken from the drains on [**3-27**] continued to grow Enterobacter and yeast-non-albicans.
Decreased amount of air in the subdiaphragmatic perihepatic air-fluid collection when compared to the prior examination.
Marked decrease in intraperitoneal free air.
Unchanged amount of ascites as well as mild mesenteric stranding and mesenteric lymph nodes consistent with given history of peritonitis.
Small right loculated pleural effusion.
On the morning of [**2187-3-29**], the patient was noted to have increased crackles throughout all lung fields.
The chest xray was read as Extensive bibasilar atelectasis with possible additional small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of fluid overload.
The patient was having tachypnea, labored breathing and O2 sats were difficult to maintain and he was placed on a non-rebreather and transferred to the Trauma ICU (bed availability) He was intubated immediately after arrival to the ICU, a BAL was performed and an additional chest xray suggested aspiration or pneumonia.
