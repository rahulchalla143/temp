She reports that she was in the hospital in [**2196-2-4**] for shortness of breath thought related to a COPD and CHF exacerbation.
Her hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and guiac positive stool.
Then over the last 24-48 hours, she has had increasing shortness of breath.
Review of systems is also notable for wheezing.
She has chronic lower extremity swelling, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and dyspnea on exertion, which has been relatively unchanged.
Review of systems is also notable for the following: - history of DVT in the past and coumadin was discontinued early due to melena.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Diffuse ST-T wave changes.
No diagnostic interim change.
Findings consistent with volume overload.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Bibasilar atelectasis; underlying infection cannot be excluded.
[**2196-4-26**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], there may be mild improvement in pulmonary vascular status, though some of this may be related to the differences in technique.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists as does a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
Small angioectasia without bleeding was identified in the proximal ascending colon Successful [**Hospital1 **]-Cap treatment was applied to the small angioectasia identified in the proximal ascending colon Multiple diverticula with medium openings were seen in the descending colon and sigmoid colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Small grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted  Recommendations: Clear liquids when alert, awake, and at baseline Follow for response/complications Please call should severe abdominal pain or rectal bleeding occur Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2799**]) in 10 days to obtain biopsy results Surveillance colonoscopy in 6 month's time after Golytely preparation to reassess post-EMR site in the proximal descending colon Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**] as needed  [**2196-5-2**] EGD:  Normal mucosa in the esophagus Erythema, congestion and nodularity in the antrum and stomach body compatible with mild gastritis (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy) Recommendations: Clear liquids when alert, awake, and at baseline Follow for response/complications Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2799**]) in 10 days to obtain biopsy results Continue current medications Procede with colonoscopy today Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**] as needed     Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Acute on chronic diastolic HF: This, in addition to atrial fibrillation and COPD (addressed below), likely contributed to her dyspnea.
Her oxygen requirement slowly improved and she was weaned down to her home O2 requirement of 3L.
Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: She was initially on a diltiazem drip for rate control, then transitioned to diltiazem PO and metoprolol PO.
She was started on a full dose aspirin and heparin drip with plan to bridge to warfarin, although she had recurrence of GI bleeding, which is discussed below so heparin gtt was stopped and aspirin was continued.
At discharge, she was on aspirin for anticoagulation only, with no coumadin as she has a high risk of rebleeding.
She had wheezing on initial exam which subsequently improved so was not initially managed as COPD exacerbation.
She then complained of productive cough and increased wheezing so was treated with a steroid taper, and 5 day course of azithromycin.
Her hypotensive episodes were the reason behind not starting an ACE-I during this hospital stay.
Anemia/Recurrent GIB: Patient was tried on a heparin drip for her atrial fib, and had guaiac positive stools and a downtrending hematocrit.
GI was consulted and performed EGD/colonoscopy, which showed polyp and AVM in colon that were intervened upon, and mild gastritis in stomach.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) ML Inhalation q4h () as needed for wheezing.
COPD Exacerbation 2.
Atrial Fibrillation 3.
Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure 4.
Morbid Obesity 5.
Anemia 6.
GI Bleeding 7.
Urinary Tract Infection   Discharge Condition: You are walking with a walker, eating, and breathing on your home oxygen requirement of 3L.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
This was related to a COPD exacerbation, heart failure, and an abnormal heart rhythm.
For treatment of your heart failure, you were diuresed aggressively with lasix to remove a lot of excess fluid.
You also went into an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, which you have had before.
Atrial fibrillation comes with a risk of stroke, but you have not been able to take blood thinners due to bleeding in your GI tract.
You had a EGD and a colonoscopy performed which demonstrated a polyp in your colon as well as a prominent artery both of which were treated during the colonoscopy.
You also had inflammation in your stomach.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, dizziness, passing out, increased swelling in your legs or arms, weakness, slurred speech, headache, fevers, shaking chills, night sweats, or diarrhea.
