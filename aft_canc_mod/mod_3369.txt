Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2125-7-8**] 01:00AM   PLT COUNT-230 [**2125-7-8**] 01:00AM   NEUTS-76.7* LYMPHS-19.4 MONOS-2.9 EOS-0.7 BASOS-0.2 [**2125-7-8**] 01:00AM   WBC-7.6 RBC-3.30* HGB-12.4* HCT-36.4* MCV-110* MCH-37.5* MCHC-34.0 RDW-13.2 [**2125-7-8**] 01:00AM   GLUCOSE-122* UREA N-17 CREAT-1.2 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-17  DISCHARGE LABS: COMPLETE BLOOD    WBC RBC   Hgb  Hct   MCV  MCH   MCHC RDW   Plt Ct [**2125-7-26**] 10:14  6.4 2.64* 9.0* 26.6* 101* 34.1* 33.9 19.2* 281   BASIC COAGULATION (PT, PTT, INR) [**2125-7-26**] 10:14   12.1 23.3   1.0  MRI Head [**7-8**] Large heterogeneous, hemorrhagic right parietal mass, without evidence of associated edema.
This appearance is compatible with an embryonal testicular carcinoma metastasis, though the absence of surrounding edema is unusual.
Other diagnostic considerations in a HIV-positive patient include lymphoma, particularly given the periventricular location, but the absence of associated edema is also atypical for lymphoma.
CT head [**7-8**] Right parietal parenchymal lesion abutting the lateral ventricle, with probable surrounding edema (versus cystic components).
While this is concerning for a mass, infection is also possible, given the patient's immunocompromised status.
Large right frontal epidural hematoma and subdural hematoma with concern for active bleeding.
Transtentorial as well as subfalcine herniation with shift of normally midline structures measuring approximately 1.7 cm.
Edema within the right frontal and parietal lobe is also noted.
Post-surgical changes including pneumocephalus and right parietal craniotomy.
No new hemorrhage  [**7-9**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Post-surgical changes consistent with hematoma evacuation, including partial craniectomy and extensive pneumocephalus.
Interval decrease in midline shift towards the left, now measuring 9 mm.
Interval development of focal intraparenchymal small hemorrhages in the right frontal, parietal, and right cerebral convexity.
Slight increase in right frontal pneumocephalus.
Focal parenchymal hemorrhages in the right frontal and parietal lobes, overall similar in appearance, with no significant new hemorrhage.
Hypodense areas in the right frontal and parietal lobes are more conspicuous than on prior study and more extensive in location than the prior mass.
Another hypodense area on the anterior right frontal lobe is more defined.
This may represent edema, ischemia, infarct or tumor infiltration.
Recommend MRI and follwo up(if not contra-indicated) for better assessment of these hypodense areas.
There is craniectomy with multiple hypodensities in the right cerebral hemisphere unchanged from previous study with foci of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
Extensive predominantly cortical infarcts are seen in the frontoparietal and occipital lobes.
Given somewhat atypical vascular distribution, the infarcts could be venous rather than arterial in origin.
Collection in right anterolateral aspect of the anterior cranial fossa is now fluid-filled with minimal residual pneumocephalus.
Overall stable appearance of the brain status post right parietal mass resection and epidural and subdural hematoma evacuation with stable 4-mm left shift, without new focus of hemorrhage.
Small anterior surgical bed collection with a trace pneumocephalus is unchanged.
Paranasal sinus disease.
No other intracranial changes or findings   Brief Hospital Course: [**7-8**] Pt is a 33m with previous history of testicular cancer s/p orchiectomy and chemotherapy.
Pt has complained of 2 weeks of headaches that have become progressively worse over the last 3 days.
CT of the head upon admission showed a right parietal mass with surronding vasogenic edema.
There was minimal midline shift and no hydrocephalus.
MRI +/- contrast showed an enhancing mass within the right parietal lobe and the plan was for open biopsy on Monday [**7-9**].
[**7-9**] Pt taken to the OR for R parietal craniotomy on this day.
Head CT showed large right sided epidural hematoma anterior to the resection cavity with 1.7cm of midline shift.
Pt was taken back to the operating room from CT scan and underwent emergent evacuation of epidural hematoma and R hemicraniectomy.
An ICP monitor was placed at the time of surgery to further monitor intracranial pressures.
A head ct obtained showed good evacuation of hematoma, resolution of midline shift and no hyrdocephalus.
[**7-10**] Head ct was stable with no new hemorrhage.
His baseline exam on this day showed no eye opening, PERRLA, withdraw BLE R>L, flexion RUE, extensor posturing LUE, no eye opening.
8/13 ICP bolt was removed without difficulty.
Tracheostomy, PEG and IVC filter placed on [**7-17**] without complications.
No new changes when compared to prior exams.
[**7-20**] Pt noted to be febrile on this day with an increasing WBC count and increased amounts thick secretions requiring deep suction.
Sputum cultures sent and positive for H. Flu.
[**Date range (1) 35200**] ID team consulted and recommended to discontinue levaquin and start vancomycin and ceftazadime for broad spectrum coverage.
On [**7-25**] it was noted that his LFTs were slightly elevated on the date that Ceftaz was initiated.
A subsequent RUE UE revealed a superficial clot.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
