Admission Date:  [**2139-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-10-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Codeine / Diazepam / Benzodiazepines / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR coiling of superior rectal artery PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 77 y/o woman with Afib not on coumadin, dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, IBS, CKD, and myeloproliferative disorder transferred from OSH for management of recurrent GI bleeding s/p hemorrhoidectomy requiring multiple hospitalizations and transfusions.
The patient has had about 1.5 years of intermittent GI bleeding, with painless BRBPR, maroon stools, and clots, which worsened over past 4-5 months.
Per report, she has also had intermittent hematochezia.
Colonoscopy on [**6-10**] at OSH showed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids, which were believed to be the source of the bleeding.
She had large amounts of rectal bleeding s/p hemorrhoidectomy on [**7-9**] and was transferred to ICU of OSH from [**Date range (1) 9463**], where she received 7 units PRBC and 3 units FFP and Vit K. Last Hct was 30.7.
She is s/p upper and lower endoscopy suggestive of duodenitis and mild gastritis, colonoscopy, and a tagged RBC scan without clear source (stomach or transverse colon).
Her Cr was 1.5, INR 1.68, and WBC 21 (chronically elevated WBC in 18) at OSH.
She was transferred to MICU for angiography to help localize source of persistent GI bleed with the plan of returning to outside hospital for non-emergent surgery if source cannot be embolized.
She was guaiac positive without frank blood per rectum and was given additional fluid given elevated Cr 1.5 in preparation for angiography.
She has SOB, orthopnea, chronic hot flashes, night sweats, and 130 lb weight loss over past year.
She denies fever or chills.
She has history of constipation and diarrhea.

Imaging: [**7-16**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is less pronounced, and although there is mild vascular engorgement in the upper lungs, mediastinal veins are not dilated.
Therefore, the mild-to-moderate generalized pulmonary edema could be due to transfusion reaction rather than the hemodynamic effect of blood product administration.
No pneumothorax.
Significant residual barium within the bowel is noted which limits evaluation for GI bleeding.
Diverticulosis of descending colon and sigmoid colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Multiple compression fractures noted of T9, L1, L3 and L5 which are age indeterminate.
Small bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right than the left.
Severe four-chamber cardiac enlargement.
[**7-21**] Tagged RBC scan: IMPRESSION: Moderate hemorrhage into the sigmoid colon beginning 15 minutes into the study.
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] gram demonstrated normal anatomy with opacification of left colic, sigmoidal, and superior rectal arterial branches.
Sigmoidal and superior rectal arteriograms demonstrated contrast extravasation in the region of distal rectum, associated with some early filling veins.
Following embolization of a superior rectal artery, there was no contrast extravasation.
[**7-22**] KUB: FINDINGS: There continues to be borderline dilatation of the transverse colon.
This might be consistent with mild ileus.
A small amount of residual barium is still observed in the cecum or ascending colon.
No evidence of calcifications or free air.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o woman with Afib not on coumadin due to various bleeding disorders, dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and myeloproliferative disorder transferred from OSH for management of several months of recurrent GI bleeding s/p hemorrhoidectomy, massive transfusion protocol, and IR coiling of superior rectal artery.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # GI Bleed: The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with GI bleed requiring 7 units PRBCs.
On admission, the patient had intermittent episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
She underwent a non-contrast CT that was limited by residual barium in her intestines from a past study prior to hospital transfer.
Given the length of time barium remained in her colon, gastroenterolgy felt that her bleeding was not from either an upper GI or an intestinal source.
She was then seen by colorectal who felt that her bleeding was related to her recent hemorrhoidectomy.
On the medical floor, the patient began to experience massive GIB with BRBPR and clots.
She underwent iodine desensitization and tagged RBC scan that showed bleeding localized to the sigmoid colon.
She then went to angio, and underwent coiling of her right superior rectal artery with resolution of her bleeding.
The patient did have a small right hematoma as a result of the angiogram.
However, she had no bruits and pulses remained intact.
Pt continued to have loose stools throughout her hospitalization.
She was ruled out for C. diff and it was thought that her loose stools were secondary to absent rectal tone from her hemorrhoidectomy.
#Hemorrhoids s/p hemorrhoidectomy: The patient was admitted with a healing wounds s/p hemorrhoidectomy surrounded by diffuse erythema from stool incontinence.
Pt is at high infection risk given that she does have an open wound with stool incontinence and she will need close monitoring by wound care with frequent repositioning in bed.
# acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Last Echo in [**2136**] showed EF>55%, moderate RV dilation signs of RV overload, and moderate pericardial effusion.
The patient was admitted with crackles on exam, and CXR with cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary edema.
Lasix was initially held on admission due to concern for potential hypotension from GI bleed.
She was intermittently diuresed as needed for fluid overload throughout admission.
She remained euvolemic and was discharged to rehab on lasix with metolazone PRN.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient had elevated creatinine on admission with urine lytes consistent with intrinsic renal or post-renal etiology.
#Afib not on coumadin: Patient has CHADS score of 5 but not candidate for coumadin in context of history of bleeding disorder and current GI bleeding.
The patient's lopressor was held on admission out of concern for hemodynamic instability.
#C.diff: Stools were concerning for C. diff on admission.
Loose stools are attributed to absent rectal tone and fecal incontinence .
#UTI: Patient has history of Klebsiella UTI.
Dysuria was likely secondary to foley.
She did not have increasing oxygen requirements throughout admission.
#Pulmonary Hypertension: Right heart cath in [**2136**] consistent with both cardiogenic and pulmonary contributions with elevated wedge pressure and even greater elevated PA diastolic pressure per report.
# Gout: Chronic.
# Pt is at high risk for infection given her open rectal wound.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Arterial Hemorrhage from hemorrhoidal artery Malnutrition Rectal incontinence   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
After carefully monitoring you for sometime and co-ordinating with a multidisciplinary team, you ultimately received a radiological procedure that fixed the bleeding artery.
Your major problems thereafter were the malnutrition from your prolonged illness and the wound care required to keep your skin intact around the rectum  We did make some changes to your medicines.
