She is a vague historian, but denies chest pain, fevers, cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, chest pain, LE swelling, blood in her stool or urine.
She denies abdominal pain or vomiting.
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== The patient noticed a right neck mass approximately in [**3-15**].
Neck, chest, and abdominal CT on [**2173-4-7**] showed marked thickening of the right lateral oropharyngeal wall up to approximately 2 cm and a 4.5 x 3 cm lobulated, heterogeneous, right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle that displaced the right carotid artery.
No other lymphadenopathy was visualized and there were no suspicious lung nodules.
A 10 cm right adnexal mass was visualized.
This right ovarian mass has been stable and was previously evaluated.
Neck ultrasound on [**2173-4-22**] at the [**Hospital6 2910**] showed a 5.5 x 4 cm neck mass suspicious for neoplastic process.
Pathology was read at the [**Hospital1 **] as invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ==================== Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Pernicious anemia CAD s/p MI and stent implantation in [**2171**] h/o GI bleed   Social History: EtOH: Doesn't drink Tobacco: quit in [**2171**], 60-75 PY history   Family History: nc  Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 98.4 BP: 130/70 HR: 100 RR: 16 02 sat: 93%RA/ GENERAL: NAD, alert and oriented x 2; "[**Hospital6 **]" HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, no LAD, no JVD, Reactive change in pharynx in field of radiation.
CARDIAC: RRR regular skipped beats, normal S1/S2, no mrg appreciated LUNG: bronchial breath sounds and crackedin left middle lung field.
ABDOMEN: soft, large echymossis on LLQ, G tube with moderate amount of erythema surrounding it.
5 inch midline incision c/d/i  M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing.
In the ED, she was found febrile and to have consolidation in her LLL.
Additionally, she was then discovered to be in ARF and anemic with a troponinemia and EKG with various territories of mild ST depression.
There was some concern for an aspiration PNA.
The G tube site remained a persistent concern, however.
There was leaking of a dark and viscous fluid from around the 20 french tubing.
The morning of [**8-4**], she had another large black tarry bowel movement and was tachycardic to the 120s from a baseline fo 90-100.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was evaluated for active bleeding and transfused 2 unites PRBCs.
Endoscopy was performed to evaluate the bleeding around the G-tube site and clamping was attempted, but not successful.
Patient was sent for surgery where the bleeding artery was oversewn and the G-tube was replaced and re-sited with another G-tube.
Post-operatively, the pt had episodes of hypertension, which improved with pain control.
On the day of planned discharge, the patient began to experience some tachycardia by tele.
She was asymptomatic and clinically better than ever before.
On [**8-8**], the patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute respiratory distress with increased oxygen requirements.
A large mucus plug was suctioned from the patient's oropharynx and her respiratory distress resolved.
A CXR showed no worsening infiltrate although there was possibly increased pulmonary edema/ atelectasis.
During the night, the patient intermittently required increased oxygen for saturations down to 88%- this was thought to be related to inadequate clearing of oropharyngeal mucus plugs with a component of sleep apnea.
The patient continued to have guiac positive stools, but this was felt to be residual from her GI bleed and her hct remained stable.
On post-op day 2, the patient was noted to have a possible expressive aphasia.
Final review of a CT Head showed a right parietal hypodensity.
The patient's mental status improved, but the patient had possible left sided hypesthesia and mild left upper extremity motor weakness.
Initially there was concern that the right carotid artery may be compressed by tumor, so neurology recommended permissive hypertension until MRA of neck and CNS assessed patency of vessels.
TTE with bubble study showed no PFO or ASD as possible source for emboli.
On the floor, we shifted focus and treated the patient for a CHF exacerbation.
Arterial Disease - Patient should remain on Aspirin and Clopidogrel.
5 Respiratory Failure - the patient had some trouble clearing secretions, requiring deep suction.
