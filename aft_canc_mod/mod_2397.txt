After receiving a blood transfusion on the day of admission, pt developed dyspnea (88% on 4L NC), chills and diaphoresis, with T 100.1, and creatinine 3.9 from 1.8 earlier in [**Month (only) 958**].
En route, patient became hypotensive despite 1.5 L NS bolus, and phenylephrine was started.
Prior to admission, pt had been recently treated for a sinus infection with levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate.

JVP not noted Chest: B rhonchi anteriorly Cardiac: RRR, S1S2, holosytolic murmur heard throughout precordium, best at RUSB Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, BS+ Extremities: 1+ BLE edema Skin: No rashes or lesions noted Neurologic: Sedated   Pertinent Results: # CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-3-29**] 8:20 PM 1.
Diffuse increased interstitial marking consistent with the mild interstital edema.
The differential includes congestive heart failure, fluid overload or transfusion-related lung disease (TRALI).
# TTE Echocardiogram [**2107-3-30**] 11:40:43 AM No evidence of endocarditis or abscess seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No acute pathology to explain the patient's upper extremity neurologic findings.
Please note, MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of cord pathology.
Right apical ground-glass opacity is nonspecific and may represent underlying infection or alveolar edema.
No acute pathology to explain the patient's upper extremity neurologic findings.
Please note, MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of cord pathology.
Right apical ground-glass opacity is nonspecific and may represent underlying infection or alveolar edema.
No acute intracranial pathology identified.
Please note MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of ischemia or lymphomatous involvement.
Chronic appearing sinus changes with suggestive element of acute sinusitis involving the left maxillary sinusitis.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-4-1**] 3:33 AM Mild interval improvement of bilateral airspace opacities.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M h/o secondary AML, admitted with respiratory failure s/p transfusion and blast crisis.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt developed acute respiratory decompensation after receiving blood products, raising the concern for TRALI, transfusion-associated cardiac overload [**2-5**] acute diastolic CHF, progressive AML with leukostasis, overwhelming infection 2/2 blood products received, or PNA, with the first two etiologies considered most likely.
Pt was extubated without incident, and maintained on face tent with good oxygen saturations.
He subsequently developed increased dyspnea and hypoxemia (uncertain etiology; perhaps leucostasis) and expired.
# Hypotension: Likely underlying etiologies considered were systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis [**2-5**] PNA or transfusion-related infection, or cardiogenic shock [**2-5**] NSTEMI given pt's h/o CAD.
Echocardigram demonstrated focal wall motion abnormality, with rising cardiac enzymes.
# Tumor lysis syndrome: Given pt's high phosphate, worsening creatinine, and hyperuricemia, initial concern was for tumor lysis syndrome.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Immediate etiology considered was uric acid nephropathy given pt's high uric acid.
No remarkable casts or crystals were noted on urine sediment.
Creatinine improved throughout admission with gentle hydration with added bicarb and rasburicase.
# DIC: Initial concern raised for DIC given low platelets and elevated coags, but no schistocytes were apparent and DIC labs were negative.
# Transaminitis: Elevated LFTs were noted with unclear etiology; underlying causes considered were tumor infiltrate of liver given pt's possible hepatomegaly on exam.
# Blast crisis: Pt was noted to have WBC elevated to 165, indicating likely acute blast crisis.
Given pt's deteriorated mental status as well as his oncologic prognosis, the decision was made to not intervene with any acute therapies.
# Mental status: Pt was noted to have altered mental status, absent response to noxious stimuli, and absent responsiveness after extubation.
CT head and C-spine were negative for acute pathology.
The decision was made to not intervene with any acute therapies, and pt was made CMO.
