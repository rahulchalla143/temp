Admission Date:  [**2149-11-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-8-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 65686**] Chief Complaint: AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: 66M s/p brain tumor resection and history of recurrent meningitis presented from rehab with AMS, increased confusion and weakness x 1 day.
He had a Merckel's brain tumor resected [**2149-8-14**] by [**Doctor Last Name **] which was complicated by small amounts of hemorrhage and recurrent Serratia meningitis (pansensitive) treated with meropenem most recently.
Per family rtepor, pt was first noted to have obvious slowing while eating his dinner last night ([**2149-11-14**]).
Pt was also complaining of pain in the front of his head, which seemed to have resolved by the time he presented to the ED.
CT Head showed increasing edema in brain.
On arrival to the floor, pt denies headache and neck stiffness.
Past Medical History: # Neuroendocrine small cell cancer likely [**Location (un) 5668**] cell: - diagnosed in [**7-/2147**] after patient incidentally found a left axillary lymph node.
Imaging studies showed FDG-avid enlarged left axillary lymph node without other concerning nodes or masses.
- [**8-/2147**]/[**2146**]: 4 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide - [**11/2147**]/[**2147**]: received radiation - [**4-/2148**]: imaging study showed no evidence of recurrence of - [**8-/2149**]: several weeks of AMS --> large L temporo/parietal/occipital lesion s/p craniotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], biopsy consistent with [**Location (un) 5668**] cell cancer #.
[**2149-8-14**]: s/p Left parietal-occipital craniotomy for mass resection.
Pathology report was consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor.
Treated for recent UTI and epididymitis as an outpatient prior to [**2149-8-12**] admission #.
Basal cell carcinoma #.
Left hip pain #.
H/o shooting pain to the left lower extremity after a fall in  college #.
pan-sensitive SERRATIA MARCESCENS meningitis [**2149-8-24**] treated with ceftriaxone #.
VRE ?
No smoking history.
(From OMR) His father did have melanoma and developed brain metastases.
He mother had thyroid disease and congestive heart failure.
History of malignant melanoma in his maternal aunt.
Sclera anicteric.
Dry MM, OP without lesions.
Able to rotate neck without pain.
No focal neurological deficit noted.
[**2149-11-15**] CSF:  Cerebrospinal fluid:   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma   (history of [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma).
[**2149-11-16**] CSF: DIAGNOSIS: Cerebrospinal fluid:   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma   (history of [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma).
Progressive decreased density and size of the left occipitoparietal intracranial hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
Within limitations of motion degraded study, no definite areas of new hemorrhage.
Again noted are hypodensities in bifrontal lobes, which correspond to signal intensity changes on recent MRI of [**2149-10-20**], and may represent underlying leptomeningeal disease as well as underlying ischemic disease.
[**2149-11-15**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable chest x-ray examination with no acute process.
[**2149-11-17**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to marked slowing and, at times, voltage reduction over the left posterior temporal region with extension to the left occipital, centro-parietal, and right occipital regions, on occasion.
This would probably represent a structural or destructive process.
Rim-enhancing mass in the left parietal/occipital lobes with central restricted diffusion, similar to prior.
The restricted diffusion within this mass is similar to the postoperative and preoperative examinations, likely representing blood products and residual tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 66yo M s/p recent resection of Merckel's neuroendocrine tumor with 2 prior episodes of Serratia meningitis who presents from rehab with AMS x 1 day and fevers.
# AMS: DIfferential includes recurrent meningitis, other infectious process, or post-ictal confusion.
No evidence of new ICH on CT head.
In terms of potential infectious sources that have been evaluated, CXR is unchanged with no obvious infiltrate.
Per d/c summary from last admission, the patient had a seizure while on the medical floor that was responsive to Ativan, for which he has since been on Keppra and EEG did not reveal any seizure focus.
Neurology recommended MRI w and w/o contrast for further evaluation of evidence of meningoencephalitis.
The cultures are negtive to date, but cytology was positive for malignant cells.
# C Diff colitis: Pt was cotninued on po vancomycin and per ID recs, will need to continue until 10 days after the course of Meropenem is finished.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
