Per patient he has been feeling SOB since [**Month (only) 404**] but his symptoms were subtle at the time.
He also admits to having some fevers and night sweats few weeks ago which have resolved.
Over the past few days he is SOB when he speaks and after walking short distances.
He otherwise denies chest pain, abdominal pain, N/V or significant weight loss.
3)History of basal cell carcinoma of skin.
6)Hyperplastic colonic polyp resected in [**2-4**] colonoscopy.
7)Ankle fracture in early [**2128**] complicated by DVT requiring coumadin anticoagulation.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: vitals T 97.6 Tmax 102.6 BP 102/78 AR 90 RR 22 O2 sat 98% on 3L Gen: Pleasant male, lying in bed HEENT: MMM Neck: No cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated, ?
JVD Heart: nl s1/s2, no s3/s4, no m,r,g Lungs: CTAB with scattered crackles; decreased BS @ L posterior base Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS Extremities: no edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally  Pertinent Results: 1)Cxray ([**2146-4-27**]): Massive left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
New moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
c. Interval appearance of widespread airspace opacities throughout the entire left lower lobe and the basal segments of the left upper lobe and lingula.
d. Slight interval decrease in size of right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
e. Unchanged widespread lymphadenopathy, consistent with history of CLL.
f. Small right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
3) Echo ([**2146-4-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
However, there is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Also, there is brief, mild invagination of both the right and left atrial free walls.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Biventricular function is unchanged from before  [**2146-4-27**] 03:40PM BLOOD WBC-50.1* RBC-3.09* Hgb-9.7* Hct-28.6* MCV-93 MCH-31.2 MCHC-33.7 RDW-16.2* Plt Ct-180 [**2146-5-3**] 06:45AM BLOOD WBC-82.0* RBC-3.09* Hgb-9.6* Hct-28.8* MCV-93 MCH-31.2 MCHC-33.4 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-174 [**2146-4-27**] 03:40PM BLOOD PT-14.4* PTT-24.6 INR(PT)-1.3* [**2146-4-27**] 03:40PM BLOOD Glucose-136* UreaN-20 Creat-1.1 Na-137 K-4.6 Cl-103 HCO3-23 AnGap-16 [**2146-5-3**] 06:45AM BLOOD Glucose-94 UreaN-12 Creat-0.9 Na-139 K-3.9 Cl-105 HCO3-26 AnGap-12 [**2146-5-3**] 06:45AM BLOOD Calcium-7.8* Phos-3.2 Mg-2.4  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] was admitted under the medicine service and was worked up for his shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray on day of admission revealed a massive left pleural effusion.
Also on this day he underwent a chest CT which revealed a new pericardial effusion.
Initial results from microbiology were that the pleural and pericardial effusion were negative for microorganisms.
And cytological results were consistent with previously diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
He was discharged on [**5-3**] with the appropriate follow-up appointments, including f/u with heme/onc for possible CLL treatment.
