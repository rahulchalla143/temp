New large right subdural hematoma.
New small left subdural hematoma.
New sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage, left greater than right.
Severe right subfalcine and uncal herniation.
Compression of the right lateral and third ventricles, with entrapment and severe dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
Nodular cirrhotic liver, consistent with underlying cirrhosis.
Apparent cyst in the left lobe, with no other focal liver lesions identified.
However, the detection of liver lesions with ultrasound in a cirrhotic liver is limited.
MRI may be performed to further assess (along with evaluation of the above mentioned pancreatic lesion).
Ascites and splenic varices consistent with portal hypertension.
Gallstones within the gallbladder neck, though no definite findings to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Two complex cystic lesions near or within the uncinate process of the pancreas.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR: Bilateral effusions are demonstrated, left more than right, with bibasilar areas of atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 46yo F with EtOH cirrhosis presents from clinic with decompensated liver failure.
A CT head performed that day showed no definitive bleeding, though note was made of a 10x9mm hyperdensity associated with the falx.
The radiologic differential included subdural hematoma versus meningioma.
An emergent CT head was obtained following transfer to the MICU which showed large right sided subdural hematoma with subfalcine and uncal herniation.
Kidney donation was considered but ultimately declined due to the patient's elevated creatinine by the following morning, despite hemodynamic support overnight with vasopressors.
She had been having worsening jaundice and increasing bilurubin with a MELD of 34 at the time of discharge from [**Hospital3 **].
She reported feeling lethargic, light-headed and noticed increasing abdominal distention.
She did not have asterixis or other signs of encephalapathy.
She also did not have fever/chills or abd pain.
Her diuretics were held secondary to hypotension and she was continued on naldolol with holding parameters.
She underwent RUQ U/S with dopplers that showed cirrhotic liver.
This was likely secondary to over diuresis with lasix and spironalactone as well as poor po intake.
Pleural Effusions: Pt recently admitted to [**Hospital3 2568**] with pleural effusions.
Reportly 2L of fluid was removed on two occasions.
Lung exam shows mild dullness to percussion at bases and CXR shows effusions.
Pyuria: Pt with positive UA on admission, but likely contamination given multiple epis.
Medications on Admission: At admission: Lasix 60mg TID Lactulose daily Prevacid 30mg [**Hospital1 **] Multivitamin daily Klor-Con (Potassium) 40meq daily Rifaximin 400mg TID Spironolactone 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Nadolol 20mg daily Prednisolone 40mg daily  On transfer to MICU: lactulose 30mg TID rifaximin 400mg TID prednisone 20 daily protonix 40mg po bid mvt  Discharge Medications: not applicable  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: subdural hematoma end stage liver disease secondary to alcohol abuse  Discharge Condition: deceased  Discharge Instructions: not applicable  Followup Instructions: not applicable
