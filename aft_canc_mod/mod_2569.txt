She was hospitalized from [**10-28**] to [**2139-11-5**] with fatigue, visual hallucinations, and hypercalcemia during which time, she was treated with Bendamustine and Rituxan with symptomatic improvement.
Her hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, calcitonin and pamindronate with resolution.
ROS + diarrhea: Patient was hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 39961**] for C.diff colitis and has been continued on po flagyl since.
+ urinary frequency, which the patient attributes to lasix - fevers, chills, nightsweats, headache, diplopia, paresthesias -sore throat, cough, shortness of breath - chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea - dysuria, hematuria, foul smelling urine .
- Originally presented in [**2131-12-17**]: elevated white blood cell count of 24,000 and a monoclonal IgG kappa paraproteinemia.
There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy and she did not have anemia or thrombocytopenia.
- Early [**2136**], WBC levels started to rise and presumably she had either symptoms or cytopenias.
- Course of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and Rituxan x 6 cycles from [**2136-10-17**] to [**2137-3-17**] with remission - Became symptomatic with fevers and a cough and re-started therapy in [**2138-1-17**] with 2 more cycles of FCR.
Torso CT at [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2138-6-26**] showed progressive upper abdominal and mesenteric adenopathy and splenomegaly.
- In [**2138-10-17**] she suffered a detached retina so no treatment for her CLL.
- Repeat CT on [**2139-4-8**] which showed interval enlargement of her axillary, retroperitoneal, periaortic, mesenteric, and iliac adenopathy and a diffusely enlarged spleen.
On [**2139-4-16**] severe cellulitis/nec fasc in her L arm transferred to [**Hospital1 24300**] for a fasciotomy.
- Dyspneic with significant hepatosplenomegaly and a white count of 424K.
But again increase in her white count and size of her spleen, therefore she was started on a regimen of Campath which correlated with fever, cough, and a large hematoma at the injection site.
- [**2139-9-17**] had CT demonstrating pancolitis and proctitis.
During her admission she was experiencing weakness in her legs, therefore an LP was performed.
Flow on her CSF revealed atypical lymphocytes highly suspicious for CNS involvement by her known CLL.

Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: VS: P 98 BP 109/57 RR 18 T 97.8 Pain Score 0/10 %O2 Sat 99 HEENT:  Shows no pharyngeal lesions.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
IMAGING: CXR [**2139-11-30**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-20**] and 13: Lung volumes are still low, particularly on the left where linear opacities are due to subsegmental atelectasis.
There are no findings to suggest pneumonia or pulmonary edema, no pleural effusion or indication of central adenopathy.
Lateral view suggests a lower thoracic vertebral body is unchanged from at least [**10-20**].
Abdominal XR [**2139-12-3**]: FINDINGS: One supine and one left lateral decubitus image of the abdomen show multiple air-filled loops of dilated small bowel measuring up to 3.9 cm.
There is a small about of air seen within the colon extending into the rectum.
These findings are concerning for an early complete or partial small-bowel obstruction.
There is no evidence of free air.
There are significant degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, with a mild curvature that may be related to positioning.
IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel are concerning for a partial versus early complete small-bowel obstruction.
Infectious work-up also performed for generalized symptoms and increasing WBC.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
The patient had a h/o MDR pseudomonas UTI sensitive to  ciprofloxacin, which was continued.
Preliminary results of Urine culture grew Enterococcus, and the patient was started on Vancomycin on HD 2.
(This was later discontinued when the patient was noted to have reduced urine output).
The patient also had a h/o severe C Diff colitis in the past and complained of worsening diarrhea at the time of admission.
On the morning of HD 3, the patient was triggered for hypoxia and shortness of breath.
Evaluation revealed patient in mild respiratory distress with oxygen saturation of 95% on 2L NC.
CXR revealed no significant pulmonary congestion and no pleural effusions.
These findings were concerning for rapid progression of disease.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: On the evening of HOD #3, the patient developed hypotension with SBP in 60s as well as bradycardia in the 40s.
Ciprofloxacin was stopped and she was started vanc/cefepime IV for empiric coverage of hospital-acquired pathogens, given patients immune compromise secondary to CLL and new hypotension concerning for septic shock.
She was treated with one dose of fosfomycin prior to discharge for VRE bacturia.
Vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued as there was no evidence of c. diff toxin on any of her stool samples.
