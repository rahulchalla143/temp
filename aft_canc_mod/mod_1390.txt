He presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] on [**2110-4-23**] with excessive fatigue and shortness of breath two weeks after completing his chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
At the time of admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] the patient denied any fevers or chills, cough or sputum production, but noted increasing weight loss.
While at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 2063**] the patient was found to have a small PE and was placed on intravenous heparin.
He also was found to have a large abscess and multiple secretions, which precluded extubation.
He was placed on multiple intravenous antibiotics with minimal change in status.
He was also noted to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation, which were controlled with AV nodal blockers.
On [**2110-5-11**] the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for a left pneumonectomy of the necrotic left lung.
He also developed hyperglycemia and was controlled with NPH.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] postoperative course was complicated by cardiovascularly the patient required pressors for a short period of time.
Endocrine wise, the patient required an insulin sliding scale for his episodes of hyperglycemia and neurologically the patient was intermittently agitated, but was being sedated with Haldol, Ativan and/or Morphine.
On chest x-ray he was found to have a loculated pleural effusion on his right side, which may have contributed to his weaning difficulties.
The patient was noted to have decreased urine output and a drop in his systolic blood pressure into the 70s and 80s.
He was unresponsive to fluid boluses.
At about 8:00 p.m. on [**6-25**] the patient began complaining of abdominal and chest pain and found to have right upper quadrant tenderness on examination.
His [**Known lastname **] count was found to be elevated at 23 and his hematocrit had fallen to 24.2.
He then received an emergent abdominal CT scan with contrast, which showed bilateral pleural effusions, a rightward shift in his mediastinum, large pericardial effusion, slight thickening of the cecal wall, dilated colon with fluid and small pockets of free air in the peritoneum, large amount of ascites and anasarca and a suggestion of a calculus cholecystitis given the appearance of the gallbladder on CT scan.
He had an emergent cardiac echocardiogram performed which initially showed a small circumferential pericardial effusion, but later on review revealed tamponade physiology of both the right and left ventricles and a large loculated anterior pericardial effusion with right atrial and right ventricular compression.
Septic shock.
