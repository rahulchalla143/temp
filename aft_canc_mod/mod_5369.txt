He first developed symptoms about 2 months prior to presentation.
PFTs showed a mild restrictive defect that was worse than his last testing in [**Month (only) **].
He also had a CT chest that showed an area of consolidation in the left lung, felt to be most compatible with a pneumonia.
The patient was seen again in clinic today on an urgent basis for evaluation of persistent low-grade fevers, dyspnea, and coughing.
Productive cough in the AM with alternating clear or yellow and occasionally blood-tinged sputum.
Also weight loss of about 10lbs over the past 5-6 weeks.
A CXR suggested worsening infiltrate on the left.
Blood work was notable for elevated WBC of 11.8 with a left-shift.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2119-3-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2119-4-1**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
IMAGING: [**2119-3-21**] CXR (PA and lat): IMPRESSION: Persistent peripheral consolidation although slightly improved since the recent CT in [**2119-2-13**] with background changes of known IPF.
Enlargement of left upper lobe opacity, with increasing mass-like configuration and displacement and narrowing of the left upper lobe bronchus.
The appearance is concerning for a primary lung cancer, particularly considering increasing size of aorticopulmonary window and left hilar lymphadenopathy, as well as a new lytic lesion at T12.
This lesion would be amenable to either bronchoscopic or transthoracic needle biopsy.
New widespread areas of ground-glass opacification in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally.
Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage (the patient reportedly is experiencing hemoptysis), opportunistic infection, and acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
[**2119-4-3**] CXR (portable): AP chest compared to [**3-24**] through 18:  Widespread infiltrative abnormality in the right lung has worsened progressively since [**3-30**] after some earlier improvement.
This is more likely to be infection or hemorrhage than edema, given that course.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, who presented with persistent low grade fevers, productive cough, and hypoxia despite treatment with PNA.
He was found to have a left lingular mass on rigid bronch [**2119-3-24**] and was transferred to the MICU for failed extubation s/p bronchoscopy.
He was found to have a new L lingular mass on bronchoscopy which came back as squamous cell carcinoma with one out of two positive lymph nodes.
In the MICU, despite broad treatment for PNA (R-sided), diuresis, and IV steroid treatment for possible IPF flare for more than 5 days, he continued to have high O2 requirements with desaturations off face mask oxygen.

Levsin/SL 0.125 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: 1-2 tablets Sublingual every 4-6 hours as needed for increased secretions.
Scopolamine Base 1.5 mg Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) Transdermal every seventy-two (72) hours as needed for secretions.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with persistent fevers, SOB, and cough and found to have newly diagnosed terminal lung cancer.
You have been treated for a possible associated pneumonia as well.
