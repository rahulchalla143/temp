However, her therapy has been hold due to tachycardia possibly from volume depletion.
However, in the afternoon of [**2103-10-26**], she had a acute onset of numbness of right [**Doctor Last Name **] that only lasted for 15 mins.
After she arrived at our ED, a head CT was taken and showed "2.3 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm lesion in the high left frontoparietal region with surrounding vasogenic edema.
additional 1 cm rounded lesion in the right parietal lobe with mild surrounding edema".

Denies  sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
Past Medical History: Oncology history:  Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] noted a "pimple" on her mid back which began to bleed intermittently, and increased in size.
On [**2102-8-8**] an excisional biopsy was performed with pathology revealing an at least 14.5 mm deep, ulcerated and invasive melanoma, which was classified as type non-specific, but clearly contained a nodular component.
There was a small focus of epidermal involvement of MMIS and the tumor extended to at least [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV.
Additionally, a PET/CT scan showed a 3 cm FDG-avid mass in her right axilla without other disease.
On [**10-5**], she underwent a wide local excision, sentinel lymph node evaluation with selective left axillary lymphadenectomy, and a right axillary lymph node dissection.
There was no residual disease found in the wide excision nor disease in the four left axillary sentinel lymph nodes, however, five of twenty-seven lymph nodes were involved in the right axilla, as well as evidence of extracapsular spread.
On [**2103-1-3**], she was preparing to commence a year of adjuvant interferon when a suspicious lesion was identified on her right leg above the ankle and was biopsied, with pathology showing a 1.2 mm deep, non-ulcerated invasive melanoma with at least two mitoses per square millimeter.
On [**2103-2-1**], she underwent a wide local excision with sentinel lymph node sampling with pathology revealing no evidence of disease in the wide excision specimen or any of the three right inguinal sentinel lymph nodes.
On follow up CT performed [**6-15**], an area of most likely scarring was seen in the right apex without features consistent with neoplasm seen.
At that time, she noted increased abdominal bloating, reduced energy and appetite.
PMH: obesity, hyperlipidemia  PSH: appendectomy, uterine myomectomy   Social History: She lives alone and is currently unemployed.
She has no children.
Family History: Her father died at age 58 from complications of colon cancer and her mother died at age 88 from complications of an intracranial hemorrhage.
She has a 50-year-old sister who suffers from epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.

findings highly suggestive of metastatic dz.
no midline shift or herniation.
MRI HEAD [**2103-10-27**]:Multiple parenchymal enhancing lesions, consistent with metastases.
The largest lesion in the left paracentral lobule is hemorrhagic and demonstrates moderate surrounding edema, but no significant shift of midline structures and no herniation.
Right axillary postoperative seroma and radiation changes.
No evidence of additional disease in the torso.
EEG [**2103-10-28**] This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG due to the presence of occasional sharp wave discharges and spike and slow wave discharges in the bilateral frontal central regions, phase reversing at F3 and F4, indicative of an area of epileptogenic cortex in these regions.
Additionally, intermittent bursts of theta frequency slowing was seen in the bilateral frontal central regions indicative of subcortical dysfunction.
No clear electrographic seizures were seen.
MRI brain [**2103-10-31**] Stable appearance to multifocal peripheral parenchymal enhancing lesions, with a large amount of edema surrounding the left parietal lesion.
Expected postoperative changes in the left parietal resection bed, including minimal hemorrhage and pneumocephalus.
No large quantity of intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute large vascular territorial infarction.
No shift of normally midline structures or central herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 55 year-old female with stage IIIC melanoma (T4bN3bM0) who has completed surgical management and adjuvant radiation therapy as well as surgical management of a second primary, stage IB melanoma, currently on week 32 of interferon therapy(however, His therapy has been hold due to tachycardia possibly from volume depletion), presenting with right sided numbness and tingling and weakness.
# Brain Mass: neuro was consulted for patient's numbness and brain mass on CT.  MRI was done which revealed hemorrhagic lesion, likely metastatic melanoma in left parietal lobe which would correspond to symptom distribution.
EEG was also done which showed epileptogenic cortex in frontal lobes bilaterally but no seizures, as well as subcortical dysfunction.
Due to hemorrhage associated with lesion, anticoagulation and antiplatalet therapies were avoided (DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots) and pt was placed on captopril to maintain SBP goal <160.
CT head showed no hemorrhage.
# anemia: this was likely secondary to underlying cancer and/or medication or IV fluids.
Medications on Admission: lorazepam 0.5 mg Tab One - Two Tablet(s) by mouth Every 4-6 hours as needed for nausea  naproxen 375 mg Tab One Tablet(s) by mouth Two-Three times per day.

If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
