Admission Date:  [**2128-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-12-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Erythromycin Estolate / Xylocaine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 71 yo woman with metastatic breast cancer to spine, femur p/w acute dyspnea.
Pt was in USOH until this afternoon, when she developed sudden dyspnea @ 3pm.
However, she became progressively more dyspneic over the next hour and EMS was called.
Of note she had recent admit [**Date range (1) 40693**] for dyspnea, thought to be [**1-23**] PNA (and a possible aspiration event), treated with cefpodoxime/flagyl.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was initially afebrile (though eventually spiked to 101.6), BP 180s/110s, hr 120s-140s, rhonchi on exam, given ntg slx1, started on nitro gtt and given lasix 40 mg iv X1 (UOP 750cc).
CTA negative for PE or consolidation, though evidence of pulmonary edema and large bilateral pleural effusions as well as increased right hilar lymphadenopathy.
CT abd showed multiple liver metastases (new since [**1-28**]), increasing bilateral adrenal thickening - mets vs hypertrophy, small amount of ascites, mild anasarca.
CT head checked in case of the need for anti-coagulation, showed mass at R cranial vertex.
Past Medical History: Onc history: Left breast cancer diagnosed in [**2124-6-20**] with three positive nodes and underwent lumpectomy followed by Cytoxan and Adriamycin.
In [**2126-3-22**] she was diagnosed with a vetebral metastatic lesion and at the same time was also diagnosed with colorectal cancer for which she underwent excision.
Right pathologic proximal femur fracture s/p ORIF [**2128-4-8**], s/p XRT -Goiter with hypothyroidism -Hypertension -Anxiety disorder -Lymphedema left arm -Rectal cancer   Social History: lives alone with caregiver during day, former tob and etoh, 2 daughters  Family History: Father died at 73 of coronary artery disease and mother died at 97.
Physical Exam: Temp 95.3 oral BP 122/66 Pulse 82 Resp 16 O2 sat 99% 6 L NC Gen - anxious, but no acute distress HEENT - extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes moist Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - rales throughout CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abd - Soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds Extr - trace edema b/l.
[**5-31**] CT Head w/o Contrast: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a hyperdense ill-defined 3.2 x 1.9 cm mass at the right frontovertex that appears to be extra-axial in location with slight mass effect on the subjacent cortex and minimal subfalcine herniation (approximately 5 mm of midline shift).
No other intracranial mass is identified.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Known lastname **] matter differentiation is preserved and there is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
No hydrocephalus.
A 1 cm destructive osseous lesion at the right frontal calvarium is seen (2:11), likely a metastasis.
There is also a well-defined lytic lesion of the left parietal calvarium, at the vertex (2:26) which may represent a prominent arachnoid granulation, or could represent metastasis in this patient with extensive metastatic breast cancer.
Hyperdense extra-axial mass at the right cranial vertex may represent dural metastasis or meningioma.
There is minimal mass effect and 5 mm of subfalcine herniation.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
Destructive osseous lesion at the right frontal calvarium is likely a metastatic lesion.
Possible metastasis versus prominent arachnoid granulation at the left parietal vertex.
Given the known extensive metastatic disease, including epidural involvement in the lumbar spine, the right craniovertex extra-axial lesion, which crosses the midline and may breach the superior sagittal sinus, likely represents a dural metastasis.
However, incidental meningioma remains a possibility as these may occur with increased frequency in patients with breast cancer.
The well-defined, scalloped left parietovertex lesion is most suggestive of an incidental "giant" pacchionian (arachnoid) granulation.
This includes peripheral low-attenuation (measuring negative [**Doctor Last Name **], suggestive of fat) as well as central stippled calcification or ossification, with no associated soft tissue component.
This could represent an unrelated hemangioma or, less likely (given the calcification), epidermoid.
However, lytic breast metastasis with residual bone fragments, remains a concern.
Coronal, sagittal and multiple oblique reformats were performed of the chest as well as coronal and sagittal reformats of the abdomen and pelvis.
CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The heart is moderately enlarged with no evidence of pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
Large mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted including a 2 x 2.7 cm pretracheal lymph node (3A:29), and two right hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm each.
Diffuse perivascular ground-glass opacification of the lungs is consistent with pulmonary edema.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, measuring simple fluid density, with associated atelectasis.
No definite consolidations are seen.
Geographic airspace opacity along the left upper lobe is relatively unchanged since [**2128-1-22**] and consistent with post-radiation changes.
No pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Multiple enhancing masses are seen within the liver, new since [**2128-1-22**] and consistent with metastases from patient's known metastatic breast cancer.
The largest lesions include a 3 x 2.5 cm lesion in the right lobe (3B:107).
A 2.7 x 2.5 cm lesion of the inferior and posterior aspect of the right lobe (3B:123) and an ill-defined 3 x 3 cm lesion in the inferior aspect of the left lobe (3B:116).
The adrenal glands are thickened bilaterally, increased since [**2128-1-22**], also concerning for metastases.
A non-enhancing exophytic cyst of the left kidney is again noted.
Intra- abdominal small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.
Increased stranding within the mesentery and soft tissues consistent with anasarca.
Duodenal diverticulum is again noted.
Post-surgical changes of the anastomotic site are stable with no extraluminal air identified.
No free fluid or lymphadenopathy within the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: Again seen are diffuse sclerotic metastases throughout the lumbar spine and pelvis with a stable L1 compression fracture status post vertebroplasty.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
Increasing mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Progression of disease with new liver metastases and bilateral adrenal enlargement suggestive of metastasis.
Diffuse osseous metastases with no evidence of new fractures.
[**5-31**] CXR FINDINGS: The patient is in lordotic and slightly leftward rotated position.
There is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature which may be consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion which is unchanged in size.
There is no evidence of a right pleural effusion.
The sclerotic appearance of several lower thoracic vertebral body is stable corresponding to sclerotic metastasis on prior studies.
Perihilar congestion and cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with congestive heart failure.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with either effusion or atelectasis and is stable.
Again identified is sclerotic foci and vertebroplasty material from patient's known metastatic disease to the spine.
[**6-1**] CXR Moderately severe pulmonary edema and small-to-moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left, have increased since [**5-31**].
Mild cardiac enlargement has increased.
No pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: An 8 x 9 mm ring-enhancing lesion is present within the right occipital lobe with an adjacent 9 x 10 mm more homogeneously enhancing lesion within the left occipital lobe, both consistent with metastatic disease.
Additionally, a previously identified dural-based mass, predominantly located at the cranial right-sided vertex with midline extension to involve the left- sided vertex appears to have mild amount of homogeneous enhancement in association with thickening of the dura and dural enhancement, also suggestive of a dural metastatic lesion.
Two osseous lesions, one within the inner table of the right frontal bone with extension to an extradural location and the second within the posterior high vertex of the parietal bone with inner table erosion and adural extension are also likely consistent with osseous metastatic disease.
Increased T2 and FLAIR signal abnormalities within the cerebral periventricular deep [**Known lastname **] matter are compatible with chronic small vessel infarction.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or acute infarct.
No abnormal areas of restricted diffusion are identified surrounding the parenchymal lesions.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, likely inflammatory in origin.
IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with bilateral occipital, subdural, and osseous right frontal and left parietal metastatic lesions.
Coincident meningiomas accounting for the vertex dural lesions is an alternative diagnosis.
[**6-3**] MRI spine: FINDINGS: There are areas of low signal identified predominantly in C2, C4, C5, T1, T2, and T3 vertebral bodies indicative of sclerotic metastasis.
There is no evidence of spinal cord compression or epidural mass identified.
There is no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen from C3-4 to C6-7 without spinal stenosis.
IMPRESSION: Sclerotic metastatic disease in the visualized cervical vertebral bodies without epidural mass or spinal cord compression.
No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
FINDINGS: Again diffuse sclerotic metastasis is seen in the thoracic vertebral bodies.
As seen on the previous lumbar spine MRI of [**2128-3-7**], there is a pathologic fracture of L1 vertebra visualized with retropulsion.
There is mild spinal stenosis seen at that level.
In the thoracic region at T9 and T10 level, mild epidural soft tissue changes are seen with mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis.
There is no obvious spinal cord compression seen on the T2 axial images, however.
There is no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities seen.
IMPRESSION: Bony metastatic disease with low signal intensities indicative of sclerosis.
Chronic pathologic fracture of L1 with retropulsion and mild spinal stenosis which appears to be secondary to epidural disease at T9 and T10 level which can be better evaluated with gadolinium-enhanced MRI if clinically indicated.
No spinal cord compression seen.
[**6-1**] ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is  focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral  regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-4-20**], new regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction is now seen c/w CAD and the severity of  mitral regurgitation has increased.
A large left pleural effusion is similar (was present but not reported).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
