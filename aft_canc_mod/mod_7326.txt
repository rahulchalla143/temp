Admission Date:  [**2198-12-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-12-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 55 year old female with history of metastatic breast cancer with mets to cervical spine, right hip and history of malignant pericardial and pleural effusions.
Pt underwent pericardial window on [**7-30**] for pericardial effusion with improvement in symptoms of dyspnea.
Subsequently developed a left > right pleural effusion, which was managed with thoracentesis and placement of a pleurex catheter in [**9-29**].
Since that time pt has noted persistent weakness and dyspnea on exertion, now worsened to the point where the patient has difficulty with dressing, transfer and is unable to walk between rooms.
She reports having worsening right hip pain recently, was found on MRI to have evidence of bony mets and earlier today had cycle [**2-24**] of radiation to this area with her radiation oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Otherwise on notable history pt notes chronic cough x years, mildly worse lately with clear to yellow sputum production.
Had one episode of n/v over the weekend with low grade temp to 100.3.
Has mild chest discomfort with coughing and dyspnea as above.
+ Occasional constipation.
No LE edema.
Had CXR which showed bibasilar pleural effusions L>R and LLL infiltrate.
Bedside TTE showed suggestion of pericardial effusion.
F/u formal TTE showed LVEF 35-40% with increased echo-dense loculated pericardial effusion and some evidence of increased pericardial pressure.
Had an elevated WBC with left shift.
Admitted to the CCU for monitoring of pericardial effusion with concern for evolving tamponade.
Upon arrival to CCU pt underwent thoracentesis with interventional pulmonology, with removal of 200cc cloudy fluid, pt reported interval symptom improvement.
In [**2192**] known metastatic disease to spine, supraclavicular node, and right hip.
She has tried and failed multiple chemotherapy regimens, now cycle 1, day 16 of Herceptin/Xeloda 2) Anxiety 3) Hypertension (has been on lisinopril but stopped on own) 4) s/p appendectomy 5) Hypothyroidism .
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Her father died of a AAA rupture.
There is a history of cancer in multiple family members.
NECK: Extensive radiation changes, difficult to appreciate neck veins, no distention noted.
Unable to take pulsus (s/p axillary LN dissection on R and PICC on L) Evidence of venous distention of L superfical thoracic wall veins.
Decreased BS R>L, poor air movement.
+ BS EXTREMITIES: Slight pitting edema L breast, b/l elbows.
Left atrial abnormality.
Low limb lead voltage.
Probable prior anterior myocardial infarction.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is a moderate sized partially echo filled loculated pericardial effusion most prominent anterior to the right ventricle (1.8cm) and anterolateral to the left ventricle (1.8) with minimal (1.1cm) inferior to the left ventricle and minimal around the lateral left ventricle and apex.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is mild intermittent right ventricular diastolic collapse but no exacerbation of transmitral Doppler inflow.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-9-13**], the effusion is larger and increased pericardial pressure is suggested.
A prominent pleural effusion is also now present.
Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is also now present.
