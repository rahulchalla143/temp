Admission Date:  [**2185-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-2-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Diagnostic cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: This is an 81 yo female with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor on home hospice, h/o CVA, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Hospital1 **] emergency room with chest discomfort and malaise.
She began experiencing chest discomfort at 12:30 during the night, and took some nitroglycerin with partial relief, but did not tell the family because she was hoping it would resolve.
By the morning, patient was becoming dyspneic and felt nauseous, and requested to come to the hospital.
Chest pain had resolved on arrival to [**Hospital1 **] Emergency room, but she was noted to have ST elevations in III and aVF with prominent R-wave with ST depressions in V1-V2.
Left heart catheterization demonstrated LVEDP of 40mmHg, LAD with diffuse disease and a 99% mLAD stenosis, LCx with diffuse disease, 50% pLCx stenosis, 90% mLCx lesion after OM1, 70% OM1, pRCA occlusion with large conus with 80% stenosis giving collaterals to LAD and RCA.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Ventricular tachycardia #.
History of MI and Ventricular tachycardia in [**8-/2184**], on amiodarone, ICD declined #.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 35% in [**1-/2184**] at [**Hospital1 **] 3.
H/o right-sided CVA in [**2157**] #.
H/o Bell's Palsy with residual deficits of facial muscles.
History of Neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastasis #.
History of Renal cell CA #.
H/o small-bowel obstruction, S/p exploratory laparotomy #.
Rheumatoid arthritis #.
Hypertension #.
Diabetes mellitus - on oral metformin #.
Hyperlipidemia #.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
II/VI systolic murmur.
No thrills, lifts.
+ S3 LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG [**2185-2-16**] - Sinus rhythm.
The previously mentioned multiple abnormalities persist without diagnostic interim change.
[**2185-2-15**] - Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an apical left ventricular aneurysm and an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a small (~0.5 cm) mobile echodense structure adjacent to the apical anterior wall consistent with probable thrombus.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel disease.
The LMCA had mild disease.
The LAD was diffusely diseased with 99% stenosis at the mid segment.
The LCX was diffusely diseased with 50% stenosis at the proximal segment, 90% stenosis at the mid segment after the first OM, and there was 70% stenosis within the first OM.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling pressures consistent with diastolic dysfunction, with LVEDP 40 mm Hg.
Careful pullback across the aortic valve did not reveal a significant gradient.
Patient was symptom free, and ECG done during catheterization showed resolution of ST segment changes.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo female with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, apical aneurysm, CVA, CHF, presents with chest pain in setting of uncontrolled hypertension now s/p cardiac catherization.
As patient was pain free with resolution of ST changes elected to pursue conservative management with BP control and diuresis and would consider PCI if recurrent symptoms.
# Chest pain: ST-elevations may have been secondary to aneurysmal changes noted on [**Hospital3 4107**] echocardiogram and confirmed on echocardiography today at [**Hospital1 18**].
Lack of significant biomarker elevation suggests against significant ischemic territorial STEMI, and angiography suggests chronic RCA given collateralization.
Patient may have had symptoms secondary to uncontrolled hypertension.
STarted patient on Imdur 30 mg PO daily for both blood pressure and anginal control.
# Hypertension - Patient maintained as outpatient on BB, ACEi.
# Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Euvolemic with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Echocardiogram with aneurysmal changes, possible thrombus in LV.
# Chronic renal failure - baseline unknown, Cr currently 1.5 and stable, potassium stable, continue to monitor.
# Rhythm - history of ventricular tachycardia, continued amiodarone and BB, repleted electrolytes as needed.
# Diabetes - Insulin sliding scale in house, cahnged back to metformin on discharge.
# Neuroendocrine carcinoma - Continue fentanyl patch, senna, docusate, lorazepam, acetaminophen.
# Rheumatoid arthritis - restart methotrexate and prednisone on discharge.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual as needed as needed for chest pain: please hold for BP < 100.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of [**Location (un) 86**] and Greater [**Hospital1 1474**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: acute coronary syndrome .
Secondary: rheumatoid arthritis, CAD, neuroendocrine tumor  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, chest pain free  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest pain.
We did a catheterization which showed chronic heart disease but no clear signs of an acute heart attack.
We also did blood tests which showed that you did not have a heart attack.
