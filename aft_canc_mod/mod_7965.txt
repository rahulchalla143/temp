Admission Date:  [**2173-2-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2173-2-23**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 105134**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a significant history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times three, congestive heart failure (last echo with an ejection fraction of 40%) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a rapid response, presented with chest pain and a rapid rate, and respiratory decompensation.
The patient was noted to have ST elevations with her rapid rate which cleared when her rate was adequately controlled with beta-blockers.
However, later that evening she developed sinus bradycardia.
In the CCU she was diuresed with resolution of respiratory distress, CKMB fraction was positive but Troponin I was negative.
Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction times three.
Congestive heart failure.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Heart rate rhythm regular, no murmurs.
Scattered expiratory wheezes.
Chest x-ray showing congestive heart failure without infiltrates.
ST depressions V4 through V6, 1 and L. 2.
Atrial flutter at 57.
ST changes noted above had resolved.
There was an initial concern for cardiac ischemia with the elevated CKMB fraction in the absence of Troponin I elevation.
This was thought to be consistent with an enzyme leak secondary to strain.
However, she did not tolerate this well although it initially decreased her rate allowing for control.
Congestive heart failure that she initially suffered secondary to her rapid rate was thought to be from flash pulmonary edema, responded well to diuresis at the time of this dictation she is sating well on room air and able to ambulate comfortably without desaturation.
Her chronic renal insufficiency was stable with a creatinine of 1.5 which was close to her baseline.
This did not change even with aggressive diuresis following her pulmonary edema.
She had no asthma exacerbations while in house.
Her initial white count was elevated over 200 however, this subsequently declined to less than 100 with no interventions.
No further workup or intervention was taken at this time and she can follow-up as an outpatient with her own hematologist.
The patient does have baseline anemia and given her enzyme leak she was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.7.
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
