Mild Q-T interval prolongation.
Probable left atrial abnormality.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-7-8**] ST segment depressions are more prominent in the high lateral leads and the rate is faster.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 97	166	100	380/444	52	6	133 Pertinent imaging:  Echo ([**2140-7-18**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior walls and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Upper extremity doppler ([**7-20**]): official result pending   Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o male with hx ESRD with melanotic stools since starting dialysis.
On plavix for hx CAD, and given timing of symptoms with dialysis possible that combination of being on plavix and heparin flushes from dialysis +uremic platelets revealed a lesion in his GI tract susceptible to bleeding.
The patient had a hct of 16.2 on admission and was transfused to a goal Hct of 30 due to CAD history.
An initial EGD showed multiple ulcers in antrum and pylorus without clear signs of bleeding.
EGD once again showed antral ulcers and duodenitis (biopsy pending at time of discharge) and Cscope showed 3 sessile polyps that were resected (biopsy pending at time of discharge).
Of note, at time of discharge, it was noted that his H.pylori serology that was previously negative had turned postiive by EIA, thus he was contact[**Name (NI) **] and Rx for clarithro and amox X2weeks was added (already on PPI [**Hospital1 **]) for triple therapy.
CAD s/p bypass: In the setting of his severe anemia/GIB, he had an NSTEMI while in ICU.
He underwent an Echo with showed anteroseptal WMA (mid LAD distribution) and it is unclear whether this is new/old (reversible or fixed).
H. pylori infection: The patient was found to have a positive H. pylori serology in the setting of gastric ulcers.
The patient was placed on a PPI for his GI bleed and started on two weeks of amoxicillin 1g [**Hospital1 **] and clarithromycin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Left hand thrombophlebitis: He had a transient fever on [**7-16**] and was started on Vanco.
The superficial thrombophlebitis on his left doral hand resolved prior to discharge and the patient was afebrile >24 hours.
Left arm thrombosis: two days prior to discharge, he complained of left arm swelling.
He had left arm swelling in the past.
He underwent a doppler which showed OLD/Chronic nonocclusive DVTs of brachial and basillic veins and a NEW occlusive DVT of axillary vein which is likely reason for the new swelling.
Repeat dopplers in 2weeks are recommended to rule out extension of the clot.
He is advised to seek immediate attention if he develops worsening/severe swelling of L arm for concern for compartment syndrome, which would be an indication for catheter directed thrombolysis.
ESRD with complications of anemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism: The patient tolerated hemodialysis on Tu/Th/Sat while in house.
Of note, he has secondary hyperpara and severe hyperphos.
GI: Followup on biopsies of the gastric ulcers and sessile polyps, appt.
Clarithro and Amox were added after discharge for triple therapy for H.pylori  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: UGIB [**1-4**] PUD (melena/hematochezia) Acute blood loss anemia s/p 9U prbc NSTEMI [**1-4**] demand (anemia, bleed) ESRD on HD 2ndary HyperPara->severe hyperphos CAD s/p CABG, current Echo with WMA (mid-LAD), need outpt stress   Discharge Condition: STABLE   Discharge Instructions: ***Please bring this discharge instruction sheet to your primary doctor!
You were admitted for 3 weeks of black stools and 1 day of marroon stool secondary to bleeding from  you gastrointestinal tract (likely ulcers).
Please return to ER if you have recurrance of black/marroon stools or chest pain, lightheadedness.
...... Due to your severe anemia and stress, your heart also was stress out.
For this, you will need to have a stress test after discharge and close follow up with cardiology.
You were also found to have old and new blood clot of your Left arm near armpit.
Ask your dialysis doctor to start you on anemia shots (like epogen) weekly.
Also you may need other dialysis meds for your high phosphorus.
please follow low potassium and low phosphorus diet.
