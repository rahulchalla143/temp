A CT abdomen revealed a gastric outlet obstruction.
Pt reports decreased po intake over the last couple of days and increased nausea.
He reports [**8-16**] pain to his left mid-abdomen which radiates through to his back and up to his left shoulder and across to his right shoulder.
CXR revealed a large gastric bubble and an NGT was placed revealing coffee ground emesis.
Labs revealed a 4 point Hct Drop.
EKG showed new biphasic TWs V1-2 although CEs 1st set neg.

Scattered ground-glass opacities within the lungs (new since [**2114-11-8**]) for which the differential is broad.
Differential diagnosis includes drug toxicity from chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**], infectious process (consider PCP in the neutropenic patient), atypical edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
Aspiration and lymphangitic tumor spread are not favored diagnoses.
New mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy since [**2114-11-7**].
Gastric outlet obstruction likely secondary to known tumor encasement at the level of the second portion of the duodenum.
Debris within the metallic common bile duct stent which was previously air-filled without evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
New hypoattenuating lesion at the dome of the liver (series 3: image 72), which is not fully characterized on this arterial phase study.
Renal calculi within the left kidney as described above.
Possible mild obstruction.
Recommend correlation with ultrasound if there are corresponding symptoms.
Coronary artery calcifications, status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
Increased size and new pulmonary nodules within the right middle lobe for which monitoring on followup exams is recommended.
[**2114-12-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis and focal akinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall and mid inferolateral wall (LVEF = 40 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global and mild regional systolic dysfunction.
[**2114-12-22**] Portable Abd U/S: FINDINGS: The bowel gas pattern is essentially within normal limits with no evidence of obstruction.
No free Intraperitoneal gas, though this could be difficult to detect on the left decubitus view presented.
If there is strong clinical suspicion for either obstruction or free intraperitoneal gas, CT would be the next imaging study.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26670**] is a 62yo M w/ h/o chronic gastric outlet obstruction [**3-10**] pancreatic CA now presenting with Acute Respiratory Distress and hypotension.
# Acute Respiratory Distress: The pt arrived in the ICU now on 6L NC from a baseline of no O2 in the setting of new ground glass opacities.
DDx included infection (Aspiration PNA, Atypical), inflamatory rxn (potentially secondary to chemotherapy- Gemzar), edema, hemorrhage.
He was initially put on Vanco, cefepime and doxycycline for coverage of aspiration and atypical PNA given his h/o allergy to Cipro and Macrolides.
# Hypotension: Pt was briefly placed on Levophed in the ED for hypotension which quickly resolved on arrival to the ICU and was discontinued.
# Gastric Outlet Obstruction: The pt had originally come to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-19**] to be evaluated for cyberknife treatment but was transferred to the ED with low O2 Sat.
Obstruction was likely the origin of LUQ abd pain and worsening nausea and secondary to extrinsic compression from pancreatic mass.
# CAD: Pt presented with EKG changes in the setting of a hx of CAD and Hct < 30.
Pt had no further EKG changes during hospitalization.
