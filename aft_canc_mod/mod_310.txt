She reports that she first developed shortness of breath several months  ago ([**Month (only) 216**] [**2184**]) and was found to have a left-sided pleural effusion, and she underwent thoracentesis; subsequent cytologic analysis showed malignant cells consistent with known adenocarcinoma.
The shortness of breath had improved temporarily but recurred within several weeks; the pleural effusion had reaccumulated.
During the admission, she was noted to be in and out of atrial fibrillation, alternating from tachycardia to sinus bradycardia, and with systolic blood pressures in the 70's - 90's.
Given the tachycardia and hypotension, an echocardiogram was performed demonstrating large pericardial effusion and evidence of RV collapse.
She went for pericardiocentesis on [**5-10**].
Echo showed small anteroapical pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Her creatinine was noted to be increasing (from 1.4 to 1.9 to 2.3) with continued hypotension despite multiple fluid boluses (totaling ~2L).
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
She denies chest pain (other than at the site the pericardial drain), dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, syncope, PND, orthopnea.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 66 year old female with metastatic breast cancer and malignant pleural/pericardial effusions, admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit with atrial fibrillation and hypotension after pericardial drainage placement.
# Hypotension: Initially there was concern for septic shock, and patient received antibiotics and was placed on levophed.
A Swan catheter was placed, and it was found that her hemodynamic numbers more consistent with cardiogenic shock.
# Atrial fibrillation: Hospital course was complicated by several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
It was felt that this was secondary to her pericardial effusion, hyperadrenergic state from possible infection, depressed function, and mitral regurgitation.
# Oliguria/acute renal failure: Patient developed acute renal failure, felt to be likely a combination of poor forward flow, and ATN from transient hypotension.
# Systolic congestive heart failure: Patient's last ejection fraction was 20-25%.
She was formerly on carvedilol and lisinopril at home; which were held in the setting of hypotension, and not added back due to persistently borderline low blood pressure.
# Valves: Patient has known mitral regurgitation.
# HTN: Home medications held in setting of hypotension.
Her pain, mainly in a band-like distribution across her epigastric area, was treated with fentanyl and oral dilaudid.
# Illeus/constipation: Patient had difficulty with constipation during her stay, with repeated x-ray imaging consistent with an illeus, without evidence of obstruction.
Her tube feeds were given as tolerated due to nausea and vomiting.
