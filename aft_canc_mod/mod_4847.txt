Culture pending  Radiology: [**2135-2-16**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7710**] is a 58 year old male with recently diagnosed squamous cell cancer of the head and neck who presented with respiratory distress and was intubated in the ED.
# Respiratory failure - First ABG with acidemia and hypercarbia.
Differential includes respiratory infection or mucous plugging vs. upper airway compromise from malignancy vs. narcotic overdose given home med use.
Report of ?pus with intubation concerning for pneumonia which was more apparent on repeat CXR after fluid resuscitation.
Suspect aspiration given altered mental status and location of infiltrate.
Patient initially on vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin to cover for healthcare associated pneumonia and narrowed to vancomycin and zosyn (plus metronidazole for C.diff).
# Unresponsiveness - Likely secondary to pulmonary infection vs. mucous plugging vs. narcotic overdose given hypercarbia and respiratory distress.
Hypercarbia improved post intubation.
No evidence for seizure or other intoxication on serum/utox.
# Diarrhea/C.diff - Stools were positive for C. difficile and patient was started on IV flagyl.
# Anion gap - Likely secondary to lactic acidosis, most likely from infection.
# Elevated CK - Possibly early rhabdo from lying immobile overnight.
# Renal failure - Baseline creatinine 0.6-0.7 per WXVA records.
Likely pre-renal from dehydration in the setting of diarrhea and acute infection, now trending downward after fluid resuscitation.
# Hyperkalemia - Initially 6.1 then resolved to 4.6.
Likely secondary to acute renal failure.
Improvement likely result of IVF and diarrhea.
# Hypertension - Tachycardia could be rebound from beta-blocker withdrawal in addition to acute illness.
Responded back into 90s with 1.5 L IVFs in the early afternoon and has maintained in this range.
