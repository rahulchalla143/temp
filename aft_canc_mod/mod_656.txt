Admission Date:  [**2155-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-3-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Mental status changes, ?aspiration pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 43 yo male with recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal ca s/p multiple trials of chemotherapy and resection of mets including brain mets who was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 2005**] hospital on [**7-7**] with a diagnosis of pneumonia, UTI, and infection of J-tube site and completed course of vancomycin and meropenem ending on [**7-8**].
At hospice, he was noted to have thick secretions and decreased responsiveness and he was sent to [**Location (un) 620**] for evaluation.
Pt was noted at the time to be somnolent and had a fixed right pupil.
He had a CT scan which revealed a temporal lobe mass and 1 cm midline shift.
Pt is being transferred here for evaluation of intracranial mass.
Cx-ray revealed aspiration pneumonia.
He was evaluated by the neurosurgical service for evaluation of his right temporal lobe mass and midline shift, and the patient declined further neurological surgery.
Decadron 6 mg IV q 6 hours was recommended until clarification of goals of care   Past Medical History: Metastatic Nasopharyngeal carcinoma- extensive chemotherapy and radiation trials, first diagnosed in [**2142**], see below Positive PPD Hypothyoridism Decreased vision and ptosis on the right Decreased hearing on the right Steroid myopathy.
Pertinent Results: DIAGNOSTICS: At [**Location (un) 620**] Cx-ray: Right middle lobe infiltrate .
CT head 3.6 x 3.5 mass in right middle cranial fossa with external vasogenic edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo male with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma s/p failure of chemo and radiation now admitted with MS changes secondary to midline shift secondary to brain metastases.
Brain mets: There were no clinical changes since admission.
There were thought to be likely secondary to intracranial mass and midline shift.
LE dopplers on HD#2 showed no DVTs b/l.
On HD#7, patient experienced another episode of desaturation and tachypnea resolving with suction.
CXR showed left patchy opacities and effusion that were new.
There was no white count.
By end of HD#11, patient had increasing frequency of respiratory distress episodes and decreasing saturations (70 - 80%) despite suctioning and nebulizer treatments nearly q2hrs.
On HD#11, overnight patient had agonal breathing and sats in the 50-70s with RR in the 20s.
# Leukocytosis: Initially thought to be a likely steroid effect (given decadron at OSH) than active infection.
Source for potential infection includes respiratory (though with resolving pna) versus recurrent J tube site infection (see below).
Patient remained afebrile throughout hospital stay.
# Feculent material in G/J tube/abdominal distension: patient continued to have drainage and blocking from G/J tube throughout the admission.
No fistulization or malpositioning on imaging.
Overview: malpositioning ruled out by radiologic studies, fluoro showed movement of contrast into lumen without leakage.
No evidence of acute bowel pathology on CT scan from [**7-10**] or KUB.
Per surgery, the tube was in the right place is most likely not the cause of abdominal distension.
# Exacerbation of anemia - HCT fluctuating 26 - 32 over past week, now at 26 x2d.
Some bloody material draining from the J-tube site and pt had large guaic pos bm x1.
# Pain - Pt.
continueed to localize abdominal pain only.
Fentanyl patch 100 mcg and IV morphine to 4-8mg Q2h were used for pain control.
No morphine drop as per HCP as of HD#8.
# Hyponatremia - 133, Urine osm > 200, patient euvolemic.
Due to further deterioration of patient's status and terminal condition, by HD#7, it agreed that no tube feeding (J tube not working) or TPN will be adminstered.
Pain controll with IV moprhine and GI comfort will be primary considerations as was treatment of the PNA.
By HD#11, due to continued exacerbation of respiratory distress, the patient was made comfort measures only after discussion with HCP and patient's wife.
