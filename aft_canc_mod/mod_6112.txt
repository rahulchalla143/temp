Admission Date:  [**2184-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-4-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-5-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**] Chief Complaint: Epistaxis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICA stenting Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 55 year-old Cantonese-speaking man with known aggressive nasopharyngeal carcinoma who presents with epistaxis.
He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Heme Onc for nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed in [**8-/2183**] after one year of right-sided headache, diplopia, fatigue, and 20-pound weight loss.
Imaging showed nasopharyngeal carcinoma involving the bilateral prevertebral and veli palatini muscles, right foramen ovale, right cavernous sinus, right Meckel cave, and right orbital apex, right infratemporal fossa and carotid space, right petrous apex, and clivus.
He has since undergone XRT, cyberknife, and 3 cycles of cisplatin/5-FU with stable findings on his most recent MRI nasopharynx on [**2184-3-17**] and decreased FDG avidity of his nasopharyngeal mass on his PET-CT on [**2184-4-12**].
He was in his USOH until this evening at 10pm when he awoke with significant bleeding from nares.
He subsequently began coughing vs. vomiting bright red blood.
EKG showed sinus tach @ 101 and no ischemic changes.
CXR and CT chest showed peribronchovascular distribution of ground glass opacity c/w aspiration.
CT neck showed blood filling the nares and nasopharynx without active arterial extravasation.
Prior to transfer, he was hypotensive into the 70s and was given a total of 2L NS and 4 units of pRBC.
Access is via 2 18g PIV; has also has an unaccessed portacath.
The patient was a passenger and complained of mild headache and neck pain afterwards although experienced no loss of consciousness, dizziness, or bleeding; CT head and neck w/o contrast at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] negative for bleed or fracture.
Past Medical History: Probable T4bN0/1M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma as above.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T 97.6, P 86, BP 101/76, RR 13, O2sat 100% on PC 26/25/10/50% General: Intubated, sedated HEENT: Pupils 3mm and reactive, crusted blood in bilateral nares and oropharynx with tumor visualized eroding into posterior nasopharynx with no active bleeding on ENT scope, ETT and OGT present Neck: Supple, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: Foley present Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Neck: Supple, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation BL, no wheezes, no rales CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Soft, mild TTP in epigastrim, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, Ext: Right groin site mild echhymosis and TTP, no bruit C/D/I.
Imaging: ======== CT neck: Interval intubation and NG tube placement with mottled air and fluid density compatible with hemorrhage filling the nares and nasopharynx.
There is a similar appearance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma as described on the [**2184-3-17**] MR accounting for differences in imaging technique, and if further evaluation for potential tumor progression is desired, MR is recommended.
Extensive aspiration, with hematoma seen within the tracheobronchial tree.
CXR: Central distribution of alveolar opacity consistent with aspiration, in this case of blood.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically indicated.
Increased blood in the nasopharynx.
Persistent blood or inspissated secretions in the paranasal sinuses.
The known nasopharyngeal tumor and posttreatment changes are not well evaluated on this exam.
Unchanged bilateral opacification of the mastoid air cells.
Decreased FDG avidity in nasopharyngeal mass consistent with response to therapy.
Although a GI malignancy is unlikely to appear over the course of 6 months, this focus of FDG avidity should be correlated with any recent sigmoidoscopy or coloscopy.
EKG: Sinus tach at 101 bpm, no ST-T changes, faster rate but otherwise consistent with prior ECG from [**2184-1-12**].
In this patient with known nasopharyngeal cancer, there has been mild interval decrease in the right nasopharyngeal mass lesion.
Stable intracranial extension of the mass into the cavernous sinus via direct extension and perineural spread, as detailed above.
Multiple new embolic infarcts seen throughout the right cerebral hemisphere and the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Stable abnormal signal in the clivus and right lateral mass of C1, concerning for tumor extension.
Extensive paranasal sinus disease, as described above  Brief Hospital Course: 55-year-old man with nasopharyngeal carcinoma s/p chemoradiation presented with epistaxis and admitted to the MICU and found to have right cartid perforation now s/p carotid artery stent placement by interventinoal radiology.
Hospital course was complicated by dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia and right upper extremity DVT.
# Epistaxis / Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: patient has history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma presenting with epistaxis.
He was taken for angio graphy which showed a pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the petrous and cavernous portion of the distal right ICA.
Post-procedure there was concern for possibility of hemorrhagic stroke and CT head was done which did not show any new infarcts.
ENT examined patient with laryngoscopy/nasoscopy, findings were incrased blood in nasopharynx, erosion of right medial clivus and medial margin of right petrous carotid canal unchanged.
It is likely that tumor or mass effect eroded into ICA wall and subsequently regressed, causing bleeding without visualized mass.
Patient had a bronchoscopy with removal of blood (no clots of active bleeding seen), and subsequently successfully extubated on [**4-20**].
Repeat MRI shows interval decrease in size of nasopharyngeal disease with stable encacement of right carotid, invasion of foramen ovale/rotundum.
# Aspiration pneumonia: Patient was febrile to 102 on [**4-19**] and chest xray was obtained which showed infiltrate consistent with aspiration.
He was treated with 8 days of unasyn and remained afebrile for the remainder of hospital course.
# Dysphagia: Following extubation patient had dysphagia and was observed to aspirate while eating.
Speech and swallow was consulted who initially recommended nectar thick liquids and no solids.
He was instructed to return to the hospital if dysphagia worsens.
Dysphagia is likely related to a combination of intubation and instrumentation in a patient with a history of XRT therapy.
# Ischemic infarcts: MRI obtained to evaluate nasopharyngeal carcinoma showed apparently new right sided ishcemic infarcts, no new neurological deficits were noted.
Infarcts are likely related to manipulation of carotid artery.
# Right upper extremity DVT: Patient developed right arm pain and R>L upper extremity swelling at the site of an infiltrated peripheral IV.
Ultrasound showed non-occlusive DVT involving the axillary and brachial veins.
# Hypotension: likely in setting of acute bleed.
No fevers or leukocytosis to suggest sepsis initially though patient did spike temperature to 102 after bleeding episode which was thought to be in setting of aspiration.
WBC increased to 12 from admission likely due to aspiration of blood and possible pneumonia, started on unasyn as above for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
He underwent MRI to evaluate progression of disease which showed interval decrease in size of nasopharyngeal disease with stable encacement of right carotid, invasion of foramen ovale/rotundum.

Secondary diagnosis Anemia due to acute blood loss Aspiration pneumonia Nasopharyngeal cardinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: As you know, you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] for severe bleeding from your throat.
We believe that the bleeding began as a result of the tumor in your head.
You developed a blood clot in your right arm and were treated with warm compresses to the right arm.
You had difficulty swallowing and were seen by our swallowing specialists.
It was determined that a small amount of food and liquid goes down the windpipe when you swallow which places you at risk for aspiration and infection.
We recommend regular consistency liquids, and solid foods cut in to small bite sized pieces however even with this diet, there remains the possbility that you will continue to aspirate a small amount of food and may develop an infection.
If you develop worsening difficulty swallowing or fevers, please return to the hospital for evaluation.
