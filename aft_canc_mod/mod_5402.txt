While no definite enhancement is seen to suggest an alternative diagnosis for the foramen magnum lesion, such as a meningioma or leukemic deposit, after discussing the case with the attending neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25918**], consideration for a followup MR study using gadolinium enhancement was suggested, as well as consideration for standard catheter cerebral angiography.

Neuro:  OSH head CT negative for bleed however, head CT in ED showed regions of subarachnoid hemorrhage at the left cervicomedullary junction (level of foramen magnum) and bilateral posterior temporal lobes.
Additionally, there was a intra-ventricular hemorrhage within the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
CTA head showed a 1mm sessile aneurysm from the anterior communicating artery and minor atherosclerotic calcifications involving the distal left internal carotid artery, immediately proximal to the carotid foramen.
Differential diagnosis included meningioma or leukemic deposit, after discussing the case with the attending neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], consideration for a followup MR study using gadolinium enhancement was suggested, as well as standard catheter cerebral angiography.

Furthermore, he was told that his work-up was not completed and that he still needed an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and that neuro-oncology was asked to evaluate him.
If you have any worsening headaches, weakness, falls, change in mental status or any other worrying symptoms, please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency room.
Patient will need repeat conventional cerebral angiogram in 3 weeks to re-evaluate for etiology of subarachnoid bleed.
