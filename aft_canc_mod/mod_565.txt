in [**2087**], last CD4 on [**2103-6-13**] = 22 w/ VL 891,000, on intermittent HAART, last started on [**2103-6-15**]), EtOH abuse, anal HPV, and recent admission from [**2103-6-12**] - [**2103-6-21**] for malaise and weakness who was admitted [**2103-7-9**] for altered mental status and mechanical fall at home and was found to be pancytopenic.
The patient reported that he was feeling well at rehab/home and did not have any specific complaints but on [**7-9**] he had a mechanical fall and was thought to be more confused by his home VNA so he was brought into the hospital.
Denied head strike or head/back pain from fall, stated that he felt weak and just collapsed at 1pm.
History difficult to take due to his mental status, proxy contact attempted but no answer, left message to call back for ICU consent and further hx taking.
Of note, during his earlier admission in [**Month (only) **] for AMS, had an unremarkable LP and MRI, was labeled as HIV dementia.
Past Medical History: #HIV/AIDS--CD4-57/4%, VL [**Numeric Identifier 14614**] on [**2101-10-5**], not on meds since then; Nadir CD4 57 prior to [**5-/2103**] admit, no documented thrush or CMV in past Prior treatment includes: LAM/ZDV/EFV, ?NFV;  TDF/FTC with FD LPV/r (started [**2096-11-26**], stopped [**2096-12-19**] due to diarrhea but restarted by [**1-3**], discontinued by [**7-/2097**]);  TDF/FTC and ATV/r (started [**7-/2098**], self-discontinued [**12/2098**]) RPR non-reactive [**2099-5-5**].
Physical Exam: Admission PE: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear, no visible signs of thrush Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Good air movement b/l, +wet crackles at R base CV: Sinus tach, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: LE equal [**5-17**], UE equal [**5-17**].

Imaging: CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
MRI Head: Prominence of ventricles and sulci consistent with global cerebral atrophy given the history of HIV/AIDS.
Few T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
CT chest [**7-11**]:Multifocal ground-glass pulmonary abnormality is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 14617**] terms of extent, but in the setting of severe neutropenia it could indicate relatively widespread and serious infection, including pathogenic bacteria aswell as viral infection.
Pneumocystis is less likely because of therelatively small voluem of pulmonary involvement.
Pulmonary hemorrhage is analternative explanation for the lung findings.
Widespread adenopathy, more significant for number and distribution than size, is more likely HIV related than lymphoma although abdominal adenopathy and splenomegaly are considerable.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2103-7-13**]: Multiple ill-defined hepatic hypodensities without appreciable enhancement, and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy.
These findings may be compatible with infiltrative hepatic lymphoma, and a lesion in the lower aspect of segment [**Doctor First Name **] may be amenable to percutaneous biopsy as long as the hemangioma in that segment is avoided.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Very small pericardial effusion.
Path: SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: DIFFUSE INVOLVEMENT BY NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA (DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA).
Erythrocytes are decreased in numbers, and exhibit moderate anisopoikilocytosis with polychromatophils, echinocytes, dacrocytes, and rare red cell fragments.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 1.3 cm bone biopsy diffusely infiltrated with large cells with moderate amounts of pink cytoplasm, irregularly shaped nuclei with clumpy chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.
No residual marrow elements are appreciated.
CD3 highlights admixed T-cells.
Overall, the findings are consistent with involvement by a high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] CD5 positive large cell lymphoma).
In the bone marrow, a few scattered [**Last Name (un) **] positive cells provides sufficient evidence that this lymphoid proliferation is EBV driven.
B cells demonstrate a double (Kappa and Lambda) positive light chain population.
These abnormal B-cells are present in the blast window.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by an abnormal population of B-cells that are CD5-positive and seen within the blast window.
The findings are consistent with the B-cell lymphoma recently diagnosed in the marrow.

He was initially transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension (FAST negative).
Hospital course has been notable for lymphoma diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy, BAL with negative PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and urine with positive histo ag, prolonged pancytopenia, and hypotension.
Labs showed acutely worsened anemia with Hct of 18.7 - stool was brown, guiaic +.
He was given 2U PRBC + 2L IVF in ED along with Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He later triggered several times for hypotension, but was asymptomatic during these episodes.
A cosyntropin stimulation test diagnosed adrenal insufficiency, likely from [**Hospital1 **] therapy and possible HIV.
#Anemia: GI was consulted for acute anemia and guiaic+ stool, they recommended inpatient EGD/colonoscopy after further stabilization.
Pt remained pancytopenic and required high number of transfusions, likely secondary to underlying lyphoma, and also ambisome that pt was put on.
Transfusion requirement tapered down after ambisome was stopped.
#Lymphoma: Patient  had a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate pancytopenia which was a dry tap and pathology with  diffuse large B-cell lyphoma, Bcl-2 +, Bcl-6 +, and CD10 negative.
The hypodense liver lesions were thought to be [**2-14**] lymphoma and liver biopsy was deferred given risk of bleeding with patient?????
However, he then started having fevers once again, and a second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] was administered starting [**2103-8-19**], and was well-tolerated.
Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given improvement with hydration via NS.
#Fever: Initially differential included infectious vs neoplastic processes primarily.
CT imaging was notable for patchy ground glass opacities, hepatomegaly with hypodense liver lesions, splenomegaly and diffuse adenopathy.
Patient was isolated for TB and was empirically treated for PCP with prednisone and Bactrim (prednisone for transient hypoxia/[**Doctor First Name **]) until BAL was negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] cxs were unremarkable, but given degree of immunosuppression patient was empirically treated for bacterial pneumonia with Vancomycin/Zosyn/Levofloxacin for a 14 day course.
In regards to TB, Quantiferon gold was indeterminate but a [**Name10 (NameIs) **] culture from [**7-17**] was positive for acid-fast bacilli.
Fevers from lymphoma vs infectious, but had resolved by mid [**Month (only) 205**].
Upon recovery of his coutns following cycle 1 of [**Hospital1 **], he started having fevers once again.
Chest X-ray was unclear regarding possible pneumonia as a source of fevers, and he was initially started on antibiotics.
However, repeat chest X-rays did not supprot a diagnosis of pneumonia, and the patient clinically had no evidence of chest pathology.
Fevers were then thought to be due to malignancy.
LP did not demonstrate bacterial infection and viral CSF work up was deferred by recommendation of ID team given recent negative work up in early [**Month (only) **].
An MRI head demonstrated significant brain atrophy and large ventricles but no evidence of CNS lymphoma.
# Hypokalemia: pt had a persistant hypokalemia in the middle to end of [**Month (only) 205**].
This was thought to be secondary to ambisome therapy, which has a high incidence of electrolyte abnormalities.
Work-up revealed high levels of renal pottasium wasting.
If hypokalemia does not resolve, he may have an underlying RTA.
#Thrombocytopenia:  Patient was found to be thrombocytopenic since admission.
Patient also became refractory to platelet transfusions, and an anti-platelet antibody screen was found to be positive.

Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted after a fall with fevers and confusion.
Your fever was thought to be secondary to an infectious process and you were treated with antibiotics after which your temperature normalized.
We tested you for tuberculosis and found that that you do not have it.
A fungal infection (histoplasma) was found in your urine and we treated you with antibiotics.
You also had low blood counts and a bone marrow biopsy was done to investigate the cause.
A lumbar puncture was done to determine whether or not you had disease in the fluid and you were empirically treated with injection of a chemotherapy [**Doctor Last Name 360**] into the spinal fluid.
You were treated for the lymphoma with intravenous chemotherapy.
You also had low blood pressure, and were diagnosed with adrenal insuffiency, for which you will need to take a steroid.
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3237**] if you have not heard from them by Monday afternoon, or if you have any other questions.
