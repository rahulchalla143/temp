Pain is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] of Cardiology referred the patient to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery in the setting of brain metastasis and the question of the risk of bleeding during Heparinization and go on cardiac bypass of surgery.
Coronary artery disease.
Lung cancer with brain metastasis.
ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, the patient did complain of worsening distance vision, no dysphagia.
He did also state that he had shortness of breath with angina, no palpitations, and heartburn since he had been on steroids, no melena, or hematochezia.
He had no nocturia.
He did state that he had bilateral lower extremity weakness at the end of the day with right greater than left, no known varicosities, and histories of CVA or TIA.
Heart was regular, rate, and rhythm without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
He had positive bowel sounds with benign abdominal examination.
He had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ordered a MRI and the Cardiac team is waiting for the results to assist in assessing the bleeding risk of the metastases and to determine whether or not he was a surgical candidate for coronary vascularization.
On [**12-2**], the patient underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with a mediastinal lymph node dissection upon the discovery of enlarged nodes when his chest was open, and the patient also had intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the operating room for hemodynamic instability.
Consultation during was also obtained during Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] of Thoracic Surgery.
On postoperative day two, the patient was doing fairly well, had to restart his Neo-Synephrine over the prior evening due to some hypotension.
His balloon was removed with no evidence of any groin hematoma.
On the 26th, the patient was reintubted during the evening for hypoxemia with a pO2 of 47 secondary to thick and copious tracheobronchial secretions.
He was bronched at the same time in the unit which showed nonpurulent thick secretions and no collapse of his airways.
He was bronched again on the [**12-5**] for copious mucoid secretions in the left upper lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe.
The patient did have some symptoms of right leg, arm, and face weakness and right foot numbness with a likely ACA stroke or hemorrhage in the left parasagittal metastatic lesion.

His right sided paresis with increased weakness continued.
He was also seen by Neurosurgery, who recommended continuing his IV decadron and Dilantin, and patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] about the possibility of having surgery to remove the metastatic lesion in his brain, which was discussed with the patient.
His left apical pneumothorax was stable.
He was seen daily by the Stroke Service with noted improvement on the 31st in his right facial droop and his right upper extremity arm weakness now increased to [**5-14**] for strength.
He had an approximately [**4-14**] right leg strength.

Lung cancer with brain metastases.
Right sided paresis.
