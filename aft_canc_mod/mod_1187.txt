Admission Date:  [**2162-5-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2162-6-8**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 203**] Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post nephrectomy and Intensive Care Unit stay, transfer for cardiac catheterization  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 89-year-old female who is status post a nephrectomy on [**2162-5-24**] for renal cell carcinoma.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course after nephrectomy was complicated by an episode of unstable angina while on the surgical floor with increased troponin to 7.3.
The patient experienced a retroperitoneal bleed requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells as transfusion, as well as reversal of anticoagulation.
On transfer, the patient was without complaints.
She did complain of mild shortness of breath, but denied cough, chest pain, chest pressure, had a good appetite, was slightly thirsty, was denying any urinary symptoms.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**] with left internal mammary artery to LAD, saphenous vein graft to PDA, saphenous vein graft to OM, status post myocardial infarction in [**2161-10-19**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the saphenous vein graft and RCA.
Status post cerebrovascular accident with no residual deficits.
Breast cancer status post right mastectomy in [**2147**].
Norvasc 10 mg po qd  ALLERGIES:  MORPHINE SULFATE, THE PATIENT GETS HYPOTENSIVE AND EXPERIENCES NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
PERCOCET, THE PATIENT GETS NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL:  The patient was a pleasant female in no apparent distress.
There was no erythema or exudate.
LUNGS:  There was decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, otherwise lungs were clear to auscultation.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, 3/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
No rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, some right lower quadrant tenderness, good bowel sounds, no guarding, no rebound.
EXTREMITIES:  1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
Chest x-ray from [**5-30**] showed increasing left sided pleural effusion and a left retrocardiac opacity.
CT of the abdomen showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate ascites and a hematoma 12 x 7 cm abutting the kidney in the retroperitoneal area.
Echocardiogram from [**2162-5-26**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction greater than 50%, at least mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Echocardiogram from the outside hospital was read as some evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
There was a known RCA occlusion that was not engaged or imaged.
Subsequently, the patient started to have an increased oxygen requirement up to approximately 4 liters to keep O2 saturations between 92% and 94%.
Chest x-ray was performed which showed pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.
For the patient's hypertension, hydralazine was started instead of an ACE inhibitor, given the fact that she had recently had a dye load, as well as one kidney removed, as well as diuresis.
PULMONARY:  Given the fact that the patient had these immune pleural effusions of unclear etiology, initially the thought was to try and tap the pleural effusions.
The family requested that the interventional pulmonology service perform the tap, however, they were unavailable at the time and subsequently, by the time they were available, repeat chest x-ray showed a decrease in the size of the effusion and the family requested that if it was not completely necessary that no further invasive diagnostic testing be done at the family's request.
Given the fact the pleural effusions had improved in size with diuresis, it was felt most likely they were related to congestive heart failure in the setting of diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation and a fluid load prior to cardiac catheterization.
HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient did not require any blood transfusions while on the medicine service here while on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].
The patient's hematocrit was checked [**Hospital1 **] after the cardiac catheterization since she was heparinized for the cardiac catheterization and the patient's hematocrit remained stable.
The patient was previously on Coumadin prior to admission for this history of a cerebrovascular accident, however given the fact that the patient had recently had a retroperitoneal bleed while being on anticoagulants, it was felt that the risk/benefit ratio would favor holding the Coumadin.
It was felt that this would also have antiplatelet activity to prevent cerebrovascular accidents and would be adequate  4.
The dose of the Zestril should be titrated up as blood pressure, potassium and creatinine tolerate and the hydralazine should be titrated down.
Renal cell cancer, status post left nephrectomy 2.
