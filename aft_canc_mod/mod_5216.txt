Admission Date:  [**2168-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-9-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-2-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: brain mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right craniotomy for brain tumor PICC line placed   History of Present Illness: 51 yo M h/o R-sided brain mass, first documented by CT [**2168-5-16**], presented to the ED of [**Hospital6 **] c/o n/v x 2 days.
Also c/o 3 days of decreased left sided strength.
Denies h/o trauma, headache, vision changes, double vision, and photophobia.
Drift could not be assessed due to left sided weakness.
As noted on the head CT examination, there is a large space-occupying mass lesion involving the right frontoparietal lobe measuring 6.3 x 5.5 cm and resulting in significant surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal effacement.
There is a second lesion involving the right posterior parietal lobe seen slightly inferior to the larger mass lesion which demonstrates mostly cystic characteristics and could be necrotic in nature.
There is vasogenic edema extending into the right temporal lobe from this lesion.
Significant mass effect is seen over the right lateral ventricle with left-sided subfalcine herniation.
The mass enhances heterogeneously following intravenous gadolinium administration.
The findings are suggestive of either metastatic disease or a primary neoplastic process such as glioblastoma multiforme.
There is mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricle indicating possible obstruction at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] due to the midline shift present.
There is also significant compression of the third ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal mass lesion involving the right frontoparietal lobe with a second heterogeneously enhancing lesion involving the right posterior parietal lobe.
Both lesions demonstrate significant surrounding vasogenic edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation of the brain.
In addition, there is early uncal herniation and effacement of the posterior quadrigeminal cistern.
Left-sided ventricular dilatation is seen due to compression of the third ventricle.
The right middle cerebral artery circulation is displaced anteriorly.
There is a prominent portion of the right posterior division of the MCA which is seen draped along the anterior aspect of the mass.
No intracranial vascular stenosis or occlusions are present.
IMPRESSION: Displacement of the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries by the presence of the mass and subfalcine herniation as noted on the brain MRI report and the previously dictated CT report of the brain.
Prominent posterior division of the right MCA is noted abutting the anterior aspect of the parietal mass.
There is a moderate amount of air and fluid within the scalp.
There is interval decrease in amount of pneumocephalus when compared to prior study.
There is continued severe edema involving the white matter in the right frontal and parietal lobes.
The edema appears to be slightly more prominent than the prior studies.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o DVT, please do bilateral exam HISTORY: 51-year-old man with fever of unknown origin and long hospital stay.
Intraluminal thrombus is not identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with fever 103 - s/p crani REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o aspiration - pt coming down for stat head CT sp fall - please coordinate AP CHEST, 1:43 P.M., [**9-5**].
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-29**]:  Lung volumes have improved and right lower lobe consolidation has cleared.
No pleural abnormality.
Also c/o 3 days of decreased left sided strength.
Denies h/o trauma, headache, vision changes, double vision, and photophobia.
The pt did have an incidence of confusion x2.
Pt with fevers- cultures grew out pseudomonas in his blood and urine.
Be aware of high salt load in zosyn; watch for fluid overload in [**Last Name (un) 8114**] pt with renal failure.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: brain tumor   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Please call the office or come to the hospital for any changes in mental status, weakness or seizure activity.
Please call the office or come to the emergency room for excessive redness from wound, drainage or fever >101.5.
