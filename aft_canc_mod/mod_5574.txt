Final Report INDICATION:  67-year-old male with anemia and cecal mass.
Evaluate for metastatic disease.
No axillary, supraclavicular, hilar, or mediastinal pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present.
Nonspecific ground-glass opacities are seen in the left upper lobe (3:29).
No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum is seen.
ABDOMEN:  The liver is normal without focal or diffuse abnormality.
A 2.1-cm non-enhancing soft tissue density (73 [**Doctor Last Name **]) lesion within the gallbladder neck is compatible with a non-calcified calculus or sludge ball, although a focal adenomyoma may have a similar appearance.
Bilateral hypodense renal lesions, measuring up to 1.4 cm in the left kidney and 1.2 cm in right kidney, are compatible with simple renal cysts.
A small hiatal hernia is present.
The small and large bowel enhance homogeneously and have a normal course.
There is asymmetrical wall thickening of the cecum (3:86), compatible with a cecal mass, which is better characterized on endoscopy.
No other retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
No free abdominal fluid, pneumoperitoneum, or abdominal wall hernia.
No omental or peritoneal nodularity is seen.
A small amount of free non-hemorrhagic pelvic fluid is present.
No inguinal hernia.
No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Thoracic spine DISH is present with flowing osteophytes along the right aspect of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
There is mild thoracolumbar dextroscoliosis.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy.
Asymmetric wall thickening of the cecum, compatible with known cecal malignancy.
Rounded 10-mm right lower quadrant lymph node is suspicious for metastatic involvement.
Small non-hemorrhagic free pelvic fluid is present, unusual for this gender and age group.
There is no other evidence for peritoneal or omental metastases.
Small nonspecific left upper lobe ground-glass opacities, compatible with an infectious or inflammatory process.
Brief Hospital Course: Reason for Hospitalization: 67M with DM and HTN who presents with severe anemia, found to have normal EGD.
Believed to have slow LGIB, likely from colonic polyp or malignancy.
Active Issues: # Anemia: The patient was originally admitted for blood tranfusion following a finding of Hct 18 at PCP office and EGD negative for acute bleed.
His anemia was thought to be due to a slow GI bleed given his gradual weight loss and worsening weakness/lightheadedness.
On [**2143-7-23**] a colonoscopy was performed which showed a 5cm bleeding cecal mass.
A CT torse was done for staging, showing no obvious mets, but some fluid in the pelvis and an enlarged LN concerning for metastasis.
He was discharged with VNA services and instructions to have Hct checks q48-72 hours and frequent vital signs checks.
# Fever and tachycardia: One day prior to discharge, the patient developed fever and tachycardia.
He was pan-cultured and had a chest XR done showing no acute process.
It would tend to occur following his transfusions, accompanied by elevated platelets.
This was thought to be due to bone marrow reaction versus infection.
He was treated empirically for infection as above.
#Abscess: Pt presented with chronic, draining R buttock abscess.
It was nontender with no fluctuance or induration on exam.
The fluid was cultured, growing coag positive staph aureus and mixed flora.
- Levaquin for 5 days for possible CAP - Follow up cecal mass biopsies - Trend Hct, transfuse as necessary - Follow up blood cultures   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Anemia 2.
Cecal mass  Secondary diagnoses: 1.
Diabetes 2.
Hypertension 3.
