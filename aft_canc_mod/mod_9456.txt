Name:  [**Known lastname 14848**], [**Known firstname 14849**]                     Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 14850**]  Admission Date:  [**2198-10-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2198-10-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2136-9-25**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 1098**] MEDICINE  ADDENDUM:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to the pleura, pericardium, and ocular, stage IV, diagnosed in [**2198-9-4**], who is status post her second therapeutic thoracentesis on [**2198-10-5**] when an outpatient echocardiogram revealed tamponade.
The patient had a history of increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for the past month.
She had two therapeutic thoracentesis to her right side as an outpatient and once again on [**2198-10-5**] was found to have pericardial tamponade by an outpatient echocardiogram.
She had pulses of [**9-18**], no JVD and [**12-6**]+ lower extremity edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA AND X-RAYS ON ADMISSION:  EKG revealed sinus rhythm but diffuse low voltages and increased rate with new electrical alternans consistent with pericardial effusion.
There was a large pericardial effusion of 4.2 cm which appeared circumferential.
There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse which was consistent with impaired filling and tamponade physiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to the CCU, the patient underwent a pericardial tap which revealed around 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid from the pericardium.
There was only a small pericardial effusion measuring about 1 cm inferior to the basal left ventricle and about 0.5 cm lateral to the left ventricle around the left ventricle apex and anterior to the right ventricle.
There was no evidence of diastolic collapse.
The patient continued to have dull pressure over her chest on inspiration and with movement.
A portable chest x-ray obtained on [**2198-10-6**] revealed interval increase in pleural fluid on the right.
An EKG obtained on [**2198-10-6**] revealed sinus rhythm, diffuse low voltages but no electrical alternans.
An ultrasound of the right lower extremity was performed for right lower extremity edema, greater than left, but revealed no evidence of DVT.
An echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricle again with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal RV, and a small pericardial effusion with no evidence of compromise.
A right pleural effusion was again noted.
Also, during this stay, the patient was taken off her Premarin due to the increased risk of clot with her malignancy.
On [**2198-10-8**], an AP and lateral chest x-ray were again obtained which revealed a stable right pleural effusion and a slight increase in a small left-sided effusion.
An EKG again revealed diffuse low voltages and sinus tachycardia.
An echocardiogram performed later that day revealed a small loculated pericardial effusion with fibrin or thrombus on the surface of the heart.
No echogenic signs of tamponade and no significant change from prior study.
She was monitored closely and her blood pressure increased to 100s/70s without intervention.
