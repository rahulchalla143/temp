-[**1-/2164**], bilateral small pulmonary nodules which increased in size; [**2164-3-25**]-biopsy confirmed metastatic squamous cell cancer.
Cycle 5 day 15 of his drugs were held in the setting of grade II mucositis and thrush.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-10-25**] the rate has slowed from 135 to 82 and the rhythm has changed from atrial flutter with 2:1 block to atrial fibrillation.
Known pulmonary metastases.
[**2165-3-20**] CT HEAD - prelim - no acute bleed or sig change from prior  [**2165-3-20**] CTA Chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
No definite evidence of pulmonary embolism, slightly limited by respiratory motion.
Interval increase in size of multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases.
Right basilar pleural thickening and nodularity with a new moderate right pleural effusion, associated with atelectasis and consolidation of the right lower lobe.
Patchy opacities in the right middle and left upper lobes, may be infectious or inflammatory.
[**2165-3-21**] Transthoracic ECHO - The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Substantial biatrial dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] is a 72 year old male with SCC metastatic to left axilla and lung, a fib, HTN, HLD, who presented with shortness of breath and weakness.
# Hypoxia, shortness of breath - Most likely secondary to pleural effusion and pneumonia.
CTA was negative for PE and patient is therapeutic on coumadin for afib.
He was also treated for healthcare associated pneumonia with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin starting on [**3-23**] for a 10 day course that was transitioned to augmentin alone after his levofloxacin dose on [**2165-3-28**].
His shortness of breath improved, however, he remained hypoxic on room air.
A thoracentesis was done and showed an exudative effusion.
Pleural fluid was sent for cytology and this was pending at the time of discharge, gram stain had 4+ PMNs, no organisms.
# Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter - On admission the patient was placed on shorter acting forms of metoprolol and diltiazem due to concern for possible sepsis and hypotension.
# Mucositis and Thrush: Secondary to chemotherapy and improved significantly with course of fluconazole.
# Metastatic SCC: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with metastasis to left axilla (s/p left axillary dissection) and pulmonary nodules.
Pt recieved oxycodone for pain, ativan for anxiety and magic mouthwash for mucositis.
# HTN:  well controlled on diltiazem and metoprolol .
# Gout: Continued allopurinol .
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for anxiety, insomnia.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: bacterial pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because of shortness of breath and low oxygen in your blood.
We thought this was from pneumonia and treated you with antibiotics.
You also had a lot of fluid around your lungs that could be from pneumonia or from your cancer.
