# Chronic Pancreatitis: Patient's CT abdomen showed evidnece of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst.
She had some diarrhea, which improved with uptitration of her pancreatic enzymes, and this can be continued to be increased as her po intake improves.
# Fever: Unclear etiology; possibly due to pancreatitis vs PNA, as CXR and CT chest concerning for BL PNA.
The patient was covered broadly w/Vanc, Zosyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia and will need to complete a 10 day course.
# Anemia: Pt had guiac + stools at OSH.
CT consistant with esophageal varicies.
# Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to cirrhosis.
A lactulose enema was given on admission with no improvement.
Imaging with evidence of diffuse anasarca, large amount of acites and chronic pancreatic changes.
No evidence of acute withdrawal.
Now holding benzos due to mental status.
# Stage I coccygeal ulcer: wound care consulted.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis vs HCAP Chronic pancreatitis with pseudocysts with flare Malnutrition, started on TPN Mental status change, multifactorial   Discharge Condition: FAIR   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to another hospital with nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain secondary to your pancreatitis flare.
While you were at the other hospital, you received pain meds that caused you to be sedated and you may have aspirated and developed a pneumonia.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], you had low oxygen levels and you were admitted to the intensive care unit.
You were found to have a pneumonia and were started on antibiotics, which you will complete for 10 days.
While you recovered, you tolerated some oral foods, so it is possible that the TPN can be stopped in a short time if you can take enough nutrition by mouth.
