Admission Date:  [**2188-8-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-7-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**] Chief Complaint: nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: This is a 59 year old Chinese woman with minimal known past medical history who initially presented yesterday ([**8-5**]) with four days of naseau and vomiting and no bowel movements.
She stopped working afterwards, and later developed a productive cough, which gradually worsened in the past month.
There was no hemoptysis.
In the past week, patient developed shortness of breath, malaise, and could only ambulate to the bathroom.
Her family also endorsed night sweats in the past week, and an 8lbs weight loss in the past 2 weeks.
During workup in the ED she had a CXR which showed a large cardiac silloute and fluid overload with possible RML infection.
Her EKG showed diffusely low voltages but no ST depressions.
LFTs showed mild transaminitis (60s) with alk phos 120 with dir bili 0.6. .
On the second day, an RUQ ultrasound in the ED showed a possible pancreatic head mass (otherwise negative).
Surgery recommended an abdominal CTA with pancreatic protocol to further evaluate.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, bilateral crackle / rhonchi Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: CNs II-XII intact.
GEN: Patient was lying flat in bed in no acute distress or pain.
Pulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Skin: No rashes or bruising Neuro: CNs II-XII intact.
No cholelithiasis or evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Possible pancreatic lesion.
Correlate with nonemergent pancreatic CT or MRI.
# [**8-5**], Portable CXR FINDINGS: There are diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.
There is a markedly tortuous aorta.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are evident.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Excessive volume overload likely due to cardiogenic etiology.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
In particular, there is slight confluent opacity in the right perihilar region which likely reflects confluent edema; however, an underlying pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
There is a large pericardial effusion which ranges in size from 2.4 to 3.5 cm.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-6**], the large pericardial effusion has resolved.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trivial pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Right lower lobe mass with centrilobular nodules and interlobular septal thickening is concerning for primary lung malignancy with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Small, malignant pericardial effusion following percardiocentesis.
No tamponade.
Lytic metastasis, D11 vertebral body with invasion of the spinal canal and impingement on thecal sac anteriorly.
A posterior element lesion is also noted at T4.
At T11, there is marked motion artifact, but suggestion of left sided anterior epidural disease .
There is no significant cord compression or myelomalacia present at this time, however.There is bulging of the posterior vertebral body into the canal and mild compression deformity at this level.
Evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence for osseous metastatic disease.
No epidural disease is seen.
There are multilevel disc bulges.
Posterior element hypertrophy is also present at multiple levels.
IMPRESSION: Osseous metastatic disease at C2, C7, T4 and T11 as described.
At T11, there is mild compression deformity and small amount of epidural tissue, particularly on the left, without significant cord compression at this time.
Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
T wave inversions and poor R wave progression in the anterior precordial leads are consistent with prior anterior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Brief Hospital Course: 59F Chinese immigrant with no significant past medical history admitted with four days of nausea and was noted to have pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p pericardiocentesis with cytology showing adenocarcinoma.
Further workup showed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the spine c/b T11 compression fracture without cord compression.
# Cardiac tamponade secondary to adenocarcinoma: Pt developed shortness of breath, and tachycardia, with a pulsus >20 mmHg on hospital day 2.
CT abdomen showed circumferential fluid in pericardium.
Bedside ECHO showed RV collapse consistent with tamponard physiology.
Due to shortness of breath and inability to lie flat, pt was intubated and sent to cath lab for pericardiocentesis, which drained ~700 cc sanguous fluid.
Post-procedure ECHO showed minimal residue fluid accumulation.
Interval changes measured by ECHO and daily pulsus did not show evidence of reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
Pt remained asymptomatic for the remainder of her hospital course with a baseline pulsus of <14.
# metastatic adenocarcinoma-lung primary: Pt's presenting chest x-ray showed diffuse reticulonodular pattern, concerning for TB, or carcinomatosis.
Of note, both pericardiofluid and BAL showed positive adenocarcinoma on cytology, but negative AFB.
Pathology stain of the pericardiofluid and BAL showed adenocarcinoma of lung primary.
Patient was seen by heme/onc who recommended further outpt testing for typing and an MR head for complete staging.
# Compression fracture at T11 without cord compression.
Spinal MRI was obtained due to patient's complaints of lower back pain.
There was evidence of compression fracture at T11 on both chest CT and spinal MRI, without significant cord compression.
There was also evidence of osseous metastatic disease at C2, C7, and T4.
Pt was evaluted by Neurosurgery, who felt that there was no imminent risk of cord compression.
Tylenol was avoided due to patient's transaminitis.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia: Pt developed fever to 101.6 on hospital day 3.
Chest CT revealed bilateral pleural effusion and density in RLL concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia.
Given patient continued high O2 requirement, and history of cough, the suspicion for pneumonia was high.
BAL, sputum culture, blood culture, urine culture showed no growth.
# Transaminitis Patient presented with transaminitis and indirect bilirubinemia.
No evidence of biliary obstruction was found on abdominal US.
Hepatitis panel was also negative.
Initial DDx include hepatic congestion secondary to cardiac tamponarde or metastasis of adenocarcinoma.
Of note, there was a ~ 7 mm hypoenhancing foci in right hepatic lobe on the abdominal CT, and marked gallbladder wall edema consistent with congestive heart failure.
# Disclosure of medical information Pt initially expressed wishes to disclose medical news to family only, but later wanted to know herself.
Agreement was reached that medical information will be released to patient with presence of her husband for emotional support.
CHRONIC ISSUES # beta thalassemia Patient presented with microcytic anemia, consistent with her reported history of beta thalassemia.
Patient continued to refuse head MRI during hospitalization, which made complete staging of her disease impossible.

You were admitted because of abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation.
You were found to have fluid around your heart (tamponade) which had to be drained to help you breath.
The fluid was found to be caused by a lung cancer, which has spread to your spine and liver.
The cancer has caused a fracture in your lower spine, which is contributing to your pain.
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor, as well as the cancer doctors.
Please call [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8230**]-speaking patient advocate and cancer navigator, for social work questions.
