C-SPINE CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison.
There is no acute cervical spine fracture or subluxation.
Note is made of degenerative changes at multiple levels, centered at C5-6 and facet degeneration and left neural foraminal narrowing at C4-5 and C5-6.
Left upper rib fractures are noted at the first and second ribs.
There is a left apical pneumothorax.
Fractures of the nasal septum and bilateral nasal bone fracture are not well seen on this study.
Right thyroid nodules are noted.
Small hypodense areas and calcification noted in the left submandibular gland.
No acute cervical spine fracture or subluxation.
Degenerative changes with neural foraminal narrowing as described.
Hyperdense material (likely blood) in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx and sinuses as described.
Left upper rib fractures and left apical pneumothorax more completely assessed on subsequently performed chest CT.  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: assess for injury Field of view: 36  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old woman s/p MVC REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for injury CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
FINDINGS: There is small left pneumothorax along the apex and anterior base, with chest tube in place terminating in the apex.
There has been decrease in size of pneumothorax compared to outside study.
No evidence of mediastinal hematoma or pericardial or significant pleural effusion is noted.
Thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified, however, no evidence of acute aortic injury.
Small mediastinal nodes are noted, however, no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is noted.
Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
There is a large calcified granuloma in the left lung base measuring 1 cm.
There is soft tissue contusion overlying the sternum along with a fracture involving the body of the sternum.
A small stepoff is best seen on sagittal reformatted image 39.
A small amount of retrosternal hematoma is noted.
There are multiple rib fractures involving right first, third through seventh anteriorly and left first through third.
ABDOMEN: There is no evidence of free air, free fluid, fluid collection, or bowel dilatation or significant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
The liver is unremarkable without evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilatation or focal liver lesion.
Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and the visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
There is a large exophytic left lower pole simple renal cyst measuring 13 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis.
PELVIS: The visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
There is no ascites or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Marked degenerative changes of pubic symphysis and thoracolumbar spine is noted.
There is no compression deformity of the thoracolumbar spine.
Bilateral rib fractures, sternal fracture with retrosternal hematoma.
Small left sided pneumothorax, with chest tube in place.
Incidentally noted large exophytic left renal cyst.
4-mm noncalcified right middle lobe nodule, if the patient is at low risk for lung cancer, no followup is needed.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: post trach CXR  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old woman with trauma, intubated for respiratory failure.
INDICATION: History of trauma, intubated for respiratory failure.
Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a similar study obtained one day earlier.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Pulmonary vasculature shows slightly more marked perivascular haze and diffuse densities on the bases are again suggestive of moderate amount of bilateral pleural effusion and perhaps slightly more on the right than the left.
No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified.
Successful procedure without evidence of pneumothorax or other complications.
AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
No MR.  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Due to suboptimal quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Cannot reliably assess for presence/absence of left ventricular outflow tract gradient or aortic stenosis due to suboptimal acoustic windows.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess cardiac structure and for valvular disease.
Acute Pain Service consulted for epidural catheter placement given her rib fractures.
Her pain was adequately controlled with this.
She is receiving Tylenol prn; was receiving Fentanyl prn for pain in the Trauma ICU, but will be discharged on prn IV Morphine.
She should be changed to oral narcotics that can be given through her PEG once pain better controlled while at rehab.
Hematology consulted for leukopenia; patient with a long standing history of this and anemia and has been followed by an outside hematologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74124**]) for this.
There was no evidence for leukemic or hematologic malignancy on smear; it was recommended that if her neutrophils and bands were <1000 she should be placed on neutropenic precautions.
She will need to follow up with her hematologist once all of her acute issues are resolved.
A tracheostomy and PEG was placed; she is receiving tube feedings and is tolerating them without difficulties.
Physical therapy was consulted and have recommended acute rehab.
