Interval development of some edema within the posterolateral left chest  wall without focal fluid, possibly due to chronic positioning.
No abdominal or pelvic fluid or hemorrhage to explain this patient's  continuing transfusion requirement.
Some increased stranding and thickening of the subcutaneous tissues and skin adjacent to this patient's left gluteal hematoma.
MRI C SPINE [**2105-12-27**] IMPRESSION: Compared to the study of the previous day, there has been no  significant change in the extent or mass effect of the posterior spinal  epidural hematoma, extending from the C4 to the T3 level, with no evidence of new hemorrhage.
COMMENT: In the absence of significant change in clinical/neurologic status, the utility of daily follow-up MR examinations in this setting is unclear.
The epidural hematoma seen in the lower cervical upper thoracic region has slightly extended inferiorly to T2-T3 level with a small inferior extent now visualized, minimally indenting the thecal sac.
Previously noted degenerative changes are again identified.
CT AB PELVIS [**2105-12-25**] IMPRESSION: Large left buttock hematoma, primarily intramuscular involving the left gluteus maximus muscle with a focal area of active extravasation just posterior to the left superior posterior iliac spine.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Severe multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes, worst at C4-C5 with severe canal stenosis, cord compression, myelomalacia, and bilateral severe neural foraminal narrowing.
Epidural hematoma involving C6-7 to T2-T3, as described above.
CXR [**2106-1-11**]: The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation aside from minimal right basilar linear atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild linear atelectasis at the right base.
No evidence of pneumonia.
ELBOW PLAIN FILM, LEFT  [**2106-1-11**]: No previous images.
Three views show no evidence of acute bone or joint space abnormality.
There is, however, some elevation of the anterior fat pad, suggesting some effusion that could represent blood in the joint space.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 23503**] is a 79 M with a recent diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A (factor VIII inhibitor) who presents with back and left thigh pain who was found to have an epidural hematoma and left gluteus maximus hematoma with active extravasation.
C6-7 to T2-3 Epidural Hematoma: He presented with back pain and was found to have an epidural hematoma related to his acquired hemophilia.
There was no evidence of neurologic compromise on exam.
This was his first significant bleed since his diagnosis, and he was subsequently started on recombinant factor VII infusions to prevent cord compression.
Left Gluteus Maximus Bleed: His CT scan showed evidence of extravasation into left gluteus maximus muscle.
Though the patient developed extensive hematoma and edema over LLE, the pt never developed compartment syndrome, and the hematoma eventually largely absorbed by the time of discharge.
Acquired Hemophilia: He received a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A secondary to factor VIII inhibitor in [**Month (only) **] of [**2105**].
His factor infusions were incrementally spaced apart, however intermittent findings of peripheral bruising delayed weaning at several points during his month-long hospitalization.
It will likely take many months to see a full effect of immunosuppressive therapy.
The patient was instructed at length about the concerning signs and symptoms of bleeds for which he should call the on-call hematology/oncology fellow.
Due to the development of leukopenia thought to be secondary to bactrim, he began atovaquone 1500mg daily for PCP prophylaxis prior to discharge.
Due to persistent hypokalemia requiring daily repletion, he was started on supplementation on discharge.
No evidence of ischemia.
Tachycardia improved with hematocrit stability.
Leukopenia:  He developed leukopenia to 2.5 which was thought to be secondary to bactrim marrow suppression.
The  initial source of bleeding was felt to be from his left gluteus maximus hematoma.
Hypertension:  he was started on lisinopril 5mg daily for hypertension  INACTIVE ISSUES: 9.
Prostate Cancer:  this was diagnosed 3 years ago and is of low volume and grade.
Epidural Hematoma 3.
That is what caused the blood collection around your spine.
START POTASSIUM CHLORIDE  20mEq daily because your steroids are likely causing low potassium 4.
