Admission Date:  [**2190-1-14**]     Discharge Date: [**2190-2-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2138-5-27**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of frontal astrocytoma initially diagnosed and resected in [**Location (un) 9012**] in [**2189-5-24**].
At that point he then underwent XRT in [**Month (only) 205**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], in [**2189-11-24**] on [**11-25**] he had repeat resection of his frontal lesion at [**Hospital1 346**] with Gliadel placement.
He was given pre-op radiation and thus the pathology from the surgical specimen was unrevealing but subcutaneous nodules were positive for malignant histiocytes.
On [**2-3**] he had a right temporal craniotomy, resection of his right temporal lesion and transferred to the floor.
Postoperative course was complicated by seizure on [**2-18**] thought to be secondary to increased intracranial pressure.
Subsequent head CT negative for bleed but suggested recurrence of lesion right frontal lobe.
On [**2-19**] MR showed new right frontal lesion with local edema and midline shift but no evidence of uncal herniation, transferred to the O-Med service on [**2-19**] for chemo with Carboplatin, Cyclophosphamide and VP-16.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for dysuria.
The patient denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or headache.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right frontal malignant astrocytoma diagnosed [**5-24**], status post resection [**5-24**], status post XRT repeat resection with Gliadel wafers placed in [**2189-11-24**] and [**2189-12-24**] new lesion in the right temporal region.
Pathology revealed granular cell tumor.
Postoperative course was also complicated by CSF leak as mentioned in the HPI.
He has diabetes mellitus secondary to steroid use.
He is status post trach and decannulation related to intubation problems with initial surgery in [**Name (NI) 9012**], status post resection of right temporal lesion on [**2190-2-4**].
On [**2190-2-18**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 12785**] [**Last Name (Titles) 35440**] mass right frontal lobe with central lobe intensity, increased size and intensity from [**2-9**].
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21760**] edema resulting in increased shift of midline structures to the left without evidence of uncal herniation.
On [**2-18**] head CT, non contrast, showed no new hemorrhage, massive right frontal and basal ganglia edema.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  51-year-old male with recurrent right frontal lobe tumor, right temporal lobe tumor, status post resection times three.
Course complicated by surgical wound infection and CSF leak, now status post 6 weeks antibiotics for staph.
Repeat imaging showed recurrence of right frontal lesion with [**Month/Year (2) 21760**] edema.
Antibiotics were withheld for the coag negative staph given the five weeks treatment with Vancomycin and the resistance of the coag negative staph to Clindamycin.
