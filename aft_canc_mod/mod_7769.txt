There is moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration, but no pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or other evidence of CHF.
There is linear scarring involving the left mid lung, and minor atelectasis involving that lung base, but no focal consolidation is seen.
There are atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta, without focal aneurysmal dilatation.
There is diffuse osteopenia with anterior wedging of mid thoracic vertebrae and resultant kyphosis, unchanged, with no acute thoracic compression seen.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without CHF or focal consolidation .
CT HEAD - There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Mastoid air cells and the imaged paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or edema.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Abnormal septal motion/position.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-7-6**], the severity of aortic stenosis is slightly increased.
MRI/MRA Head FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
No evidence of territorial infarcts, midline shift or mass effect identified.
Subtle periventricular hyperintensities are identified indicating minimal changes of small vessel disease unchanged from previous study.
Following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement identified.
IMPRESSION: No enhancing brain lesions or acute infarcts identified.
No significant change since [**2129-4-22**].
A fetal right posterior cerebral artery is incidentally noted.
A small distal left vertebral artery is also incidentally noted ending in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a normal variation.
Mild-to-moderate COPD is again noted.
Abnormal interstitial pattern on the current study is attributable to COPD.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is a very small left-sided pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
Soft tissue anchor projects over the right humeral head.
Degenerative change is noted to involve the thoracic spine without evidence of spondylolisthesis or fracture.
Persistent small left basilar atelectasis and left-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 84F h/o atrial fibrillation on warfarin, AS/MR, chronic diastolic CHF, admitted with weakness and worsening positional occipital headache.
# Respiratory distress:  Soon after transfer from the ED to the floor, pt noted R-sided chest pain x 1 hour, then was acutely 'not feeling well.'
Pt noted to be in respiratory distress by the team.
Given initially unclear etiology of patient's hypoxic respiratory failure, EKG was done to r/o possible acute ischemic event; this demonstrated questionable pathology.
Transthoracic [**Year (4 digits) 461**] was obtained and demonstrated new areas of wall hypokinesis at the left and right ventricle.
This new pathology, patient's known medication noncompliance, existing aortic stenosis, and chronic diastolic dysfunction, were considered to be the likely contributors to her acute respiratory decompensation.
Sputum gram stain obtained after intubation demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters, and pt was started empirically on vancomycin for PNA.
# Worsening positional occipital headache/Gait Instability: Pt reported symptoms of lightheadedness on exam with positional change, although orthostatics negative in ED and on floor.
Pt was at her baseline sinus bradycardia with 1st degree AV block, with no pauses on ECG.
CT and MRI head were negative for acute pathology.
Valsartan was considered a possible contributor to her headache and dizziness, and was therefore discontinued in the ICU.
# Weakness - Pt.
On exam she has peripheral neuropathy of both LE extremities.
No history of diabetes.
She has also had recent hospitalization and illness and is likely decompensated from baseline.
#Back Pain: Patient began complaining of left sided thoracic back pain.
EKG did not show new ischemic changes and her cardiac enzymes were negative.
She was later found to have point tenderness just medial to her scapula on her back, and her pain was attributed to musculoskeletal causes.
#Hemoptysis/Epistaxis: Patient began complaining of hemoptysis while in the ICU, thought to be secondary to intubation in setting of elevated INR.
Her hemoptysis and epistaxis persisted on transfer to the floor.
The etiology is felt to be secondary to CHF, in setting of pneumonia, and dry mucosa from increased ipratropium, as she was receiving 6 puffs every 4 hours for six days.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient was previously being treated for diastolic heart failure.
Echo obtained in MICU demonstrated new wall hypokinesis at the left and right ventricles, with depressed ejection fraction at 40-50%.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt had supratherapuetic INR and warfarin was held in the MICU.
# Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: Pt was noted to be anemic with thrombocytosis, both at baseline.
# Hypertension: Pt was noted to be hypertensive during respiratory distress, although it was unclear whether HTN preceded her respiratory decompensation.
Soon after transfer to the ICU she became hypotensive and her valsartan was discontinued.
