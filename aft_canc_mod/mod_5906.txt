Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted, with most evident changes noted at C4-C5 with mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc space, vacuum degeneration, endplate irregularities, and osteophytic spurring.
A shallow posterior disc protrusion is seen at C5-C6.
There is probable degenerative calcification along the undersurface of the atlantodental articulation.
Prominent calcifications of the common carotid bifurcations are noted, atherosclerotic in origin.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
----- CT head without contrast [**2132-3-10**]: Extensive hemorrhage is demonstrated within the left frontal and left temporal lobes with marked mass effect and edema, with left to right subfalcine herniation and uncal/hippocampal herniation, with prominent brainstem compression at the incisura.
A small amount of hemorrhage is also seen in the third and fourth ventricles.
A small left frontal subdural hemorrhage is also demonstrated.
Mild amount of fluid and mucosal thickening is demonstrated within ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Extensive hemorrhage within the left frontal and left temporal lobes, with marked surrounding edema and mass effect, left to right subfalcine herniation, uncal/hippocampal herniation, and intraventricular hemorrhagic extension.
Small left subdural hemorrhage is also noted.
Underlying mass lesion cannot be fully excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 81 year old female with multiple myeloma, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high cholesterol, and congestive heart failure who was found by husband on floor next to bed night of [**3-8**].
She then had slowly worsening mental status during day and by [**2132-3-9**] was confused with slurred speech.
Head CT with large left intracerebral hemorrhage with small left subdural hemorrhage.
Here, repeat head CT looked worse with 6x8 cm left temporal/parietal/frontal bleed with ~2cm midline shift, subfalcine and uncal herniation.
Also, small left subdural hemorrhage.
Exam in am on [**2132-3-10**] showed pupils dilated R>L and non-reactive, no corneals, no gag, no nasal grimace and only mild extensor posturing to pain.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Intracerebral hemorrhage with secondary herniation and brainstem compression.
