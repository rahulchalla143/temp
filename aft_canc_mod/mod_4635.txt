She endorses intermittent hematochezia since [**Month (only) 958**].
She underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2188-8-13**] and was found to have a near obstructing lesion at 10-15cm (distal sigmoid/rectum).

Heterogeneously enhancing, likely malignant mass in the low sigmoid, with upstream fecal loading, suggesting a degree of obstruction.
A 16-mm enhancing right external iliac lymph node and an 11-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule are concerning for metastatic disease.
Multiple small hepatic hypodensities, nonspecific, though warranting attention on followup studies.
No convincing evidence of perforation related to recent sigmoidoscopy.
Fluid density structures with peripheral enhancement measuring up to 2.5 cm at the left aspect of the sigmoid mass may reflect necrosis within the mass.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis.
Locally invasive rectal mass located 10 cm from anal verge with longitudinal dimension of 3.5 cm.
Extensive mesorectal lymphadenopathy with posterior perirectal nodes touching the CRM and right external iliac node consistent with metastasis.
Possible conglomerate of centrally necrotic nodes, superolateral and to the left of the mass measuring 2 x 2.6 cm.
This could also represent a contained collection from localized tumor perforation or necrotic extension of the primary mass.
Diffuse parenchymal opacity has slightly increased on the right.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased on the right and trace on the left.
Associated compressive atelectasis at the right base is noted.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch is present, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Colonoscopy [**2188-8-20**] A near completely obstructing mass was seen at 10 cm from the anal verge consistent with newly diagnosed cancer.
A 3 cm long severe malignant stricture was seen.
Massive liquid stool came out.
