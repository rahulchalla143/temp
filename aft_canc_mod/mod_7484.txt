She describes her abdominal pain as dull, intermittent, and radiating bilaterally across the lower abdomen and pelvis with moderate amount of diarrhea x 1 day.
She also notes mildly increased SOB x 2 days, though she is dyspneic at baseline and says that her SOB waxes and wanes.
Per family, she was recently undergoing dexamethasone taper and her symptoms correlated with this.
She also describes severe pain coming from her right shoulder and lateral neck where she has had ongoing lymph node inflammation x several months.
There was no stridor or wheezes noted on her exam.
She received a CTA given concern for PE for which was negative.
UA showed small leuks and 7 WBCs so given a dose of cipro.
EKG was done given her SOB which showed new infero/lateral ST depressions and TWI in V1-V3, but no chest pain.
Pt received albuterol/ipatropium nebs for her SOB, and then was noted to became stridorous with a hoarse voice (worse than normal).
A/P and lateral neck XRAY obtained showing soft tissue xray of neck shouwed some "indentation" of right side of trachea thought [**3-14**] known enlarged lymph nodes, but no critical stensosis.
Repeat CXR showed new vascular engorgement.
ENT called to scope and found to have unilateral vocal cord paralysis, but no edema (pt reports having history of this at [**Hospital1 **]).
Has mild SOB now but this is c/w her status prior to presentation.
No abd pain, no n/v/d.
VS are 128/72, 85, 96% 2L  Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma KRAS, EGFR, and ALK w/t - [**10/2147**] Developed hoarseness, diagnosed w vocal cord paralysis.
CXR at that time revealed a R lung mass and hilar adenopathy - [**2147-11-13**] EBUS biopsy of her mediastinal LNs which revealed NSCLC adenocarcinoma CK7 + and TTF-1 + with some smaller cells CK5/6 + and a few cells p63 + - [**2147-11-22**] PET CT revealed an FDG-avid right upper lobe masses with right hilar, mediastinal, and supraclavicular LAD, an enlarged FDG-avid portocaval lymph node, and a left adrenal nodule with low level FDG-uptake - [**2147-12-7**] Pemetredex 500 mg/m2 as a radiation sensitizing [**Doctor Last Name 360**], started XRT - [**2147-12-18**] CT torso with interval progression of disease with enlargement of all previously measured lesions.
No definite new lesions - [**2147-12-29**] Completed 2500 cGy to the primary tumor and LNs - [**2148-1-29**] CT torso showed mixed response with increase in size of the right supraclavicular node but decrease in size of the mediastinal and hilar nodes.
Mild decrease in size of right pulmonary nodule.
Found to have new brain mets.

Right bundle-branch block.
CXR [**2148-3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, slightly limiting evaluation, with no radiographic evidence for acute process on this single view.
Lung nodules as seen previously.
No acute intracranial process.
Hypodensities in the occipital lobe are unchanged from [**2148-2-1**], due to known metastatic lesions.
No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
New pulmonary nodules bilaterally are concerning for progression of non-small cell lung cancer, less likely infection.
Moderate right hydronephrosis, unchanged from the prior study.
XRAY NECK SOFT TISSUES [**2148-3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Leftward deviation of the trachea, likely secondary to known right neck mass without significant airway compromise.
Right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with an associated right upper lobe opacity are known to represent the patient's lung carcinoma.
No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.
There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.
The left lung is hyperinflated consistent with known underlying emphysema.
Heart remains somewhat prominent with a left ventricular configuration suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy.
No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
Scattered degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
PATIENT DID NOT HAVE LABS DRAWN NEAR DISCHARGE TIME AS SHE WAS CMO.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yof with history of NSCLC with metastases to the brain, presenting with increasing SOB, found to have stridor in the ED with concern for vocal cord paralysis.
# SOB/Stridor:  Pt initially presenting with worsening SOB for 2 days in setting of steroid taper.
ENT scoped and noted left vocal cord paralysis which they felt likely explained the stridor.
However, the patient reports that this had been noted last [**Month (only) 216**] at [**Hospital3 4107**] so unclear if this would have caused acute decline.
Of note, neck XR in the ED showed some possible tracheal indentation thought secondary to her lymphadenopathy which could have caused the stridor and improved with steroids.
Pt also may have component of volume overload given prominent interstitial markings on CXR, but the remainder of her exam is consistent with hypovolemia.
Given her radiation treatment, she may have component of phrenic nerve palsy which could explain her air hunger.
Pt was also offered a trach with the explanation that this will allow her to breathe better, allow fixation of her cord and speak better w/ bypass valve, but patient refused.
Pt was placed on cooling mist face mask, and given fentanyl patches for her R shoulder pain.
She also received morphine for her pain and dyspnea.
Pt was also receiving lorazepam 1mg IV q6 for agitation and anxiety.
On transfer to the floor patient continued to have pain issues, eventually put on morphine drip as she was CMO, continued fentanyl patch, and ativan PRN for comfort until she passed away.
Possible etiologies include recent high dose steroids, or infection (possible UTI seen on UA).
# EKG changes:  Pt with diffuse ST depressions and TWI new from prior EKG.
Diffuse nature is more suggestive of demand ischemia in the setting of her stressed state from her shortness of breath.
UCx was negative, no further treatment.
# Anxiety: Pt on ativan 0.5mg po QHS prn at home, increased to 1mg iv q6hrs PRN agitation or anxiety once Pt was transitioned to comfort care.
# Htn:  On atenolol as outpt, which was discontinued once Pt was transitioned to comfort care.
