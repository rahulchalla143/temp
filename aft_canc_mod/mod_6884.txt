The patient began noting symptoms approximately 1 week ago.
She was also referred for stress testing.
On admission to the BMT service, the patient underwent head CT, which showed a 1.3 cm hemorrhage in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
She was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt that the bleed likely occured several days ago.
She denied any complaints other than as above.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
No focal numbness/tingling.
Denies lightheadedness or dizziness.
Past Medical History: - History of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a MIB fraction of approximately 100%, but no features of Burkitt's.
Diagnosis was made after biopsy of a large left adrenal mass.
She also had massive retroperitoneal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
- Sarcoidosis - GERD  Social History: She is married and lives with her husband.
She is retired after having worked in teleservices.
She does not know of any exposures to tuberculosis or asbestos.
She has no pets.
Family History: Her father was a smoker and passed away from lung cancer at ~65 years of age.
There is no history of sarcoidosis in her family as far as she knows.

Imaging: ======== CT HEAD [**2150-5-12**]: New parenchymal hematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere, with minimal surrounding edema and minimal mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
CXR [**5-20**]:  No previous images.
Lungs are essentially clear and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
MR head [**5-14**]: Solitary enhancing mass within the left cerebellar hemisphere, corresponding to the hyperdensity seen on CT.
The findings may reflect a hypercellular tumor, or a mass containing hemorrhagic components.
The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma or a solitary hemorrhagic metastasis.
Stable small gastrohepatic, celiac and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
No new significant adenopathy is seen in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Mildly dilated esophagus with oral contrast may be due to reflux.
Scattered biapical ground-glass opacities and centrilobular pulmonary nodules with calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are consistent with known history of sarcoidosis and are stable.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o F with PMHx significant for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, sarcoidosis, who was admitted earlier today with ataxia and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after head CT revealed cerebellar bleed.
# Cerbellar Mass: When she first presented head CT revealed a left cereballr bleed.
Subsequent MRI revealed an underlying mass.
She had an LP with the CSF showing many white blood cells many of which appeared malignant and flow cytometry revealed B-cell origin cells with CD20 expression, suggesting CNS involvement of her lymphoma She was started on high dose methotrexate on [**5-16**] and tolerated this well.
Her ataxia and left side dysmetria improved.
As above, had CNS involvement and L cerebellar mass.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma Left cerebellar mass  Secondary: Sarcoid   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We found that you had a mass in your cerebellum on the left side.
Based on the results of a spinal fluid analysis this is likely due to your lymphoma.
Please call the hospital and have the BMT fellow paged if you develop a fever >100.4, worsening balance or any other concerning symptoms.
