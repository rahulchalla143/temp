Admission Date:  [**2154-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-7-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 49 year old female with hx metastatic renal cell carcinoma on sutent s/p gemzar chemotherapy on [**10-14**] presented to clinic with dizziness and malaise.
She was found to be hypotensive to the 80s, and tachycardic at 112, pale but mildly jaundiced which was an acute change.
Found to be in acute liver failure.
A CTA was performed which showed no PE but with increased vascular resistance in the R M/L lobes, known R mediastinal mass with mass effect on SVC, worsening collapse of entire R lung and finally R pleural effusion.
Recently she has been admitted for a presumptive pna on levo/flagyl dc'd on [**9-16**] with completion of her antibiotics on [**2154-9-21**].
She denied further symptoms at that time.
C/o increased WOB and fever for last 2 days, that has worsened to dyspnea at rest.
Denies any other localizing symptoms - no cough, chest pain, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rashes or headaches.
Past Medical History: Depression Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade [**2-3**] s/p right radical nephrectomy with venacavotomy, with pulmonary metastases, s/p multiple chemotherapeutic regimens most recently C3D1 of gemzar/sutent on [**10-14**] Peridontal disease Bartholin cysts   Social History: Divorced, 2 adult kids, quit tobacco at age 30 after 1ppd x 10 years, social EtOH, lives in [**State 1727**].
Family History: colon ca mother age 80, [**Name2 (NI) 3685**] in maternal aunts, older age  Physical Exam: 96.8 79/61 HR 90 RR 36 SpO2 50% on nonrebreather Gen: obvious increased work of breathing, speaking in short sentences HEENT: periocular pallor, perioral cyanosis, MM dry, open mouth breathing CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, no m/g/r Pulm: no breath sounds right side, left side with good air movement, no wheeze/rale/rhonchi Abd: +BT, soft, nontender Ext: Cool, poorly perfused with mild cyanosis   Pertinent Results: [**2154-10-17**] 04:20PM   TYPE-ART O2 FLOW-4 PO2-23* PCO2-37 PH-7.15* TOTAL CO2-14* BASE XS--17 INTUBATED-NOT INTUBA COMMENTS-NASAL [**Last Name (un) 154**] .
No evidence of aortic dissection or central/segmental pulmonary emboli.
Subsegmental branches within the right middle and right lower lobe are incompletely opacified due to increased vascular resistance.
No significant interval change since prior exam of the known large invasive right mediastinal mass, adjacent mass effect on the SVC, and development of collateralization.
Moderate increase in size to a loculated right pleural effusion with fissural component.
New small left pleural effusion.
Mild amount of adjacent linear and dependent atelectasis.
Increased size and mass effect of metastatic lesion in the mediastinum/right hilum which now almost completely occludes the SVC with increased collateralization.
Other pulmonary lesions have increased in size.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 F with met RCC presents with SOB found to have near total collapse/occulusion of her right lung [**2-1**] tumor progression.
# SOB - No PE evident on CTA, CT with evidence of tumor progression and collapse of most of right lung with minimal perfusion and pleural effusions.
Initially began antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
And that intubation needed to be soon given her poor oxygenation.
Was started on a morphine gtt which helped with her dyspnea.
# Acid/base- Metabolic Acidosis- 31 Gap acidosis, with Elevated lactate, also with inappropriate respiratory compensation, thus likely respiratory alkalosis, with mixed metabolic alkalosis given the anion gap difference is 20, and change in bicarb is 17.
No labs were drawn the last day of her life given her CMO status.
# ARF - Likely prerenal in the setting of hypotension, low fluid intake.
# Increased LFTs- New lab abnormality, no evidence of malignancy on recent CT, likely associated with worsening SVC syndrome, hepatic congestion, or possible new metastases.
Expired [**2154-10-19**] due to cardiopulmonary arrest in the setting of widely metastatic lung cancer.
