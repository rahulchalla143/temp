His most recent scans are notable for recurrence of his hepatocellular carcinoma following his radiofrequency ablation (5/[**2118**]).
At his most recent oncology visit on [**2118-10-5**], he was found to have a rapid deterioration in his liver function and was felt not to be a candidate for further cancer-directed therapies.

RLL consolidation consistent with PNA was also seen.
CT Head negative for acute process.
He was given zosyn and clindamycin as treatment for his pneumonia.
Cirrhosis Child's class C, complicated by varices, encephalopathy, and ascites.
Hepatitis C secondary to IV drug use.
Hepatocellular carcinoma status post RFA in [**2118-5-5**].

There are bibasal effusions along with atelectasis/probable consolidation at the lung bases.
Follow up with AP and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to assess for atelectasis vs. consolidation.
There is apparent deformity of the left humeral head which is not well visualized and if there is suspicion of trauma to the left shoulder joint, dedicated views of the left shoulder would be helpful.
Cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left lobe of the liver consistent with patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma.
There is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein which is non-occlusive.

Respiratory failure/PNA ??????
Pt was intubated for unresponsiveness and a GCS of 8 at an OSH.
CT of chest demonstrated RLL consolidation c/w possible aspiration PNA.
Repeat CXR on [**10-12**] showed improving lung fields with no signs of consolidation.
On the floor he did not have any pulmonary distress, but did spike a fever to 102.5 while on unasyn, so he was switched to vanc/levo/zosyn.
His CXR was negative and he quickly defervesced so Abx were stopped after a short course.
Upon admission, he had many stigmata of liver disease, both on exam (encephalopathic, scleral icterus, palpable mass in epigastric area c/w HCC mass in left lobe, mild ascites, spider angioma, extensive ecchymosis) and laboratory testing (elevated INR and abnormal liver enzymes).
An U/S of RUQ on [**10-12**] showed no signs of portal vein thrombosis, cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left lobe of the liver c/w patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma; there is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein which is non-occlusive.
Hypotension: On [**10-11**], the patient developed hypotension to 80/40's.
Likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and possibly opioid toxicity.
Hct stable in mid-20's during admission and hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed.
