Admission Date:  [**2133-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-1-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: temp to 105, ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP IR placement of biliary drain  History of Present Illness: 80 y/o M w/history of diabetes, gastric cancer, with recent development of painless jaundice, GNR bacteremia, biliary obstruction, and suspected cholangitis, who presents to the hospitalist service s/p ERCP.
In brief, patient admitted to OSH ([**Hospital3 635**]) on [**2133-1-17**] with progressive generalized weakness over the previous one week.
Having difficulty walking and getting around secondary to weakness.
U/A showed evidence of infection with leukocytes greater than 50 WBC.AST was 243, with ALT of 151, alk phos of 778 and bili of 7.7.
U/S was performed and showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation without obvious obstruction.
MRCP was subsequently performed which showed hepatobiliary and gb dilatation with eccentric narrowing of the CBD of the head of the pancreas possibly due to occult mass.
no ductal or GB stones detected.
Also left lower lobe 3cm pulmonary mass of focal consolidation noted.
Patient underwent ERCP today which demonstrated tumor infiltration of the duodenum, resulting in inability to reach the major papilla.
He was xferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to control the hyperthermia   Past Medical History: 1. parkinsons disease 2. diabetes 3. h/o gastric adenoCa diagnosed 6 y/ago 4. s/p colostomy 5. htn 6. h/o TIA 7. h/o chronic anemia 8. h/o GI bleed 9. h/o appy 10. h/o CHF- undocumented type 11. h/o large bowel obstruction [**2-14**] sigmoid volvulus in 10'[**31**].
Social History: married, denies tobacco.drinks one alcoholic beverage a night  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: 101.1 96 108/62 18 97/2l GEN: lethargic HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, op without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, firm, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: AAOx0.
Small right pneumothorax, predominantly situated anteriorly, but with a small lateral, likely loculated component within a moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.
Small left pleural effusion and small pericardial effusion.
Left lower lobe posterior basal segment consolidation, with patchy areas of increased airspace opacities throughout both lungs, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Ground-glass attenuation and additional biapical centrilobular opacity most likely reflects a component of superimposed pulmonary edema.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
The diffuse areas of bilateral opacification persist.

On transfer he was sent to the ICU for fever of 105 and hypotension.
He had ERCP which was unable to relieve biliary obstruction [**2-14**] duodenal mass/obstruction.
Biopsy of this mass during ERCP showed adenocarcinoma.
His hospitalization was complicated by worsening renal failure requiring initiation of dialysis.
In addition, he developed a right sided pneumothorax and right sided pleural effusion.
1)h/o Gastric cancer - Likely recurrant given duodenal mass biopsy showing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma c/w recurrance of gastric cancer.
Oncology consultation deferred during admission given patient's established relationship with oncologist at [**Hospital3 635**] hospital, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7049**], and family's wish to pursue further eval and treatment for recurrent gastric cancer closer to home.
2)Biliary obstruction: most likely due to obstruction from recurrant gastric cancer.
Unable to treat obstruction with ERCP due to duodenal obstruction, so he had IR placed common bile duct stent.
He required a second IR procedure with extension of the CBD stent due to persistant obstruction from the duodenal mass.
Following the second procedure the external drain was removed and his total bilirubin has continued to trend down and he has remained afebrile suggesting that he now has unobstructed internal biliary drainage.
He was treated with levofloxacin (start date: [**1-21**]) and fluconazole (start date: [**1-31**]) for GNR bactermia and sparse growth of [**Female First Name (un) **] from his biliary fluid.
3)Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease: baseline creatinine 1.5.
His course has been complicated by progressive renal failure in the setting of underlying infection and recurrant gastric cancer.
He has been followed closely by renal consultation service, who feel that his renal failure is most likely due to progressive ATN, which was difficult to manage due to pulmonary edema/effusions.
There was no evidence of obstruction on renal u/s.
He had persistant pericardial friction rub concerning for uremic pericarditis.
In addition, he also had worsening repiratory status and developing oliguria which led to initiation of dialysis on [**2133-2-4**].
4)Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis - course was complicated by likely aspiration event on the floor which resulted in intubation.
CT scan demonstrated multi-focal infiltrates.
He was treated with 13 day course of vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.
5)Pneumothorax, Pleural Effusion - In the setting of worsening respiratory function and increasing O2 requirements a CT scan of his chest was obtained which demonstrated large right sided pleural effusion, right sided pneumothorax and smaller left sided pleural effusion.
He had IR guided thoracentesis, pleural fluid with bilirubin level of 4 and sparse [**Female First Name (un) **].
Given these findings, pneumothorax felt most likely to be a complication of CBD stent placement.
Chest tube was considered for treatment of his complicated effusion, however no further intervention was pursued as family decided to change to comfort measures only, with no further invasive procedures.
6)Atrial fibrillation - new onset during this admission of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7)Guaiac positive colostomy output - in setting of elevated INR likely due to nutritional deficiency and multiple antibiotics.
Felt most likely due to gastritis/trauma from NG tube placement.
He was treated with twice daily PPI and bleeding stopped without intervention.
8)Pericardial friction rub - most likely due to uremic pericarditis.
He had two echocardiograms which did not show any significant pericardial effusion.
9)Coagulopathy - INR elevated as high as 2.2 during this admission, felt to be due to nutritional deficiencies and antibiotic therapy.
10) Anemia - HCT slowly trended down during his admission and he was transfused total of 2 units of PRBC's.
Also has a component of chronic anemia treated with epoetin prior to admission and during admission.
