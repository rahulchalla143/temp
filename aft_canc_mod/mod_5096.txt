History of Present Illness:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. [**Known lastname 64713**] is a 63 year-old female with a history of CAD status post MI in [**10/2118**], status post stents X3 (last on [**2119-4-14**]) currently on ASA and Plavix, atrial fibrillation no longer on Coumadin given a history of life-threatening lower GI bleed in [**11/2118**] (at which time Coumadin was discontinued and Plavix was initiated), also with CHF and PVD, who presents from home with a 1-day history of "dark stools".
Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**11/2118**] with a lower GI bleed while on Coumadin and ASA.
At that time, endoscopy was remarkable for EGD with mild gastritis (negative H. pylori), and C-scope with multiple diverticula and polyps, with a blood clot seen at the hepatic flexure with diverticula and polyps underneath without active bleeding.
A tagged RBC scan was positive for tracer uptake at the hepatic flexure, but an angiogram was negative, and an intervention was not performed.
* She now reports that she started having marroon-colored stools at night before admission.
She subsequently had 10 other BMs with marroon-colored stools and bright red blood mixed in.
She notes that she feels the urge to move her bowels, and does not have bleeding in between.
She had transient abdominal discomfort in the LLQ, which lasted 30 minutes and spontaneously resolved.
She reports mild shortness of breath, without chest pain.
No recent fever or chills, no other complaints.
Orthostatic vitals showed a mild increase in HR (currently on BB).
Past Medical History: --LGIB: Admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2118-12-1**] with massive LGIB while on coumadin and plavix after NSTEMI and A.fib.
s/p multiple colonoscopies, bleeding scans -->diverticular bleed, localized bleed to hepatic flexture, unable to perform intervention.
--ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Developed PAF during admission for NSTEMI [**10-31**] converted to sinus rhythm with beta blocker, anticoagulated with coumadin s/p massive LGIB.
--ANEMIA [**2118-12-12**] Hemolytic Anemia - unclear etiology after extensive inpatient w/up.
--FIBROMYALGIA Longstanding history - takes Percocet 7.5/325 120 tabs per month --HYPERTENSION H/o hypertensive crisis - admitted [**2118-11-15**] with hypertensive crisis and pulmonary edema.
Currently under better control - some degree of permissive hypertension given elevated creatinine.
--BREAST CANCER s/p R mastectomy ~20 years ago --CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE EF 35-40% 3+ TR or 1+ MR, e/a 0.45 --PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE s/p bifem bypass --?
PATENT FORAMEN OVALE: conflicting echo readings [**10-31**] --h/o ENDOCARDITIS h/o questionable step viridans endocarditis --h/o RIGHT ATRIAL LESION (THROMBUS VS. VEGETATION) seen on ECHO [**11-15**] and [**2118-11-16**].
RESP: CTAB, without adventitious sounds.
No murmur appreciated.
Abdomen soft, mild RUQ tenderness without rebound or guarding.
DRE: Bright red blood, no stool.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2119-5-30**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
MODERATE GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2119-5-28**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2119-5-28**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring given concern for her brisk LGI bleed.
She remained hemodynamically stable with slight decreases in her hematocrit.
She underwent a tagged RBC scan which was not revealing in terms of her bleeding source.
Her c-scope was finally performed on [**5-15**] which did not show any active bleeding, but with diffuse diverticulosis throughout her entire colon, and multiple polyps.
It was thought that likely one of her diverticula bled, but it was unclear exactly in what location.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] had been consulted to assist with possible surgical intervention, but given lack of localization, it was felt that short of performing a total colectomy, it would be prudent to wait for the next bleeding episode to decide on which portion of the colon to remove.
The pt was evaluated by surgery and taken to OR [**5-18**] for a R hemicolectomy due to persistent bleeding and transferred to the recovery room in good condition.
On [**5-18**], patient developed chest pain and shortness of breath.
ECG revealed no acute changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
TEE revealed the left atrium is markedly dilated and elongated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is a prominent eustachain valve and chiari network which appears thicker than usual, but othewise, no abnormal masses, vegetations, or thrombi are seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The interatrial septum bows prominently into the right atrium, suggesting elevated left atiral pressures.
There is severe left ventricular hypertrophy, but the infeior wall is somewhat thinner (1.5 cm vs over 2 cm for other walls).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed at 45-50%.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include moderate infeior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace central aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral central regurgitation is seen.
Pt was started on a diltiazem drip and beta blocker for rate control.
Pt again had chest pain and shortness of breath [**5-24**].
ECG again showed no acute changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
On [**5-27**], pt had WBC of 23 and a wound infection was discovered.
Wet to dry dressings three times a day were done to treat the wound infection.
On discharge, pt had WBC of 10.2 and wound was no longer draining and had granulation tissue  Medications on Admission:  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: ASA 325 mg PO QD Plavix 75 mg PO QD Percocet prn Norvasc 10 mg PO QD Sertraline 25 mg PO QD Imdur 60 mg PO QD Ambien prn Lipitor 80 mg PO QD Toprol 100 mg PO QD HCTZ 25 mg PO QD   Discharge Medications: 1.
