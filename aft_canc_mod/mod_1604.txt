CT abd/pelvis was consistent with acute pancreatitis.
On [**10-23**] he had coffee ground emesis followed by respiratory failure requiring intubation.
CXR showed BL infiltrates and he was started on vancomycin and zosyn on [**10-23**].
A repeat CT scan on [**10-26**] showed increaseing peripancreatic stranding and fluid consistent with worsening pancreatitis.
It was thought there was a new fluid collection abutting the body of the pancreas c/w a pseudocyst.
Past Medical History: Lower back pain since [**Month (only) 216**] Petrous apex cholesterol cyst s/p surgical drainage in [**2127**] dyslipidemia / hypertriglyceridemia daily alcohol use HTN Prior pancreatitis in [**2126**] (mother unable to confirm).
Recent divorce, foreclosure, and end of a relationship with a girlfriend living in the [**Name (NI) 32945**].
no seizure history.
slightly tympanic.
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
skin: in right groin papular erythematous rash without pus or vescicles.
2+ DTRS throughout.
[**2136-10-26**]: OSH CT abd/pelvis: Increasing peripancreatic stranding and fluid consistent with worsening pancreatitis.
New fluid collection abutting the body of the pancreas, consistent with a pseudocyst.
New BL pleural effusions.
Prominent areas of consolidation in both lower lobes, new since the prior study.
[**2136-10-27**] CXR: bibasilar opacities, consistent with small pleural effusions and areas of consolidation which could represent atelectatis and/ or infiltrate.
Mild pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
Extensive peripancreatic stranding and fluid, little changed from prior study, and compatible with provided history of pancreatitis.
There is no loculated fluid collection to suggest abscess or pseudocyst formation.
The pancreatic parenchyma enhances homogeneously, without evidence for pancreatic necrosis.
No evidence for vascular complication.
Increase in bilateral moderate pleural effusions, with dependent opacities most likely representing atelectasis.
However, there is additional multifocal air space opacity in the right middle lobe and lingula, new from prior study and concerning for pneumonia.
[**2136-11-7**]: Head MRI No acute intracranial pathology.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 39yo male w hx of EtOH abuse, HLD, presenting from OSH w acute pancreatitis, and intubation for PNA .
# Pancreatitis: This is a patient who presented with abdominal pain, elevated amylase / lipase, and evidence of pancreatitis on imaging.
On transfer, [**Hospital1 18**] imaging did not show evidence of pseudocyst or necrosis.
After extubation (discussed below), patient had an improving abdominal exam with decreasing pain control requirements.
In the setting of a serious illness, it was thought that these findings were likely reactive in etiology and lagging behind his clinical recovery.
There was low suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative disorder.
At that point, if his leukocytosis and thrombocytosis had not resolved, they recommended that he undergo additional testing, including BCR-ABL and JAK2 testing.
They did not recommend starting aspirin given his recent GI bleed.
# Hypoxic resp failure: This is a patient who developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of a likely aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.
He was transfered here intubated with persistent BL infiltrates, treated with vanco/zosyn for possible VAP/asp pna.
There were some difficulties with weaning the patient from fentanyl, so he was started on methadone.
# Seizure-like activity: This is a patient who at OSH vague "seizure-like activity" was noted in OSH d/c summary for which he was started on Keppra.
Patient had no documented seizures in ICU, but remained exceedingly agitated requiring multiple sedatives.
MRI brain showed no suspicious lesions or cause for seizures or agitation.
Keppra was d/ced after patient failed to show any concerning seizure activity--it was thought that the previously reported seizure-like activity may have been [**1-31**] to agitation in the setting of inadequate sedation.
# Coffee ground emesis: This is a patient with coffee ground emesis at OSH on [**10-23**] requiring 4 units pRBCs.
It was thought this was [**1-31**] EtOH gastritis vs stress ulcer vs NG tube induced esophagitis.
His HCT remained stable without signs of bleeding or hemolysis.
# HTN: This is a patient with baseline HTN on lisinopril, HCTZ and metoprolol as an outpatient.
The patient was continued on metoprolol at transfer, with several episodes of hypertension after transfer.
At discharge, low-dose lisinopril was started given history of hyperlipidemia.

You were transferred here for treatment of your pancreatitis and pneumonia.
You were also found to have an elevated number of platelets in your blood.
If it is still elevated in a month's time, please see your primary care doctor for further workup.
