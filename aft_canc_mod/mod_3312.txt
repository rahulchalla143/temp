Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 30-year-old woman with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary.
At [**State 792**]Womens', about [**3-1**], she developed pseudomonal urosepsis and vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation.
Her course was complicated by post-hypotensive coma as well as subarachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds.
Neurologists at RIH felt she had a poor prognosis, but communication between the medical team and family was strained and transfer was arranged to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion.
Her outside course in more detail: Patient transferred from Women and [**Hospital 60658**] Hospital to [**Hospital **] Hospital [**2151-3-1**] with weaknes, vag bleeding x several days, fever 102.5, hypotension, hypoxic 84% on 4L NC, tachypnic to 30, with labs significant for lactate 6.3, wbc <1.0, plt 9, hgb 8.9, and INR greater than lab threshold.
Placed on [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/vanc/fluc/gentamicin for neutropenic fever and thrush initially.
CT abdomen consistent with large necrotic pelvic mass - not sampled [**12-18**] coagulopathy.
Continued to have recurrent fevers.
Seen by Urology who did not change stents given severe coagulopathy and worsening renal function.
Found to be in DIC and supported with daily blood products.
Developed renal failure with Cr peak of 2.9.
Head CT done [**3-10**] with bilateral SAH and L temporal parenchymal hematoma.
Also with multiple masses consistent with metastasis.
Felt secondary to low platelets with no surgical intervention indicated.
Given 48 hours off sedation with out change in mental status (last morphine was [**2151-3-13**]).

[**2151-3-17**] MRI head: FINDINGS: The sagittal T1 images demonstrate several areas of high signal along the sulci bilaterally which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhages.
There are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images, this could not be further confirmed.
There is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain.
There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes, which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen.
Images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation.
There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A CT would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci.
Gadolinium-enhanced MRI would also help for further assessment.
pCXR [**2151-3-17**] 5:01am: FINDINGS: No prior comparisons.
Heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique, no sizeable pneumothorax.
There is a somewhat wedge-shaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia.
No other confluent infiltrates are appreciated .
Mild pulmonary edema.
Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis, aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations.
EEG [**2151-3-18**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features .
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pericardial effusion.
pCXR [**2151-3-19**]: Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved, probably resolving edema.
There is more rightward mediastinal shift, suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung.
No appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions .
pCXR [**2151-3-20**]: Increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases, worsened slightly since [**3-19**] at 10:57 p.m. Heart size is normal.
There is no pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**3-17**]- Stool: negative for Cdiff toxin [**3-18**]- Stool: negative for Cdiff toxin .
[**3-18**]- Swab from Nephrostomy:    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2151-3-18**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2151-3-20**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
NOCARDIA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.
[**3-20**]- Catheter tip (IV): WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2151-3-21**]):    No significant growth  Brief Hospital Course: 30 yo F with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to OSH [**3-1**] with pseudomonal urosepsis, vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation.
Course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology.
# Neurologic - The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases, possible hemorrhages, and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
The patient's neurologic exam (performed after sedation removed >48 hours) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity.
She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected  (hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia), but neurologic exam was unchanged.
Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation, which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable.
She was originally intubated for airway protection, and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration.
# Fevers/Infection - Per outside hospital records, the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine.
pneumonia vs atelectasis at the R lung base.
Fevers also may be from head bleed, cancer, or drug.
No further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process.
# Squamous Cell Cancer - unknown primary.
Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin.
She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia (40-50K).
Hematology/Oncology service at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment.
# h/o DVT - patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation.
# Hypernatremia - Improved from OSH.
# Acute Renal Failure - stable, likely [**12-18**] hypotension leading to ATN that is slowly improving.
# Access - R IJ changed sterilly over wire [**3-7**] .
