Had initially presented to OSH w/lethargy and hypotension with SBP 70s-80s (baseline 90s).
Was found to have UTI, also had urinary retention requiring Foley placement.
Was initially admitted to floor, but developed recurrent hypotension requiring ICU transfer, aggressive IVFs, and pressor support.
He was later restarted on ceftriaxone given concern for recurrent UTI, but this was d/c'd after 2 days given rising Cr and concern for AIN (urine eos positive).
Had delirium during the admission, and was often not oriented to place or time.
Was concern for possible drug effect from vancomycin, and also concern for HIT.
Did not have any bradycardia.
Despite ongoing IVF administration during the admission, he did not develop any evidence of volume overload/acute CHF.
Had anemia which was attributed to his chemotherapy, though he also had hematuria attributed to his bladder cancer.
Was guiac positive at one point in setting of supratherapeutic INR, though later was guiac negative.
Coagulopathy presumed secondary to antibiotic therapy and poor nutrition.
Developed diarrhea which was presumed secondary to antibiotic use; C. diff was negative.
Per report, since discharge has had poor PO intake.
Labs yesterday notable for rising WBC from 22.5 to 24.5, and rising BUN/Cr.
In the ED, he triggered on arrival for hypotension with SBP in 80s.
Had mild TTP in suprapubic area.
Given history of recent UTI and concern for sepsis secondary to urinary source, patient given cefepime.
He is admitted now to ICU for further management of his hypotension.
Occasional abdominal pain and nausea with certain foods.
Reports chronic lower abdominal pain for which he takes morphine.
Denies vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.
No rashes, myalgias, or arthralgias.

There is a small amount of volume loss in the left lower lobe laterally, but no infiltrate is seen.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 58M with history of metastatic bladder cancer s/p XRT, [**Month/Year (2) 3454**], prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy, CHF with LVEF (25%), HTN, DM, and recent ICU admission for sepsis secondary to UTI, presenting now with decreased PO intake, recurrent hypotension, worsening leukocytosis, and worsening renal function.
Pt's morphine was discontinued for concern over neurotoxic metabolites.
#SIRS/Hypotension/Probable Sepsis: Patient p/w worsening leukocytosis and tachycardia; concern for severe sepsis given hypotension, decreased UOP, increased confusion, and worsening renal function.
Was having intermittent fevers during recent admission, and was hypothermic in ED.
No clear source of infection; UA suggestive of UTI, but similar to UAs obtained during recent admission that were culture negative.
Did report urinary frequency and has had mild suprapubic tenderness, though possible symptoms and UA findings are related to underlying bladder cancer.
Clinical picture not suggestive of PNA or meningitis.
Hypotension could be related to volume depletion given recent decrease in PO intake, and did improve with IVF overnight.
Adrenal insufficiency less likely given normal/elevated cortisol level.
SBP currently improved to 110s-120s after 4L IVF, though patient continues to have confusion and low UOP (has been incontinent and refusing Foley, so unable to accurately assess UOP).
He remained afebrile throughout his stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
DDx includes delirium secondary to possible infection, narcotics use, renal function; poor perfusion in setting of hypotension.
Exam not suggestive of meningitis, and neuro exam non-focal.
He was worked up and treated empirically for possible infection as above with antibiotics being discontinued once decision made with family to transition to comfort focused care.
#Tachycardia: ECG showed sinus tachycardia with PVCs.
Was likely component of pre-renal azotemia secondary to possible sepsis and volume depletion.
Also concern for CIN given recent contrast CT scans.
DDx includes poor forward flow from CHF, ATN given recent hypotension (FeNa 2.1%),, post-renal obstruction from patient's malignancy (hydronephrosis noted on recent imaging).
Pain appears to be well controlled per patient; home doses of morphine were continued.
During recent admission was attributed to chemotherapy, hematuria from bladder malignancy.
H&H was trended with no precipitous drop.
