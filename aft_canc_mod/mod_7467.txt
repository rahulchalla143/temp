Admission Date:  [**2120-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-4-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: IV Dye, Iodine Containing / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**Attending Info 65513**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain, nausea / vomiting, pelvic mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Intubation   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN, asthma, CAD s/p MI in [**2112**], and DM2, who presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting after discharge from an OSH.
Patient was found to have a 15 cm RLQ mass at OSH and was initially scheduled for outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5797**].
Smokes 1PPD, no ETOH, no illicits.
Family History: Daughter [**Name (NI) **] with ovarian CA age 20, s/p surgery, now 40yo and healthy Brother died of jaw cancer No other ovarian, breast, uterine, colon, cancers in family  Physical Exam: (On admission) VS 100.1 96 166/75 20 98%RA A&O, NARD, appears stated age Heart RRR Lungs CTAB, no WRR Abd soft, mildly distended with tympany, diffuse TTP mainly RLQ and epigastrium, no R/G, +BS Pelvic deferred Ext no edema, no calf TTP   Pertinent Results: (On admission) .
Large complex cystic mass with thick septations and irregular wall in the right adnexa.
The lesion is concerning for an ovarian neoplasm such as cystadenocarcinoma and surgical resection has to be considered.
[**2120-2-4**]: Current study demonstrates new left lower lobe opacity accompanied by pleural effusions that may potentially represent interval development of infectious process or aspiration.
No evidence of pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is still presence of complete consolidation of the left lower lung, but some aeration of the left upper lung is noted with decrease in the mediastinal shift.
The right lower lobe consolidation continues to increase and is worrisome for developing infectious process  [**2120-2-4**]: Right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium and should be pulled back for approximately 1.5 cm.
In contrary there is growing right lower lobe consolidation highly worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.
[**2120-2-5**]: Previous left lung collapse has cleared in the left upper lobe and some of the lower, progressive improvement since [**2-4**].
Overall, findings point to compromised airway, presumably due to secretions.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion with mediastinal venous engorgement also indicate some cardiac decompensation, but I do not see edema.
Small pleural effusion may be present on the left as well.
[**2120-2-7**]: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the left side.
Bibasilar atelectasis are improved.
Mild pulmonary congestion has improved.
Previously described right apical opacity has improved.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
Bilateral LENIS [**2120-2-4**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.
