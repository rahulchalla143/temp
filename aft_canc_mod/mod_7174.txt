#Metastatic renal carcinoma- Prior to admission, the patient was receiving radiation to her pelvic mass and spine.
Her lung metastases have increased in size on chest x-ray, and the pt was more short of breath, now requiring constant O2.
Her pain was managed with fentanyl patch and oral dilaudid for breakthrough.
#Anemia- The patient's anemia is likely due to a combination of dilution from fluids and bleeding from pelvic mass.
Due to higher risk of bleeding over risk of clot, her coumadin was stopped.
