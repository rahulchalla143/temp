HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma originally diagnosed in [**2134**].
The patient had bilateral partial nephrectomies at that time for chromophobe oocytic component tumor (grade II to III) with 4.5 cm skin size with capillary penetration but negative margins.
The patient presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past two weeks and an oxygen saturation in the 80s on the day of admission at his oncologist's office.
As noted, a chest x-ray in [**2142-3-29**] showed hilar lymphadenopathy and a bronchoscopy with biopsy showed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
The patient has had a chronic cough for months which has been intermittently productive of yellow and green sputum.
The patient has complained of anorexia over the past several weeks.
The patient notes orthopnea requiring him to sleep on two pillows, but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
In the Emergency Department, the patient responded to 3 liters of oxygen with oxygen saturations coming up to 92% but had an increasing oxygen requirement.
The patient was seen by the Primary Medicine team at 4 a.m. and was short of breath on 100% nonrebreather but was mentating well.
The chest x-ray on admission was consistent with congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2134**] with bilateral partial nephrectomies; chromophobe oocytic component tumor (grade II to III); 4.5 cm; capillary penetration; and negative margins.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in [**2108**] and a normal echocardiogram in [**2138**].
History of transient ischemic attacks.
History of gastrointestinal bleed resulting in a hemicolectomy.
The patient does not have a smoking history.
In general, the patient was in no acute distress.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
No murmurs appreciated.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Neurologic examination revealed no gross deficits.
Skin examination revealed multiple psoriatic plaques on the scalp.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray from [**6-11**] showed bulky lymphadenopathy with diffuse reticular nodular pattern and bilateral pleural effusions; consistent with congestive heart failure and metastatic disease.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with a flipped T wave in leads V4, V5, and III (which were new).
Just noting a computed tomography scan from [**6-8**], prior to admission, showed extensive mediastinal adenopathy with a node as large as 3.3 cm X 2.9 cm (which has increased in size).
Also, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Also with new nodular densities and an increased size of metastases in the left lobe with one nodule measuring 12 mm in diameter.
HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with hypoxia with an oxygen requirement, but his saturations improved on 100% nonrebreather mask to the 90s.
Of note, the patient came to the Intensive Care Unit on a nitroglycerin drip and had been taking isosorbide mononitrate, and this may have worsened his respiratory status as it may have dilated pulmonary vasculature that was contracting to try and keep his V/Q match.
The patient will most likely require establishment of a new lower dry weight.
There was an immediate suspicion for a pulmonary embolism on admission; however, given the patient's metastatic status, history of bleeds, and improving oxygen saturations, the patient was not fully heparinized at that time.
However, on day two of admission the patient was sent for a computed tomography angiogram to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
This may have enhanced his respiratory distress as the patient is oliguric.
This likely was an iatrogenic elevated bicarbonate level due to either over bicarbonated dialysis solution and/or his Phos-Lo and/or Renagel.
END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was last dialyzed on [**6-9**].
It was very likely that due to the patient's recent anorexia he had lost dry weight and needed to be dialyzed to a lower dry weight.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had a distant history of a myocardial infarction.
A recent echocardiogram from [**2138**] showed a preserved ejection fraction and left ventricular function.
The patient did have a small troponin leak by enzymes at approximately 0.2, but his creatine kinase levels were flat at around 50 to 60.
We had a low suspicion that the patient had a cardiac event and thought that this was more likely due to his respiratory distress and his end-stage renal disease.
This echocardiogram on [**6-12**] showed a small right-to-left shunt across the atrium, left ventricular function was preserved and normal size, normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient did have moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was also switched from Ticlid to Plavix for an anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] which the patient is presumably on in lieu of aspirin which he is allergic to.
TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an insulin sliding-scale and a diabetic diet with fingersticks four times per day.
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ISSUES:  The patient recently learned that he had metastases to his lungs.
