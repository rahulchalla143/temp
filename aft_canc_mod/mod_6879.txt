Wet Read: CXWc FRI [**2187-4-27**] 10:23 PM 11x6mm hyperdensity left temporal lobe could be small hemorrhagic contusion, but lack of associated traumatic findings makes this less likely.
Cannot rule out metastasis from occult primary.
Recommend f/u imaging to assess for evolution.
Final Report INDICATION: 75-year-old woman with seizure and suspected temporal hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: In the left mid temporal lobe, there is a 12 x 7 mm ovoid hyperdense lesion, without surrounding edema or mass effect.
There is no other hyperdensity to suggest other acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no edema, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemia.
There is no fracture.
There is a small amount of soft tissue density material within the left maxillary sinus, consistent with mucous retention cyst.
IMPRESSION: 12 x 7 mm hyperdensity within the left temporal lobe.
In the setting of trauma, a small hemorrhagic contusion is possible, although less likely in the absence of other sequela of trauma.
Alternatively, a metastatic lesion from an occult primary cannot be excluded.
Recommend followup imaging to assess for interval change as a traumatic lesion should evolve on short order.

Significant areas of hyperintensity signal are demonstrated in the subcortical white matter on T2 and FLAIR, likely consistent with severe chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Unchanged focus of hemorrhage identified on the left temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.6 x 10.0 mm in the transverse dimensions.
Mucosal thickening is noted on the left maxillary sinus.
A second focus of hemorrhage is identified on the right parietal lobe on the convexity (4:24) measuring approximately 3 x 4 mm in size.
CLINICAL INDICATION: 75-year-old woman with left temporal contusion and subarachnoid hemorrhage after fall in the bathroom.
Evaluate for underlying mass as described on the prior CT of the head.
In comparison with the prior CT dated [**2187-4-28**], again a focus of hemorrhage is identified on the left temporal lobe, measuring approximately 6.6 x 10.0 mm in size (4:11), the T2 and FLAIR images demonstrate multiple scattered areas of hyperintensity signal in the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes, the sulci and ventricles are prominent, likely indicating atrophy and possibly involutional in nature.
On the magnetic susceptibility sequences, multiple foci of magnetic susceptibility are demonstrated, more obvious in the occipital and parietal regions.
A few of these lesions are identified in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
On the diffusion-weighted sequences, there are punctate areas of moderate restricted diffusion raising the possibility of subacute embolic events (602:17 and 602:13).
After the administration of gadolinium contrast material, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.
In the right parietal convexity (4:24), there is a small focus of hyperintensity signal, possibly representing hemorrhagic change, measuring approximately 3.1 x 4.6 mm in size.
Mucosal thickening is observed on the left maxillary sinus with small fluid level.
Unchanged area of hemorrhage on the left temporal lobe.
Multiple foci of magnetic susceptibility signal demonstrated mainly in the parietal and occipital lobes, possibly consistent with amyloid deposits, other entities cannot be completely excluded such as micro- bleedings.
There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.
Punctate area of hyperintensity signal demonstrated on the right parietal convexity possibly consistent with focal hemorrhagic change.
Punctate areas of restricted diffusion as described in detail above, possibly consistent with subacute ischemic changes, these areas are not visualized in the corresponding ADC maps.
Multiple areas of hyperintensity signal demonstrated in the subcortical white matter as described above, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
