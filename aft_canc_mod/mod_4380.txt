He reports having the same pain in past (see discharge summary [**2127-6-27**]) with extensive workup and no etiology found.
The pain is located under his right anterior lower ribs, radiating up to mid chest and down to RUQ.
Also with cough productive of green sputum x 3 days.
Pain much worse with cough and vomiting.
Also using Zofran, ativan and Compazine which help with nausea significantly.
He has chronic edema in both legs due to prior DVT, on coumadin, he reports this is unchanged.
No other abd pain or CP.
In the ED: EKG: ST 106, NA/NI, no STEMI.
CT chest/abd with contrast done, no significant new findings.
CT torso showed an 8.9 x 8.4 cm mass in the upper pole of his right kidney with tumor thrombus extending into the right renal vein, IVC, and right iliac/femoral veins.
There was suspicion for involvement of the right adrenal gland by his primary tumor.
There was also noted to be "bulky" retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy "measuring approximately 4 cm."
Core needle biopsy of  his left supraclavicular lymph node, demonstrated papillary carcinoma, consistent with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.
Had severe nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and stomatitis around the time of completion of the 28-day cycle.
- [**2126-4-6**]: Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with severe nausea and worsening abdominal pain.
Also noted growth of his left supraclavicular lymph node.
- [**2126-4-7**]: Follow up CT demonstrated interval increase in his retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, increase of the right adrenal mass and presence of his extensive tumor thrombus throughout the right renal vein and inferior IVC up to the confluence of the hepatitic veins.
It also showed suspicion for continued deep venous thrombosis of the right common femoral and right superficial femoral veins.
- [**2126-4-29**]: Began cycle 1 of bevacizumab and temsirolimus per phase II protocol 08-184 - [**2126-6-21**]: Hospitalized with vomiting and pleuritic chest pain.
CT scan ruled out acute PE, showed overall stable disease and decreased size of the supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Found to have lower extremities DVT was started on LMWH.
- [**2126-8-19**] a CT scan torso performed after cycle #4 showed mixed behavior with overall decreased right renal mass bulk but stable and slight increased periaortic, retrocrural, mesenteric, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Stable extent of tumor/thrombus involvement of right renal vein and IVC.
- [**2126-12-30**] Torisel held due to marked worsening of lower extremities edema - [**2127-1-6**] clinical disease progression.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): .
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2127-9-5**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.

Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2127-9-6**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    ACID FAST SMEAR (Preliminary):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Scattered peripheral lung opacities persist, slightly improved in areas though cavitation in a RUL opacity is new.
These opacities are more concerning for infection as this appearance is atypical for RCC mets though metastasis cannot be excluded.
Right renal mass, large adrenal metastasis (possibly invading liver), bulky RP lymphadenopathy unchanged from [**2127-4-28**].
KUB [**9-2**]: IMPRESSION: No pneumoperitoneum.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Moderate fecal loading.
Loop of mildly prominent sigmoid within normal limits, although with slightly greater caliber; if pain were to persist, then follow-up radiographs could be considered.
ECHO [**8-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**9-1**]: INDICATION: Right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared moderate right-sided pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
In addition, there are at least two consolidations, one of which is located at the bases of the right upper lobe and one of which is located in the right lower lobe.
No pleural effusion.
No other focal parenchymal opacities.
Unchanged position of the left pectoral Port-A-Cath.
The pre-existing parenchymal opacities on the right are not substantially changed.
No evidence of tension.
CXR [**9-3**]: Interval development of minimal pneumothorax on the right side since [**2127-9-2**].
Overall increase in the right lower lung consolidation and cavitation within a more discrete consolidation concerning for breakdown in pneumonic consolidation or infected cavitary metastasis.
CXR [**9-4**]: Interval development of minimal pneumothorax on the right side since [**2127-9-2**].
Overall increase in the right lower lung consolidation and cavitation within a more discrete consolidation concerning for breakdown in pneumonic consolidation or infected cavitary metastasis.
Marked improvement in the right pneumothorax with trace apical pneumothorax visualized on the current examination, although lucency at the right lung base raises concern for air within the costophrenic sulcus.
There continues to be a diffuse airspace process within the right lung.
The left lung is clear, although there is likely a small left effusion.
Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema within overlying the right lateral soft tissues likely related to chest tube placement.
Left subclavian Port-A-Cath is again seen with the tip in the SVC.
There continues to be a right apical pneumothorax which appears larger than on the previous study from 5:12 a.m.
Right mid and lower lung airspace disease with a component of possible cavitation is essentially unchanged.
Lungs volumes remain low with patchy opacity at the left base, which likely represents atelectasis as this was not previously appreciated on the most recent comparison.
Patchy opacity at the right base is again seen and unchanged in appearance.
There is a persistent small right apical pneumothorax, which is stable.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 M with history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma presented with 1 day of pleuritic RUQ pain.
# R chest/RUQ pain: On admission, CT abd/chest showed no acute pathology apart from continued large tumor burden on right side.
He was noted to have had a similar presentation in [**Month (only) 116**], at which time etiology was not elucidated: no PE, negative cardiac enzymes and EKG, bedside swallow eval negative, bone scan negative, bronchoscopy [**2127-6-26**] was unremarkable, no organisms on gram-stain.
Given CT findings, current presentation was thought to be either chemo induced pneumonitis (with steroid benefit), or a possible infectious process in the lungs.
It was felt that the CT findings were consistent with his oncologic process, and that given his significant evaluation during the previous admission for the same complaints, that it appears safe to initiate a trial of steroids.
His Oxycontin was uptitrated from 80 TID to 100 mg po TID, due to persistent pain rated approx [**8-17**].
Pt noted that much of his pain medication dosing is limited by nausea with increasing dosage.
# Metastatic renal cell CA: On bevacizumab and temsirolimus (Torisel).
Due to CKD/ chronic disease.
52 year old male with metastatic RCC, PTX [**3-12**] cavitary lung lesion s/p chest tube, transferred to the ICU with worsening tachypnea and O2 says, pleuritic chest/abd pain and new right lung infiltrates on CXR.
R pneumothorax was monitored & noted to wax and wane, especially worsening when the chest tube was changed from suction to water seal.
# R PNA/empyema/bronchopleural fistula Given his worsening tachypnea and increasing oxygen requirement s/p chest tube placement for PTX, there was concern for an additional pulmonary process.
Continued air leak despite re-expansion of PTX pointed toward development of a bronchopleural fistula, with contribution of splinting and low minute ventilation secondary to pleuritic pain.
CXR also showed new right middle and lower lobe infiltrates w/known cavitating R lung lesion (per prior CT), which likely contributed to his increased O2 requirement, as they have not been treated up to this point.
BAL fluid and pleural fluid were collected during the procedure and sent for culture and studies - they eventually grew coag+ staph.
However, over the next two days the patient developed an increasing O2 requirement to maximum high-flow oxygen, and serial CXRs showed worsening loculated empyema, with thick purulent drainage from the chest tube.
Transient fluid-responsive hypotension and decreased urine output were thought to be manifestations of sepsis secondary to the complicated pulmonary infection.
Patient had previously indicated that he would not want to be resuscitated, but would be OK with short-term intubation.
Primary oncologist confirmed Full Code status with patient.
Palliative care was consulted and followed the patient for symptom management, given the lack of further onc treatment options and need for pain management during acute pulmonary developments.
He was pain free on a PO regimen of 120 oxycontin TID, 300 mg gabapentin qHS, and dilaudid IV 2-3 mg q2H PRN.
#Nutrition: Patient noted to have poor PO intake.
Appetite likely limited by breathing difficulties and malignancy.
# Lower extremity edema [**3-12**] DVTs: Multifactorial with low albumin, known DVTs (on coumadin), and possible burden of known bulky lymphadenopathy in pelvis.
Cardiac etiology also possible given the pericardial effusion, but there does not appear to be any tamponade physiology on exam or TTE.
# Metastatic renal cell CA: On bevacizumab and temsirolimus (Torisel) prior to admission.
Initially deferred further treatment decisions to the primary oncology team, who discussed with the patient that there are no other chemotherapy options.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Known renal cell CA with prior baseline 1.3-1.7.
The acute rise in his creatinine are likely pre-renal secondary to decreased intake from pain, but could also be ATN [**3-12**] hypotension or post-renal.
He was given fluid boluses for low urine output.
Labs showed hyponatremia with low urinary sodium, suggesting dehydration.
# Pericardial effusion: Likely malignant and without tamponade by exam (no appreciable pulsus, mild JVD, and clear heart sounds without a rub) or Echo, but tachycardic and with mildly decreased BPs.
# Abdominal pain: Exam worsened early in admission, but we suspected that pleuritic pain was responsible.
Exam without rebound, only mild guarding.
No signs of peritonitis or free air on CXR.
Worsening lactate (1.7) likely due to general malperfusion.
# Microcytic anemia: Chronic, stable MCV 74-75.
Likely due to chronic kidney disease with an element of possible malabsorption/iron deficiency.
# CAD: History of CAD with DES placed in [**2123**].

You were admitted with increased pain in your right chest and abdomen.
You were found to have a severe necrotizing pneumonia with a connection between the space around your lung and one of your airways.
Additionally, you were found to have a collection of pus surrounding your right lung.
We treated you with antibiotics and helped to control your chest pain so you could cough more to clear the infection.
Given your poor lung condition and metastatic cancer, you, your family, and our medical team all agreed that it would be in your best interest to transition to hospice care with making comfort a top priority.
You will go to hospice with pain medication, and will no longer be on antibiotics or have a chest tube in place.
