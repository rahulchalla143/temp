No crackles or egophany.
No rales ABD: distented, soft, tympanitic to percussion, minimal HSM EXTRM: chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally with cracked, scaling, erythematous skin on dorsal aspect of BLE up to mid-shin, 1+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Skin is warm with slight cooling in lower extremities; minimal peripheral edema NODES: 2x2 cm, mobile node in left axilla; no LAD in clavicular, para-aortic, or inguinal nodes.
FINDINGS: There is a moderate-to-severe right-sided pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion.
There is no other interval change.
IMPRESSION: A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion .
There are bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on the left, unchanged.
No pneumothorax identified.
Bibasilar atelectasis persists.
[**2110-10-22**] IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-21**]: Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the right and moderate on the left, has increased in volume.
There is new atelectasis or conceivably consolidation in the lateral aspect of the right mid lung, which should be reassessed following decrease in pleural fluid.
Heart size is obscured by pleural effusion, but has not changed in the interim.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2110-10-24**] History of right upper lobectomy and shortness of breath.
There is loss of volume on the right with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and shift of heart and mediastinum to the right.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
There is persistent ill-defined opacity at the right lung base.
In addition, there is ill-defined opacity in the left lower zone that is either new or was partly hidden by the left pleural effusion on the prior film.
No definite pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar pulmonary opacities consistent with atelectases/consolidation.
No pneumothorax.
[**2110-10-25**] LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS CHEST: A small pleural effusion is seen, loculated, on the right.
EKG: sinus vs sinus arrythmia, tachy, rate 104; nl axis; no LVH, nl qwaves or ischemic changes .
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80 yo lady w/ remote br ca, NHL w/ lung recurrence and s/p RUL lobectomy, here w/ shortness of breath; re-accumulation of pleural effusions.
1. dyspnea: likely [**3-5**] growing effusions in setting of erratic lasix dosing.
Patient was afebrile during the admission and did not need to be on antibiotics.
On HOD#6, patient had bilateral thoracenteses of her pleural effusions (after reducing her INR with 5mg vit K).
Patient had a questionable pneumothorax - very small in RLL.
Repeat CXR could not rule out a loculated pneumothorax - hence a lateral decubitus film was sent which showed:A small pleural effusion is seen, loculated, on the right.
currently back in sinus arrythmia with stable BP  alternates between afib and sinus arrhythmia.
Heart healthy/ low sodium diet.
