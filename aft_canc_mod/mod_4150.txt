During the procedure, there appeared to be a perforation of the common bile duct by the stent, as dye was visualized extraluminally.

They removed the stent that had been placed at the outside hospital, and placed a stent across the common bile duct.
She complained of abdominal pain, which was in contrast to her pain free presentation at the time of admission.
The CT scan showed a large amount of air in the retroperitoneum extending into the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissues.
There was no definite evidence of intraperitoneal air.
Multiple pulmonary emboli were noted in the right lower lobe, as was a small right-sided pneumothorax.
Her abdominal pain resolved.
She was started on subcutaneous heparin, but she was not fully anticoagulated for the finding of pulmonary emboli because she had active GI bleeding (bleeding noted at the time of ERCP and guaiac postive stools).
On [**5-1**], she was transfused with two units of blood for blood loss anemia.
There were no clots or vegetations.
On [**5-5**], lower extremity doppler ultrasound was performed to look for evidence of deep vein thrombosis, since she had known pulmonary emboli.
A pulmonary consult was obtained to determine the risks versus benefits of long term anticoagulation.
They recommended 6 months of anticoagulation, but given the fact that she still had active loss of blood from her GI tract and because she was at increased risk for falls based on her age and health status, they agreed that IVC filter placement would be adequate treatment/prevention for the time being.
On [**5-16**], she underwent a colonoscopy which was unremarkable - no evidence of cancer, bleeding or collitis, diverticulosis, but no diverticulitis  Medications on Admission: digoxin 0.25 daily lasix 20mg po every other day allopurinol 300mg daily omeprazole 20mg daily enalapril 20mg daily probenacid [**Hospital1 **] atenolol 50mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
