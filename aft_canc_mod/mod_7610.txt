He first noted symptoms in late [**2131-11-6**] including mid-epigastric pain, heartburn, dysphagia and weight loss.
His symptoms however progressed and in [**Month (only) 1096**] he started having nausea/vomiting initially only to solids and then with liquids.
During this time he also developed heavy sweats during the day and night.
Due to severe pain and inability to tolerate PO, he presented to the ED at LGH and was admitted for dehydration and further work-up.
CT abd/pelvis [**2132-1-7**] revealed a 3.8 X 5.0 cm soft tissue mass at GE junction as well as diffuse soft tissue deposits and adrenal nodules.
The following day, [**2132-1-8**] he underwent EGD and biopsy of the mass from OSH reports low grade adenocarcinoma.

IMAGING/STUDIES: PET SCAN [**2132-1-11**]: IMPRESSION: Remarkably extensive focal FDG-avid lesions, predominantly in the musculature throughout the head, neck, and torso, but note should be made of FDG-avid lesions in the brain, bilateral adrenals, bone, and peritoneum.
Differential diagnosis includes melanoma, atypical lymphoma, and other aggressive neoplastic disease.
Extensive granulomatous disease may also be considered.
Biopsy of nodules or the esophagus would be helpful for a more definitive diagnosis.
MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2132-1-13**]: FINDINGS: There is a hemorrhagic mass measuring 2.2 x 2.4 cm in the right cerebellum with a small satellite nodule adjacent to it, compatible with metastatic disease.
There is edema surrounding the lesion with mass effect on the fourth ventricle which is partially effaced.
No hydrocephalus is present at this time supratentorially.
IMPRESSION: Cerebellar metastatic lesions as detailed, with mass effect on the fourth ventricle which is partially effaced.
No evidence for acute hydrocephalus at this time.
CXR [**2132-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of superior mediastinal mass, no cardiac enlargement, no pulmonary congestion, and no acute pulmonary infiltrates on this preoperative chest examination .
CEREBELLAR TUMOR BIOPSY: .
NOTE: The sections show an adenocarcinoma composed of columnar cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism arranged in villous to solid architecture involving cerebellar parenchyma.
Overall, the morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics are consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal origin.
Note is made of patient's history of esophageal/gastric adenocarcinoma.
MRI HEAD [**2132-1-18**]: IMPRESSION: Cerebellar metastatic lesions involving both cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left side as described above, unchanged from prior study.
CT HEAD [**2132-1-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of large hemorrhage.
MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2132-1-19**]: IMPRESSION: Since the previous study, patient has undergone resection of right-sided cerebellar lesion.
Blood products and edema are seen.
No change in the mass effect on the fourth ventricle noted or evidence of hydrocephalus seen.
No acute infarct.
The right upper mediastinal stripe thickening is consistent with known lymphadenopathy as well as right hilar involvement.
There is new opacity in the left mid lower lung, worrisome for developing infectious process in this location, most likely in the lingula.
There is no appreciable right pleural effusion but small left pleural effusion is seen and might reflect parapneumonic fluid.
TISSUE PATHOLOGY FROM GE JUNCTION MASS SENT FROM [**Hospital1 **] FOR REVIEW: Gastroesophageal junction, biopsy (2 consult slides labeled S12-43, procedure date [**2132-1-8**], [**Hospital6 3105**], [**Hospital1 487**], MA):  Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, at least intramucosal; no submucosal tissue present for evaluation.
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM [**2132-1-25**] Distal esophageal stricture with holdup of the passage of contrast; however, this is patent to both thin and thick barium with some delay, with the residual contrast cleared by drinking water.

BRIEF HISTORY PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO OMED: 42 y/o male with a 30+ pk year smoking history who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3105**] and admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2132-1-9**] for evaluation of a 3-4 cm mass at the GE junction.
He first noted symptoms in late [**2131-11-6**] including mid-epigastric pain, heartburn, dysphagia and weight loss.
His symptoms however progressed and in [**Month (only) 1096**] he started having nausea/vomiting initially only to solids and then with liquids.
During this time he also developed heavy sweats during the day and night.
Due to severe pain and inability to tolerate PO, he presented to the ED at LGH and was admitted for dehydration and further work-up.
CT abd/pelvis [**2132-1-7**] revealed a 3.8 X 5.0 cm soft tissue mass at GE junction as well as diffuse soft tissue deposits and adrenal nodules.
The following day, [**2132-1-8**] he underwent EGD and biopsy of the mass from OSH reports low grade adenocarcinoma.
A PET CT on [**2132-1-11**] showed extensive, diffuse FDG-avid lesions, predominantly in the musculature throughout the head, neck, and torso but also in the bone and brain.
Overall, he is felt to have widely metastatic disease, including musculature, bones, lungs, cardiac, adrenal as well as CNS metastases (notable for partial effacement of the 4th ventricle).
Patient had ultrasound-guided right gluteal intra-muscular nodule biopsy on [**2132-1-14**].
This returned as positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
On [**1-18**], pt underwent posterior craniotomy for resection R cerebellar mass, as there was partial effacement of the 4th ventricle with mass effect.
Radiation oncology was consulted for WBXRT or Cyberknife as well.
=========== #Esophageal v Gastric Cancer with known metastasis including to the brain: History as above, patient had several biopsies consistent with adenocarcinoma of gastric origin.
Radiation Oncology was consulted regarding treatment options, and will be seeing the patient on an outpatient basis for further evaluation.
Patient's biopsy results from mass at LGH was requested and sent here for further review to assist with onc treatment and planning.
Repeat MRI/CT did not show hydrocephalus, c/w with postop changes, no hemorrhage.
His cerebellar biopsy was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
#Leukocytosis: Patient with WBC in the 40's on presentation to OMED, trending upwards since admission.
While he is on steroids, he has been on a taper which is less likely causing this, patient could also have stress response to recent surgery but is still trending upwards.
Patient had an infectious workup, no growth on blood or urine cultures.
#Thrombocytopenia: Patient with downward trending platelets since admission from 200's now to low 100's with eventual nadir in low 100's.
