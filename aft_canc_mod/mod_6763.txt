History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 82412**] is a 77 year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, diabetes transferred on [**5-18**] from [**Hospital 82413**] hospital for evaluation of confusion and neck stiffness.
At that time, he complained on bilateral neck pain and a sore throat.
He was felt to have torticollis and was discharged with flexeril and percocet.
He was still complaining of neck pain, but was having visual hallucinations of things/people in his house.
His daughter called his PCP at which point they attributed his symptoms to the medication changes and percocet/flexeril was discontinued.
He appeared extremely fatigued and was sleeping more.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response w/HR of 160; it is unclear what medications were changed at this time.
During this admission at Carnitas, he was noted to have low grade fevers and a elevated wbc (12.6).
[**Month/Year (2) **] cultures grew gram positive bacteria - veilonella in [**2-8**] bottles ([**2-6**] anaerobic [**Month/Day (2) **] cx).
Echo (TTE) was performed and was negative for vegitation.
Due to persistent neck pain, the patient had a Head CT that showed enlarged ventricles but nothing acute.
MRI showed hyperintense T2 signal in the left paraspinal muscles; no evidence of abcess or osteomyelitis.
On arrival, the patient continues to have a sore throat and next pain.
Continues to have bad sore throat and headache radiating from his neck.
He reports occasional double vision but no photophobia; he reports visual hallucinations (seeing people, animals) but denies auditory or gustatory or other sensory hallucinations.
He has not noticed any rashes; denues weakness beyond his baseline residual polio weakness.
He has never had any symptoms like this before.

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary): FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):  NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Fluid collection posterior to the vertebral body at C2 level and involving the craniocervical junction and odontoid process as described in detail above with significant pattern of enhancement and soft tissue swelling, impinging and producing the thecal sac without [**Known firstname **] evidence of signal abnormality with the cervical spinal cord.
Epidural abscess at the level of the vertebral body of C2 is a consideration with associated abnormality in the odontoid process, the possibility of osteomyelitis versus infiltration at this level is a consideration.
Abnormal pattern enhancement and epidural fluid collection posterior to the vertebral body at C2 level, impinging the thecal sac and the spinal cord as described previously on the MRI of the cervical spine, likely consistent with an abscess.
Soft tissue edema is identified anteriorly and posteriorly at the level of T2 level, please refer to the dedicated MRI of the cervical spine for details.
Heterogeneous pattern of enhancement is noted in the base of the odontoid process on the right, raising the possibility of infiltration or osteomyelitis, correlation with CT of the cervical spine is recommended for further assessment.
The previously noted fluid collection and abnormal enhancement at the craniocervical junction is not clearly identified, please refer to the dedicated MRI of the cervical spine and neck for details.
Possible abnormal enhancement noted in the right internal auditory canal, raising the possibility of an intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma, correlation with a dedicated MRI of the posterior fossa with contrast is recommended if clinically warranted.
Multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity distributed in the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Mild patchy mucosal thickening noted in the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Multilevel disc degenerative changes as described in detail above, more significant from L2/L3 through L5/S1 levels.
Lytic lesion within the dens and C2 vertebral body, with partial destruction of the anterior and posterior cortices.
No other bone lesions seen.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
4 mm thyroid nodule.
If indicated, the degree of stenosis in the cervical left internal carotid artery may be better assessed by ultrasound.
Unchanged epidural abscess posterior to C2.
Unchanged compression of the spinal cord by the epidural abscess at C2, without evidence of cord signal abnormalities.
Transthoracic Echo ([**5-23**]): No valvular vegetations seen.
Increased size of lytic lucency in the C2 odontoid process with increased posterior cortical destruction.
Despite the increased lytic lucency which is concerning for osteomyelitis, there is normal anatomic alignment of the odontoid process without fracture or dislocation.
Persistent epidural collection posterior to C2, less apparent on this non- contrast-enhanced study, but there is persistent indentation and compression of the thecal sac.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST ([**5-26**]): Slight interval decrease in size of epidural abscess at C2 with decreased mass effect on the cord.
No definite cord hyperintensity is seen.
Post op changes with a fluid collection along the lamina/spinous process from C2-C4 which may represent a seroma but superimposed infection cannot  be excluded.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**5-30**]): Improvement but onoing severe dyphagia with aspiration of thin liquids.
Neck Pain/Stiffness: Patient had persistent neck pain and stiffness on transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2108-5-18**], with no new focal neurological deficits (patient has baseline right upper extremity weakness from a prior polio infection).
Patient had a CT and MRI scan of the cervical spine on [**2108-5-20**] that showed an epidural abscess at the level of the C2 vertebral body with probable osteomyelitis involving the odontoid process.
There was impingement of the thecal sac without signal abnormality of the spinal cord.
ENT was consulted on [**5-21**] and felt the abscess was most likely from hematogenous seeding, with no clear fistula tract or upper airway gross lesion.
The MRI showed unchanged epidural abscess posterior to C2, unchanged osteomyelitis of odontoid process, and unchanged spinal cord compression from prior study.
Orthopedic spine decided to schedule surgery for [**5-25**] given no resolution of abscess after conservative management.
Patient had stat CT C-spine, which showed increased cortical destruction of the posterior and anterior aspect of the dens, with no displacement or fracture.
Patient was typed and screened for [**Date Range **], given 2 units FFP, maintained NPO except for BP meds.
Patient did recover to [**4-8**] LE strength after patient repositioned head within cervical collar and rested hands on top of head.
Pus was drained from the C2 site, but no hardware was placed due to risk of infection.
Patient was transferred to the PACU, and due to difficulty extubating the patient, he was then transferred to the SICU on [**5-25**].
His SICU course was complicated by post-operative delirium, which improved over the next few days.
His strength in his lower extremities returned to 5-/5, and his pain was well-controlled with the hard collar in place and oxycodone.
On [**5-30**], infectious disease recommended discontinuing clindamycin and ceftriaxone, and transitioning to ceftriaxone and flagyl given the patient developed diarrhea on [**5-30**].
-- Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] of Orthopedic Surgery.
Bacteremia/Leukocytosis: Patient was afebrile on transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], with a leukocytosis of 21k.
Ceftriaxone was started on [**5-20**] to for polymicrobial coverage.
Given history of unprotected intercourse, RPR and chlamydia tests were sent and were negative.
Patient had a transthoracic echo on [**5-23**] that showed no valvular vegetations.
On request, [**Hospital 1263**] hospital transferred the [**Hospital **] sample on [**5-24**] to [**Hospital1 18**], and the sample was sent out to [**Hospital1 **] for sensitivity testing.
Patient was afebrile throughout hospital course.
Dysphagia - Patient was noted to have difficulty swallowing on transfer to medicine service on [**5-22**].
On [**5-23**], the video swallow was obtained and showed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin and nectar thick liquids.
The etiology of his dysphagia was most likely due to his epidural abscess with underlying osteomyelitis, with further impairment from his hard collar.
Nutriton was consulted and initated tube feeds with no complications.
Repeat video swallow showed improved swallowing function from previous video swallow on [**5-23**], but with continued risk of aspiration.
Atrial fibrillation - Patient's atrial fibrillation was well rate-controlled on the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Orthopedic spine recommended holding any anti-coagulation or antithrombotics pending decision on need for surgical intervention.
Patient was noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate in the low 100s on [**5-22**].
Patient's INR increased from 1.3 on [**5-18**] to 1.6 on [**5-24**], most likely due to nutritional deficiency.
Hypertension - Patient was hypertensive with systolics in the 160s on day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Patient was noted to be hypertensive again on [**5-23**] with systolic in the 160s, and his lopressor was up-titrated.
Urinary incontinence - Patient first reported urinary incontinence on [**5-24**], which coincided with his weakness in the lower extremities and thus was concerning for spinal cord compression.
Patient reported a return of his urinary incontinence on [**5-29**].
Diabetes - Metformin was held and an insulin sliding scale was started.
Diarrhea - Overnight on [**5-30**], patient had several loose bowel movements and was incontinent.
The acute onset of diarrhea in a patient on Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone was concerning for C.difficile infection.
Patient is likely at increased risk for loose stools due to tube feeds.
Gout/Knee pain - Home dose of colchine was continued until patient went to OR [**5-24**].
After patient developed diarrhea on [**5-29**], the colchicine was discontinued given possible contribution to loose bowel movements.
On [**5-31**], patient developed new onset of left knee pain.
On exam, the knee joint was warm without palpable effusion, with pain on active and passive ROM.
Given his history of bacteremia, there was a concern for septic arthritis and thus knee arthrocentesis was attempted.
There was no drainable fluid on arthrocentesis after 3 attempts.
The lack of effusion was more convincing that patient's knee pain was most likely a recurrence of his gout, especially given patient was recently taken off his Colchicine.
Colchicine was held given the ongoing diarrhea, and pain was managed with Ibuprofen 600 mg Q8H.
Anxiety: Stopped diazepam to minimize altering medications.
-- monitor for anxiety  11.
Skin: Provided skin care with special attention to buttocks (stage II pressure ulcer at coccyx).
Right vestibular schwannoma - Asymptomatic, noted on MRI of the brain.
Pain Control: Ibuprofen standing and oxycodone liquid prn  The patient was FULL CODE during this hospitalization.
