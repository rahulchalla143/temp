**FINAL REPORT [**2100-6-9**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2100-6-9**]):    NO GROWTH.
No pulmonary embolism or acute intra-abdominal process.
Numerous bilateral bronchovascular ground-glass opacities, right greater than left, similar to or minimally increased from [**2100-5-27**].
Smooth interlobular septal thickening and slight bronchial wall thickening.
This combination of findings is potentially due to bronchopneumonia with a component of pulmonary congestion.
However, organizing pneumonia or small foci of hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Numerous lytic osseous lesions, similar to prior, involving lower lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones.
Eccentric soft and calcified abdominal aortic plaques.
[][**6-7**] CXR: no intrathoracic process   Brief Hospital Course: []BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with PMH notable for metastatic cancer (unknown primary) undergoing chemo, being treated for LE cullitis, presenting with lighheadedness [**12-17**] hypotension, s/p ICU transfer.
[]ISSUES: # Hypotension: Pt presented to the ED with lightheadedness and was found to have systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
Although afebrile, pt may not have been able to mount a white count and therefore might have remained afebrile despite infection.
Likely not obstructive shock as pt with negative CTA and negative LENIs.
Cardiogenic shock also unlikely given normal baseline EKG.
Urine culture showed no growth.
He remained afebrile until discharge and was no longer orthostatic.
Pt had episode of hemoptysis 4 days prior to admission.
After significant fluid resuscitation in ED will likely have dilutional anemia.
H/o rectal bleeding so this was considered a possible source.
The patient was also on gemcitabine which suppresses the bone marrow which is consistent with his low retic count of 0.2.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic inflammation (normocytic, high ferritin, low TIBC and low transferrin).
There was moderate improvement in the erythema and swelling of the left lower extremity by the time of admission.
# Malignant epithelioid cancer of unknown primary (possibly carcinoma per path report):  Patient received 2nd of 8 scheduled XRT while in house with f/u to complete the final 6 sessions.
# Hypothyroidism: -Continued on outpatient levothyroxine  # Asthma: -Continued on outpatient flovent, albuterol PRN  # Depression: -Continued on outpatient fluoxetine  # GERD: -Continued on outpatient pantoprazole  # HLD: -Continued outpatient simvastatin, niacin  []TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1.)
