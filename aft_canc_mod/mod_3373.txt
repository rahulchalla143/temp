Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control.

Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control.
[**2141-3-27**], VSS overnight.
Retroperitoneal fluid collection and primarily in the posterior pararenal space now demonstrates no drain and appears larger than previous study.

Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control  [**2141-3-28**], patient had an episode of BP drop below 90's, was given Albumin w/ good BP response.
