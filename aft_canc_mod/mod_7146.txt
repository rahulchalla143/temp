She did not appear to have any evidence of acidosis.
Given lack of ketones in her urine, this all suggested hyperosmolar non-ketonic state, without evidence of DKA.
Prior to this she had no known history of diabetes mellitus or glucose impairment.
The hyperglycemia may all be related to her steroids or could also represent unmasking of type two diabetes mellitus (HgA1c 7.9).
CXR without clear infectious etiology, UA negative, no other suggestion of infection as precipitating factor by history.
The pt also continued to complain of blurry vision which was thought to be secondary to her hyperglycemia.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted, Was started on lantus 10U qam, metformin started/increased to 1000/500 (will need to monitor LFTs given underlying cholestatic liver disease).
She was given diabetes teaching by nutrition and nursing, and was asked to call [**Last Name (un) **] after discharge to arrange a follow up appointment.
#) Acute renal failure: The pt's ARF resolved with IV fluid rescuscitation.
#) Anion gap/Osmolar gap: Suspect that this was in large part due to renal failure and dehydration.
#) Hypertension: BP meds initially held in setting of ARF and volume depletion.
#) Thrush: Treated with Nistatin swish and swallow, suspect this is secondary to steroid use and concurrent hyperglycemia .
Visual acuity as noted in ED, fundoscopic exam without gross abnormalities.
No eye pain or redness to suggest acute angle closure glaucoma or other acute process.
Instructed to f/u ophtho ASAP if does not improve in next few days, and needs regular f/u as well for DM .
#) Chest discomfort: Patient has a history of left-sided chest pain that has been evaluated by her PCP and was felt to be costochrondritis in the past.
No convincing ischemic changes on EKG and CE were negative for ACS.
#) Left arm pain: Pt complained of a tingling sensation in her left arm extending from the palm of her hand to her elbow.
She stated that this pain started after a painful IV attempt in the ICU in which she felt tingling in her arm afterwards.
On examination, this seemed to be consistent with trauma of one of her nerves, so tylenol/heat packs recommended.
