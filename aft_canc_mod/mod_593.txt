Admission Date:  [**2100-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2100-10-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2028-2-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea/Hypoxia requiring NRB.
M with nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis diagnosed by CT in [**2094**] (no biopsy in system), small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**5-/2100**], s/p chemotherapy and radiation, presents with progressive shortness of breath.
He recently saw his oncologist on [**10-5**] where he was "clearly hypoxic" though no vital signs recorded.
Plan also included pt seeing his pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to consider the role of possible steroids for his pulmonary disease as well as possible radiation pneumonitis and the role of steroids for this.
Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonitis (NSIP) 2.
COPD 3. s/p tonsillectomy 4.
Pulmonary scarring .
The patient presented in [**4-/2100**] with progressive difficulty walking, ataxia, weight loss and shortness of breath.
A CT scan done on [**2100-5-13**] showed a large right paratracheal mass and right upper lobe spiculated nodule.
Bronchoscopy on [**2100-5-17**] showed a negative brushings; however, a fine needle biopsy done in 4R station was positive for small cell lung cancer.
Staging PET CT done on [**2100-5-24**] showed FDG avid right upper lobe nodule measuring 16 mm with an SUV of 9.3.
There was a large FDG avid conglomerate nodal mass in the right paratracheal region having an SUV max of 14.2.
There was a mild tracer uptake in the prevascular node with an SUV of 3.7.
Additionally, there was a low level uptake in the L4-L5 area on the right side and in the T8 vertebral body, but they are likely due to degenerative changes in the spine.
Staging head MRI done on [**2100-5-15**] showed no evidence of brain metastasis.
Lumbar puncture on [**2100-5-31**] showed that the CSF was negative for malignant cells.

Background interstitial lung disease compatible with NSIP and emphysema, with continued increase in areas of ground-glass attenuation and  peribronchovascular airspace opacification and consolidation, which is most notable in the left upper lobe as well as the lower lobes.
Findings again concerning for superimposed infection or inflammation (such as drug reaction), or acute worsening of the patient's underlying NSIP.
Pulmonary edema is considered less likely, and there is no pleural effusion.
No pulmonary embolus seen.
[**10-11**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with overall low normal systolic function.
[**10-14**] CXR: The recently developed acute area of opacification in the left retrocardiac region has improved, and may be due to a resolving area of acute aspiration.
Other widespread pulmonary opacities are unchanged allowing for slight differences in lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory distress: Initially admitted to MICU, chest x-ray showed bilateral hazy opacities, lymphadenopathy, and a background of chronic interstitial lung disease.
Echo revealed mild LVH.
On [**10-15**], a meeting was held during which the patient became DNR/DNI and focus was shifted to the patient's comfort, with IV morphine and pleasure feeds.
The dyspnea was ultimately felt to be multi-factorial, including worsening nonspecific interstial pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, progression of lung cancer, or infection.
Discussions were held between the patient, HCP, primary team, & palliative care, during which the patient & HCP ultimately favored transitioning to hospice.
#Hyponatremia: Thought by MICU team to be secondary to poor PO intake.
# Small Cell Lung Cancer: Lymphadenopathy on admission chest imaging was believed to be consistent with his known cancer.
Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], who reported that the cancer responded to treatment but if this was radiation pneumonitis and if it did not respond to steroid initially that there was little hope of improvement.
# Anemia: Hct at baseline 31-33. .
# Neuropathy/Back pain/tooth pain: The patient received morphine, acetaminophen, fentanyl and viscous lidocaine.
