HEENT: Sclera anicteric, moist mucus membranes, oropharynx clear  Lungs: Diffuse expiratory crackles, more pronounced at the bases.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, hyperactive bowel sounds, mild distention, no rebound tenderness or guarding Ext: Warm, well perfused .

Friable tissue and necrotic tissue were seen at the distal end of the stent suspicious for residual cancer.
[**2169-6-17**] CXR: Left lower lobe opacities have increased worrisome for aspiration.
Right lower lobe and right mid lung opacities are more chronic and stable.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
[**2169-6-18**] EGD: A large bulk of friable tissue was seen within the stent at the distal end.
The blood clots were fragmented with combination of snare and spiral basket.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for the tumor tissue destruction with majority of tissue within the stent successfully coagulated.
Friable tumor tissue and necrotic tissue was also seen distal to the metal stent.
[**2169-6-18**] LLE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity.
The patient reported intense knee pain during the study, exacerbated by flexion.
No obstructing mass.
Opacification of the trachea with barium indicating either aspiration or tracheoesophageal fistula at the level of the carina (proximal end of the stent), as described above.
[**2169-6-20**] VIDEO SWALLOW: IMPRESSION: No evidence of aspiration.
[**2169-6-22**] CXR: Interval appearance of the left lower lobe consolidation and left pleural effusion concerning for pneumonia  .
Near complete obstruction by malignant-appearing tissues, suggesting remaining cancer, at the distal end of the stent.
A 153 mm x 18 mm fully covered WallFlex esophageal metal stent successfully placed under fluoroscopic guidance.
DISCHARGE LABS:  Brief Hospital Course: 58yoM with Stage III esophageal CA and PEs on warfarin s/p EGD and Bx of mass [**2169-6-16**] in the setting of supratherapeutic INR who was admitted to the ICU for observation after he vomitted 75cc of BRB post-procedure.
he had no recurrent episodes of hematemesis or melena.H/H remained overall stable .Given evidence of esophagitis on biopsy of esophagus , pt was  started on IV protonix [**Hospital1 **] .
# Esophageal CA: Pt underwent an EGD on [**6-16**] because of inability to swallow his saliva or  liquids.
EGD showed evidence of a mass causing near complete obstruction.
Biospies were aobtained and showed esophaigitis and atypical cells.
Repeat EGD done on [**2169-6-18**] and mass in the stent was coagulated.
# PNA /TE fistula: Pt with cough after drinking post EGD on [**2169-6-18**].Barium esophogram shows evidence of TE fistula.
CXR on [**2169-6-22**] showed evidence a new lll infiltrate and pt started on cefepime/vancomycin and flagyl.
#Gout : Pt with gout flare with knee pain and rt shoulder, bilateral toe pain.
Low dose allopurinol was continued.. .

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to the hospital after vomiting blood after an upper endoscopy.
The endoscopy was done because of diffulty swallowing and showed an obstructuion of your esophagus.
You also developed a left lower lobe pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration from the fistula.
Lansoprazole 30mg 2x a day (this medication takes the place of omeprazole (Prilosec) because it dissolves in your mouth and avoids having to swallow another pill that might have difficulty passing the esophageal stent).
