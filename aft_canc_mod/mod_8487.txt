PLEURAL FLUID CYTOLOGY: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: Small amount of residual debris in the pericardium.
No evidence of tamponade.
Small LV cavity with hyperdynamic function, a mild LVOT gradient that increases slightly with Valsalva.
There is minimal pericardial fluid left with some organized elements at the RV apex and RV outflow tract.
Unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, somewhat improved on the left.
Persistent cardiomegaly with decreased pericardial effusion.
Multilevel degenerative anterior wedge compression fractures as before.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures, with equalization of RA, RV, PCWP, and pericardial pressures (RA mean 19 mm Hg, RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PCWP mean 22 mm Hg, and pericardial pressure 20 mm Hg).
There was a blunted y descent.
The pulmonary vascular resistance was mildly elevated (218 dynes-sec/cm5).
However, pericardial pressure remained mildly elevated.
Pericardial tamponade.
Biventricular diatolic dysfunction.
Large cardiac silhouette unchanged, left lower lobe atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are improving.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old with PMH of CAD s/p stent placement and meningioma was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and fatigue.
Had an echo and CTA which showed a left pleural effusion & a small pericardial effusion w/ possible diastolic dysfunction.
She came back [**10-15**] after having a large increase in cough and sob.
She has also had chronic diarrhea ([**3-31**] BM per day) plus vomiting x 2 overnight.
CT of chest shows worsening pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, etiology unknown.
TTE showed evidence of tamponade w/ RV diastolic collapse.
Also had new onset Afib this admission treated w/ IV Amiodarone now transitioned to PO.
# effusions - Unclear etiology; could be viral vs. cardiac etiology.
Thoracentesis revealed high LDH but otherwise transudative in nature.
# hypoxia: No signs of pneumonia or PE on CTA.
Most likely due to a combination of pleural and pericardial effusion/atelectasis on imaging and exam.
Influenza negative.
# atrial fibrillation: In atrial fibrillation on admission with no prior history.
# Leukocytosis: stable; unclear etiology but infectious etiology remains a possibility although no organism identified to date.
Pt has elevated WBC on discharge but otherwise stable, likely [**1-29**] UTI.
# CAD: No signs of ischemia on EKG or CEZ.
Known chronic hyponatremia.
[**Month (only) 116**] have dCHF contributing to her current worsening of hyponatremia.
# Hypothyroidism - Continue home levothyroxine.
