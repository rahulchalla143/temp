Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 y/o with CAD, DM, h/o gastritis, and recent ascending colon polyopectomy presenting with 1 day of BRBPR.
BRBPR: The temporal correlation with recent polyopectomy on [**2133-10-15**] and onset of painless BRBPR makes post-polypectomy bleeding most likely.
The presence of BRBPR from a site in the ascending colon suggest a brisk rate of bleeding.
The onset with diarrhea makes infection possible, however less likely without abd pain, leukocytosis, or fever.
UGI bleed is possible given h/o gastritis but unlikely given recent normal EGD.
Pt has h/o grade 1 hemmirhoids on past colonoscopy, but not noted on most recent Colonoscopy.
In addition no diverticulosis noted on colonoscopy.
GI was consulted and felt by the time she was in the ICU, she did not appear to be bleeding and was hemodynamically stable.
Upon arrival to the medical floor, her HCT remained stable x36hrs without transfusion.
Her diet was advanced without difficulty.
She was instructed to resume aspirin 1 day after discharge, but to avoid NSAIDs until she had followed-up with her GI physician.
No EKG changes.
# Renal: Cr mildly elevated to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0 to 1.1.
Likely prerenal given diarrhea and blood loss.
No CP or ischemic changes on EKG in setting of HCT drop.
ASA was held given no recent stents and active bleeding initially.
After discussion with the GI service, she was instructed to resume aspirin 81mg po qdaily on 1d after discharge ([**10-26**]).
# Fe deficiency anemia: etiology remains unclear, and pt will continue to have outpatient workup.
# Depression: continued SSRI.
