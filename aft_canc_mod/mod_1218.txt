Admission Date:  [**2166-9-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-9-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2099-9-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old man with a history of metastatic gastric carcinoma who was recently started on hospice care and then presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department on [**2166-9-7**] with severe left hip pain and inability to ambulate.
The onset of these symptoms were precipitated by a fall from a chair four hours prior to admission.
An x-ray of his left hip demonstrated a left femoral neck fracture with displacement.
Metastatic gastric carcinoma diagnosed approximately one year ago.
Status post partial gastrectomy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of deep venous thrombosis.
History of coronary artery disease.
In general, the patient was calm, however, he was clearly short of breath and in obvious pain.
There was no JVD.
No carotid bruits.
No adenopathy.
There was normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and there were no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
He had decreased breath sounds at the bases with mild crackles and wheezes bilaterally.
There were active bowel sounds and there was no palpable hepatosplenomegaly.
He had no peripheral edema and he had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Although the patient had recently been initiated on hospice care, the decision was made for the patient to undergo a left hemiarthroplasty for repair of his left femoral neck fracture, given that this procedure would give the patient the best chance of early ambulation with full weight bearing.
They felt that his baseline dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
They felt that given his recent cardiac catheterization in [**2163-9-16**], which demonstrated normal coronaries and an absence of symptoms, the patient was unlikely to have a flow limiting coronary artery disease.
Given his significant anemia on presentation to the [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was also transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells prior to the operative procedure.
Airway suctioning done at that time reportedly demonstrated copious amounts of coffee ground emesis.
A repeat chest x-ray done following the procedure demonstrated diffuse, patchy opacification of the right middle and lower lobes consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Given the appearance of this chest x-ray and the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he was deemed to be a poor candidate for weaning off of mechanical ventilation and was therefore transferred to the MICU for continued monitoring.
He initially required frequent suctioning of coffee ground emesis, but he gradually required less and less suctioning following his successful extubation on [**2166-9-15**].
By the time of discharge from the hospital the patient was requiring minimal self suctioning of tannish secretions.
A repeat chest x-ray done on [**9-15**] demonstrated marked interval improvements in his right middle lobe and right lower lobe atelectatic changes.
There was also evidence of patchy left lower lobe consolidation and a right perihilar consolidation possibly consistent with a multifocal aspiration pneumonia.
He was also started on Clindamycin 600 mg intravenous q 8 hours following his orthopedic procedure for empiric coverage of his aspiration pneumonia.
Gastric cancer:  The patient has a known metastatic gastric cancer and was recently begun on hospice care.
His gastric cancer was the presumed source of his coffee ground emesis.
He was continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg intravenous q 12 hours given his coffee ground emesis.
Left femoral neck fracture:  At the time of discharge the patient was postoperative day number four following a left hemiarthroplasty for his left femoral neck fracture.
Although the patient ideally would have been resumed on anticoagulative therapy with Warfarin following his orthopedic procedure, given that he was having continued coffee ground emesis presumably from his gastric cancer, the patient was not restarted on anticoagulative medications following his orthopedic procedure.
He was instead maintained on sequential compression devices of his bilateral lower extremities for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
At the time of discharge, however, the patient no longer had coffee ground emesis and he was therefore restarted on heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.
for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had a transient episode of hypotension while on a propofol drip while he was still intubated.
for a history of hypertension the patient was not hypertensive during this admission and this medication was not restarted.
Neurological:  The patient continued to complain of abdominal pain as well as left hip and knee pain postoperatively.
The patient achieved adequate pain control with this regimen.
His creatinine decreased to 0.5 at the time of discharge from the hospital, indicating that he likely had a component of acute renal failure at the time of his presentation to the hospital.
This acute renal failure was most likely secondary to hypovolemia.
He was started on a clear liquid diet on the day prior to discharge, however, the patient did not have significant po intake during this hospitalization.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a presumed aspiration pneumonia as noted above.
Displaced left femoral neck fracture status post left hemiarthroplasty.
Metastatic gastric cancer status post partial gastrectomy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of deep venous thrombosis.
Aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as necessary for further follow up of his metastatic gastric carcinoma.
He was also given a telephone number for the [**Hospital **] Clinic to follow up with them as directed for further management of his left hemiarthroplasty following his left femoral neck fracture.
