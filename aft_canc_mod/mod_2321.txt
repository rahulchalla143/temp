By post-operative day 2 her blood pressure was stabilized but she experienced several oxygen desaturations leading to increased oxygen requirement.
She was started on albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, pulmonary toilet, advair and her CXR suggested volume overload.
Over the next 3 days several liters of fluid were diuresed off and her oxygenation improved until she was able to be weaned down to 2 L O2 via nasal canula without subsequent desaturation.
At discharge her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air, she was ambulating with some assistance from either nursing or physical therapy, was tolerating regular diet and her pain was well controlled.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after having an open right colectomy for obstructing ascending cecal colon cancer.
After surgery, you had some extra fluid collect in your lungs and this in combination with your COPD and smoking history caused you to have respiratory difficulties and you required a stay in the intensive care unit.
You were also treated for a urinary tract infection with antibiotics.
