Evidence of recent sphincterotomy and plastic stent placment.
No bleed apparent.
Additional notes: No source of GI bleed noted.
No fresh blood within upper GI tract.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2131-3-19**] 4:50 PM CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Reason: evaluate for mass Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old man with ?
of cholangiocarcinoma based on ERCP, ERCP s/p stent placement REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for mass CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
This is a CTA of the abdomen with and without reconstructions.
INDICATION FOR STUDY: Evaluate for possible cholangiocarcinoma in 79-year-old man with abnormal ERCP study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Bilateral Bochdalek hernias are noted in the posterior left and right hemithoraces.
A large amount of intraperitoneal free fluid is noted.
Bilateral intrahepatic bile duct dilatation is noted with bilateral pneumobilia.
No focal lesions identified within the liver.
Immediately superior to the gallbladder fossa is an approximately 3 x 3 cm rim calcified mass which might represent a large gallstone.
Several other large gallstones are noted within the distended gallbladder.
This is associated with several periportal lymph nodes.
The adjacent vascular structures, specifically the portal vein, the superior mesenteric artery, and the superior mesenteric vein are all widely patent.
No discrete masses identified within the pancreatic head where a large approximately 3 x 3 cm diverticulum is present.
A small splenule is identified.
No solid masses are present in the left or right kidneys.
Several simple cysts are identified in both kidneys.
Large amount of free intrapelvic fluid is noted encircling the bladder.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lower lumbar spine.
No other lytic or blastic lesions are identified throughout the skeleton.
3D arterial MIP and volume rendered images as well as MINIP and venous volume rendered MIP images were obtained which again confirm the presence of ill-defined soft tissue encircling a stent within the portahepatus and encircling the proximal portions of the left and right hepatic artery.
Ill-defined delayed enhancing soft tissue masses within the portahepatus encircling the common hepatic duct as well as the proximal left and right hepatic arteries and indistinguishable from the cystic duct.
The features concerning for a Klatskin-type neoplasm.
No hepatic metastases are noted and the main portal SMV and superior mesenteric arteries are patent.
An additional calcified mass immediately adjacent to the gallbladder might indeed represent a large gallstone but it does have an unusual appearance.
This is not concerning for a hepatic neoplasm.
Large amount of intraperitoneal and intrapelvic ascitic fluid.
The etiology of this fluid is uncertain but this would be amenable to a tap for cytologic purposes if indicated.
Large duodenal diverticulum.
An EGD was performed: no apparent bleed, no fresh blood in upper tract.
He was continued on CTX and Flagyl for a question of sepsis (elevated WBC, elevated lactate, temp 96).
Anemia: thought to be secondary to recent sphincterotomy.
Bacteremia may have been secondary to recent OSH ERCP and stent.
Probable cholangiocarcinoma: per OSH ERCP brushings, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
CT shows soft tissue masses within the portahepatus encircling the common hepatic duct, as well as the left and right hepatic arteries.
Disp:*8 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Suspected cholangiocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You have been diagnosed with suspected cholangiocarcinoma based on pathology brushings from ERCP and your CT scan.
Return to the Emergency Room or call your doctor if you develop episodes of fainting, nausea and vomiting, blood in your stools, chest pain, shortness of breath, high fevers or any other concerns.
