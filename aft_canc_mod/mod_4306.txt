He notes a recent history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past six to eight weeks.
This is relatively constant and there is no exacerbating or alleviating factors.
On [**2138-10-10**], he underwent a CT scan of the abdomen that demonstrated multiple cysts throughout the liver.
However, in the right lobe, there is a less well-defined multicentric low density and it was unclear by report whether this was a cystic or solid, and an MRI was recommended.
There was a multifocal solid mass in the right lobe of the liver measuring 3.3 x 4.8 cm.
This was thought to be a tumor thrombus in a branch of the right portal vein, but the main right, right anterior, and right posterior portal veins are patent.

Mild left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
[**2138-11-24**] abdominal U/S: small pockets of abdominal fluid were identified in the left lower quadrant and lower central abdomen.
A small pocket of fluid is seen along the superior margin of the liver.
Pain control was maintained with intrthecal morphine by Acute Pain Service.
While in the PACU, patient required multiple fluid boluses (5.5 L) and 25% albumin for hypotension, tachycardia, and low urine output, which responded, but was kept in the PACU overnight for observation.
An EKG and cardiac enzymes were obtained for chest pain and were negative.
Triggered for dizziness on getting out of bed.
[**11-9**]: Triggered for tachycardia (143), low sat (90-93% on 3LNC), and low urine output (100 cc frank blood).
Respiratory distress attributed to pulmonary edema.
Patient was transferred to the SICU and a urology consult was obtained for hemorrhage into Foley.
Cystoscopy demonstrated uretral tear and prostatic bleeding: 3-way Foley placed and bladder irrigated.
Intubated for respiratory acidosis.
Passed swallow eval.
Peritoneal fluid sent: no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (WBC 233, RBC 478, negative gram stain and culture).
[**11-20**]: Started on Lasix and aldactone for edema/ascites and Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
Suture placed at drain site for fluid leakage.
[**11-22**]: Central venous access discontinued.
Ascitic leakage from incision and drain site.
[**11-24**]: Ultrasound obtained showing minimal ascites.
