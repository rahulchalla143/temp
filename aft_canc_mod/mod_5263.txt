MRI with diffusion-weighted images more sensitive in the evaluation for acute ischemia/infarct.
The azygos vein is distended and there is a suggestion of mild edema in the right lung, but the combination of hypotension and large heart raises concern for pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 53M hep C cirrhosis, smoldering myeloma, here with catastrophic metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure and sepsis.
* Shock: Most likely secondary to sepsis, secondary to bacterial peritonitis.
* Acidosis: Most likely secondary to combination of liver, renal failure, and sepsis.
Subsequent to death of patient, gram stain of peritoneal fluid was found to contain heavy GNR along with PMNs, suggesting that most likely source of overwhelming sepsis was bacterial peritonitis, although primary reason for this was unclear.
