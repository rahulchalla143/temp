26 yo man D +278 after single cord transplant for hypoplastic MDS with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted for sepsis.
Initial MDS course was complicated by mucor infection of the tongue with prolonged ICU course for upper airway obsturuction, followed by pericoronitis as well as perirectal abcess.
Post transplant course c/b VRE + Coag neg staph bacteremia [**6-/2137**] (treated with dapsone); CMV viremia [**7-/2137**], c.diff infection [**10/2137**] (treated with 14 days oral vanc), admission on [**10/2137**] for low grade temperature attributed to +CMV viremia with prolonged IV ganciclovir --> oral Valgancyclovir course; last admission 10/4-6 for neutropenic fever, CT chest showed non specific minimal peribronchial ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe, treated with course of levofloxacine; Saw ID [**12-12**] Valgancyclovir was stopped as CMV viral loads remained negative since [**10-22**], was started on valacyclovir for HSV/VZV PPx.
He also continues oral Posiconazole for mucor and monthly pentamidine nebs for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (most recent [**12-28**]).
He has been intermitently leukopenic and neutropenic throughout his illness with especially low white counts generally ranging around 1000-3000 during the past 2 months.
Thrombocytopenia has been continous throughout his illness and latley stable at ~ 25,000.
Finally he is thought to be at low risk for GVH and thus stopped immunosupressive meds in [**2137-9-16**] (was on tacrolimus prior).
Over the past several months, he has had recurrent PNAs and has been followed in pulmonary clinic.
In [**Month (only) 404**] he was found to have fever and neutropenia and worsening tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, particularly in the left side.
Repeat CT chest on [**3-4**] showed some resolution and he was most recently seen in pulm clinic on [**2138-3-20**].
Today pt called clinic because he reported feelings of malaise and nausea and noted that he had a low grade fever.
He went to clinic and was found to have a fever of 103, Bp in 80's systolic, HR of 140.
Past Medical History: -Hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13) - single cord transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG.
-Last chemo: Tacrolimus [**2138-10-5**], which was stopped after clinical suspicion of GVH decreased - Oral Mucor infection [**2136**]: infiltration into base of the tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation of bleeding lingual artery.
Complicated hospital course involving multiple ICU stays for post-operative laryngeal edema following intubation.
- C. difficile infection [**10/2136**] - pericoronitis s/p extraction 4 teeth [**2137-1-24**] - peri-rectal abscess s/p drainage [**2137-2-27**] - Hemochromatosis - Transaminitis (felt most likely multifactorial; contributions by medications and hemochromatosis)  Social History: -Moved from [**Country **] in [**2136**].
-He has no pet exposures.
Family History: Father died at age 73, per reports had "illness" and progressive weakness.
No known family history of cancer or bleeding disorders.

No evidence of intracranial, orbital, or dural extension.
CT SINUS IMPRESSION:  Extensive paranasal sinus disease with active secretions, suggestive of acute infection.
R Middle Inferior Turbinate Polypoid lesion, right inferior middle turbinate, biopsy:            - Polypoid fragments of sinonasal respiratory mucosa with focal acute (neutrophilic) and chronic inflammation and surface erosion.
- No definitive fungal organisms seen; see note.
Note: Special stains (PAS, PAS with Diastase, and GMS stains) are negative for fungal organisms.
Clinical:   History of oral mucormycosis, now with sinusitis, polypoid tissue at inferior right middle turbinate.

He was hypotensive initially in clinic, but has been responsive to fluids with BP stable in 110s systolic at time of admission.
The only obvious source of infection was sinuses.
CT and MR sinuses showed diffuse acute sinusitis.
Due to pt's history of invasive mucormycotic infection without negative margins and pt being on suppressive doses of posaconazole, more invasive culture/biopsy data was pursued.
Four sinus aspirates and biopsy of polypoid lesion were collected during ENT exam.
The polypoid lesion was sent for frozen path, and preliminary read came back positive for invasive fungal infection.
All fungal markers and stains were negative, and final path was negative for fungal infection.
# MDS, s/p BMT.
# transaminitis: stable.
thought to be [**3-20**] to med effect or hemochromatosis.
We were concerned that you might have an invasive fungal infection and had ENT surgery take a biopsy from your sinus.
There was no evidence of fungal infection on your biopsy.
