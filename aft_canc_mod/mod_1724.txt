Admission Date:  [**2150-5-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 28994**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] is a 65 year old man with a history of CLL and pulmonary embolus.
He has been off of treatment for his CLL secondary to complications from the chemotherapy.
He has required frequent transfusions for his anemia (last transfusion of 2 units of pRBC's on [**5-21**]).
He is neutropenic and has been on valacyclovir, pentamidine, and voriconazole.
He reports a dry cough starting about one month ago.
Two weeks ago he began having a cough slightly productive of whitish sputum.
He did not take any medication for the cough and it was not made better or worse by anything that he noticed.
At his oncology appointment on [**5-21**] he reported worsening of this cough.
A chest xray showed a right sided infiltrate with concern for a fungal process.
He felt febrile last evening, but did not have a thermometer.
Review of sytems: Reports recent constipation, but now having regular bowel movements.
He had some incontinence of urine last night, but denied dysuria or hematuria.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: SUMMARY OF CLL HISTORY: 1) He developed herpes zoster of the right cheek in [**2143**], treated with Valtrex.
In [**2143**], he had recurrence of a cutaneous eruption involving the right cheek, but evaluation was felt inconsistent with recurrent herpes zoster and biopsies supported a clonal low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferation, perhaps "marginal zone B-cell lymphoma," reviewed by dermatologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28984**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
(2) This right face cutaneous eruption waxed and waned in early [**2144**], extending to involve the right nostril and skin to the left of midline underneath the nose.
In follow-up evaluation a CBC showed leukocytosis (WBC = 22.7K), but differential was not obtained.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28984**] in follow-up who performed skin lesional punch biopsy of the superior nasolabial crease on [**2145-4-7**].
This showed skin involvement by CLL, without evidence of transformation.
(3) Subsequently, he saw Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Company 2860**], and flow cytometry of peripheral blood on [**2145-4-28**] confirmed a lymphocyte predominance by CLL; 3% of cells were positive for CD38.
On [**2145-4-28**], torso CT scan at [**Hospital1 112**] showed extensive lymphadenopathy at multiple sites throughout the upper neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, as summarized in my [**2146-2-25**] note.
(4) Repeat CBCs in [**5-11**] again showed leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance on differential.
Flow cytometry at [**Hospital1 18**] again confirmed CLL; however, 50% of B cells were CD38 positive.
(5) In [**5-11**], he developed fevers and constitutional symptoms with marked fatigue and weight loss.
By [**2146**], he had noted marked improvement in his constitutional symptoms with resolution of fevers and stabilization of his weight, having had a 15-pound weight loss during his summer illness.
(6) In [**12-12**], he developed bilateral otitis media, worse on the right, complicated by tympanic membrane perforation.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Company 2860**] on [**2146-1-13**] who noted 2 cm submandibular and inguinal lymph nodes, in addition to small anterior and posterior cervical and bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
Peripheral blood FISH analysis on CLL cells was obtained showing abnormalities for the D13S319 13q14.3 and P53 17p13.1 probes in 4/100 and 70/100 nuclei, respectively.
On lasix, he felt improved shortness of breath.
However, on [**2146-3-28**] and [**2146-4-11**] he experienced "crashing" fevers and sweats.
With progressive dyspnea, he was found to have markedly increased left pleural effusion and posterior pericardial effusion with RV collapse.
Admitted to hospital on [**2146-4-27**], he ultimately underwent placement of a pericardial window, with drainage of left pleural and pericardial fluid, both showing CLL cells.
However, evaluation of pericardial tissue showed organizing fibrinous material with entrapped mixed inflammatory cells, including numerous small lymphocytes consistent with CLL cells.
However, there was no evidence of [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation or otherwise, and CLL cells were regarded as "bystanders."
Of note, multiple specimens for various infectious diseases (see OMR) were negative except for [**Location (un) **] B4 and B5 antibodies which were "8" rather than "less than 8."
(8) On [**2146-5-12**], he was admitted to hospital from [**6-2**] to [**2146-6-9**] with progressive dyspnea related to worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
Left thorascopic pleural biospy and talc pleurodesis were performed on [**2146-6-6**].
No morphological evidence of large cell transformation or infection is seen.
The morphology, supported by the concurrent flow cytometry immunophenotyping ([**-6/2615**]: CD20 dim, CD5-positive, CD23-positive, lambda light chain expression) is consistent with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma."
Again, CLL was felt to be a "bystander" and not the cause of the pleural effusion.
Molecular analyses for Erlichia were negative on pleural tissue.
(9) With progressive symptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia, he began his first chemotherapy for CLL on [**2146-9-21**], receiving cycle #1 of fludarabine/Cytoxan (without rituximab).
Further therapy with Fludara/Cytoxan was held due to persistent thrombocytopenia.
(10)Due to worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia thought to be secondary to ITP as well as bone marrow involvement with CLL, he received a pulse of high-dose dexamethasone at the beginning of [**9-12**] with 4 doses of weekly rituximab and weekly vincristine on weeks 2 through 4 ([**2147-9-14**] through [**2147-10-5**]).
Thrombocytopenia improved but anemia persisted.
On [**2147-10-27**], after five Campath doses, Campath was held secondary to WBC 0.4 with ANC 297 and increased anemia and thrombocytopenia.
(12) Hospitalized [**2147-12-27**] to [**2148-1-2**] with febrile neutropenia attributed to viral infection.
(13) On [**2148-10-10**], with worsened severe thrombocytopenia attributed to ITP complicating progressive CLL, he resumed prednisone 1 mg/kg = 80 mg daily.
On [**2149-2-18**], we administered IVIg for hypogammaglobulinemia in the setting of his infection.
On [**2149-3-3**], repeat chest CT showed marked improvement with near complete resolution of ground glass lung opacities, prompting infectious disease specialist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] to discontinue voriconazole therapy for aspergillosis.
(16) After four cycles of RCD chemotherapy, anemia and thrombocytopenia improved, and lymphadenopathy resolved.
Decision made to hold off on further cycles due to prolonged leukopenia and increasing fatigue.
OTHER PMH: (1) History of basal cell carcinoma of skin.
(2) Osteoarthritis of hands.
(3) Urinary frequency with BPH.
(4) Hyperplastic colonic polyp resected in [**2-4**] colonoscopy.
(5) Ankle fracture in early [**2128**] complicated by DVT requiring coumadin anticoagulationx  Social History: Retired banking lawyer.

Urine Culture [**2150-5-23**]: pending  Imaging: CXR [**2150-5-24**]:Large opacity is identified within the right upper to mid lung zone, corresponding to the region of abnormality on prior chest radiograph, though significantly increased in size/severity compared to prior.
There is no pneumothorax.
No significant vascular congestion or pulmonary edema is identified.
Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged from prior and likely represents a stable small effusion.
A trace left effusion may also be present.
Large consolidation within the right upper lung zone, significantly increased in size since prior, probable pneumonia given the clinical history and increase in severity compared to prior.
Stable small right pleural effusion.
Possible trace left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] is a 65 year old man with advanced CLL which left him neutropenic for an extended period of time.
He met SIRS criteria on admission with tachycardia, fevers and leukopenia.
His CXR revealed a RUL consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
He had been on voriconazole prophylaxis prior to admission which was expanded to ambisome for fungal coverage.
He had a history of erlichia and was started empirically on doxycycline as he had spent time on [**Hospital3 **] this season.
