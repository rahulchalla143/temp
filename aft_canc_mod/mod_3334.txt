Admission Date:  [**2187-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-12-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-12-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Paracentesis and removal of 3L of fluid  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 70235**] is a 64 yo woman with metastatic uterine cancer, obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea.
She was seen by her gynecologist-oncologist 2 days prior to admission, at which time she discussed with him recent CT findings of a large new abdominal mass.
At that visit, she was complaining of worsening shortness of breath.
Per report, she has had about a month of increasing abdominal girth and increasing peripheral edema.
She was then started on norepinephrine for mild hypotension.
She also received levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia prior to her chest CTA.
She denied pain in general and chest and abdominal pain in particular.
Past Medical History: Uterine carcinosarcoma - Stage IC, Grade 3 Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Degenerative joint disease Asthma Melanoma (9 years ago) Excision of melanoma of the lower extremity C-section x1 TAH-BSO Wound revision, complicated by MRSA infection Knee surgery  Social History: Per OMR, the pt does not smoke or drink.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 105/69 P: 99 R: 36 SaO2: 100% General: sedated, intubated, responds to verbal stimuli, responds appropriately to questions HEENT: PERRL, no scleral icterus, MM dry Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally anteriorly, no wheezes, ronchi or rales Cardiac: borderline tachy, distant S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, ?
of large mass in center of abdomen, but not incredibly obvious Extremities: 2+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally, 1+ DP pulses bilaterally Neurologic: Sedated, intubated, squeezes hands on command, wiggles toes  Pertinent Results: [**2187-12-2**] Renal U/S - No evidence of hydronephrosis  [**2187-12-3**] Paracentesis -  Successful therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis with aspiration of 3 L of clear amber yellow fluid.
Samples were sent for cytology and microbiology.
[**2187-12-3**] Peritoneal fluid - Atypical epithelioid cells, reactive mesothelial cells and numerous inflammatory cells.
[**2187-12-4**] CXR -  Free air in the abdomen, which is new.
No radiographic evidence for obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 70235**] is a 64 yo woman with h/o uterine CA who was admitted with recurrent disease (large intrabdominal mass), new ascites, dyspnea and hypotension.
In setting of presumed bowel perforation she developed increased tachypnea, tachycardia and respiratory distress.
She died overnight due to respiratory failure from underlying bowel perforation and increased abdominal free air.
1) Respiratory distress: On admission, her symptoms of dyspnea were most likely [**12-22**] ascites and increased intra-abdominal pressure.
She was intubated in the emergency department for respiratory distress and inability to tolerate lying flat.
She had ultrasound guided paracentesis and removal of 3L of ascitic fluid.
She chose not to be intubated and died over night due to respiratory distress likely from increasing abdominal free air, abdominal mass, ascites and bowel perforation.
She was treated with a morphine drip for symptoms of respiratory distress.
2)Intra-abdominal free air - visible on CXR and KUB most likely due to bowel perforation most likely caused by tumor erosion into adherant bowel.
Surgery consulted and after discussion with GYN-ONC and given patients underlying malignancy it was decided that she is not a good operative candidate.
5) LE edema: Most likely due to IVC compression by large volume ascites.
No evidence of PE on CTA.
