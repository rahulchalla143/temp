Admission Date:  [**2108-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-4-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-1-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Shellfish / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, increasing shortness of breath.
Pancreatic Abcess  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line Placement [**2108-4-17**] Thoracentesis, Right VATS, Right Chest Tubes [**2108-4-3**] Bedside Tongue Biopsy [**2108-4-24**] Multiple CT scans Multiple daubhoff placements   History of Present Illness: 51 yo male with a history of HTN, and ETOH use, was admitted to an OSH for a pancreatic abcess, nausea and vomitting for 1 week.
He was an inpatient for 2 weeks at an OSH and developed worsening of abdominal pain and increasing shortenss of breath and a rising amylase, lipase and WBC count.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours show interval decrease in width, likely due to improving volume status of the patient.
There is also improvement in bilateral asymmetric perihilar and basilar alveolar process, particularly in the left perihilar region.
Although these opacities may in part be due to improving pulmonary edema, underlying pneumonia is suspected, particularly in the lower lobes.
Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2108-4-23**] 10:39 AM CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Contrast: OPTIRAY  INDICATION: 51-year-old with head and neck cancer, recent pancreatitis, presenting with acute shortness of breath, rule out PE and reassess abdominal collections.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, with persisting consolidation in the right lower lobe.
There are diffuse enlarged lymph nodes throughout the mediastinum, suspicious for metastatic nodes.
Multiple small subcentimeter axillary nodes.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are multiple small thin- walled fluid collections throughout the abdomen, not significantly changed in size and appearance compared to the prior study.
The pancreatic parenchyma enhances homogeneously without evidence of significant necrosis or intraparenchymal abscess.
There are coarse calcifications along the duct near the pancreatic head, likely the sequela of chronic pancreatitis.
Moderate amount of ascites surrounding the liver and throughout the pelvis.
Small ill-defined hepatic hypodense lesion within segment VI, too small to characterize.
Additional tiny hypodense lesion in segment V anteriorly, too small to characterize as well.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
The kidneys, adrenal glands, stomach, and proximal small bowel are normal.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Large amount of ascites and free fluid in the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen.
BONE WINDOWS: 2.5-cm ill-defined lytic lesion in the right iliac bone lateral to the SI joint, suspicious for metastasis.
Old right lateral rib fracture, demonstrating some callus formation.
No other suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION: 1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Stable size and appearance of multiple small fluid collections throughout the abdomen, likely pancreatic pseudocysts; too small to be amenable to percutaneous drainage.
3) Bilateral pleural effusions with right lower lobe consolidation which may relate to persisting pneumonia versus less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
4) Enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suspicious for metastatic nodes.
5) Stable moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites.
6) 2.5cm lytic lesion in the right iliac bone lateral to the SI joint, suspicious for metastasis.
7) Small hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen, too small to characterize.
An abdominal CT at this time showed pancreatic pseudocyst given history of pancreatitis, ascites, bilateral pleural effusions - right greater than left.
A abdominal CT on [**2108-4-17**] showed multiple dynamic fluid collections again seen within the abdomen, some smaller and some larger when compared to prior study.
# Respiratory/Bilateral pleural effusions/pneumonia: [**2107-3-26**] he was intubated for respiratory distress, on [**2108-3-26**] he was re intubated after self-extubation.
A chest x-ray revealed worsening of his bilateral pleural effusions with associated basilar atelectasis.
He was being suctioned for copious thick rusty/blood tinged secretions and respiratory support was continued.
An NGT was draining small quantities of bilious fluid.
Antibiotics Imipenem-Cilastatin was given for pneumonia empirically.
On [**2108-4-1**] he was transfered back to the ICU for O2 sats to 80% and tachycardia with his heart rate in the 130's.
The patient continued to having respiratory difficulty and the bilateral effusions were very slow to improve.
[**2108-4-17**] the patient had acute onset of shortness of breath and an O2 saturation of 75% and was transfered to the ICU.
He responded well to Lasix and nebulizers and continued respiratory care.
The last tube was removed on [**2108-4-25**], a follow-up chest x-ray was negative for pneumothorax.
#Hemetology: The patient was transfused on multiple occasions from [**Date range (1) 66583**] for anemia of chronic disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 66584**] white count continued to be slightly elevated throughout his hospital stay, though is currently trending down.
# Aspiration/failed swallowing: Speech and Swallow was consulted on [**2108-4-6**] for aspiration and continued to recommend he stay NPO.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have symptoms of aspiration  of any liquids/thickened liquids/solids taken PO.
He was also noted at this time to have a left tongue mass.
#Large tongue mass: ENT/ORL consult was obtained on [**2108-4-10**] for a left, posterior tongue lesion.
The patient had slurring of speach and difficulty with clearing of oropharyngeal secretions.
The mass is 2 cm firm lesion and highly concerning for malignancy especially given the patient's history of alcohol and tobacco abuse.
They had no specific course of treatment without a confrimed tissue diagnosis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Pancreatitis/Pancreatic Abscess Bilateral Pleural Effusions Tongue Mass Pneumonia Anemia of chronic disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please come to the emergency room if you have fever >101.4F, nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, inability to take liquids or any other concerning symptoms.
