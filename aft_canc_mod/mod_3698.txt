He denies any black or tarry stool at that time, or pain with bowel movements.
He was noted to have another episode of BRBPR with clots.

Complete occlusion of the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery  with only a small 1 cm opening in that popliteal vessel.
Reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery which continues down to the foot with a short 1 cm occlusion in the mid leg.
There is no DP artery in the foot.
There is a large posterior tibial artery with collaterals in the foot.
[**2103-8-20**]- L jump graft.

1cm duodenal ulcer with clot .
A mass is seen in the right atrium measuring 3.0 x 1.4 cm.
The mass appears to be attached to the eustachian valve or may be a prominent eustachian valve .
No vegitation is seen in the tricuspid, aortic or mitral valves.
Mild (grade I) diastolic dysfunction.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
While this finding may be seen in acute hepatitis as well as other entities, it can be considered a normal variant as well.
The liver contour is not nodular and there are no signs of portal hypertension to suggest cirrhosis.
No brisk bleeding while in ICU, one episode of BRBPR afternoon of [**10-7**].
Tagged RBC scan showed delayed bleeding in LLQ, no indication for emergent angio, especially given PVD.
Ddx includes bleeding in sigmoid/rectum as pt s/p radiation for prostate cancer vs diverticulum vs AVM.
Pt also with h/o duodenal ulcer but sxs and imaging more c/s with lower GIB.
Had bleeding study that showed bleeding from rectum.
Colonoscopy later showed two non-bleeding rectal ulcers and radiation proctitis.
Patient noted to have a RA thrombus in [**5-5**].
Found to have supratherapeutic INR to 9 on admission which has been reversed to 2-2.7 with PO vitamin K and FFP.
However after TTE was negative for right atrial thrombus the heparin drip was turned off and coumadin was d/cd as the patient no longer had a reason to be anticoagulated and was at high risk of further bleeding from the GI tract.
Bacteremia: Patient had fever and blood cultures showed coag negative staph sensitive to Vancomycin in [**5-2**] bottles.
The PICC line was pulled and cultured with no growth.
He may need a replacement HD catheter placed eventually if he has persistent bacteremia although subsequent blood cultures taken here since the catheter was changed show no growth to date.
In setting of bacteremia had foot XR that showed no evidence of osetomyelitis and vascular surgery felt the foot had not changed in appearance.
H/o C. Diff.
Possible Blood Dyscrasia/thrombocytosis.
Atrial tachycardia: Patient had several episodes of acute tachycardia felt to be sinus tach vs atrial tachycardia usually associated with volume depletion after HD.
The patient remained asymptomatic with stable blood pressures and mentation throughout all episodes of the tachycardia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed from rectal ulcers and radiation proctitis.
Atrial tachycardia.
Coagulase negative bactermia from HD catheter line  Discharge Condition: The patient was normotensive, not tachycardic, afebrile, and with a stable hematocrit for >24hours before discharge.
This bleeding likely happened because your blood was too thin.
You then had a colonoscopy that showed the bleeding was from two ulcers in your rectum and possibly from injury to your rectum caused by radiation.
You had a fever from an infection in your blood that came from your dialysis catheter.
You have been given antibiotics for this infection and should continue these antibiotics for four weeks.
You should call your doctor or come to the emergency room if you experience light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening foot pain, fevers, blood in your stool or black tarry stools, or any other concerning symptoms.
