She has a remote hx of colon CA ([**2111**]), thalassemia, was recenlty admitted to OMED (d/c'd [**3-30**]) for hypercalcemia, acute renal failure in context of new diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
At that time, she began having pain in her chest and her back which became worse over time.
Her abdominal area and torso seems to have swelled and she has had weight loss of about ten pounds over the last six to seven weeks with poor appetite.
O/P workup revealed multiple lytic bone lesions and an abnormal monoclonal spike that was c/w IgD lambda.
During this visit she was found to have acute renal failure (Cre 6.8) and hypercalcemia (12.5) and was directly admitted to the OMED service.
During her admission, she was found to have a monoclonal gammopathy (IgD).
Her ARF was thought to be secondary to light chain nephropathy and hypercalcemia.
Skeletal survey revealed multiple destructive lesions in calvarium and spine with several vertebral body fractures.
She remains in a significant amount of pain and has therefore been taking narcotics on a regular basis for relief thus contributing to her fatigue.
She was not responsive to voice or touch.
Later witnessed to have a GTC seizure x 1 min.
She had a CT scan which showed right para falcine, parieto-occipital hyperdensity c/w acute blood with surrounding edema as well as a left parasagital meningioma.
Patient was LP'd, given Ceftriaxone 2gram IV, dilantin 1gram IV, Decadron 4mg IV, and FFP for mild coagulopathy (INR 1.4).
She had an MRI and abdominal/pelvis CT for abdominal distension.
Patient denies headache, photophobia, nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
She said that she had some difficulty with her medications.

2) Calcified meningioma in the left parafalcine region.
3) Lytic lesions in the skull are consistent with multiple myeloma or metastases.
MRI w/ gad: Extensive areas of T2 signal hyperintensity are evident in the cortex and subcortical white matter.
There is no diffusion signal abnormality associated with this finding to suggest infarction.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Bone findings consistent with multiple myeloma.
Stable appearance of liver and renal cysts.
EKG: NSR @65bpm, normal axis, Qs in V4-V6, I and aVL  Thyroid Scan Findings consistent with multinodular goiter.
Renal US 1) Complex cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney demonstrating a thickened wall with a 10mm mural nodule.
2) Stable appearance of multiple other simple renal and hepatic cysts demonstrating no complex features.
3) Increased echogenicity of the renal cortices, consistent with renal parenchymal disease.
CSF: Cytology: Negative for Malignant cells Oligo bands: none present, band present in serum is NOT present in CSF   Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo with recent dx of myeloma and ARF s/p plasmapheresis who presents with new onset seizures and was found to have a right parietal hemorrhage of unclear etiology.
NEURO: The patient was admitted to the neuro ICU for evaluation of ICH and seizure management.
Her initial CT scan was stable and showed no increase in the size of the hemorrhage.
(underlying mass (plasmacytoma?)
vs infection vs venous infarct vs hypertensive hemorrhage).
MRI with gado not helpful in further narrowing differential, but did show evidence of posterior leukoencephalopathy which was thought to be due renal failure or hypertension (though she was not hypertensive on admission).
MRV was negative for sinus thrombosis.
The Acyclovir was d/c'd sec to low suspicion for herpes encephalitis.
Decadron was initially started at 4mg q6 for cerebral edema, but was later increased to 10mg q6 hours for myeloma treatment.
Her mental status dramatically improved over first 24 hours of admission and she has had no further seizures.
Given her history and the location of the bleed, it was felt that her bleed was most likely due to an underlying mass.
She had a repeat LP on [**4-6**] for cytology and oligoclonal bands.
CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells nor was there evidence of paraprotein.
There was a question of dural enhancement on the first MRI (though this was difficult to determine do to motion artifact).
She had a repeat MRI with contrast which showed "surrounding edema which is slightly increased since the previous study.
However, previously seen diffuse increased signal in the occipital lobes bilaterally and in the posterior temporal lobes have resolved confirming the findings to be secondary to posterior reversible encephalopathy.
A repeat MRI will be done in [**5-4**] weeks to assess for underlying mass.
She will continue Keppra for seizure prevention.
She started her 2nd steroid pulse for multiple myeloma and completed 4 days of high dose Decadron (10mg q 6h).
Because it is not common for myeloma to cause parenchymal CNS disease, there was concern that her hemorrhage could be due to a second primary tumor with metastasis.
Her last CT scans showed small thyroid nodules and lung nodules as well as multiple renal cysts.
Thyroid US showed evidence of multinodular goiter and renal US showed multiple simple cysts and one complex cyst.
A renal MRI was done to further characterize the complex cyst and showed: "cyst within the upper pole of the left kidney demonstrates a 5 mm enhancing nodule in its anteromedial aspect, which is concerning for an intracystic neoplasm".
RENAL: ARF secondary to cast nephropathy due to light chain production.
Renal recommended starting Bicitra for metabolic acidosis.
CV: Troponin leak present on admission was felt to be due to renal failure.
There were no acute ischemic EKG changes.
Her hypertension was initially well controlled on metoprolol, but her BPs slowly began to increase.
Triamcinolone 0.025 % Cream [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) PRN for breast rash.
Intracranial Hemorraghe.
Acute Renal Failure    Discharge Condition: Stable.
If you feel more lethargic, have new weakness, numbness, change in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3029**] or return to the Emergency Room.
