[**2178-11-14**] CXR:  Moderate cardiomegaly with a mildly unfolded atherosclerotic thoracic aorta are unchanged.
There are multifocal areas of airspace opacities predominantly involving the mid and lower lungs bilaterally, compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
There is no pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
There are patchy perihilar opacities as well as mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Left sphenoid sinus air-fluid level may represent sinusitis in the appropriate clinical context.
[**2178-11-16**] Video swallow study:  Multiple oral and pharyngeal phase defects with associated penetration and aspiration, partially reduced with chin tuck position.
Brief Hospital Course: An 85 year-old lady with chronic diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, h/o thromboembolic CVA in [**2165**], now presenting with worsening dyspnea, fever, and cough.
She is admitted to the ICU for oxygen requirement and hypotension.
FEVER/DYSPNEA She presented with worsening cough, fever, leukocytosis, diffuse crackles, and CXR consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis.
Blood and sputum samples were sent for culture.
Overnight there was significant clinical improvement.
She was afebrile and had decreasing oxygen requirements to 4L to maintain O2 sats in mid 90s.
She remained stable on this regimen, with no white count, no fevers, and a steady improvement in symptoms.
We believe that she may have had an aspiration event, causing a pneumonitis.
The other possibility, given CXR findings of multifocal infiltrate, is that she has had an atypical pneumonia, either bacterial or viral, in which case a 7-day course of levofloxacin should provide sufficient antimicrobial coverage.
There was no positive culture data from urine, blood, or sputum.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE This was evident on her chest x-rays and consistent with her significant smoking history.
She had wheezes on exam and we treated with standing and prn albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
ANEMIA Her hematocrit trended from 36.9 to 39 to 31.3, to 29.9.
CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE She had a TTE in [**2176-11-15**] that showed moderately decreased left ventricular function with 3+ MR and 4+ TR.
On exam during this admission she appeared euvolemic, with no lower extremity pitting edema and mild crackles at the bases which were hard to interpret in the setting of multifocal pneumonia and diffuse scattered crackles.
We held her Lasix due to her hypotension and concern that she was volume depleted.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION She was monitored on telemetry and continued on outpatient digoxin.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE This resolved with intravenous fluids.
There were no focal neurologic deficits, apart from her difficulty swallowing (see below), which may be unrelated to her history of cerebrovascular accident.
DYSPHAGIA Because she came in after a likely aspiration event, she was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathologists.
After video swallow study showed significant aspiration risk, they recommended a po diet of soft solids and honey thick liquids with meds crushed in puree.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 486**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Aspiration pneumonia or pnuemonitis .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES Atrial fibrillation on coumadin Hypothyroidism History of cerebrovascular accident   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
We found that the levels of coumadin in your blood were slightly elevated during the last few days.
You can use the Advair inhaler two to three times as needed for shortness of breath.
