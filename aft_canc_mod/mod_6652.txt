Admission Date:  [**2173-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-10-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: WBC of 185K  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy Endotracheal Intubation PICC line placement and removal PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60yo F w/ a PMH of hypothyroidism, hypertension, fibromyalgia and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH today for evaluation of a month of night sweats, worsening back pain, frequent and easy bruising, and fatigue.
She had been to her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week ago for evaluation of these symptoms and had her thyroid checked (which was normal per her report).
Initial labs showed a WBC of 185k with a predominance of blasts and some promyelocytes.
She remained afebrile in ER (T 99.3-100.0), BP 111-137/61-83, HR 70s.
She was seen by the heme-onc team who looked at her peripheral smear and felt that it was most consistent with the microgranular variant of APML.
On arrival to 7F, she states that she overall is feeling OK. She has a [**3-25**] headache, bandlike, across her forehead and behind her eyes, c/w her sinus headaches.
Not associated with any vision changes, weakness, numbness or tingling.
ROS: + NS, as well as "sweats" during the day no frank fever, chills no weight changes but + anorexia x1 week + easy bruising (several wks) and bleeding from her gums (1 day) denies any visual changes + headaches as noted above, along with increased fatigue denies ST, nasal congestion, ear pain, + rhinorrhea denies CP, SOB, CP + palpitations/tachycardia - HR as high as 117 in last few weeks denies any emesis, but + nausea denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR denies any dysuria, hematuria, frequency or urgency denies epistaxis denies rashes, + dry skin + worsening back pain over last 24 hrs  Past Medical History: # Hypothyroidism # Hyperlipidemia # HTN # Fibromyalgia # GERD # Migraines   Social History: Lives in [**Location 6134**] with her husband.
Family History: No family history of bleeding or cancers; father's cousin recently died of leukemia.
OP clear but has evidence of bleeding on her buccal mucosa bilaterally.
Has soft swelling at site of line insertion.
No palpable hematoma, but line is slightly tender to palpation.
LUNG: CTAB, no crackles or wheezes.
ABDOMEN: Soft, ND, ttp in RUQ, no palpable liver edge, no appreciable splenomegaly.
No pronator drift.
Pertinent Results: CXR PA/LAT [**2173-1-30**]   No evidence of pneumonia/edema.
Right internal jugular catheter tip is in the SVC with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Ill-defined bibasilar reticular opacities are new and of uncertain etiology, for which, if clinically indicated, further evaluation with CT for further characterization could be performed.
Small left pleural effusion has increased.
Bibasilar atelectases has increased, worse in the right side.
[**2-1**] Liver US-  No evidence of hepatic mass or gallbladder pathology and otherwise unremarkable ultrasound.
[**2-2**] TTE-  Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
No structural valvular disease.
[**2-2**] CXR Portable- New moderate pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
[**2-3**] CXR Portable- Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2-3**] Lower extremity arterial non-invasives at rest- Normal resting arterial study .
[**2-3**] CXR portable- Worsening moderately severe pulmonary edema with increasing confluent areas of opacification in the right upper and left mid lung zones representing asymmetric edema or evolving infectious process.
Patient was noted to have hypoxia to 86% on RA on [**1-31**], and was placed on 3L NC, and decision was made to start leukopheresis in preparation for starting ATRA.
She was transferred to MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Potential etiologies of her respiratory failure considered were pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload, pulmonary hemorrhage, TRALI, leukostasis, or pneumonia.
She was diuresed aggressively due to concern for volume overload, but this was hindered by her continued need for blood products.
It was felt her respiratory failure was due to a combination of volume overload and capillary leak.
She was continued on vanc/aztreonam and levoflox was added for atypical coverage.
She also developed acute renal failure and therefore her cytarabine and hydrea were held.
Nephrology was consulted and felt this to be a tubular toxic effect from cytarabin/hydrea (she had granular casts on sediment) verses (less likely) thrombotic microangiopathy from DIC.
On [**2-9**] patient developed necrotic oral lesions that were swabbed and treatment dose of acyclovir was initiated.
On [**2-11**], oral swab showed evidence of HSV-like cytopathic effect and acyclovir was changed to IV.
Overnight into [**2-13**], patient developed a new oxygen requirement and developed massive hemoptysis with progression of oral and esophageal pain.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of her hemoptysis and respiratory failure.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: #) Respiratory Failure:  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hemopytsis and worsening respiratory distress, intubated on [**2173-2-15**] & bronchoscopy was performed on [**2-15**] & [**2-16**].
Imaging was consistent with ARDS of unknown etiology & bronch showed some bloody clots in large airways thought due to mucositis, but no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Pt had some evidence of low grade DIC that improved over ICU course, and oropharyngeal bleeding improved with plt tranfusion threshold >50.
The BAL cultures were + for GPCs & final culture was consistent with oral flora, thought not to be cause of her primary pulm process.
Pt was treated with empiric Abx while neutropenic & febrile with Vanc/Aztreonam/Fluconazole & Acyclovir with plan to continue abx until [**3-7**] to complete 7 day course post resolution of neutropenia.
Initially, pt was noted to have ongoing tachypnea, respiratory alkalosis, mucositis causing significant upper airway secretions.
Acyclovir was switched to prophylactic dose after pt had received 14 days of treatment dose and is no longer neutrapenic.
Pt also completed 5/5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
Fluconazole was switched to Caspofungin on [**2-22**] due to positive glucan, will need to f/u on repeat fungal studies.
?Pt was noted during & s/p extubation, pt was noted to have a persistent respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation.
It is unclear if this was a central response to pain or agitation.
During diuresis, there was an additional component of contraction alkalosis with elevated bicarbonate suggest a mixed metabolic & respiratory alkalosis.
#) Abn LFTs: On [**2-26**], pt was noted to have mild elevation in LDH/Alk Phos & Tbili.
Pt had no RUQ tenderness on exam & repeat labs showed T.bili was trending down  with a stable haptoglobin & no schistocytes on smear.
#) Acute systolic heart failure: Pt presented to ICU with significant pulm edema & initial ECHO showed an EF drop from 70% to 10%, believed to be [**1-16**] acute chemo toxicity as pre chemo ECHO had a normal LVEF.
Pt was intermittently febrile & neutropenic throughout ICU course on broad spectrum ABx including Vanc, Aztreonam, Acyclovir, Caspofungin & completed a 5 day course of Levo for atypical coverage.
Pt is still having some mild bleeding from oropharynx likely due to resolving mucositis, trauma & possible reactivation of HSV mucositis.
Pt has not been getting PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] while NPO, d/w BMT and presumably safe in the short term.
However, pt has been unable to take po & pressures became persistently elevated since extubation requiring max dose IV meds including Hydralazine, Labetalol, Lasix & on [**3-2**], pt was started on a Clonidine patch.
Pt has hx of lifelong hypertension that has been difficult to control.
Renal US showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Pt still unable to take significant po due to mucositis, Acyclovir was decreased to ppx dose on [**2-28**] and pt was continued on viscous lidocaine, Magic Mouthwash, Morphine & Ativan prn.
Pt was noted to have significant skin breakdown on hard palate with e/o bleeding on [**3-2**] thought to be secondary to trauma & suctionning.
D/w ID who recommended continuing ppx dose Acyclovir, monitor for interval worsening, and consider reswabbing HSV DFA is no improvement.
#) Constipation ??????
Pt has not been able to take PO stool softeners due to mucositis and nothing per rectum while she continues to be neutropenic.
Abd is mildly distended with BS, pt is having flatus.
# APML (15-17) s/p cytarbine, idarubicin followed by ATRA, intra-thecal ara-c on [**3-5**] - Had LP and per hemepath there were no definite blasts in CSF from [**3-5**]; did have myeloid precursors but likely contamination from peripheral blood - pt was continued on ATRA, along with Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis [**Name Initial (PRE) **] leukocytosis initially which was thought to be [**1-16**] ATRA maturation of cells and recovery of marrow which was consistent with normalization after a few days.
- continued to have early cells in peripheral blood including bands, myelos, promyelos; somewhat worrisome and another incentive to cont therapy soon especially considering the fact that the cure rate for patients with this disease is about 70% and the normal treatment for this disease is 3 rounds of anthracyclines + ATRA --> therefore risks and benefits were discussed with patient regarding further anthracyclines and it was decided to continue with mitoxantrine for a second round on [**3-15**] given that there is often an acute non-cumulative dose related cardiac toxicity in patients that receive anthracyclines.
Prior to therapy cards were consulted who agreed pt had not received an amount of anthracycline that would put her at risk for a cumulative effect and could not say definitively that the first event was due to idarubacin although it was the most likely cause.
Prophylaxis with Dexrazoxane 500mg IV given 30 minutes prior to each dose of mitoxantrone was used for prevention of cardiac toxicity.
Her counts reached an appropriate nadir without complication with intermittent transfusions for low platelets and hematocrits and subsequently recovered.
# Acute systolic HF, resolved Pt had acute systolic heart failure likely [**1-16**] to idarubicin related cardiac tox although it is also possible this was septic induced (but no definite culutres positive).
Pt had global hypokinesis and was on diuretic therapy when I came on the service with metoprolol.
She was diuresed until appeared euvolemic and LFTs which almost certainly were due to hepatic congestion and not med related trended down with diuresis.
At the time of euvolemia she still had significant dependant edema ([**12-16**]+) but given euvolemic we held further diuresis and allowed pt to equilibrate and eventually autodiurese (as EF has recovered).
Prophylaxis with Dexrazoxane 500mg IV given 30 minutes prior to each dose of mitoxantrone was used for prevention of cardiac toxicity for the second round of anthracyclines.
No s/s of toxicity were apparent during the rest of her admission.
# LUE DVT: The patient was noted to have LUE swelling on [**3-23**].
# Aspiration pneumonia - completed 10 days of flagyl and levofloxacin today on [**3-13**] and remained afebrile thorugh entire course and afterwards .
# Profound Dysphagia, weakness - failed swallow eval and then had video swallow demonstarting pt may take nectar pre-thickened fluids but given that pt would not be able to take enough PO a PEG was placed by GI and TFs started.
Pt had some difficulty with high residuals and this was thought to be related to slow GI transit (large amount of contrast from barium swallow was seen on the KUB, no obstruction).
She was cleared for discharge home with only minimal PT at home.
# HTN - metoprolol as above .
# Hypothyrmoidism - Continued levothyroxine, home dose 112mcg po daily - TSH elevated but in setting of illness difficult to interpret; may need to increase dose .
# Fibromyalgia: continued to have good relief with PRN morphine.
# Hyperlipidemia - lipitor held for elevated LFTs, not restarted on discharge, will address at follow up appointment.
