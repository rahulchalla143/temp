Admission Date:  [**2184-1-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-1-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins / Aspirin / Fentanyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3552**] Chief Complaint: Elective bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy x2 with biopsy of LUL mass Intubation Arterial Line Central Venous Line   History of Present Illness: 80 year old woman with past medical history significant for broncheoalveolar carcinoma who was undergoing an elective bronchoscopy for biopsy of a LUL mass on [**2183-1-20**].
Approximately ~45 minutes into procedure, the patient became hypertensive , rigid and unresponsive, with oxygen saturations falling into the 50s.
These symptoms resolved immediately once the bronchoscope was removed and she was bagged.
She was transferred to the MICU with what was thought to be a dystonic reaction to fentanyl.
She was noted to have a right sided neck mass after CVL placement (during which the subclavian artery was hit) and underwent an U/S which did not show a hematoma.
She was also noted to have very labile BPs with systolics going into the 80s after propofol.
She was also noted to have a UTI (GNR) and was started on ciprofloxacin.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Bronchoalveolar carcinoma; status post right and left upper lobectomies.
History of strokes and transient ischemic attacks.
History of drop attacks; previously on Dilantin but this was stopped and she has had no further symptoms.
Obstructive sleep apnea; on continuous positive airway pressure at home.
Restless leg syndrome.
She has no children.
Family History: Father died of gastric cancer in his 70s.
Mother died of a myocardial infarction in her 60s.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM Neck: non tender right sided neck bulge, +subclavian line.
CV: regular, S1S2 2/6 SEM at RUSB Lungs: coarse breath sounds bilaterally Abd: soft, NTND, +BS Ext: w/wp, no edema Neuro: alert and oriented x3.
Bronch [**1-21**] COMPLICATIONS:  Muscle rigidity secondary to Fentanyl resulting in hypoxemia, airway obstruction and respiratory failure.
The right-sided airways were within normal limits, as was the trachea and left mainstem bronchus, except the presence of severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Endobronchial biopsies of the soft tissue mass were obtained and sent to pathology.
Tissue Biopsies of LUL pending on discharge  Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old woman with complicated PMH including broncheoalveolar carcinoma for which she was undergoing an elective bronchoscopy when she had an episode of rigidity, hypertension and desaturation attributed to a dystonic reaction to fentanyl and was subsequently intubated and in the MICU.
Dystonic Reaction The patient's rigidity, desaturation and hypertension were thought to be due to a dystonic reaction to fentanyl.
She was intubated for airway protection and extubated without diffuculty.
Broncheoalveolar Cancer The patient successfully underwent bronchoscopy the day after her dystonic reaction and biopsy specimens were obtained of her LUL mass.
Right neck mass After right sided central line placement, complicated by puncture of the subclavian artery, the patient was noted to have a right sided neck mass.
This mass was non tender and stable in size, however, a neck U/S was done to rule out hematoma/aneurism and was negative.
Labile BP The patient has a history of hypertension and was on isordil and norvasc as an outpatient.
UTI In the MICU, the patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection growing gram negative rods.
She was started on a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for a complicated UTI, which grew out klebsiella that was pan sensitive (I to nitrofurantoin).
Elevated Cr Peaked at 2.2 and trended down; likely UTI and prerenal.
Respiratory failure requiring intubation [**1-21**] reaction to Fentanyl 2.
Labile Hypertension 3.
Tracheobronchomalacia 5.
COPD   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: 1.
You have been diagnosed with a bladder infection.
Call your PCP if you develop painful swallowing or swelling of the mouth or worsened swelling of the right side of the face.
