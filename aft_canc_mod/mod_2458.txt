Admission Date:  [**2190-9-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-11-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-4-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3265**] is a 60-year-old white male with a long history of acid reflux disease.
Recently he was treated with antacid therapy and baking soda, but has been having refractory acid reflux symptoms.
He underwent an upper endoscopy in [**2190-5-24**] which basically revealed a friable, nonobstructing lower esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The adenocarcinoma involved one-third of the esophageal circumference.
The biopsies taken at the time confirmed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with papillary features and widespread necrosis.
The ultrasound-guided examination of the mid-esophageal mass demonstrated invasion into the muscularis propria, but no evidence of invasion beyond this, consistent with a T2 tumor.
Careful examination of the remainder of the Barrett's esophagus demonstrated mild wall thickening to 4 mm, limited to the submucosa, with no focal masses noted.
In addition, there was an 11 mm round isoechoic periesophageal lymph node noted at 33 cm.
A CT scan of the abdomen and chest was performed, which revealed two hyperdense lesions in the liver, but no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
The bilateral pleural effusions noted were thought to be related to congestive heart failure and left lobe atelectasis, but there was no radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.
Subsequently an MRI of the liver was performed, which was negative for any evidence of metastatic disease to the liver.

Noninsulin dependent diabetes  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  No evidence of lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of ptosis.
Cardiac examination:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
No masses palpable.
No organomegaly.
IMAGING STUDIES:  Upper endoscopy performed in [**2190-5-24**] showed a friable, nonobstructing lower esophageal adenocarcinoma involving one-third of the esophageal circumference.
CT scan of the abdomen performed preoperatively showed two hyperdense lesions in the liver, but no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.
In addition, bilateral pleural effusions were seen, which were thought to be due to congestive heart failure.
The MRI of the liver performed preoperatively was negative for any evidence of metastatic disease in the liver.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the diagnosis of moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, surgery was recommended.
The estimated blood loss was 500 cc.
There were no complications.
The patient remained intubated, and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
His pain was controlled with the epidural catheter.
On [**2190-10-1**], chest x-ray was taken showing a slight interval increase in the left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.
The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted, given the history of chronic myelogenous leukemia and decreasing white blood cell count.
A barium swallow study was performed on [**2190-10-2**], which showed no evidence of contrast extravasation from the esophagogastric anastomosis.
On postoperative day six, the patient complained of severe chest pain and shortness of breath, but no nausea, vomiting, and no radiation of the pain.
No diaphoresis at the time.
He was 95% on 2 liters, and had decreased breath sounds.
On [**2190-10-4**], the patient was noted to have right arm swelling.
A right upper extremity venous ultrasound was obtained, which showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
On postoperative day ten, the patient again complained of difficulty breathing.
However, he did not appear to be in acute respiratory distress given no tachycardia and no desaturation.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2190-10-8**] to rule out pericardial effusion.
The findings were symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
The patient again complained of shortness of breath and had coarse sounds on lung examination.
Thus the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
Given increased wheezing and shortness of breath, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
A chest x-ray obtained on [**2190-10-10**] showed probable congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size since the previous study.
Given the fever and a large right pleural effusion, it was successfully aspirated by the radiologist.
The etiology of his worsening renal function was thought to be due to decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.
The patient was consequently reintubated for worsening respiratory distress.
The E. coli and Enterobacter were pansensitive.
The pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis on [**2190-10-12**] grew staphylococcus aureus (coagulase positive), which was sensitive to clindamycin, gentamicin, Rifampin and vancomycin, but resistant to oxacillin (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus).
The consequent pleural taps grew no bacteria.
He continued to be in congestive heart failure with moderately-sized effusions, which were tapped several times.
He complained of another episode of shortness of breath while on the regular floor.
His creatine kinase and troponins were negative for any signs of myocardial infarction, and his electrocardiogram was unchanged from baseline.
He continued to have upper extremity edema, which decreased somewhat during his hospitalization.
His congestive heart failure was managed by the Cardiology service, and medications were adjusted regularly.

The patient is to follow up with the Heart Failure specialists within the next week.
