It was felt that the CT finding was not subarachnoid hemorrhage and therefore no further neurosurgical intervention was warranted.
Because of her rib fractures and small pneumothorax she was admitted to the ICU for close respiratory monitoring; no chest tube was required.
She was seen by Orthopedics for her clavicle fracture which was treated with a sling and she will follow up in a couple of weeks in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic.
