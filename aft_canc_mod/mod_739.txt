At that time, he was found to have 20 grams of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria and new diabetes insipidus.
A bone marrow biopsy showed >60% plasma cells.
Hypertension 4.
Had a pulmonary stress test in [**2167-6-23**] with findings suggestive more of cardiac disease limiting his exercise tolerance, rather than pulmonary disease, however he does have both restrictive and obstructive lung disease.

There is stable scarring versus atelectasis at the right lung base.
There is a stable area of plate-like opacity in the lateral portion of the lingula anterior to the major fissure that may represent atelectasis or scarring.
There is new linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There are stable small mediastinal lymph nodes, notably a 6 mm prevascular node and a 9 mm right peritracheal node.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bone windows again demonstrate diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with the patient's history of multiple myeloma.
IMPRESSION: Stable scarring/atelectasis at the right lung base with no pleural effusion.
Stable scarring or atelectasis in the lingula anterior to the major fissure.
FINDINGS: Mildly enlarged heart is unchanged in appearance.
Hilar contours look prominent with slight upper zone redistribution.
Poor inspiratory effort with low lung volumes is unchanged.
Multiple bilateral healing rib fractures are unchanged.
Incidental note is made of severe osteoarthritic changes of the left glenohumeral joint and right acromioclavicular joint.
Slight prominence of pulmonary hila and upper zone redistribution suggests mild heart failure.
2.The opacity at right lung base is stable and might suggest persistent pleural thickening.
Unchanged appearance of multiple healing rib fractures.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2167-12-14**]  5:22:50 AM   Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat.
Short P-R interval.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific T wave changes in leads I and aVL.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-12-13**] atrial premature beats is new and bradycardia is absent.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea - The patient has had 3 hospitalizations in the past 2 months with similar symptoms.
No pneumonia/CHF signs.
Pulmonary was consulted to assess the cause of this recurring dyspnea.
They did not think he has COPD or asthma and also the patient has not noted much change in his symptom with prednisone/steroids.
