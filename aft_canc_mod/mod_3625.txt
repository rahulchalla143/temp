Now being transferred to OMED for new dx of Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Originally admitted to an OSH [**1-7**] after a fall with a left ankle fracture.
Discharged to a nursing home, noted to have UTI treated with cipro.
Subsequently returned to the OSH with confusion and was noted to have hyponatremia with (NA 122) in setting of dehydration.
Also noted to have some right hand weakness and advised for outpt neuro f/u.
Had LE weakenss seen by neuro had multilevel DJD and sent to rehab.
Sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-15**] due to weakness in all limbs.
EMG done showed diffuse axonal pattern c/w neuropathy.
LP showed somewhat elevated protein (cytology sent).
Given findings, question of neoplasm raised.
CT of chest subsequently performed and found lung mass w/ nodal mets.
Also suspicious lesions in kidney and liver.
Question of small cell lung CA raised.
Ultimately obtained tissue for pathology on [**2170-2-15**].
Pathology returned [**2-19**] with new dx of Small Cell Lung Ca.
At time of transfer patient c/o continued weakness.
Only focal complaint is perirectal discomfort (has a decubitus ulcer).
Now transferred to OMED service for intitiation of therapy for new cancer diagnosis.
Beyond history as surmarized above, patient c/o recent bout of somonlence x 3 day.
She also has persistent low back pain [**2-24**] to ulceration and is willing to try low dose narcotics to help this.
Denies any other symptoms of infectious process though did have some increased bowel frequency several days.
No diarrhea currently F/ch/N/V.
Past Medical History: Left ankle fracture [**2170-2-2**], s/p cast Weakness thought related to polyradiculopathy (as above) SIADH - had been thought related to ILD Cataracts Interstitial lung disease Hypertension Diverticulitis Gout s/p tonsillectomy s/p appy s/p cholecystectomy s/p colon resection s/p ovarian cyst removal Rotator cuff injury Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome Lumbar radiculopathy Chronic lumbar spondylosis  Social History: Lived at home alone prior to hospitalizations.
No alcohol or drugs.

No masses or LAD.

No rebound or guarding.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No apraxia, no neglect.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

Possible left anterior fascicular block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Improvement in left upper lung opacity seen [**2170-2-6**] with small residual nodular density persisting.
Abnormal mediastinal contour with marked convexity of the aorticopulmonary window has not appreciably changed compared to the recent radiograph.
While this could represent enlargement of the pulmonary artery, underlying lymphadenopathy or mass is possible.
Multiple left upper lobe nodules with large left mediastinal nodal conglomerate centered within the AP window with obstruction of the left anterior and apicoposterior upper lobe bronchi.
This is consistent with a primary lung carcinoma with nodal metastases, with small cell carcinoma most likely.
Exophytic right upper pole renal lesion measuring 2.1 cm in greatest axial dimension.
This lesion is concerning for renal cell carcinoma, however, a complex (proteinaceous vs hemorragic) cyst is also within the differential.
MRI would be preferred for definitive characterization.
Hypodense lesion within segment VIII of the liver, not compatible with a simple cyst.
Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis without a classic pattern.
Adjacent intensely FDG avid right lung nodule also consistent with lung cancer.
Large FDG avid conglomerated mass centered in the region of the AP window with lobulated borders consistent with lymph node metastases.
FDG avid liver lesion consistent with metastatic disease activity.
FDG avid bony involvements of T2, T11, L1 vertebrae, right scapula and left femoral neck consistent with metastatic disease.
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT  [**2170-2-26**] 2:12 PM No previous images.
Two views show no convincing evidence of lytic lesion in the region of the left hip.

# Small Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic - Given CT chest findings there was initial concern for metastatic lung cancer.
Given initial presentation of weakness, it was presumed that neuro findings were likely explained by paraneoplastic syndromes.
An MRI was then obtained for staging which revealed a liver lesion suspicious for metastatic spread.
PET Scan [**2-23**] confirmed metastatic lesions in her liver and [**Last Name (un) 2043**] involvement at T2, T11, L1, R scapula & L femoral neck.
# Weakness - Neurology was actively involved in care during hospitalization.
Paraneoplastic syndrome was the presumed etiology of her weakness given characteristic EMG findings.
Have begun treating Small Cell as above.
# Urinary retention - Prior to this hospitalization, had been treated with antibiotics for UTIs, however, most recent culture from [**2-16**] without growth.
Likely due to urethral spasm following foley removal.
# S/p ankle fracture.
# History of loose stools - Early during hospital course.
Patient did not have further loose stools.
# Decubitus ulcers - Wound care consulted and provided recommendations.
# Gout- Continued colchicine initially, but then briefly discontinued given concern of loose stools.
No evidence of active flares but pt feels one 'coming on'.
# Left Hip Pain - Known lesions in left femoral neck.
Obtained plain film to assess for structural stability.
Negative for a lytic lesion, but would have to have significant decortication to see on plain film.
# Hyponatremia- Resolved with fluid restriction (likely from SIADH).
# Thrush- Noted on transfer to Oncology.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with weakness and recent ankle fracture.
Further evaluation revealed metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Neurology and orthopedics were also involved in your care given your weakness and broken ankle.
