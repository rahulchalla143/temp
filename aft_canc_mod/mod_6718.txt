Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin started for suspected post obstructive pneumonia.
Patients shortness of breath continued with tachycardia and anxiety, placed on BiPAP with resolution of dyspnea.
Past Medical History: - Breast cancer [**2150**], s/p modified radical mastectomy, 5 years of tamoxifen (Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 116**]) - Lung mass, squamous cell carcinoma?

No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: Loud left lower lobe rhonchi and expiratory wheezes throughout.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
There is evidence of increase in size in the left infrahilar mass which occludes the lingular bronchus, though it is difficult to tell the precise borders of the lesion and size of the lesion given the non-contrast technique.
There is also new collapse of the left lower lobe, though the airway remains narrowed but patent, as evidenced by air bronchograms throughout the left lower lobe.
Patchy nodular opacities elsewhere within the left upper lobe and within the right lung are also new, possibly infectious or disease related.
Slight increase in left pleural effusion, new trace right pleural effusion and mild increase in pericardial effusion.
Bulkiness of the left adrenal, unchanged, without a focal lesion noted.
If indicated, this could be further evaluated with ultrasound for the presence of a focal lesion.
Calcified lesion of the interpolar left kidney, not fully characterized.
Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Mild interval increase in size of subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes, nonspecific.
Abnormal focus of enhancement is identified in the left frontal lobe subcortical white matter as described in detail above.
Punctate areas of restricted diffusion are also noted in both cerebral hemispheres in the convexity, possibly consistent with metastatic foci, versus thromboembolic ischemic changes versus septic emboli.
Chronic microvascular ischemic changes identified in the subcortical white matter.
Obliteration of the paranasal sinuses with fluid levels within the maxillary sinuses bilaterally and significant mucosal thickening involving the frontal, ethmoidal and sphenoid sinus, bilateral opacities in the mastoid air cells.

Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Patient is s/p trach placement as she was ventilator dependent.
Patient's condition was multifactorial given lung cancer, prior emphysema requiring oxygen and development of post obstructive pneumonia.
Patient had bronchoscopy on [**2-2**] that showed lots of pus (consistent with pneumonia) and external compression of airways.
- Continue trach mask as tolerated, goal > 24 hours - Continue Atrovent / Albuterol nebs as needed - Continue mouth rinse  # Post Obstructive Pneumonia:  In the setting of new diagnosed lung mass, patient developed LLL pneumonia and was treated with Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Flagyl for a total 14 day course.
Patient has remained afebrile and has been maintaining saturations on trach mask.
Ultimately, patient will need her lung mass addressed as she is prone to obstructive process in the future.
- Monitor patient for signs and symptoms of infection .
# Left squamous cell lung cancer:  Per CT report, it has increased in size comapared to [**12-6**] comparison and it completely obstructs the lingular bronchus.
