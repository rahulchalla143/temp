Admission Date:  [**2164-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-3-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: multiple bronchoscopies [**1-30**]: CT guided lung biopsy [**1-31**]: Chest tube (left) placed; removed [**2-10**] [**2-7**]: started chemoradiation (stopped [**2-13**]) after d/w family [**2-8**]: PEG placement, Trach placement, VATS, pleurodesis   History of Present Illness: 61 M Cantonese-speaking only, former smoker who quit 10 yrs ago, admitted on Mon to [**Location **] service for workup of L lung mass which is likely malignant, here with dysphagia x 2 months, hemoptysis x 2 months, weight loss of [**5-10**] lbs, reduced PO intake, became acutely SOB today at 2 pm.
Throughout today, he developed worsening SOB, with O2 sats ranging from 95-98% RA at 2 pm, 92% RA at 5 pm, 87% 2L nc at 9 pm, 85% 100% FM at 11 pm.
ENT was consulted for SOB, and found normal vocal cords, normal posterior pharynx, no lesions on vocal cords, +mediastinal lymph nodes.
CXR shows no cardiomegaly, no pleural effusions, no infiltrate.
Earlier today, patient was sitting straight up on the side of bed drooling, with severe SOB, RR 30.
EKG showed mild STD in lateral leads, no previous for comparison.
Patient failed bedside video swallow study.
Focal liver lesions with peripheral enhancement, most likely representing hemangiomas.
2 cm left adrenal nodule with enhancement, worrisome for metastasis in this patient with lung mass.
PET CT may help for further staging.
Small free fluid in the lower pelvis.
[**1-23**]: CT chest: Chest CT [**2164-1-23**]: (1) Mass or mass-like consolidation in two segments of the left upper lobe.
(2) Small left adrenal mass.
Extensive heterogeneity in liver texture.
(3) Esophageal distention, probably functional.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid septal hypokinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
New left upper lobe consolidation occupying predominantly the upper portion of the lobe in addition to known left upper lobe/lingular consolidation/mass.
These finding may represent massive aspiration or hemorrhage 2.
New retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is improved aeration of the left lung with persistent atelectasis and consolidation with air bronchograms noted.
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration in the left lung with persistent atelectasis and consolidation   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo former smoker admitted for workup of L lung mass after presenting w/ c/o dysphagia, hemoptysis, and weight loss x 2 months, admitted to the ICU for acute SOB.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**2-3**] mucus plugging of L upper lung field complicated by ?
Bronchoscopy was performed x4 each time with evidence of mucus plugging and thick secretions.
We recommend continued lasix 40mg PO daily for approx 1-2 weeks as he was quite volume overloaded during this admission.
He had a negative head CT for mets but did have an adrenal met noted on abdominal CT scan.
Given his poor respiratory status and extensive disease burden, the heme/onc service did not feel that he would benefit from surgical resection or high dose chemo.
# Cards Vasc: In the setting of hypoxia and hemoptysis, the patient had a troponin peak to 0.9.
An echo showed some mid-septal hypokinesis.
It was thought that this was a demand ischemic event and there were no further issues during his hospitalization.
.. # Left pneumothorax: Patient had a PTX s/p CT guided biopsy.
He did undergo VATS with pleurodesis on [**2-8**] given his signifant pleural effusion.
# HTN- Consistently elevated BP, especially when he becomes agitated.
# Hemodynamic instability: Originally he was hypotensive.
This appeared to be combination of sedation for intubation and hypovolemia.
# Anxiety: ambien and/or ativan prn .
final discussion revealed that patient is DNR but would be hooked up to ventilator if in respiratory distress.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Furosemide 40 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): we recommend continuing this for another 5-7 days to correct his positive fluid balance.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Adenocarcinoma of the lung - hypoxic respiratory failure - postobstructive pneumonia - atrial fibrilation - hypertension - left pneumothorax (now resolved) - prolonged intubation requiring trach placement - s/p VATS, pleurodesis - s/p PEG placement   Discharge Condition: fair, breathing on trach collar.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and coughing up blood.
You had a mass in your lung which is consistent with adenocarcinoma of the lung.
We treated you for a prolonged course on the ventilator and ultimately you were extubated and did well with a trach.
