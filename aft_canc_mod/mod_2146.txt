Further incubation showed contamination with mixed skin/genital flora.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2117-2-22**], [**2117-2-24**]): FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
Unchanged metastatic involvement of the right posterior fifth rib.
A patent foramen ovale is present with prominent right-to-left passage of microbubbles at rest and with cough.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
CT CHEST HIGH RES W/O CONTRAST [**2117-2-16**]: IMPRESSION: Findings likely represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis or pulmonary edema.
Interstitial lung disease is very unlikely given the acute onset of findings.
There is slight interval progression of linear interstitial opacities currently with more alveolar component as well as small amount of pleural effusion seen on the right.
The findings are most likely representing progression of the pulmonary edema but superimposed infectious process in particular in the right lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded and should be correlated with clinical findings.
There is no pneumothorax.
BL LE U/S [**2117-2-16**]: IMPRESSION: Slightly limited exam (nonvisualization of the left popliteal vein secondary to patient pain and nonvisualization of the left tibial vein), but otherwise no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yo male with stable metastatic prostate cancer who was admitted from the ED with weakness and fever.
His respiratory failure was thought to be combination of PNA and acute CHF.
After 2 days of successful diuresis and broad spectrum abx, pt did not improve as was still hypoxic to 80s upon movement.
CT chest high res revealed diffuse ground glass opacities most c/w hypersensitivity pneumonititis.
An echo with bubble study also revealed a patent foramen ovale.
It was thought that the patient had a chronic shunt that was unmasked by the acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Following transfer to the floor, he became increasingly uncomfortable and voiced consistent desires to go home and die.
He was offered morphine gtt for comfort, as well as haloperidol and lorazepam for agitation.
Cause of death was respiratory failure from C. difficile infection, metastatic prostate cancer, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
DETAILED PROBLEM LIST: # C. difficile colitis: Pt developed profuse watery diarrhea following transfer from ICU, and stool tested positive for C. difficile toxins.
Patient was started on PO Flagyl, then switched to PO vancomycin given his severe infection and rising white blood cell count.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pt was admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure requiring high flow mask with FiO2 of 60%.
His respiratory failure was thought to be combination of PNA and acute CHF.
After 2 days of successful diuresis and broad spectrum abx, pt did not improve as was still hypoxic to 80s upon movement.
CT chest high res revealed diffuse ground glass opacities most c/w hypersensitivity pneumonititis.
An echo with bubble study also revealed a patent foramen ovale.
It was thought that the patient had a chronic shunt that was unmasked by the acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on presentation to the ED, thought to be initially due to poor PO intake.
Was given IVF which likely exacerbated and caused his acute CHF.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out as normal to high cortisols drawn.
Upon further work up the patient was found to mainly be hypotensive during tachycardic episodes.
Tele captured possible SVT during these paroxysmal tachycardia, and 12-lead EKG confirmed AVNRT.
On the floor, patient developed hypotension in the setting of C. difficile colitis that responded to IV fluid boluses.
He began refusing his metoprolol, and he had an episode of hypotension down to 70s/50s with AVNRT, which broke with carotid sinus massage.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient's urine culture grew out pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Enterococcus.
# Possible pneumonia:  Initially, etiology appeared most consistent with pneumonia in the setting of cough, leukocytosis, fever, and new retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
Started levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia, patient did not improve (likely because the diagnosis was more likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis and unmasked L->R shunt as opposed to PNA), therefore pt was broadened to vancomycin and cefepime.
# ITP: Stable, platelet count rose likely reactive to infection.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: Patient's disease was stable, with continuation of chronic Foley for urinary retention.
