#GI Bleed: Melena on exam/history most consistent with upper GI bleed.
EGD showed 3 cm submucosal mass in the second part of the duodenum, with erosions and evidence fo bleeding.
This was felt to be consistent with extension of the primary renal tumor.
The surgical team felt he was unlikely a surgical candidate, given the extensive involvement of his cancer and mets, and removal of the culprit duodenal tumor area would likely involve total nephrectomy, Whipple, partial hepatectomy.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney disease - improved to baseline with transfusion.
Return to the hospital if you have concerning symptoms, such as lightheadedness, chest pain, dizziness or dramatic bleeding.
