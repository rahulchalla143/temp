Admission Date:  [**2108-8-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-8-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-5-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Neurology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease was transferred here from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital because of intractable seizures and decreased mental status.
He was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf, until [**8-17**] when he began to become "confused" and developed gait difficulties.
He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic attacks and was d/c home.
On [**8-20**], he was at home when he developed a nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.
He was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he continued to have generalized seizures.
Despite the Dilantin load and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to have clinical seizured.
Despite the Ativan drip and Dilantin therapeutic levels, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to be unresponsive and had intermittent seizures.
A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.
At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2106-4-11**] after developing a respiratory infection.
A bone marrow biopsy was done in [**2106-8-11**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
This had to be discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of neutropenic fever.
Most recent surveillance computed tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph nodes.
A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs).
Routine cultures for bacterial, TB and other infectious agents were also normal.
Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing epileptict activity.
In particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10 seconds.
At this point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital- induced decreased cardiac function.
Mr [**Known lastname **] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance imaging examination ([**8-24**]) showed multicentric areas of T2 hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as well as bilateral thalami.
Laboratory studies throughout Mr. [**Known lastname **] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures and extensive toxic metabolic workup.
Another LP for cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and cytological analysis was also performed.
In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics with broad coverage.
Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal damage (red neurons).
There was no evidence of an infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.
At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members.
