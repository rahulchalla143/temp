# Abdominal Pain: Upon admission the pt reported 4 days of worsening abdominal pain and distention.
This was thought to be due to post-procedural pain from her recent RFA of an HCC 1.5 weeks prior to admission, as well as distention from ascites secondary to her cryptogenic cirrhosis.
She had a diagnostic paracentesis performed in the ED which showed no evidence of SBP.
She had a RUQ ultrasound performed which showed patency of the hepatic vessels, as well as moderate ascites relatively unchanged from her prior CT scan on [**2158-10-11**].
This markedly improved her pain and distention.
At time of discharge she did not have any abdominal pain.
# Hypervolemic Hyponatremia: Upon admission the patient's Na was 119, down from a baseline of 125 during her last admission.
This was thought to be due to hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to her cirrhosis.
She was asymptomatic with regards to the hyponatremia with no mental status changes.
Her Tolvaptan was increased to 30mg daily on [**2158-10-25**] due to no increase in her sodium on the 15mg dose.
She continued to have poor response to this so it was stopped and she was ultimately started on CVVH for removal of fluid with resolution of her hyponatremia.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient developed progressive volume overload that was refractory to diuresis.
She was initially started on octreotide and midodrine out of concern for HRS but ultimately transitioned to CVVH for removal of approximately 30kg of fluid.
Etiology of renal failure was thought to be predominantly due to cardiorenal syndrome with small component of HRS.
She was continued on midodrine and hydrocortisone to support her blood pressures during dialysis given episodes of hypotension.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient developed increasing oxygen requirement in the ICU initially requiring BiPAP and then mechanical ventilation.
The cause of her distress was felt to be related to volume overload and improved with CVVH.
She failed speech/swallow evaluation after extubation but per family wishes, her diet was advanced for comfort with the understanding that she remains at high risk for aspiration.
Upon admission cardiology was consulted to assess whether or not her AS might be leading to her fluid overload state.
A repeat echo was obtained which revealed an aortic valve area of 0.9 consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
Cardiology was consulted who felt valvoplasty was not indicated in this patient given her multiple medical conditions and her high risk of morbidity with a surgical intervention.
# AIH/cryptogenic cirrhosis: Pt presented with worsening MELD scores due to renal failure.
Patient is not a transplant candidate given her severe aortic stenosis.
She was maintained on supportive treatment for her liver disease including lactulose for her hepatic encephalopathy and tube feeds for her poor nutrition.
Tube feeds were stopped on patient and families request because they felt she was able to take in adequate nutrition on her own.
She was discharged on lactulose 15 mL PO TID and neomycin Sulfate 500 mg PO Q8H for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy.
She was also discharged on Ciprofloxacin HCl 250 mg PO Q24H for SBP prophylaxis.
We reviewed her overall poor prognosis given the extent and incurable nature of her underlying liver disease.
The renal team discussed the importance of continued hemodialysis and emphasized the fact that no fluid had yet been taken off during her hemodialysis sessions and that this would likely be required in the future.
Patient requires this for severe debility; she is bedbound and requires maximal assistance for repositioning.
Wheelchair Standard wheelchair with elevating leg rests.
Patient requires this for severe debility.
Alternating pressure pad Patient requires this as she is completely bedbound, with multiple pressure ulcers.
Medically necessary because patient has significantly limited functional mobility and is dependent for sit to stand transfer.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 25699**],  You were recently hospitalized for abdominal pain and distention.
These symptoms were thought to be due both pain from your recent radiofrequency ablation of your hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as fluid in your belly, known as ascites, secondary to your cirrhosis.
You also developed hypotension, volume overload, and failure of your kidneys which requires hemodialysis.
We also found that you have worsening of your aortic stenosis; you were evaluated by cardiology who determined that the risks outweighed the benefits of surgery.
Followup Instructions: [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center [**Location 8262**], [**Numeric Identifier 1415**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5972**] Nephrologist: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**] Scheduled: Monday, Wednesday, Friday- **Tuesday, [**11-28**] at 6:00pm and Friday, [**12-1**] at 6:00pm- Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] will follow up with you at your next dialysis for your hospitalization.
