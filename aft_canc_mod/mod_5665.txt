After confirmatory studies, patient was found to have a mass within the body/tail of the pancreas extending to the splenic flexure with partial obstruction of the colon at the splenic flexure, occlusion of the splenic vein and severe narrowing of the SMV.
These findings were consistent with pancreatic cancer.
Furthermore, soft tissue deposits within the omentum are consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
The patient then underwent an exploratory laparotomy, biopsy of omental mass which was suspicious for metastases, mobilization of the hepatic flexure of the colon and decompressing loop transverse colostomy on [**2186-8-5**].
He was also noted to be in chronic A-fib which resolvd with an amiodarone drip.
