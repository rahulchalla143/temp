Admission Date:  [**2190-2-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-2-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2140-10-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit, [**Location (un) **] Team  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49 year old male initially admitted to the Medicine Service on [**2-3**] with shortness of breath and spontaneous pneumothorax after several cycles of Bleomycin for testicular seminoma who was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2190-2-5**] for hypoxia.
Briefly, the patient was initially diagnosed with seminoma in [**2189-7-20**], status post orchiectomy for testicular mass.
Patchular vascular invasion with preoperative Beta HCG 9 that remained elevated postoperatively.
Computerized tomography scan showed metastatic evidence to chest, neck and abdomen with both the retroperitoneal and subclavicular lymphadenopathy.
This was complicated by pneumonia on [**11-22**] and no normalization of LDH, acid fast bacillus and Beta GG was admitted to [**Location (un) **] outside hospital on [**1-10**] to [**1-15**] with shortness of breath.
Chest computerized tomography scan showed no pulmonary embolism but did show bronchiectasis and interstitial fibrosis.
The patient was readmitted to the outside hospital on [**1-27**] through [**1-29**] with spontaneous pneumothorax and managed expectantly.
On [**2-2**], after increasing shortness of breath after coughing he went to the outside hospital.
He had shaking chills, nasal congestion, increased clear sputum and central chest congestion with occasional wheezing.
No orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.
The patient had a 74% room air saturation and increased subcutaneous emphysema.
Chest computerized tomography scan showed pulmonary fibrosis and moderate left pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum emphysema, soft tissue enlarged pulmonary artery.
No mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation.
Testicular cancer in [**2189-7-20**], radical orchiectomy, pure seminoma with vascular invasion.
Atrial fibrillation treated on Amiodarone discontinued [**2189-12-20**], secondary to question of pulmonary fibrosis.
History of mild renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 2.5.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs, positive rales and wheezes, right greater than left.
Abdomen, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
Chest x-ray [**2-5**], increasing left apical pneumothorax with 20% volume loss, left lower lobe atelectasis, left pigtail catheter in place, bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities, blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
Chest computerized tomography scan [**2-4**], small left pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema and intramuscular emphysema, extensive pulmonary fibrosis, left greater than right, right predominantly lower lobe.
Pulmonary artery prominence with no consolidations.
[**2190-2-5**], echocardiogram, ejection fraction greater than 55%, no patent foramen ovale, by Bubble study, mild right atrial enlargement.
Electrocardiogram, sinus rhythm with a rate of 112, axis -36, T wave inversions in 3 and 6, biphasic Ts and AVF.
Hypoxia - The patient presented with diffuse infiltrates concerning for pulmonary fibrosis and Bleomycin lung toxicity.
The patient had been on Amiodarone which has also contributed and the patient also had a spontaneous pneumothorax on chest x-ray which was managed with chest tube placement as per Cardiothoracic Surgery.
The patient was maintained on antibiotic treatments for his pneumonia, given his sick contacts, also atypical presentation, given his previous immunosuppression and therefore the patient was continued on Prednisone.
Subsequently, however, the patient had worsening hypoxia and on [**2-6**], after extensive discussion with the patient and his wife, the patient was subsequently intubated given his worsening respiratory status.
The patient continued to be intubated with worsening hypoxemia throughout the hospital course and on [**2-10**], an extensive discussion was made with the family and given the patient's inability to wean off of his FIO2 and with worsening hypoxia it was agreed upon that the patient should have comfort care as an ultimate goal for his hospitalization, and on [**2-10**], the patient was subsequently placed on Comfort-Measures-Only.
Subsequently the patient also had some hypotension which was covered with pressors and on [**2190-2-10**], at 10:26 PM, the patient had worsening hypoxia and after withdrawal of care, the patient was found to be unresponsive to deep sternal rub, no heartsounds were palpable.
History of atrial fibrillation - The patient was maintained on Amiodarone and Atenolol for rate control.
There were no acute issues to be followed up with Oncology.
Renal - The patient's creatinine continued to rise, likely due to hypotension.
