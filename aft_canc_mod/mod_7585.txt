Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with    pericardial fat.
Laparoscopic jejunostomy.
History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 53 y/o F with Stage IIB (T2N0M0) adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus s/p neoadjuvant therapy who presents for follow up after an open J tube placement 3 weeks ago.
Initial attempt was made at laparoscopic J tube placement, however the operation was converted to open due to extensive adhesive disease requiring lysis of adhesions and resection of a small portion of small bowel.
Pt states that she has continued to feel better everyday since discharge, but she still continues to have intermittent episodes of nausea and vomiting of digested food.
Pt has been taking compazine for these episodes with minimal relief.
Otherwise, pt denies abdominal pain or diarrhea.
When she is not experiencing nausea and vomiting, she is able to tolerate soft foods without difficulty.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history - [**2109-9-17**] - EGD revealed a 6 cm ulcerated tumor in the lower third of the esophagus, following a CT of the abdomen for chronic abdominal symptoms showing thickening of the esophagus.
Biopsy of this lesion was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
[**2109-9-23**] - EUS revealed a T2N0 disease.
[**2109-10-2**] - PET/CT ruled out metastasis [**2109-10-14**] - C1D1 Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Day1)/5-Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 days 1, 2, 3 and 4) concurrent chemoradiation [**2109-11-11**] - C2D1 Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Day1)/5-Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 days 1, 2, 3 and 4) concurrent chemoradiation [**2109-11-19**] - [**2109-11-23**] Admitted for poor PO intake and esophageal pain XRT: 28 Fractions from [**2108-3-12**], Total Dose 5040 cGy.

Sixteen lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/16).
Lymph node, para-esophageal (V):  One lymph node, no malignancy identified (0/1).
Lymph node, subcarinal (W):  One lymph node, no malignancy identified (0/1).
Esophageal donut (AA):  Segment of esophagus within normal limits.
Bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions which measure near simple fluid in Hounsfield units and do not contain foci of gas.
Mucosal enhancement of the gastric conduit is intact.
Enlarging hypodense lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney, suspected to represent a cyst with complication or hemorrhage.
Consider ultrasound for further characterization.
High-density lesion within the small bowel mesentery adjacent to surgically placed jejunostomy tube likely represents a small mesenteric hematoma.
Right pleural effusion, which appears partially loculated and with an intrafissural component appears substantially decreased in size.
Previously visualized left pleural effusion has resolved.
However, there are no new parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe suggestive of a developing infection versus re-expansion edema.
[**2110-1-30**] Ba swallow : Status post esophagectomy with intrathoracic anastomosis.
No leak or obstruction.
Mild narrowing at anastomotic site, expected after recent surgery.
No pneumothorax.
No pulmonary emboli.
Following removal of pleural drains, large, nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion, has increased with new large anterior loculation, responsible for persistent severe atelectasis, right middle and lower lobes.
Small left pleural effusion stable.
Small pericardial effusion increased; no evidence of cardiac tamponade.
Probable small airway obstruction.
[**2110-2-9**] CXR: Heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has improved since [**2-7**], but heart size is normal, and pulmonary vasculature is not particularly engorged.
Lateral view demonstrates that the opacification in the right lower lung is due to pleural fluid collection in the major fissure.
I see no pneumothorax.
The layering component of right pleural effusion is small and unchanged since removal of the right pleural tube.
No pneumothorax.
Her pain was controlled with an epidural catheter effectively.
Following transfer to the surgical floor she desaturated to the mid 80's and developed atrial fibrillation which prompted transfer to the ICU for further management.
A CT torso revealed bilateral pleural effusions right > left.
There was no obvious evidence on an anastomotic leak.
Her rapid afib was controlled with Lopressor then a Diltiazem drip.
Unfortunately her dyspneic episodes recurred despite TPA through the right pigtail, clearing of her left effusion and replacement of her right pigtail catheter.
She had a CTA which was negative for PE but multiple loculated effusions were noted in the right chest.
She spent the night in the ICU and did well with pulmonary toilet and pain control.
A BAL was sent from her bronchoscopy which grew Klebsiella  pneumoniae.
She also had thrombocytosis and aspirin was started on a daily basis.
She was seen by the Cardiology service after her episodes of RAF/SVT and they felt that the episodes were secondary to recent surgery and pleural effusion and there was no indication of a primary cardiac cause for them.
From a GI standpoint, her barium swallow showed no evidence of a leak and her liquid diet began on [**2110-1-30**] with a gradual increase to fulls then soft foods in small amounts.
She does have some episodes of anxiety and has required occasional Ativan which is very effective.
Her incisional pain is minimal and she is taking minimal narcotics so that constipation will not be an issue.
She will continue her cyclic tube feedings along with a soft diet and she will keep a log of her oral intake so that her feedings can be adjusted at her first clinic visit.
