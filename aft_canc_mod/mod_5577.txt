Admission Date:  [**2196-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-4-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-5-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Carboplatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: chest pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization on [**4-26**] showing clean coronaries   History of Present Illness: 74yo F with stage IV lung CA complicated by recurrent pleural effusions who was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2196-4-15**] with progressive shortness of breath and LLL pneumonia.
On [**2196-4-16**], she developed chest pain and anteroseptal ST elevation.
She has had recurrent episodes x 2 since then, one episode of flash pulmonary edema, and another episode of chest pain and CHF yesterday.
Echo showed LVEF 35%, and anteroseptal wall motion abnormalities.
Due to recurrent episodes of chest pain, patient was transferred for cath.
Upon transfer, she was reported to be afebrile on antibiotics and was able to lie flat.
She denies any change in breath with cough.
Her pain has not improved with nitro gtt.
On arrival to the floor, patient continues to have chest pressure.
She has leg pain which is chronic, related to disc disease.
Past Medical History: Anterior wall STEMI with Trop peak to 4, treated medically given prognosis, however cathed [**2196-4-26**] for continued chest pain which showed no angiographically apparent CAD COPD Stage IV NSCLC with liver mets and recurrent effusions s/p pluerex catheter placement [**2196-3-26**] at [**Hospital3 **] chemo-induced neuropathy anemia, neutropenia chronic back pain GERD chronic cough   Social History: Lives at home with husband.
Physical Exam: VS: T=98, BP=137/76, HR=95, RR=18, O2 sat= 94% on 4L GENERAL: Cachectic, frial-appearing elderly female in mild distress [**3-9**] SOB and chest discomfort.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Coarse crackles diffusely.
99% 2L to 100% on 3L Her initially very rhonchorous breath sounds cleared up by day 2 of hospitalization; clear without crackles but with only poor to fair air movement, heart RRR, no BLE edema.
[**Hospital1 **]-atrial abnormality.
Anterior ST segment elevations with Q waves in the same leads consistent with evolving/recent anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**4-23**] CXR IMPRESSION: Findings in the upper right chest likely representing postsurgical change.
A mass-like density is projected within an air cavity in the upper right chest.
There is additional streaky density consistent with fibrotic scarring and subsegmental atelectasis.
Prominent interstitial markings are likely chronic.
There is no definite focal consolidation.
Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus is consistent with pleural thickening and/or fluid.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid anterior septum.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction but preserved global ejection fraction.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Discontinue Clopidogrel   Brief Hospital Course: Pt's course is complicated as she has received care at several hospitals ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 46**]) and documentation was not fully provided on transfer here, but in brief:  74yoF with stage IV metastatic (to liver) NSCLC including recurrent effusions requring Pleurex catheter transfered from OSH where she had an anterior STEMI [**2196-4-16**] which was medically treated for a week (?
given poor prognosis from metastatic lung ca) who was transferred for evaluation for cardiac cath given ongoing chest pain.
Acute STEMI: Likely had an acute LAD occlusion given distibution of STE on ECG at the time of event.
She continued to have chest tightness through her course which was ?
multifactorial but possibly from continued cardiac ischemia without further enzyme leak or worsening on EKG.
Therefore, Heparin gtt, statin, and Plavix were discontinued and pt should continue on ASA and BB only, and could consider adding ACEi if bp/Cr tolerate.
By the time of discharge, pt had been free of chest tightness for several days.
Of note, she received an echo which showed EF 55-60%, normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**], 1+ MR, mild PA sHTN, and focal hypokinesis of mid anterior septum consistent with ACS territory.
Brief episode of hypoxia: On admission, pt with normal O2 sats on 4-5L NC however day after admission had acute hypoxia, to mid 80s on 5L, during which she was also having chest tightness.
Nitro was up-titrated, but pain was ultimately relieved by 0.5mg Dilaudid.
She was nevertheless diuresed with 20 mg IV Lasix and called back out to the floor with stable oxygenation, and had no further issues.
Unclear exact etiology of such acute hypoxia but DDx considered included mild CHF, mucus plugging, aspiration; less likely PE given that she was on Heparin gtt at that time.
NSCLC/pleural effusions: Patient likely has a prognosis of weeks-months to live from the standpoint of her malignancy as discussed with her primary Oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38058**].
There was question of re-starting chemotherapy, and this can be addressed in follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38058**].
She recently had a left sided Pleurex catheter for malignant effusions, which over time has tapered off.
COPD exacerbation vs PNA and apparently new cavitating lesion: Extremely unclear on admission as we received no d/c summary, but she was apparently being treated for COPD exacerbation with IV Solumedrol and Zosyn/Levaquin.
Through her course, we obtained records from [**Hospital1 46**], a CTA dated [**4-17**] that showed:  7-8cm cavity in RUL which contains 5cm mass with some calcification within it probably consistent with fungus ball.
Some associated RUL atelectasis with dense LLL atelectasis and obstruction/thrombosis of L subclavian with colateralization.
Paratracheal and bilateral hilar adenopathy with chest tube at left base noted.
This was apparently new compared to a CT chest that was done at another hospital [**Hospital3 417**] [**3-/2196**], and the DDx for subacute cavitating lung lesion included sub-acute infectious process (?
She improved clinically, with decrease in her WBC count and was afebrile through her admission.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center - [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction s/p cath Secondary: non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to liver; RUL cavitating lesion noted on CTA from [**Hospital3 3583**] [**4-/2196**], ?
- You should recieve cefepime, an antibiotic, for 5 more days to treat a lung infection that was diagnosed at [**Hospital3 3583**].
- You may use nebulizer treatments: iprtroprium every 6 hours and Xoponex (levalbuterol) every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath or cough.
