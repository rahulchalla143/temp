CXR [**2140-2-1**]: Severe bilateral pneumonia has not improved since [**1-31**].
There is also a component of mild pulmonary edema which is probably worsened.
No pneumothorax.
At least a moderate left pleural effusion is presumed.
Bilateral asymmetrically distributed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving the left lung to greater degree than the right, accompanied by smooth septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions.
These findings likely represent a combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
Small pericardial effusion.
Healing sternal fracture and several anterior rib fractures, which are not appreciated on the older CT of [**2139-9-15**] but are age indeterminate.
CArdiac ECHO: IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Very small to small, circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Left pleural effusion.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-1**], a very small to small pericardial effusion is present.
Previously, at least borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was appreciated.
The left pleural effusion is new.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 y/o F with hx of T1DM with severe gastroparesis, prior episodes of DKA, acquired hemophilia, htn, multiple recent admissions for nausea and vomiting, initially presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea found to have multifocal pneumonia requiring ICU monitoring, acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, difficult to control blood sugars, and acute kidney injury.
Pt was s/p 2mg IV ativan in the ED for management of nausea and she initially presented to the floor extremely lethargic and barely responsive.
She triggered for hypoxia 46% on RA but was never cyanotic and rapidly improved to 100% on RA.
ABG did not demonstrate hypoxia or hypercarbia or acidosis.
Her symptoms improved over half an hour when she was mildly lethargic but responding to questions appropriately and conversant, falling easily into sleep but arousable.
When awake patient endorsed symptoms of dysuria and diarrhea.
For renal failure IVF were given and home diuretics held.
The following day, her lethargy was resolved and she was having fever to 101, productive cough and diarrhea.
Given numerous allergies to antibiotics she was started on meropenem and vancomycin for hospital acquired pneumonia, though aspiration pneumonia remained on the differential.
In the ICU, she was observed to be volume overloaded and treated with diuretics in addition to broadening her antibiotics to include antiviral treatment and azithromycin for legionella.
During her ICU course she was diuresed with 40mg IV lasix, her O2 requirement improved.
She continued to have intermittent diarrhea and nausea/vomiting.
On the floor, her oxygen requirement continued to improve such that she was on room air.
She continued to have fevers to 101, for which drug fever was a concern per ID.
Per ID recommendations Azithroymycin was discontinued on day 9 due to thrombocytosis.
Upon return to the floor she continued to have fluctuating high and low blood sugars requiring frequent and daily adjustments of her lantus dose and sliding scale.
During her hospitalization she required 2 units of blood products for hematocrit of 21 thought to be secondary to acute illness and phlebotomization.
Unclear remain the cause of her diarrhea which may have been viral in nature.
Nausea vomiting, initially thought to be gastroparesis were minimal during this hospitalization compared to prior.
Renal failure had improved to creatinime of 1.2 on day of discharge.
She was not started on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] due to history of hyperkalemia.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - nutrition consult for gastroparesis - [**Last Name (un) 387**] follow up with classes for nutrition classes and learning carb counting.
- CT scan in [**3-27**] weeks for resolution for pneumonia, per ID recommendation (vs CXR given the severity of her PNA and concern for cavitation) - Follow up depression - Social work follow up, consider referral to psychiatry - follow up of hematocrit and renal function - will need repeat endoscopy and possibly capsule endoscopy for evaluation of occult GIB.

THIS IS A NEW MEDICATION FOR LOW MOOD AND ANXIETY.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Acute kidney injury Diabetes mellitus Decompensated diastolic heart failure Normocytic anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came because of nausea and vomiting.
After you came you developed the lung infection and impairment of the kidney function.
The lung infection was treated with antibiotics.
During the hospital stay you started having difficulty breathing and were transferred to the intensive care unit and when you were able to breath without difficulties you were transferred back to the [**Hospital1 **].
