A CT of the chest was reportedly without malignancy.
She most recently returned to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital 8 days after discharge ([**7-12**]) with increasing cough, sputum production, and left sided rib pain which started two days prior to presentation.
A CT again showed mass-like consolidation in the lingula with interval increase in size since the previous film, RLL atelectasis and dense consolidation which is unchanged, stable mediastinal adenopathy, and an acute left 7th rib fracture.
She was started on zosyn on [**7-12**]; after sputum cx grew out MRSA she was started on vancomycin on [**7-15**].
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-18**] for further work-up and management of her recurrent pneumonias.
While her current exacerbation was considered to be due to infection, the pt was felt to have poor underlying lung function from involvement of her tumor and therefore was started on tarceva.
She continued to be treated for hospital acquired pna with vanc/levo/flagyl.
The pt was also found to have new ARF with a creatinine of 1.5, which was thought to be prerenal and resolved with IVF.
Her chest pain was felt to be due to a rib fracture and was treated with dilaudid.
She is currently on 6L NC with intermittent episodes of SOB and a dry cough and denies CP, nausea, vomiting   Past Medical History: Hypertension MRSA pneumonia in [**2138**] GERD Dyslipidemia Depression Anxiety   Social History: Patient lives a alone in [**Hospital3 **].
She reports no use of recreational drugs.
Father had liver disease.
Not family history of lung disease.

Scattered single cells and loose clusters of cells with high   nuclear cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane irregularity,   nucleoli and chromatin clearing.
These findings are suspiciuos for non-small cell carcinoma,   possibly bronchioloalveolar type .
Improving right lower lobe consolidation and lymphadenopathy.
A nearby area of well-marginated ground-glass opacity may be inflammatory or also raises suspicion for malignancy.
New mixed patchy ground glass and consolidative opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, which could be infectious, inflammatory or due to aspiration.
No evidence of bony metastases, but several rib fractures, which are unchanged in retrospect.
Suspicious renal lesion not imaged.
No evidence of acute infarct or abnormal enhancement.
No evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Two adjacent areas of focal increased tracer uptake in the left lateral 7th and 8th ribs consistent with fractures.
Nonspecific increased tracer uptake within the right 6th posterior and 7th lateral ribs.
Given the findings in the contralateral ribs, this tracer uptake may also be due to a trauma; however, correlation with cross-sectional imaging (CT scan) could be used for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Complete consolidation of the right lower lobe, which may be filled with fluid (perhaps related to recent lavage), hemorrhage, or tumor.
No focal masses are identified within the consolidated lobe.
Spiculated mass within the lingula with associated left hilar lymphadenopathy is highly concerning for malignancy.
Vague airspace opacities at the left posterior lung base and medial aspect of the right middle lobe may represent infection or less likely tumor.
1.3 cm soft tissue lesion within the right kidney which may represent a hemorrhagic cyst, or renal cell carcinoma.
Recommend further evaluation with MRI.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
TBBX:  Atypical mucinous glands, highly suspicious for bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma, mucinous type.
Brief Hospital Course: 63F with recurrent pneumonias, htn was transfered on [**7-17**] from an OSH after 3 hospitalizations for RLL pneumonia in the last 2 months.
The next hospitalization found RLL and Lingular PNA.
A BAL on [**7-2**] was negative for bacteria or atypical/malignant cytology.
On the most recent admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 56012**] was found to have sputum positive for MRSA.
The patient was at home for 8 days with 2.5 L continous oxygen requirement with dyspnea on excertion.
On [**7-12**] the patient returned to the hospital with excruciating laft sided rib pain that developed over 3 days that was though to be secondary to severe coughing.
Admission CT was postive for RLL a persistent RLL consildation, left lingular process, and 7th rib fracture.
Ms. [**Known lastname 56012**] was treated with Zosyn starting [**7-12**] and vancomycin on [**7-15**] following a sputum positive for MRSA on [**7-15**].
was found to have have a positive MRSA result cultured from sputum.
She underwent bronch at OSH which revealed no evidence of tumor.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent work-up for the hypoxia which involved pulmonary consult which recommended repeat bronch.

# Acute hypoxia; Patient experienced multiple episodes of acute hypoxia most concerning for mucous plugging given the abundant secretions on bronch.

# Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma, mucinous type: Persistent RLL cosolidation and cough over months despite treatment, BAL demonstrated bronchorrhea from bronchoavelolar cancer, mucinous type on pathology.
CT chest also demonstrated spiculated mass in the lingula.
Chest CT prior to discharge showed resolving areas of consolidation suggesting improved control of mucinous secretions.
