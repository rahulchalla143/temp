She was recently on prednisone 8mg daily and developed sore throat and cough 09/[**2112**].
Despite the levofloxacin and continuation of atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, she had increasing dyspnea and presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center on [**2113-8-29**].
Initially, concern was for cardiac cause for her dyspnea (she has a history of CABG in [**2105**]).
CXR showed RLL consolidation and she was started on vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin ([**2113-9-5**] is day 5).
She has not had fevers or leukocytosis.
She was initially on heparin gtt but developed thrombocytopenia with plts dropping from >100k on admission to 58k.
She had been ambulating independently on admission and progressed to not being able to lift her legs with elevated CK (790's on [**9-4**]), ESR, CRP.
Given her hypoxia and overall progressive weakness, she was electively intubated for concern for respiratory fatigue after discussion with oncology here ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**].
Bronchoscopy was performed after pt was intubated and revealed thick mucoid secretions.
CXR was not revealing for cause of acute respiratory failure, though she does have retrocardiac consolidation on CXR from [**9-4**], potentially related to atelectasis.
On the floor, she has no specific complaints.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, Denies shortness of breath.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2102**]: Asymptomatic abnormal CBC noted by PCP during routine visit - [**2103-9-10**]: Bone marrow biopsy showed myeloproliferative disorder, likely chronic myelogenous leukemia.
- [**9-/2111**]: Gleevec held due to worsening anemia and thrombocytosis.
Bone marrow biopsy showed accelerated phase CML.
Transplant complicated by mucositis with biopsy of the esophagus suggesting upper GI GVHD  which was treated with steroids.
- [**2112-6-9**] colonoscopy showing lower GI GVHD - [**2112-9-4**] readmitted with recurrent aGVHD of the liver upper and lower GI tract in the setting of reducing immunosuppression .

No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Left lower lobe consolidation with adjacent small left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion.
This finding is concerning for infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its branches without associated aneurysmal changes.
Right thigh lipoma is partially imaged.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a myopathy with denervating ("inflammatory") features, most severely affecting the lower extremities.
The findings are not suggestive of an acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy, such as Guillain- [**Location (un) **] syndrome.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-3-15**], no change.
Note: Section showed myofibers with prominent inflammatory infiltrate composed of foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells.
In some areas, myofibers are replaced by adipose and connective tissue, consistent with a subacute clinical picture.
CD3 labeled prominent T cell infiltrate with numerous CB8 positive cytotoxic and scattered CD4 positive helper cells, while CD20 labeled B lymphocytes are rare in perivascular zones.
The findings would be consistent with GVH myositis in the clinical context of CML status post alloSCT and history of GI and liver GVH disease.
R forearm: pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: 58-year-old female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p allo SCT [**2112-4-6**] complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD [**2112-4-25**] and liver GVHD [**8-/2112**] presenting from OSH electively intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of myopathy.
# Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially electively intubated given diffuse myopathy affecting respiratory muscles.
During trials on trach collar, she has maintained her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, however her blood pressure elevates and she reports subjective feelings of dyspnea and fatigue.
Goal now for weaning her from the vent is treatment of her diffuse myositis to improve respiratory failure in the long term with gentle weaning to trach collar.
# Mold on BAL: Sparse growth seen on bronchial aspirate from [**9-11**].
# depression: Ms [**Known lastname **] has started to appear overwhelmed and frustrated by her current condition and long term recovery that is necessary.
We have deferred starting an SSRI but this should be reconsidered outside of an acute hospitalization.
# Pancytopenia: Developed in setting of starting cyclosporine.
Dermatology was consulted and felt that her purpura was due to trauma and her coagulopathy.
The bullae were probably the result of hemorrhage into thin skin.
# Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension and had been managed at home on amlodipine 5mg, and metoprolol succinate 300mg daily.
# DVT: Pt has bilateral DVT, however in setting of diffuse ecchymoses and hematomas, heparin drip was held.
Pt had CTA at outside hospital to r/o PE and had an IVC filter placed.
# Elevated LFTs: LFT have been stably elevated during this hospitalization, likely secondary to her known GVHD.
# elevated PTT: Unclear etiology since patient has been off heparin drip for 1 week now.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# CML s/p allogeneic stem cell tx: Pt was continued on acyclovir and atovaquone for prophylaxis.
She has been started on cyclosporin and IVIG for diffuse myositis.
Repeat ECHO here showed no wall motion abnormalities.
She also had cardiac catheterization at outside hospital for workup of initial presenting dyspnea which revealed clean coronary arteries.
We have decreased her heparin SQ to [**Hospital1 **] given persistently elevated PTT.
This should be re-evaluated if remains elevated and further work-up would be warranted.
She has expressed some thoughts of depression and would likely benefit from an SSRI.
5. lidocaine HCl 2 % Solution [**Hospital1 **]: Twenty (20) ML Mucous membrane TID (3 times a day) as needed for mouth discomfort.
6. alum-mag hydroxide-simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Hospital1 **]: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heart burn.
11. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
15. ipratropium bromide 17 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for PRN: wheeze.
17. diazepam 2 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia for 1 doses.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Graft versus host disease myositis affecting respiratory muscles   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted for difficulty breathing and had a breathing tube placed to help.
It looks like your graft versus host disease caused damage to your muscle and affected your respiratory muscles.
