Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Her oncologic history began in [**2179-1-27**] when a right kidney mass was suspected on angiography (status post superficial femoral angioplasty and stenting).
In [**2179-6-29**], she underwent abdominal/pelvic CT which revealed a right kidney mass.
Chest CT in [**2179-7-30**] revealed 2 small pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastatic disease.
She underwent left lower lobe wedge resection in [**2179-8-29**] with pathology revealing renal cell carcinoma of clear cell type.
She underwent cardiac catheterization with a 90-95% stenosis of the proximal LAD noted.
She had a balloon angioplasty and stenting of the LAD.
She recovered well without cardiac issues and passed follow- up stress test to meet eligibility for the high-dose IL-2 select trial.
There also was slight interval increase in the size of the left hilar node.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Diabetes - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Peripheral vascular disease, s/p R superficial femoral artery stenting x 2 - CAD, cardiac catheterization revealing a 95-99% proximal stenosis of the LAD; s/p PCI stenting in [**2181-3-29**]   Social History: She continues to live in [**Hospital1 392**] and will occasionally help out at her relatives' Chinese restaurant answering phones does not drink or smoke  Family History: non-contributory   Physical Exam: General nad Mental/Psychological a/o Airway Mallampati [Class II] Mouth Opening [Marginal (2-3 cm)] Thyromental Distance [<6 cm] Hyomental Distance [>3 cm] Dental Other (some R molars missing) Head/Neck Range of Motion Limited Heart rrr no M or bruits Lungs Clear to Auscultation Extremities no cce neuro: a nad 0 x3 motor decreased R UE  Pertinent Results: [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   GLUCOSE-163* UREA N-17 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-11 [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   CALCIUM-8.0* PHOSPHATE-4.0# MAGNESIUM-2.0 [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   WBC-1.9* RBC-3.94* HGB-10.7*# HCT-33.0* MCV-84 MCH-27.1 MCHC-32.4 RDW-16.6* [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   NEUTS-61.5 BANDS-0 LYMPHS-33.7 MONOS-3.5 EOS-1.1 BASOS-0.3 [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   HYPOCHROM-OCCASIONAL ANISOCYT-1+ POIKILOCY-1+ MACROCYT-NORMAL MICROCYT-NORMAL POLYCHROM-OCCASIONAL OVALOCYT-OCCASIONAL TARGET-OCCASIONAL [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   PLT COUNT-124* [**2182-7-11**] 02:07PM   PT-11.7 PTT-28.3 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2182-7-2**] Sinus rhythm.
Since the previous tracing of [**2181-12-20**] limb lead QRS voltage has improved, but there may be no significant change.
Stable size to minimally decreased size of target lesions in the left upper, right lower, and right middle lobes.
However, increasing size of the pulmonary nodule along the lateral aspect of the left major fissure.
New probable pleural-based metastasis to the right of the upper thoracic spine.
Increased size of lytic lesion within the anterior and left L2 vertebra consistent with metastatic disease.
There are no signs for hardware-related complications.
A significant portion of the cement at T2 has retropulsed into the spinal canal causing significant narrowing, and likely cord compression.
There are two lateral mass screws in each C6 and C7 as well as two pedicle screws at T1 with two posterior longitudinal paraspinal rods.
The hardware appears well secured without evidence of loosening.
The prior fixation involving two pedicle screws at T9 and T10 as well as spinous process hooks at T3 and T4 appear stable.
A previously noted lytic lesion at L2 appears slightly increased in size measuring 9 mm (3:94).
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
There are several bilateral pulmonary nodules (2:25, 52).
A fat-containing liver lesion (2:79) is stable.
There are multiple aortic calcifications.
Large amount of cement retropulsed into spinal canal at T2 causing significant spinal canal stenosis and likely cord compression.
Lucency surrounding interbody fixation at T6 suggests potential lack of fusion with T5.
Known metastatic disease as described above with interval increase in L2 lytic lesion.
In the PACU she had hypertension requiring ongoing medication and to best manage this she was monitored in the TICU overnight.She was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor.
Her neuro exam remained stable with some weakness in right UE as pre-op though this improved during her stay and she was full strength by [**7-15**].

Keep wound clean / No tub baths or pools until seen in follow up/ take daily showers ??????
Have your incision checked daily for signs of infection ??????
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
