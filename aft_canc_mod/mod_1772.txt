Chest wall abnormality could represent PTLD, but extention into the thoracic cavity and associated bone destruction raises concern for infection.
Lung consolidation, pleural effusions and interlobular septal thickening are nonspecific.
Such findings have been associated with PTLD but can also be associated with infection and hydrostatic edema.
Multiloculated rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right anterior chest with internal foci of gas and minimal osseous destruction of the encased first rib, thought to represent abscess has had a minimal decrease in size.
Bilateral pleural effusions with worsening right lower lung opacification, may represent ateletasis but underlying pneumonia cannot excluded.
Two had recent instrumentation and drainage, superior and lateral, and are decreased in size compared to recent MRI.
Two larger collections noted medial and inferior demonstrate rim enhancement and intermediate density fluid concerning for infectious process.
Foci of gas in the collecting system of the transplanted kidney, likely due to air reflux from bladder foley placement, less likely pyelitis.

Nonspecific mild edema involving the infraspinatus, teres minor, and teres major.
Abnormality adjacent to the coracoid process which is suboptimally evaluated on this motion-degraded study - recommend further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT, as this could represent a mass or lymphadenopathy; collection of fluid is less likely given imaging characteristics.
Large signal intensity abnormality in the peripheral aspect of the right upper lung, corresponding to known consolidation.
Multiple focal dilatations involving ACA and MCA branches bilaterally.
Both the infarction and the vascular abnormalities suggest multiple septic emboli.

CHEST X-RAYS  [**2101-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
[**2101-7-16**]:FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions with volume loss at both bases.
There is new right mid lung infiltrate.
Overall, the pulmonary appearance has worsened compared to the film from five days ago.
[**2101-7-18**]:FINDINGS: Largely loculated moderate dependent bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are new or substantially larger from [**2101-7-11**].
Difference in effusion size from [**2101-7-16**] is likely due to depth of inspiration.
Improved aeration in the non-dependent lungs on the lateral decubitus views is secondary to positioning.
The right upper lobe pneumonia is unchanged.
No new consolidation is seen in the left lung.
No pneumothorax.
Recommend CT examination to evaluate alleged new anterior chest wall mass.
[**2101-7-25**]: There are low inspiratory volumes and slightly less penetration of the film compared with [**2101-7-21**].
Allowing for this, no significant interval change is detected.
Again seen are small effusions at the right and left bases, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
There is a hazy opacity in the right mid zone, corresponding to the right lung abnormality seen abutting the anterior chest wall on the [**2101-7-21**] CT scan.
[**2101-7-27**]: AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is new moderate right-sided pneumothorax with partial collapse of the entire right lung following resection of the medial one-third of the right clavicle and first anterior rib.
Minimal leftward shift of the mediastinum may be related to large left lower lung atelectasis.
Small right effusion is present.
[**2101-7-27**]: There is still present right large pneumothorax with significant collapse of the right lung, left mediastinal chest and left lower lobe consolidation.

Of note, there is some faint opacity in the right suprahilar region, more pronounced than on [**2101-7-29**], which may represent a re-developing pneumonic infiltrate.
[**2101-8-1**]: Persisting bilateral pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectases.
Stable right suprahilar opacity which likely represents atelectasis/consolidation  [**2101-8-1**]: Stable bilateral pleural effusion and bibasal atelectasis No evidence of pneumothorax  [**2101-8-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Such distension might increase the likelihood of aspiration.

Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 year old female with PMH of asthma, poorly controlled DM1 with last A1C of 13, HTN, ESRD s/p living related donor renal transplant in [**2092**], who was admitted for fevers and UTI, and found to have pneumonia, vegetative endocarditis and abscesses of chest wall and perinephric growing group B strep.
Also with acute infarct of rostrum of corpus callosum and possible mycotic aneurisms (neurologically intact), and episodic hypotension.
Acute Care: .
Endocarditis: A small vegetation seen on mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation on [**2101-7-27**].
This is the probable origin of septic emboli seeding patient's perinephric abscess and chest wall abscess.
When patient was showing only slow improvement, and there were new findings of infarct of the rostrum of patient's corpus callosum and formation of mycotic aneurisms, it was decided that patient should undergo PCN de-sensitization in the ICU and initiate PCN therapy.
Right Chest Wall Abscess: Patient was found to have a large abscess of the right chest wall involving the soft tissue, clavicle, and first rib and extending to the pleural space.
Cardiothoracic surgery debrided the abscess and removed infected portions of patient's clavicle and first rib.
Plastic surgery closed the wound with a flap, and patient was discharged with instructions to follow up in office for suture removal and JP drain removal.
Repeat imaging showed decrease in size of abscess on discharge.
Infarct of Rostrum of Corpus Callosum and Mycotic Aneurisms: Patient experienced several vasovagal syncopal episodes in house, and during the workup of one of these episodes, the findings of acute infarct of the rostum of the corpus callosum and two areas of probable mycotic aneurism were seen on MRA.
Patient had no neurologic deficits on multiple neurologic exams.
Felt to be caused by septic emboli from patient's vegetative endocarditis, these lesions were treated with IV PCN as were patient's other infectious foci.
Vasovagal episodes: Patient had a total of 4 vasovagal syncopal episodes in this hospital stay.
Patient's heart rate dipped below 40, she lost consciousness and quickly recovered without lasting deficit within minutes each time.
These episodes can be explained by patient's rapidly changing fluid status related to multiple surgeries, and by a degree of relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of prolonged stress from surgery and infection.
Telemetry revealed episodic atrial tachycardia, so patient was placed on low dose metoprolol.
Acute renal failure: On presentation, patient's creatinine was as elevated to 2.2 from baseline 1.1.
There was likely an initial component of AIN due to NSAID use, but also a pre-renal component related to fluid loss from vomiting and insensible losses on presentation.
Anasarca: With multiple surgeries and procedures, and with possible relative AI and low vascular tone in the setting of infection, patient intermittantly required administration of crystalloid solution to support intravascular volume.
This led to the accumulation of large lower extremity edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion.
Patient also experienced asymetric labial swelling.
The right pleural effusion was tapped, a chest tube was temporarily placed, and labs showed transudative fluid so chest tubes were discontinued.
With some days of accelerated diuresis with loop diuretics, the pleural effusions, the pericardial effusion, the lower extremity edema, and the labial swelling improved.
Oozing of blood from sites of intervention: Patient had a drop of Hct on [**8-12**] and she had oozing of blood from previous sites of intervention including site of chest tube.
Her plavix, which she was on for throbocytosis and previous episdode of TIA, was held for concern of bleeding.
Given vasocagal episodes in-house concern for fall led to this being held as well, though she was stable and without incident in-hospital for days before discharge.
Chronic Care: .
S/p living related donor renal transplant.
TIA history: Patient had an episode of a migraine with neurologic symptoms 2 months ago.
She has a history of migraines in the past with blurry vision.
MRI from [**2-/2101**], showed Punctate focus of slow diffusion in the left posterior frontal lobe consistent with a tiny acute infarct.
Background mild microangiopathic small vessel disease as well.
Patient was taking plavix but because of concern for bleed and fall it was held.
Patient should have a repeat head MRA around [**2101-9-5**] to evaluate status of mycotic aneurisms and infarct of corpus callosum.
Patient will have follow-up CT scan [**2101-9-5**] for imaging of perinephric abscess.
6. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
10. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
14. calcium carbonate 500 mg calcium (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a day as needed for heartburn.
15. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Vegetative endocarditis 2) Perinephric and chest wall abscess 3) Mycotic Aneurism and Infarct of Rostrum of Corpus Callosum 4) Urinary Tract Infection 5) Pneumonia 6) Acute Kidney Injury Secondary: 1) s/p renal transplant 2) Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 3) Hypertension 4) Thrombocytosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with 4 days of painful urination and two days of nausea and vomiting.
In the hospital we found that you had a urinary tract infection, a growth of bacteria on one of the valves of your heart, and multiple areas of infection related to this.
One was around your kidney, another was in your chest wall, and there were a few small areas of the brain that were concerning for infection as well.
You were treated with surgery for the chest wall and kidney, and you were treated with penicillin for ramaining infection.
