There has been a decrease in the size of the small right-sided pleural effusion.
There remain small areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.
The central airways remain patent without endobronchial lesions.
The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is degenerative change of the spine, but no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
[**2138-12-18**]: CT Abdomen and Pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions, which are stable in comparison with most recent study.
The aorta demonstrates coarse calcification along its wall, without any evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
No pericardial effusions are seen.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, which do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
Lung windows demonstrate multiple tiny nodules bilaterally, consistent with a miliary distribution.

There are several small soft tissue nodules noted within the anterior abdominal wall, likely reflecting areas of subcutaneous injection.
The bowel is normal in appearance, without any evidence of bowel wall thickening or dilatation.

[**2138-12-24**]: pMIBI: IMPRESSION: There is a mild reversible perfusion defect involving the inferolateral wall towards the base.
There is soft tissue swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, surgical drains, and overlying skin staples, consistent with recent surgery.
BIOPSIES: R Middle Lobe Biopsy: [**2138-12-10**] Transbronchial biopsies of right middle and lower lobes: Bronchial and alveolar tissue with patchy acute and chronic inflammation including eosinophils focally.
No evidence of malignancy.
Her hospital course was length and involved treatment for Tuberculosis, fevers of unknown origin, a total R hip replacement  and the finding of a reversible defect on pMIBI.
The initial concern was for hemolysis given history of G6PD.
However, there was no evidence of hemolysis by laboratory parameters.
In addition, the patient was completely asymptomatic with Hct of 16 suggesting slow decrease in her Hct from baseline around 25 rather than an acute drop.
The cause of her low Hct was felt to be secondary to underproduction due to underlying MDS/refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and her h/o not receiving epo.
Pt continued with slow HCT trend down during stay.
Bone marrow biopsy was repeated on this admission to primarily re-evaluate for presence of AFB, but this was negative for AFB and was sent for FISH, which was negative for cytogenetic abberations.
Prior to her R hip replacement, she had a pMIBI which showed a small reversible defect.
The patient was initially placed on respiratory precautions because of continuous cough productive of white sputum.
Induced sputum AFB smears x 3 were all negative.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] requested a routine chest CT to be done prior to the patient's discharge, which showed an increase in number and size of pulm nodules compared with last CT on [**7-20**] and the repeat CT on this admission was read as "miliary TB" by the radiology.
The patient was initially afebrile (although she was started on standing Tylenol on admission because of hip pain), but then started spiking fevers to over 103.
Both consultant teams felt that progression of active TB is extremely unlikely given pan-sensitive organism, DOT, and duration of therapy she has received.
Following a subsequent chest CT, which showed stable disease, and with the patient still spiking daily fevers, the decision was made to perform a bronchoscopy, which was negative for organisms or malignancy or TB.
Out of concern for a possible eosinophilic pneumonitis her regimen was changed to INH/levofloxacin/ethambutol to see if her fevers and eosinophilia would resolve.
# Fever of unknown origin.
Pt was afebrile on admission but was started on OTC tylenol for persistant R hip pain.
Shortly after admission, she began to spike fevers to around 102-103 while still on OTC tylenol.
On this admission, the extensive search for source of her fevers was initiated.
Thyroid nodule was aspirated and culture was negative.
ETH/PZA stopped and Levo/Strepto started.
To further work this up, on [**12-5**] a TEE demonstrated no vegetations.
Because of her eosinophilia in the setting of fevers, on [**12-6**], she was treated empirically for strongyloides with 1 dose of ivermectin.
To evaluate a potential oncologic contribution to the fevers/eosinophilia, Heme/Onc repeated the bone marrow biopsy which was consistent with her known diagnosis of MDS and AFB stain was negative.
Her bone marrow was also negative for lymphoma.
# Right hip pain.
Patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and evidence of rapidly progressive destructive arthropathy in the right hip.
Patient continue to complain of severe pain in the right hip.
Patient was given oxycodone, lidocaine patch and OTC tylenol for pain control.
[**11-9**] the plain hip film was performed and revealed no fracture but with a superior and lateral subluxation of the right femoral head.
Given the nature of patient's fever and no obvioius source as described above, it was considered that hip could be cause of fever as possible extra pul TB infection although unlikey as the patients 2 prior hip aspirations on last admission that were negative.
Rheumatology was consulted and synovial biopsy was suggested for definitive diagnosis.
Ortho was consulted as request of other teams for possible synovial bx/ hip aspirate to question the significance of R hip pain and possibility again of extra pul TB manifestation causing fever.
Intially, ortho believed best approach would be for scheduled outpt hip replacement/synovectomy since hip has far advanced arthritis/capsule restriction, it would preclude arthroscopic distension and distraction needed, so would need open procedure.
As her hospitalization progressed into [**Month (only) 404**] and her fevers continued to persist, the issue of doing hip surgery was revisited and agreed upon.
Hence, she had a pMIBI prior her her surgery which demonstrated a small reversible defect.
She had her procedure under special OR settings because of the potential of exposure to TB.
Her post op pain was managed with narcotics.
The synovial and bone biopsies were negative for AFB and did not demonstrate any signs of TB.
# Coagulase negative Staph infection.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.
A transesophageal echocardiogram did not show evidence of endocarditis.
# Cough: Pt w/ cough and productive sputum of unclear etiology, has been receiving active TB treatment and CXR on admission was otherwise clear except for some mild b/l effusions.
Original sputum cultures were negative for AFB smears x 3 and w/ only rare GNR growth.
Was thought it could also be viral URI, pertussis possible as pt without fevers on admission although on high dose standing tylenol for R hip pain.
Levoflox started for empiric bacterial pna treatment.
Approx a 2 week f/u CXR showed slightly more profuse pulmonary nodularity and a new small right pleural effusion and a 2 week f/u Chest CT was read as improvement in pulm nodules but both ID and Pulm felt was unchanged.
# Thyroid nodule.
CT also showed some heterogeneity in the left lobe of the thyroid gland (present on CT back in [**2138-7-15**]).
A thyroid biopsy was performed that was non-diagnosistic due to insufficient cellular material but was had many hemosiderin-laden macrophages consistent with cyst contents.
# Hypotension.
Pt with borderline BP during admission having to hold metoprolol on multiple occasions.
Pt's Dig and verapamil were originally discontinued, given only one episode of previous SVT and concern for drug fever.
However, the patient developed several episodes of SVT to the 160's, and therefore the metoprolol, verapamil and digoxin were titrated up.
Pt remained borderline sinus tachy around 90-110 during admission w/ no SOB, chest pain or palpitations ir lightheadedness.
H/o NSTEMI on last admission.
Statin was held due to history of transaminitis and risk of hepatic toxicity from TB meds.
Held aspirin until sure pt is not having hemolysis [**1-16**] G6PD, patient also has aspirin documented as allergy.
pMIBI prior to ortho procedure showed mild reversible defect.
EKG did not show any ischemic changes.
# Incontinence.
Connective tissue diseases were also entertained, and she did have an elevated [**Doctor First Name **], but of uncertain significance.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation QID (4 times a day) as needed for shortness of breath.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever >101.5.
