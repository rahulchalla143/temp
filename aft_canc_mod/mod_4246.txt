She has a known history of gait unsteadiness, potentially secondary to known brain metastatic disease, and was in her usual state of health until yesterday when she sustained a fall at home (per ED notes, she tripped on her rug).
She presented to [**Hospital **] hospital and was noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic.
She then underwent a chest CTA that demonstrated a left segmental pulm artery PE, small saddle PE, right pleural effusions, and ?right post-obstructive pneumonia.
She was started on a heparin gtt without a bolus, and she was given 1L NS, vancomycin for post-obstructive pneumonia and dilaudid for pain.
She was also placed on cpap empirically for dyspnea and tachypnea in the high 20s low 30s but did not tolerate it well per report.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Ms [**Known firstname 6177**] [**Known lastname 19672**] was 52 year old when on [**10-13**], [**2113**] presented with a generalized tonic clonic seizure while driving.
A CT torso on [**2113-10-14**] showed lung lesions including a right sided lung mass with associated right hilar nodules.
Biopsy of these areas showed adenocarcinoma that was CK7+, TTF-1+ and CK20 negative consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
She was determined to have metastatic lung cancer with brain involvement.
There was concern for  leptomeningeal disease by neuro-oncology on an outside head MRI,  hence Avastin was considered in the treatment regimen with carboplatin and taxol.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure/PE/pneumonia: Hypoxic respiratory failure likely multifactorial with chronic PE (from [**2114-4-2**]).
OSH CTA was reviewed demonstrating no change in PE size, and a R-sided post-obstructive PNA with bilateral pleural effusions.
Switched back to Enoxaparin on [**10-21**] when it was clear patient did not wish to have any invasive procedures during her hospital stay.
# Non-small cell lung cancer of right lung: Followed by Drs.
# Fall:  Likely had mechanical fall; found to have ?new compression fractures at OSH.
