When he was working with PT, he was noted to have L sided face droop and weakness of left hand/arm and CT scan showed multiple small subdural hematoma as above.

L facial droop, asymmetric mouth opening from facial droop, uvula/tongue midline.
Stable superimposed acute on chronic right subdural hematoma with minimal local mass effect.
No subfalcine or transtentorial herniation.
Prominent extra axial space overlying the left frontal lobe, also unchanged.
Mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells and left mastoid air cells.
Probable chronic lung disease related to asbestos exposure 2.
No acute cardiopulmonary process .
Stable acute on chronic subdural hematomas with minimal local mass effect.
No subfalcine or transtentorial herniation.
Unchanged mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and mastoid air cells .
Head CT [**2-4**]: IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2197-2-3**] exam, there is no significant change in acute on chronic right subdural hematoma.
No new focus of acute intracranial hemorrhage is noted.
ATTENDING NOTE: Some change in appearance is likely due to redistribution.
No new hemorrhage.
[**2-5**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No change in exam compared to next preceding study with stable chronic bifrontal subdural hematomas and unchanged right frontal and parafalcine internal foci of hyperattenuation, suggesting more acute hemorrhage.
Stable acute on chronic right subdural hematoma and unchanged chronic left Preliminary Reportfrontal subdural hematoma.
No subfalcine or transtentorial herniation .
Microbiology: ucx-no growth bcx-no growth  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 79 yo M with CLL on chemo, admitted to OSH for transfusion for pancytopenia, noted to have new L.sided deficit and found to have R. sided subdural hemorrhages in setting of thrombocytopenia.
# acute on chronic Subdural hematoma: Pt was seen in ED by neurosurgery with recommendation for repeat scan in ED and in 24 hours that appeared stable per radiology, subsequent scans have also been stable.
He required transfusion of platelets given concern for his neurosurgical bleeding.
On arrival to the ICU, patient examined and seemed to have worsening LUE weakness, but overall appeared stable.
Neurosurgery would like follow-up as an outpatient in 4-weeks, with head CT prior to appointment, given his clinical stability and noted no need for operative intervention.
It was thought that pt, experienced SDH due to low platelet count.
Of note, pt has a L.upper extremity weakness 3-4/5, with L.sided facial droop.
# Pancytopenia with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia- Patient admitted to [**Hospital1 392**] for severe/symptomatic anemia.
He required platelet transfusion in the setting of his low platelets, goal being > 50,000.
Of note, pt is thought to have a possible autoimmune component to his thrombocytopenia and was on steroids as an outpatient.
# CLL: Patient began treatment 2 weeks prior to admission with bendamustine.
Pt is now neutropenic and chemotherapy is on hold.
# Parkinson's disease: Patient on levodopa-carbidopa as an outpt and this was continued at home regimen .. # COPD: patient on symbicort as an outpatient, no evidence of exacerbation or respiratory distress.
# History of hypertension, but per Atrius record, with new orthostatic hypotension, likely related to his Parkinson's disease.
- Per neurosurgery, goal SBP < 140, monitor BP closely.
Pt did not have hypertension while on the medical floor and no medications were given.
Pt was found to have orthostatic hypotension a few days prior to discharge with dizziness.
However, this improved and pt was able to ambulate with physical therapy without symptoms on the day of discharge.
Transitional care -at least daily monitoring of CBC to monitor for neutropenia, and need for transfusion of plt for plt <50 or PRBCs for HCT <25 -neurosurgery f/u in 4weeks with repeat head CT, scheduled -oncology f/u for CLL and continued instructions on prednisone taper, scheduled.

Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Subdural hematoma CLL Thrombocytopenia Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a subdural hematoma due to low platelets.
medication changes: 1.start keppra to prevent seizures 2.prednisone taper 3.start bactrim and calcium and vitamin d while on steroids .
