History of Present Illness: 64M with h/o EtOH cirrhosis, HTN, DM2 who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**1-13**] with increasing abdom distension refractory to direutics (increased by PCP) and increasing lethargy.
Increasing abdom distension x several months but had been working full time until ~3 wks ago.
Had been admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hosp ~1 wk prior to this admission for a febrile episode.
Upon presentation to [**Location (un) 21541**] on [**1-13**], he had mild SOB & mild nausea believed related to his abdom distention.

Serum WBC was elevated at 17, and empiric levoflox/flagyl were initiated.
Became hypotensive to 70s/40s on [**1-15**] which improved w/500cc NS.
Also noted to have L-arm weakness w/hypoTN & CT head done but w/o evid of stroke.
Pt was directly admitted to the medicine service & upon arrival was tired, thirsty, & c/o L-arm weakness.
CT head showed possible L-pons lesion and MRI/A ([**1-17**]) showed watershed ischemia in R hemisphere.
SBP initially 115s but became hypotensive to 80s/50s & transferred to ICU for closer monitoring & pressure support.
no tobacco or ivdu.
Neck: supple without Carotid bruits CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally + ASTERIXIS.

There is calcification within the right basal ganglia.
There is a question of low density in the left side of the pons on image 9 but this is indefinite.
There are no acute fractures.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Possible abnormality of pons.
MRI: FINDINGS: There is abnormal diffusion in the right hemisphere in a patchy fashion some of which is in a location suspicious for a watershed distribution and infarction, some of which may represent embolic infarcts in the occipital lobe.
There is some abnormal signal in some of these areas especially in the posterior frontal and parietal region on the FLAIR sequence to indicate that some of these may be subacute in nature.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is no evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collection.
There is no evidence of abnormality relative to the brain stem.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal signal on diffusion weighted and T2W sequences in the right hemisphere as discussed above consistent with watershed and/or embolic infarction.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES:  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
The P1 portion of the left posterior cerebral artery is probably not patent and is associated with a fetal type left posterior communicating artery.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality  ABD u/s: ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: The liver is nodular and echogenic consistent with the history of cirrhosis.
There is free fluid in the abdomen adjacent to the liver and extending into both lower quadrants.
There is no hydronephrosis within the right kidney.
There is a small 7 mm exophytic lower attenuation area within the kidney, most likely a simple cyst.
The spleen is enlarged with multiple echogenic foci consistent with granulomas.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The middle and right hepatic arteries are patent, but contain elevated resistive indices ranging from 0.74 to 0.85.
There is no flow seen within the main portal vein or right portal vein branches.
TORSO CT: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The soft tissue window images reveal no significant axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is calcification of the aortic arch.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is a moderate sized right pleural effusion.
Small left effusion is also present.
The lung window images reveal bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
A nodular liver is visualized.
There is a large amount of ascites present.
The abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
There are multiple para-aortic lymph nodes present.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A large amount of free fluid is present.
The urinary bladder appears unremarkable.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
A rectal tear was present.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in the osseous structures.
Shrunken nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
Had major fluid shifts and hypotension after tap (was 6L) and developed stroke, worsened renal failure, worsening hepatic failure.
- Abdom U/S ([**1-17**]) showed nodular liver c/w cirrhosis; R & middle hepatic arteries w/elevated resistive indices; no flow in R or main portal veins that could be c/w portal vein thrombosis or infiltrative dz; R & middle hepatic veins WNL; L-side of liver & L-sided vasculature not visualized due to bowel gas & distention.
Spleen w/nodules c/w granulomas.
US cannot rule out HCC in worsening liver failure and PV thrombosis.
Pt developed worsening abd distension and elevated bladder pressure on [**2197-1-20**].
A large volume paracentesis was performed and 3.8 liters of fluid was removed with decreased in bladder pressure from 27 to 17.
Pt developed refractory ascites likely [**2-15**] portal vein thrombosus.
2) ARF: Thought to be [**2-15**] hypotension and ATN vs. hepatorenal syndomr.
+muddy brown casts so most likely ATN from hypoTN.
Pt continued to have worsening urine output starting [**1-19**].
3)ID: Pt developed increased leukocytosis [**1-19**] which became persistent.
A CT scan of the thorax was done on [**2197-1-20**] w/o contrast which showed [**3-17**] small pulm nodules; moderate R pleural eff; cirrhotic liver; large ascites; pancreas & bowel unremarkable.
Unclear if predated portal vein thrombosis & worsening ascities or not (cirrhosis & pancreatitis both predispose to portal vein thrombosis).
5) Previous HypoTN: DiffDx incl sepsis, dehydration (from aggressive diuresis)or poor perfusion from worsening cirrhosis.
Started Neo on [**1-18**] for increasing lactate.
5) Ischemic stroke: likely due to hypoTN post-paracentesis at OSH as L-arm weakness began acutely then; CT & MRI/A as above.
Carotid dopplers ([**1-18**]) notable for 60-69%R ICA occlusion and L-vertebral not visualized (so could be occulded or hypoplastic)  6) Coagulopathy: Likely from cirrhosis.
6) Elevated Hct: Hct in high 50s at OSH; unclear etiology (expect anemia in this chronically ill pt).
Patient with relative [**Name (NI) 58775**] and also with worsening thrombocytopenia.
Pt INR already elevated and beta-blockers contraindicated due to hypotension.
Pt was transfered to the floor and received Morphine for shortness of breath PRN.
