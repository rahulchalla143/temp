Past Medical History: PMHx:spondylosis, chronic low back pain associated with degenerative changes.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has been very stable.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes downgoing bilaterally Coordination: pt too lethargic to perform   Pertinent Results: CT head: Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Recommend head CTA to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm.
Findings were discussed with Dr.  CTA: FINDINGS: There is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the region of the anterior communicating artery (2:317), consistent with aneurysm.
This has a very narrow neck, and would be amenable to endovascular intervention.
No other aneurysm or vascular abnormality is seen.
There is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
Otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
IMPRESSION: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery, with narrow neck.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83**] was admited on [**2175-3-12**] and became increasingly lethargic and transferred to the ICU for further care under the Neurosurgery service.
A diagnostic CTA revealed a large ACOM aneursym which was coiled the following day.
was admitted to the ICU with a ventricular drain.
There were no incidences of increased intracranial pressure or decline.
A cerebral perfusion study performed [**3-15**] confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes.
He had some R shoulder weakness and shoulder X-ray was concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was consulted.
On [**2179-3-16**]/14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened due to elevated ICP levels.
He had his ventricular drain clamped on [**3-21**] and after 48 hours of the clamping trial he had a CT done which was stable without any evidence of hydrocephalus.
On discharge his exam is as follows:  Alert and Oriented X2 Moving all extremities with full strength slight Right Drift, which has been persistant throughout his hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff injury.
