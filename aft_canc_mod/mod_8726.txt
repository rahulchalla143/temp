She provides the majority of the history today as she states his dementia is quite severe.
She denies any head injury or LOC.
She reports multiple problems with his legs in the past.
Both patient and wife deny dizziness, leg pain, urinary symptoms, though frequency of urination is old, decreased urine output, urinary odor, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, cough or other symptoms.
He has not had any blood in his urine or his stool She does report he has seemed "groggier" than usual over the last few days but is not able to further characterize.
Given his CKD, she ensures that he drinks 1 quart of water daily to stay hydrated and does not feel  that he has had decreased or increased PO intake recently.
He did have a prostate biopsy for surveillance of his prostate ca on [**4-4**] which came back negative on pathology.
CT head was negative for acute intracranial process, and CXR was unremarkable.
Labs were remarkable for hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.

CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Age-appropriate cortical and cerebellar atrophy, with chronic small vessel ischemic change.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Skeletal Survey: No focal lytic bony lesion is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M with h/o prostate, testicular cancer, MGUS, and dementia presents with worsening ataxia, found to have renal failure and hyperkalemia.
# Acute kidney injury: Pt's creatinine was increased ten-fold on admission (baseline 1.5 to 11).
Did not appear volume overloaded and urine lytes revealed FeNa of 13%.
There was concern for AIN or possible cast nephropathy given MGUS.
His complement levels were normal, but SPEP and UPEP were positive and remaining clinical picture was suggestive of multiple myeloma.
He did develop hypernatremia to 147 on the day of discharge (at which point he was hydrating with only PO fluids), but renal was comfortable discharging as long as patient had close follow-up.
Lisinopril should likely not be restarted given his higher risk of volume depletion and cast nephropathy.
# Multiple Myeloma: Given patient's history of MGUS, acute renal failure, and increase in light chains, heme-onc was consulted for evaluation of progression to multiple myeloma.
He will follow-up with oncology as an outpatient for possible initiation of chemotherapy.
It is unclear if he has ever had treatment for his positive PPD in the past.
# Bradycardia: In the MICU, patient was noted to be unresponsive for 90 seconds.
Monitoring showed bradycardia to 30s.
Telemetry strip showed possible junctional escape rhythm, and cardiology was consulted for possible pacer placement.
Cardiology felt likely junctional escape with sick sinus syndrome, deferred pacing and recommended avoiding AV nodal agents.
He was monitored on telemetry throughout his stay and had no other arrhythmias.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been due to weakness and electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia known to cause lower extremity weakness).
Head CT negative for acute intracranial process and has had a negative RPR in past.
There were no acute changes in his neurological status, and he was cleared by PT to go home with services.
# Murmur: Systolic murmur on exam had not been documented in recent outpatient notes.
He had an echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart disease, but the echo showed only mild LVOT, which likely accounts for the murmur.. .
Unclear baseline, likely acute on chronic secondary to his multiple myeloma.
Guiac positive in ED which is consistent w/ recent prostate biopsy.
Anemia studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to multiple myeloma.
# Hypertension: Home lisinopril held in setting of renal failure as documented above.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: * Acute on chronic renal insufficiency * Symptomatic bradycardia due to junctional escape rhythm * Multiple Myeloma  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: * vascular dementia * MGUS * remote history of testicular cancer * prostate cancer * hypertension * carotid aneurysm * obstructive sleep apnea * chronic leg pain, possibly secondary to radiculopathy * psoriasis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2182-4-12**] after you were having falls.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed and suggest you have multiple myeloma.
STOP taking gabapentin (broken down by kidney)  PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE BLOODWORK CHECKED ON [**2182-4-22**].
