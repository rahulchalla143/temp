Chest CT revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules.
Follow-up CTs revealed slow growth of lung nodules.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male in no acute distress.

x14 potential doses.
During this week he received nine of 14 doses with 5 doses held related to shock requiring vasopressor blood pressure support and toxic encephalopathy.
On treatment day #3 he developed hypotension unresponsive to fluid boluses and was placed on dopamine for blood pressure support.
He also developed severe arthralgias requiring intravenous morphine for pain control.
He had one episode of hypoxia on treatment day #5 thought related to somnolence from narcotics.
Once weaned off dopamine on treatment day #4 he did not require recurrent vasopressor blood pressure support.
He then developed evidence of toxic encephalopathy manifested by confusion and agitation treatment day 4 into 5, prompting IL-2 to be held.
Other side effects during this week included nausea and vomiting improved with Ativan; diarrhea improved with Lomotil; and development of an erythematous skin rash.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 6.8.
He developed metabolic acidosis with a minimum bicarb of 18 improved with bicarb repletion.
He had no thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy or myocarditis noted.
He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 2.6 improved to 1.1 at the time of discharge.
He had no transaminitis noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post cycle II week two high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock, acute renal failure and arthralgias.
