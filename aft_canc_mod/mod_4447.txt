Quit smoking and EtOH ~ 1 year ago   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: On Discharge: VS: 98.2, 60, 130/54, 18, 97% RA GEN: Pleasant man in NAD CV: RRR Lungs: CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh Abd: Bilateral and midline incision with retantion sutures.
Incision packed with dry sterile gauze and covered with [**Location (un) **] straps.
**FINAL REPORT [**2174-7-22**]** Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2174-7-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2174-7-24**]** MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2174-7-24**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Large feculent collection in the right upper quadrant communicating with the surgical incision, apparently arising from a broad-based defect in the adjacent hepatic flexure/proximal transverse colon, where there are findings consistent with colonic ischemia/infarction.
Pancreatic head mass compatible with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as previously demonstrated.
New bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Extensive opacification at the right base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm and right heart border is consistent with collapse of the right middle and lower lobe with associated pleural effusion.
There is also extensive opacification at the left base medially, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
There is continued area of ill-defined opacification in the left upper zone laterally with preservation of pulmonary markings.
Is there any clinical suspicion for loculated effusion in this region?
[**2174-7-18**] CHEST PORT: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-17**]: Moderate right pleural effusion has decreased.
Lateral aspect left lower chest is excluded, but the remaining left pleural surface is unremarkable.
Previous left perihilar consolidation has cleared.
Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged when compared to [**2174-7-19**] exam.
No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette, right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumothorax has been noted.
[**2174-7-16**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of the same date no significant change.
[**2174-7-22**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Since the previous tracing of [**2174-7-20**] no significant change.
[**2174-7-28**] EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with occasional ventricular premature beats.
There is no diagnostic interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 66 yo male who is s/p side-to-side gastrojejunostomy, open cholecystectomy, open wedge liver biopsy, and multiple pancreatic biopsies for unresectable pancreatic cancer on [**2174-7-5**].
He did well post operatively( please see previous discharge summary) and prior to discharge had minimal erythema and small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the abdominal wound.
Pt presented to clinic today with increased drainage and erythema at the R lateral edge of his wound.
He has been afebrile at home with no increase in abdominal pain.
On [**7-15**] abdominal CT was obtained and demonstrated a feculent collection in the RUQ  communicating with surgical incision, arising from broad-based defect  in the adjacent hepatic flexure/proximal transverse colon, complected with colonic ischemia/infarct.
Patient went to the OR at the same day and underwent exploratory laparotomy with extended right hemicolectomy, end ileostomy, mucous fistula, mobilization of splenic flexure and wide debridement and re-closure of right subcostal incision.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro/Pain: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV/HEME: The patient has cardiac history significant for CAD s/p CABG [**2172**] and MI s/p DES 6/[**2173**].
In evening POD # 6, patient started to have bloody emesis, his Hct dropped to 24.4 from 30.1.
Patient continued to have bloody emesis and was transferred in ICU.
ICU Course: Patient began coughing up blood ~9pm [**7-21**] and then had about 125cc of bright red bloody emesis followed by 325cc of bloody output from his ostomy at 3:30am [**7-22**].
Patient has been mildly tachycardic from 88->105, however blood pressure has been stable sBP 130's.
During the EGD the the area of the efferent loop demonstrated heaped up mucosa, and the bleeding seemed to be coming from that area.
Ultimately, after clips were placed, it appeared that there was a long longitudinal vessel that, when a clip was placed on it, would bleed from another site.
After multiple clips were placed, it appeared that there was necrosis at the edge of the gastrojejunostomy that would continue to bleed.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Patient remained afebrile during hospitalization, WBC curve was monitored closely, and cultures were negative.
Wound care was done on daily bases and included debridement and dressing changes, no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular low residue diet with supplements, ambulating with walker, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Calcium Carbonate 200 mg (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for Heartburn.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.
Unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Anastamosis bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Ambulatory  with abdominal binder on only- requires assistance or aid (walker).
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*Replace fluid loss from ostomy daily.
*If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
