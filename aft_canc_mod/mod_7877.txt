She lives alone in [**Hospital3 4634**] and has never had any issues with her neighbors, agitation or unusual behavior previously.
The patient was confused and agitated in the Emergency Room, but mentioned that she had had a cold recently (but unable to elicit what sx she had).
She was started on oral ciprofloxacin for her hx of UTIs with bacteuria, despite a U/A showing > 10 epis in addition to bacteria (but only 0-2 WBCs) and neg leukocyte esterase.
That evening she had an episode of bilateral arm shaking, but apparently maintained "wakefulness".
She then per report may have had a second seizure-like episode that night, bnut no specific description is available in the notes from the OSH.
While on the floor she began to run low grade fevers.
On a more detailed physical exam, she was noted to have a herpetic rash across her L lower back that appeared to conform to a dermatomal pattern.
She was seen by neurology the next day when she spiked a fever to 102 and they were therefore consulted.
She was inattentive and sleepy on their report put otherwise without focal neurological findings.
(But while they were finalizing their recs, we were contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible transfer, and also recommended the above interventions in addition to an LP).
Unfortunately, once she was adequately positioned it was noticed that her active herpes zoster rash (with oozing blisters) was less than [**2-6**] inch away from the only viable LP site.
On neuro ROS, the pt reports that everything hurts, but we are unable to obtain further information as pt is very inattentive and uncooperative with further questioning.
On general review of systems, the pt reports that everything hurts, but we are unable to obtain further information as pt is very inattentive and uncooperative with further questioning.

These findings are indicative of moderate to severe encephalopathy most likely representing spindle coma.
This is apparent of nonspecific etiology and can be seen in the hypoxic ischemic setting, or alternatively could be related to effects of sedative medications such as long-acting benzodiazepines.

Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a 74 year-old R-handed woman with PMHx of moderate dementia, osteoporosis and scoliosis who presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2108-3-22**] for altered mental status, who has since had possible seizure activity, fevers and a herpetic appearing rash, transferred here for further mangagement.
Neurological exam was only notable for worsening encephalopathy with many brisk movements of all 4 extremities.
Unfortunately, her course has been c/b intermittent clonic seizures which are associated with a poor prognosis and associated possible brain damage.
[] Depressed Level of Consciousness - The patient's waxing-[**Doctor Last Name 688**] and then depressed LOC was initially thought at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital to be due to a UTI on the background of dementia, but she was discovered to have a left flank dermatomal vesicular rash consistent with shingles.
She unfortunately developed frequency clonic seizures that were refractory to multiple anticonvulsants until a propofol infusion was started.
[] VZV Meningo-Encephalitis - She had depressed LOC, nuchal rigidity, and intermittent movements concerning for clonic seizures or decorticate/decerebrate posturing.
The patient's CSF infection was treated with IV Acyclovir for the entire hospital course with an intent to recheck the CSF VZV PCR for possible clearance of the virus as suggested by Infectious Diseases.
[] Seizures - The patient developed myoclonic seizures, possibly resulting from her meningo-encephalitis.
This unfortunately was not successful in aleviating her seizures and her seizures worsened during this time, so lorazepam was returned to the prior dosing.
[] Hypotension - The patient was noted to have persistent low blood pressures.
She was worked up for adrenal insufficiency which revealed a low cortisol, but her blood pressure did not respond to high dose corticosteroids.
[] Pneumonia - She had a tracheostomy placed but subsequently developed ventilator-associated pneumonia which was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (tobramycin, vancomycin, cefepime).
[] Transaminitis - She was noted to have increasing LFTs after valproate was tried, so this medication was stopped.
The LFTs remained elevated but stable.
