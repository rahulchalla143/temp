Admission Date:  [**2147-12-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-12-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-12-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical Ventilation  History of Present Illness: This is a 56 year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with mets to the lung/CNS presents with worsening SOB.
Her MRI was noted to have new lesions and suspicious lesions in her spine as well.
She was noted to have severe dyspnea and referred to the ED.
CXR showed worsening mets.
She everntually had her CTA that was negative for PE, but showed worsening disease, compression of her right sided airways, pleural effusions.
She was given albuterol and ipratropium nebs and given levofloxacin/flagyl for empiric coverage.
ROS: Unable to obtain   Past Medical History: Oncology History: -- [**2147-4-27**] CT-scan a 10 cm left renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
-- This revealed worsening disease in the bilateral lungs and mediastinal masses.
-- [**2147-10-29**], brain CT on Wednesday revealed four small lesion in the CNS confirmed by MRI.
Past Medical History: Hashimoto's thyroiditis Hypertension, Appendectomy in [**2137**] Right ovary surgery in [**2135**] Laparoscopy for infertility   Social History:   Per [**Name (NI) **] Three brothers, three sisters, she has no children.
Family History: Per [**Name (NI) **] Kidney disease in her maternal grandmother who had a nephrectomy for unknown cause, great grandmother who also had kidney disease, which she describes as Bright's disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP: HR: RR: O2Sat: GEN: intubated and sedated HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: coarse breath sounds, prolonged exp phase with wheeze ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: CN II ??????
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Mild increase in the size of the right frontal and left frontal lesions.
New lesions, in the right frontal lobe and in the right occipital lobe, one of which is possibly dural based.
No significant change in some of the right occipital and the smaller lesion in the right frontal lobe.
Overall progression of pulmonary metastatic disease.
More confluent opacity in the lateral right lung base, while may represent worsening of metastatic disease, cannot exclude underlying consolidation/infection.
Overall increase in size of innumerable bilateral pulmonary metastases as well as extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, consistent with progression of extensive metastatic disease.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism; however, there is attenuation of pulmonary artery branches with mass effect on the right pulmonary artery, worse compared to prior.
Right middle and lower lobe bronchi are more compressed compared to prior from adjacent pulmonary/hilar masses.
Suggestion of trace perisplenic fluid, not fully imaged.
Multiple pulmonary masses are redemonstrated but there is interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
No interval increase in right pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax has been demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU [**Location (un) **] Course This is a 56 year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with mets to the lung/CNS presented with hypoxic respiratory failure.
Prior to extubation she had CTA which showed no clot and bronchoscopy which showed no airway compression amenable to stenting.
She was placed on empiric anti biotics but with low suspicion for pneumonia.
Based on the fact that her respiratory distress was felt to be due to progressive metastatic disease and not reversible causes, we had a family meeting prior to extubation to discuss her wishes.
Options wre to mainatin intubation and trail chemo on ventilator versus extubate and hope she is stable on high flow and then can attempt chemo versus extubate and if she has progressive respiratory distress mpve to comfort care.
She initially tolerated extubation well however gradually experienced more respiratory distress and started on a morphine drip and scopalamine patch.
Seizure: Pt with simple complex seizure in the ED.
MRI showed worsening metastatic disease.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: s/p 1 cycle of sutent.
CT scan and MRI showed worsening disease.
