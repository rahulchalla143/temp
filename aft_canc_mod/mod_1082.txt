Please see dictated Operative Note for further details.
Postoperatively, the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation and an EKG showed T waves in V2 and V3, lead III and lead AVF.
Postoperatively, the patient had three sets of cardiac enzymes and ruled out for a myocardial infarction; however, the patient continued in ventricular fibrillation.
The following day, the patient appeared to be in moderate distress; he had end expiratory wheezes and a tender abdomen with voluntary guarding.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained and they found that the atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block were new on this admission.
An echocardiogram was also obtained which showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30% with hypo and akinesis of several walls, suggestive of coronary artery disease.
The patient also had a three plus mitral regurgitation, a four plus tricuspid regurgitation and probably mild aortic stenosis.
They felt that this represented a case of ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe systolic heart failure and severe valvular disease added to the atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day three, the patient continued to have voluntary guarding of his abdomen but his pain appeared to be brief.
His intravenous was Hep-locked and he continued to require repletion for low potassium.
On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Service for further work-up of his ischemic cardiomyopathy.
