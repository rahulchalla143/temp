Admission Date:  [**2123-8-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-9-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-4-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: OMED  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy [**8-27**] Ultrasound guided thoracentesis [**8-30**]   History of Present Illness: This pt is a 65 yr old female with PMHX significant for stage IIIb non-small cell lung CA s/p one cycle of Taxol/Carboplatin and XRT admitted for with shortness of breath and hypoxemia.
The patient states that she has had a persistent cough since her lung biopsy performed three weeks ago.
She was initially diagnosed w/ NSCLC [**6-25**] due to 3 weeks of an intractable dry cough.
In [**7-25**] she also had MRI of brain which showed small right cerebellar metastasis.
She states that she has had a chronic dry cough for months but in the last three weeks it has turned productive with clear sputum.
She also c/o recent decrease in po intake and per her husband she has lost ~ 10 lbs over the last three months.
On [**8-17**], day [**2-25**] for her XRT she was note to have a temp of 100.4 w/ a persistent productive cough.
At that time a CXR showed LUL density and she was started emprically on levofloxacin.
She persisted to have fevers with chills while taking tylenol and [**8-23**] had a temp of 102 and came to ED.
She denies any nausea, vomiting, chest pain, LE edema (though present in [**6-25**]), calf pain, palpitations, or change in sputum culture.
CXR also showed new LLL retrocardiac density.
She was started in heparin drip, given Cefepime 2 gm IV x1, and 1L NS then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring of her hypoxia.
Past Medical History: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung [**6-25**] s/p chemo/XRT Metastasis to the r cerebellum in [**7-25**] Anxiety Depression Type 2 DM x 2 months Uterine CA in '[**10**] s/p XRT  Social History: She is married and retired.
Family History: Pertinent in that her mother died at age 62 with complications of diabetes, and someone in her family either her mother or sister evidently had renal cell carcinoma.
No other history if lung cancer.
CHEST: + erythema over area of biopsy site, warm to palpation, nontender, no drainage.
LUNGS: tachypneic, decreased BS in LLL & LUL, egophany RUL CARDIAC: tachycardic nl S1 S2 no m/r/g ABDOMEN: soft NT ND + BS no HSM.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Large left hilar mass and marked mediastinal adenopathy with left upper lobe atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right ---- MRI HEAD: 1.
No abnormal areas of enhancement.
Nonspecific small T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in the left cerebellum.
Chronic lacunar infarct in left centrum semiovale.
---- CXR: Interval increase in left upper lobe opacity around the apical mass and worsening of left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation.
These findings are concerning for a pneumonic process vs obstructive pulmonary collapse.
---- CXR:  Diffuse density in the left upper lobe area with concave delineation is compatible with atelectasis in left upper lobe area.
In the left hila area, an additional convex contour is noted indicative of a centrally located mass most likely the cause of the atelectasis in the left upper lobe as it results in central, subtotal airway obstruction.
The same holds for its invisibility on the lateral view indicative of both pleural effusion and atelectasis in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe.
The right lung remains aerated with somewhat irregular vascular distribution, possibly related to the previously demonstrated pulmonary embolism.
The right-sided mediastinal contour is also prominent suggestive of upper mediastinal widening related to adenopathy and/or venous congestion.
There is only mild blunting of the right lateral and posterior pleural sinus.
There is no evidence of any pneumothorax as it existed on more remote examinations.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo female w/ PMHX significant for a recent diagnosis of NSCLC s/p chemo/XRT admitted for persistent fever, SOB, cough x 5 days and found to have leulocytosis, elevated D-dimer, and new LLL findings on CXR.
The following issues were addressed during her extended hospitalization:  1.Pulmonary/PE: She did not have a CTA initially due to dye allergy.
An echo was done which showed no evidence of right heart strain.
She remained tachypneic and tachycardic though.
Due to a recent study in the NEJM, which showed a benefit of LMWH over coumadin in cancer patients at preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism, she was started on Lovenox instead of coumadin.
She continued to be tachypneic and tachycardic for the remainder of the admission.
She was switched back to a heparin drip for several days in order to have invasive procedures undertaken without problem.
She was sent out on Lovenox 1 mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] to prevent recurrence of DVT or PE.
2.Fevers/ID/pneumonia: She initially presented after having a LUL density on CXR while at XRT.
This was treated as an outpatient for 4 days with levaquin with no improvement.
She defervesed initially on this and remained so for several days.
She continued to have a persistent cough though, and her O2 requirement did not decrease.
She was changed to Zosyn, but continued to have daily fevers on this.
No other source of infection was identified, as she had negative blood cultures, negative urine cultures, and no obvious source of cellulitis/skin involvement.
She did continue to have a persistent productive cough, with nothing growing from her sputum.
They found that she had no complete airway obstruction, but did have some partial compression of her airways by her tumor.
This added to the suspicion that she may have a post-obstructive pneumonia.
A BAL was performed and grew no bacteria, but did grow [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Repeat CXRs showed a growing pleural effusion on the left.
She did have a complication of a pneumothorax on that side.
Multiple blood cultures and urine cultures continued to be sent with no growth.
Another though physical was performed, with no evidence of skin infection/abscess, oral infection, otitis, sinusitis, or perirectal abscess.
She was having no dysuria or abdominal pain, and a lactate was sent and normal.
At this point, the main hypothesis was post-obstructive pneumonia, but tumor fever was also a possible cause of these fevers in the face of countless negative cultures, as was drug fever.
IP was consulted about stenting her bronchus to help alleviate a possible post-obstructive pneumonia, but due to her anatomy, she was not a candidate for this intervention.
She was also switched to PO cipro and augmentin which continued to cover her for all possible gram positive and negative pathogens that we were covering with with her IV antibiotics.
She did not have a change in her clinical picture with this switch.
The hypothesis on post-obstrucive pneumonia was the most likely, and as she was not a candidate for a pulmonary stent, the plan became to continue radiation therapy and also to restart low dose chemo, with the hope of shrinking the tumor and relieving the obstruction.
Her oxygen requirement had been improving slowly though, and she had gradually worked down to needing 2-3 L to maintain good oxygenation.
She continued to have daily fevers, but no positive cultures.
She was also on atrovent nebs here fairly regularly, which helped to keep her breathing easier and her oxygen requirements down.
Albuterol wasn't used often due to her already persistent tachycardia.
3.Tachycardia:She had persistent tachycardia for the entire admission.
It was attributed to the PEs, fever, anxiety, or some combination of these three.
She had an echo which showed no wall motion abnormalities and her cardiac enzymes checked.
Her troponins were mildly elevated, and this was felt to be a leak from the strain she was under from the PEs as opposed to an actual MI.
ECGs showed an old MI, but no new ischemic changes.
Her tachycardia continued for the entire hospitalization, but more mildly.
The tachycardia was monitored but not treated in this setting.
No hematuria, no melena, no hematemesis or hemoptysis.
Iron studies were sent and showed a combination of anemia of chronic disease and possible iron deficiency anemias.
She never had a source of bleeding identified.
The chemo may have been partially responsible for her dropping Hct.
She also received several cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol while an inpatient, but at low doses due to her acute illness.
The MRI was repeated here on superior equipment, and there was no evidence of any metastases to the brain.
Near the end of her stay, a planning CT done by rad onc suggested progression of disease rather than regression.
6.Diabetes: She was kept on her home glipizide dose and RISS to cover for any high blood glucoses.
She had fairly good control throughout, with occassional high numbers on days after she received steroids for chemo premedication.
8.External yeast infection: She developed a candidal infection in her groin folds.
She had also had oral candidiasis at one point.
9.PT:She was encouraged to get out of bed frequently, both to prevent atelectasis and deconditioning.
She worked with PT often and regained some of her energy and strength.
She continued to have daily fevers, but they were well controlled with tylenol and she sometimes had to use ibuprofen in addition.
She also got MDIs and codeine to help ease her breathing and to help control her cough at night.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Codeine Sulfate 30 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for cough.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation three times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing: Please be aware that this medicine will cause your heart rate to increase.
Disp:*1 inhaler* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of [**Location (un) 270**]-East & Visiting Nurse Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Probable post-obstructive pneumonia Non-small cell lung cancer Anemia Right-sided pulmonary embolism Diabetes mellitus Anxiety Possible pulmonary candidiasis Oral [**Location (un) **] Pneumothorax   Discharge Condition: She is still having daily fever spikes(usually overnight or in the morning).
Post-chemo, she had some nausea this morning, but no vomiting.
Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] or return to the hospital if you get shortness of breath or chest pains.
Also call for any uncontrolled dizziness or other symptoms which worry you.
You will need to continue your antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and Augmentin) until the tumor in your lung shrinks and your obstruction is improved.
The albuterol is to use if you have shortness of breath and feel you need an extra medicine to help you breathe easier.
The side effect of the albuterol is that it will make your heart beat faster for a short time.
