Infectious disease:  The patient is chronically receiving doses of IVIG as an outpatient due to poor immune response secondary to the multiple myeloma.
She was admitted with no evidence of neutropenia, however was given antibiotic coverage in the Emergency Department with ceftriaxone and gentamicin which was changed to levofloxacin for renal dosing with 250 mg q.o.d.

Renal:  The patient has chronic renal failure on hemodialysis and was dialyzed the Monday following the first day of her admission.
Following the administration of IVIG the patient began to have increasing respiratory distress likely due in part to the worsening pneumonia, however also likely due to worsening pulmonary edema due to fluid overload.
