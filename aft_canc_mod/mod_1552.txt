Anemia - on admission her Hct was 20.3 so she received total of 3 units PRBCs with an appropriate Hct bump to around 33-35.
This was felt to be secondary to bleeding from the pre-pyloric mass.
It was discussed with her family that a conservative/palliative approach will be pursued, with symptomatic control with PPI twice a day, biweekly hct checks, and likely no readmission if she has a massive GI bleed.
Cardiac ischemia: Her troponins/CK were elevated during admission, likely secondary to ischemia from low hematocrit.
As pt has history of bleeding, anticoagulation with heparing was contraindicated anyway.
A betal blocker was added to her regimen instead of her calcium channel blocker.
She was monitored on telemetry without any adverse events.
4. s/p fall: She was noted to have had a fall at the outside hospital, but her head CT was negative for bleed and her mental statyus  5.
Nausea/vomiting: She tolerated clears then solid food in the hospital without aspiration or vomiting.
cath, EGD for massive GI bleed) should be done but will consider EGD/stent as outpatient if gastric outlet obstruction develops.
