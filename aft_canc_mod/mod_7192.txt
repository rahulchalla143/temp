History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 109238**] is a 86-year-old gentleman who had undergone a left lower lobectomy for stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer many years prior.
On surveillance CT scan he was noted to have an enlarging lesion in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
This was concerning for a second primary lung cancer and he was brought to the operating room today for resection.
Given his diminished pulmonary function, we determined that should this prove to be a cancer we would not perform a lobectomy.
