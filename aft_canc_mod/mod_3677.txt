Admission Date:  [**2199-7-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Carbapenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension s/p cardiac arrest   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Bronchial embolization: A-gram showed patchy blush in the region of LUL --> embolized with gelfoam.
History of Present Illness:  72 y/o female with h/o NSCLC s/p radiation, PE s/p IVC filter, DM, htn, COPD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-7-24**] for persistent hemoptysis.
She was initially evaluated at OSH for NSCLC diagnosed by biopsy.
She was also found to have PEs and was started on anticoagulation.
However, then developed hemoptysis and anticoagulation was stopped which was followed by IVC filter placement.
Patient then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of persistent hemoptysis.
Today, patient went to the OR with Interventional Pulmonary for rigid bronchoscopy.
Patient was found to have bleeding in LUL and L lingula.
L lingular bleeding was treated with 3 rounds of argon laser coagulation which patient tolerated well.
OR course was otherwise uncomplicated except for a brief episode of hypotension treated with phenylephrine, attributed to propofol.
However, following final laser treatment, patient lost O2 pleuth and there was concern for ansent pulses although there is question of whether she maintained a faint carotid pulse.
An intraoperative TEE showed air in the RA, RV, LV, aorta, and RCA.
TEE also showed clot in the RA and severe biventricular systolic dysfunction.
At 22, no longer selective R bronchus intubation).
Following resusitation, TEE showed resolutiion of air in RCA and improved biventricular function.
Past Medical History: # NSCLC (LUL) - dx'ed by biopsy - complicated by hemoptysis # Type 2 DM # h/o PE s/p IVC filter # HTN # hypercholesteremia # COPD # s/p tonsillectomy # s/p cholecystectomy .
No EtOH, drugs.
No murmurs appreciated.
ST elevation in .
TEE (intraoperative): large air in aorta seen tracking into coronary sinuses with severely depressed LV systolic dysfunction.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with argon plasma coagulation.
INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 74205**] has been recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer s/p X-RT and presents with massive hemoptysis, worsening over the last 1 day, from an outside hospital.
Initial evaluation revealed frank blood in the trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi which was suctioned clean.
Evaluation of the right-sided airways did not reveal any evidence of active bleeding.
Frank bleeding was seen to originate from the left upper lobe.
While repeat APC was being performed, the patient developed acute ST segments on the EKG monitoring and the procedure was discontinued.
Massive hemoptysis 3.
PEA arrest secondary to Gas embolism/ Pulmonary embolism.
Biventricular failure.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2199-7-26**] HISTORY:  72-year-old woman status post air embolus in aorta and status post cardiac arrest, now with decreased mental status.
FINDINGS:  There is marked effacement of the sulci and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
There is evidence of a tonsillar herniation.
This is consistent with anoxic brain injury with diffuse cerebral edema.
There is no definite evidence of hemorrhage.
There is diffuse effacement of the sulci and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation with effacement of the ventricular system and basal cisterns.
There is also evidence of tonsillar herniation.
This is consistent with anoxic brain injury and diffuse cerebral swelling.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 72 y/o female with h/o NSCLC s/p radiation, PE s/p IVC filter, DM, htn, COPD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-7-24**] for persistent hemoptysis now s/p rigid bronchoscopy and argon laser anticoagulation complicated by air embolus STEMI, and cardiac arrest.
# hypotension: likely cardiogenic shock s/p STEMI secondary to air embolus.
LV function reportedly severely depressed intraoperatively but with some improvement following resuscitation and resolution of air on coronaries.
30 minutes after total weaning, pt experienced acute episode of hypotension.
Given drop in PCWP and CVP with maintained cardiac output, this could be due to septic shock.
broad spectrum antibiotic treatment begun - Tx with Levo, vanc, flagyl - treat air embolus with high flow supplemental O2 to maximize air diffusion through pulmonary vasculature - Cardiology consulted, no treatment given source of STEMI was air emoboli.
- minimize PEEP if possible to allow for air diffusion out of blood - hold antiplatelet agents and other anticoagulation given recent hemoptysis and air embolus presumed as etiology - levophed and fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and SBP > 140.
# STEMI: presumed secondary to air embolus.
- hold anticoagulation as above - transfuse for goal Hct>30 - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension - Cardiac enzymes elevated but are trending down - serial EKGs .
# AMS:  Pt with AMS likely [**1-18**] neurological damage during cardiac arrest vs. air emboli stroke.
-- consult Neuro for EEG and/or CT of brain/MRI brain -- CT Head result: severe diffuse cerebral edema, consistent with anoxic/low perfusion brain injury .
# hemoptysis: patient found to have LUL and lingula bleeding on rigid bronch.
Further advancement obstructs RUL, and further removal, no longer selective intubation.
# PE: patient w/ h/o PE now s/p IVC filter.
Did not tolerated anticoagulation in past secondary to hemoptysis.
Greatly increases risk of recurrent large PE.
- hold anticoagulation - f/u repeat TTE to evaluate for presence of persistent RA thrombus .
# post-obstructive pna: presumed given CXR findings on admission.
# NSCLC: s/p radiation therapy.
# COPD: currently intubated for respiratory support.
# HTN: BP meds held in the setting of hypotension and pressor dependence.
# Depression: cont Celexa .
# DISPO: After discussing the patient's prognosis and pertinent test results with the family, the decision was made by the family to make the patient "comfort measures only" and withdraw care.
