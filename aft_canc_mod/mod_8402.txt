Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 130/69 HR 79 RR 19 O2 Sat RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm with occasional ectopy, II/VI systolic murmur heard at LLSB Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext:  WWP, no peripheral edema.
Intention tremor bilaterally, worse with movement.
There is no evidence of any axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are seen suspicious for metastatic disease (2:7, 2:35, 2:36, 2:39).
The visualized heart appears normal in size with evidence of coronary, aortic valvular, and mitral anular calcification.
The pulmonary artery is slightly dilated suggestive for pulmonary arterial hypertension measuring 3.8 cm at the proximal.
A small hiatal hernia is seen.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV AND ENTERAL CONTRAST: The liver is normal in size with evidence of a small area of hypodensity seen in the segment V of the right lobe (2:66) which is indeterminate.
There is also evidence of some intrahepatic biliary dilatation as well as extrahepatic biliary dilatation which is within normal limits given patient's age and status post cholecystectomy.Correlation with clinical history and LFTs might be useful The spleen is normal with no evidence of any granulomas, infarcts, or calcifications.
The pancreas is normal with no evidence of any surrounding fat stranding, hypodense lesion, pseudocyst, or calcifications.
The bilateral adrenal glands are normal with no evidence of any nodule, thickening, or masses.
The bilateral kidneys show evidence of subcortical and exophytic hypodense cysts which are too small to characterize.
The small and large bowel are normal without any evidence of inflammatory changes, wall thickening, or distension.
The small bowel is seen approximating the anterior abdominal wall with divarication of the recti without evidence of any herniation.
Focal thickening is noticed of the right ascending colon in the cecal area.
There are no surrounding stranding, lymph nodes, or other changes which would suggest inflammatory or malignant disease.
This is most likely either due to under-distension.
There is no evidence of any abdominal free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV AND ENTERAL CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon appeared normal with no evidence of any wall thickening, inflammatory changes, or distension.
The bladder shows evidence of a small bladder diverticulum anteriorly (2:93).
There is no evidence of any pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Patient is status post left hip fracture fixation and lumbar laminectomy.
The head of the left humerus shows significant degenerative disease which on multiple priors was seen before and is suggestive for extensive osteoarthritis.
No clear evidence of acute intraabdominal process.
Small hiatal hernia .
EKG: sinus bradycardia rate 49   Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old female with history of T2DM, HTN, and multiple pulmonary nodules who presented with weakness, sinus bradycardia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.
# Electrolyte abnormalities: She initially presented with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, as well as clinical weakness and eosinophilia.
There was initial concern for adrenal insufficiency and she was given a single dose of dexamethasone in the emergency room.
She was also given IV fluids and kayexelate and her hyperkalemia resolved.
Therefore, adrenal insufficiency was considered less likely.
She also may have had SIADH causing hyponatremia due to possible lung malignancy as she has multiple pulmonary nodules seen on previous CT scan.
She had FSH and LH levels that were low for her age, and so there was some concern for primary adrenal insufficiency, although her degree of hyperkalemia is not commonly seen in primary adrenal insufficiency.
# Weakness: She also presented with weakness and stated that her left leg was not feeling stable prior to admission.
She has multiple lung nodules concerning for an underlying malignancy, discovered during a recent hospitalization, and her weakness may be related to underlying malignancy as well.
However, these films showed no fracture and that her hardware is in the proper place.
# Bradycardia: She had sinus bradycardia on admission in setting of hyperkalemia.
She also had bradycardia to the 40's overnight after her electrolytes had normalized.
This acute hypertension resolved although she continued to be mildly hypertensive throughout her stay.
Leukocytosis: She had a new leukocytosis after admission to the hospital.
As she had no localizing symptoms of infection, it was felt to be related to receiving dexamethasone on admssion.
Lung nodules: Prior CT scan demonstrated multiple lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
She has since had a normal mammogram and the primary for this possible metastatic disease is not known.
Patient does not desire further workup for these nodules.
Upon removal of the catheter, she experienced multiple episodes of urinary incontinence, but denied frequency, urgency, or dysuria.
She had two negative urinalysis on admission, and urinalysis after removal of the foley showed moderate leukocytes, few bacteria, negative nitrites, large amount of [**Month/Day/Year **], and glucose.
As she was asymptomatic and had recent foley placement, she was not treated for a UTI.
Diabetic Neuropathy: She endorsed some neuropathy in left big toe.
