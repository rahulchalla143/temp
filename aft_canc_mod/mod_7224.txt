That was thought to be due to an underlying urinary tract infection.
In this setting, and in the setting of worsening pulmonary edema and a question of pneumonia she again became encephalopathic.
During this time she was also tapped, and was negative for SBP.
# Hepatorenal syndrome:  On call out from the MICU, the patient was noted to have worsening renal function and hyponatremia.
Urine lytes were consistent with hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal ultrasound did not show any evidence of obstruction of hydronephrosis.
#Pulmonary Edema - During the hospitalization, the patient clinically had evidence of volume overload thaw was seen on CT scan.
Renal was following the patient in house because of initial concern about the need for dialysis or CVVH, but she had no ultrafiltration during this admission.
#Hospital Aquired Pneumonia - During the hospitalization, the patient became febile with decreased oxygen saturation on room air.
It was not clear if the destuartion was due to the pulmonary edema discussed above or could be due to pneumonia.
#Tachycardia - During the hospitalization she had an episode of chest pain and acute tachycardia.
She was seen by cardiology who thought she had an atrial tachycardia.
# ESLD and HCC: Pt has known esophageal varices.
She also has known heptic lesions that are concerning for HCC.
Continued on beta blocker, although more cardio selective in the setting of her atrial tachycardia.
# Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Hct drifted down during this hospitalization.
Previous iron studies consistent with chronic disease, likely from cirrhosis.
Noted small ammount of blood in stool during hospitalization.

Recent studies: Colonoscopy without source, EGD with gastropathy and 1 cord of varices, s/p 2units of blood on [**2168-12-25**].

No head trauma and no LOC.
