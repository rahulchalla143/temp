Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with a pmh significant for a newly diagnosed CLL in [**10/2183**], DVT, and found to have PE admitted for supraventricular tachycardia, PE, and dehydration.
# Dehydration: Likely in the setting of post-treatment nausea and vomiting.
He has had emesis and nausea and been unable to take good PO at home.
He had a scan of his head which was negative for any acute process.
He had nausea controlled with compazine in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and on the floor.
He recently had an upper extremity DVT diagnosed during his past admission.
He did not have a CTA after diagnosis of DVT and he had near resolution of his DVT on discharge.
It was not felt that he was a lovenox failure, and rather the SVT was likely secondary to the significant dehydration on top of a chronic PE.
We attempted to have him discharged on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] 1mg/kg dosing, however he did not have the visual acuity or dexterity to give himself injections.
# SVT: Likely in the setting of dehydration from emesis and poor PO intake.
During the rest of the admission he was in sinus rhythm with normal rate or slight tachycardia (100-105).
He was also discharged with anti-emetics for nausea QHS.
