Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left IJ line insertion [**2112-9-20**]  History of Present Illness: 61M with HCC, HCV cirrhosis, CHF, DM, history of CVA with left sided weakness, PVD, asthma, presenting with one week of RUE swelling and pain.
It also became painful and feels somewhat tight and stiff to move.
No fevers or chills.
There was also potentially concern fo swelling on the right side of the face with some symptoms of eye irritation as well (watery eye, itching, no blurred vision).
He had a presentation in [**2112-7-6**] with swelling that involved the left arm, but he felt this was more limited to the L elbow at that time, however - not involving hand or shoulder.
He does endorse weight gain of 40# "in fluid weight" in the past 6 months, maybe 20# since last admission which he thinks is due to kidney stress and needs to have him fluids at that time.
UENIs without evidence of proximal/distal clot on R.  Received 12 units insulin for glucose >400.
Noted [**5-/2112**] to have a 4.7 x 4.3 cm right hepatic lobe mass displaying imaging characteristics consistent with HCC.
Biopsy showed well-to-moderately differentiated HCC.
Further imaging studies have been limited due to history of contrast nephropathy requiring hydration (which is further limited by cardiac concerns).
- Diabetes mellitus for 36 years, on insulin.
- Pontine stroke in [**2109**] with some residual left arm, left leg weakness.
The patient also reports that some emotional dysregulation in that his laughter, anger and sadness responses are sometimes inappropriate.
- History of osteomyelitis, s/p left foot debridement, 10/[**2111**].
- Hypertension.
- Chronic back pain, spinal stenosis, takes morphine, baclofen and gabapentin.
- Proteinuria and microscopic hematuria.
- Left eye laser surgery in [**2111**] for retinal detachment.
- Contrast induced renal insufficiency  Social History: Lives in an apartment by himself with 2 PCAs in floors above and below him.

There is no apical mass.
No pneumothorax.
Interval increase in caliber of the upper mediastinum could be due to differences in patient position or adenopathy, and not necessarily a change.
[**2112-9-15**] RUE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity including the right internal jugular vein and visualized portions of the subclavian vein.
Extensive soft tissue edema.
Evaluation of the left upper extremity was limited given inability to properly position the arm.
No evidence of thrombus in the visualized left internal jugular, subclavian, and cephalic veins.

Active Diagnoses: # Somnolence: Ddx included hepatic encephelopathy vs. uremia vs. hypercarbia vs. medication effect (was on gabapentin, baclofen, MSContin, oxycodone) vs. hypoventilation/OSA.
Patient has some degree of cirrhosis, but normal EGD in [**Month (only) 547**] [**2112**], no peripheral stigmata on exam, and synthetic function not terribly depressed (normal coags, though admission albumin 2.5).
We increased the frequency of lactulose to treat potential hepatic encephelopathy, titrating to [**4-8**] BM/day.
He was encouraged to use BIPAP overnight for obesity hypoventilation in case hypercapnia was contributing to his somnolence, but this seems more chronic in nature.
He was cultured to rule out toxic/metabolic causes of encephalopathy.
Cr increased despite octreotide, midodrine and pt became volume overloaded, leading to need for dialysis.
# Hypoxemia: A-a gradient <10 making hypoxemia is suggestive of hypoventilation, likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation/sleep apnea.
Hypercarbia appears to be somewhat chronic in nature given pH of 7.34 and pCO2 of 54 (if acute change, would expect pH of 7.28 or so).
Pt denies recent worsening of cough or dyspnea.
He was encouraged to use BIPAP while asleep for obesity hypoventilation.
A CXR was obtained to assess for any acute process.
He was admitted to MICU for worsening respiratory distress, given his anasarca pulmonary edema was the focared diagnosis, though aspiration pneumonitis and PNA were also considered.
# Anasarca- Likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia from cirrhotic disease and progressive renal failure (renal protein wasting though not nephrotic range proteinuria).
Per hepatology consult on the day of ICU transfer, patient appears to have hepatorenal syndrome, so he was given albumin 25 q8h and diuresis was held.
He received albumin before arriving to MICU and in MICU was started on midodrine/ocreotide for possible hepatorenal syndome.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: History of CKD w/ baseline creatinine around 1.6.
Recent history of contrast nephropathy with creatinine as high as 3.7.
Likely secondary to poor forward flow in setting of intravascular depletion with a component of hepatorenal syndrome.
Gave albumin and held diuresis in the setting of likely hepatorenal syndrome.
# RUE cellulitis: Unclear whether this was a true infection in setting of significant swelling, likely secondary to anasarca.
On exam, arm does not appear erythematous or particularly tender.
Started ampicillin/sulbactam for cellulitis in a diabetic on [**2112-9-16**] and showed significant improvement.
# Right-eye bacterial conjunctivitis: Treated with bacitracin/polymixin eye ointment.
Pt has had recent EGD ([**5-16**]) w/o evidence of varices.
Pt has had a colonscopy x 4 years ago (no report) and will need to d/w PCP.
# Pain: Held baclofen, gabapentin, and MSContin in the setting of increased somnolence.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Continued carvedilol, hydralazine, amlodipine.
# Elevated uric acid: Has had elevated levels in the past.
Checked urine protein.

Health Care Acquired Pneumonia End stage HCC and liver cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were initially admitted to the hospital for right arm swelling and found to have a skin infection of that arm (cellulitis).
Doppler ultrasound did not show a blood clot.
Your eye was also found to have an infection (conjunctivitis), so you were given an antibiotic eye ointment.
During your admission you were also found to have a pneumonia which required a short stay in the ICU.
We treated you with IV antibiotics and your pneumonia improved.
While you were here, you also had an acute kidney injury.
This resulted in volume overload to the point where it became difficult for you to breath.
We determined that your kidneys were not able to remove the extra fluid by themselves, so we started you on dialysis.
