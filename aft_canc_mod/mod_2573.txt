Admission Date:  [**2159-6-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2159-6-10**]   Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unstable angina/chest pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 42205**] is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease.
He was in his usual state of health until several weeks ago when he started to experience chest discomfort with exertion.
The day prior to admission, however, the patient experienced worsening midsternal chest pain [**10-24**] while picking up the trash.
The symptoms were not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis.
The symptoms resolved after five minutes.
The patient remained pain free until this morning of admission when the patient again experienced 4/10 chest pain with minimal exertion walking, and presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, where he was given aspirin, Lopressor, Heparin, nitroglycerin paste with relief of symptoms.
Electrocardiogram showed anterior ST-T wave changes, right bundle branch block, biphasic T wave in V1 through V4.
In the catheterization laboratory, the patient was found to have three vessel coronary artery disease: left anterior descending artery with 50% stenosis at D1, the small D1 with 80% stenosis, ostial 50% left circumflex with 90% tubular lesion in the OM1, and right coronary artery totally occluded with antegrade collateral flow.
The 90% lesion in the OM-1 was successfully stented with a 2.5 X 15 mm BioDivysio stent.
Pressure wire evaluation of the LAD yielded a FFR of 0.81, indicating no limitation to flow.
At the conclusion of the procedure, the patient was pain free and hemodynamically stable.
Coronary artery disease risk factors:  ?
Peripheral vascular disease, S/P AAA repair.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Heart:  Normal S1, S2, regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, mildly distended.
Right groin with arterial sheath in situ, no hematoma, no ooze, and no flank tenderness.
ASSESSMENT:  This is an 85-year-old male with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, status post OM-1 stent placement.
At the time of sheath pull, the patient shortly afterwards developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure down to the 70s/30s and bradycardia with a heart rate in the 30s.
The patient did not experience any more chest pain or shortness of breath at any time.
The patient had no recollection of the episode which was deemed vasovagal episode.
Admission TnI was 6.3, consistent with a small non-ST elevation MI with normal MB.
Groin showed no evidence of bleeding or hematoma, was soft, and there was no bruit.
Coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (marker-positive unstable angina), now S/P stent placement in OM-1.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine of 1.5.
