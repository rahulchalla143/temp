2+ edema LUE.
No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
Interval opacification of the lung parenchyma within the left hemithorax with minimal aeration of the left upper lung lobe consistent with pneumonia.
Interval worsening of the patchy airspace opacities within the right lower, middle, and upper lung lobes also consistent with pneumonia.
Interval increase in size of large right pleural effusion.
CT Head:  No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or major vascular territorial infarction.
New, multifocal patchy opacities within the right lung which may represent infiltrate or CHF.
Upper ext doppler: New non-occlusive thrombus within the left subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt intubated on arrival to ED.
