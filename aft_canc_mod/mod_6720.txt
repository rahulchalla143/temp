Per the operative report, intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated the lesions in the medial segment and right lobe of the liver.
There were also four suspicious lesions in the left lateral segment and all of these were successfully ablated using radiofrequency ablation.
In the post op period she was having low urine outputs and receiving bolus fluids.
Due to anxiety she was restarted on her home dose of Xanax.

Repeat ultrasound indicated no flow problems to the liver.
Ct of the abdomen was unremarkable, not showing any fluid collections and having normal post surgical/ablation changes.
She was transferred to the SICU after receiving flumenazil with little effect on mental status.
Hepatology was consulted who suggested the initiation of lactulose, avoiding narcotics as much as possible and anxiolytics altogether.
A head CT did not show any acute abnormality.
By EEG she was showing either a metabolic derangment or encephalopathy.
She became less sedated, continued with confusion which waned and was resolved by POD 7.
She was tolerating a regular diet at discharge and calorie counts revealed an average caloric intake around 1700 calories.
A psychiatry consult was called due to patients' increasing anxiety.
She stated she would be fine once home, and meeting with the oncologist helped calm some of her anxiety and concerns.
