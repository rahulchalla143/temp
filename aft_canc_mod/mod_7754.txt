Previous Imaging: [**12-5**] (from OSH) CXR: Bibasilar areas of opacity compatable with atelectasis or pna .
Small inferior wall myocardial infarct with mild inferolateral myocardial ischemia.
Imaging: CXR [**12-12**]: IMPRESSION: Since [**2133-12-9**], moderate pulmonary edema has resolved, Small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lung atelectasis have improved   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 y/o male with recent CVA [**2133-11-9**] and h/o CABG ([**2109**]) with complex anatomy and LV systolic dysfnction (EF = 35%) here with intermittent chest pain and troponin of 5.22, transferred for palliative catheterization.
NSTEMI - Patient with significant vascular disease, CAD history and risk factors, presents with intermittent chest pain and elevated troponins.
Recent nuclear stress test in [**7-24**] showed global hypokinesis, EF 38%, small inferior wall myocardial infarct with mild inferolateral myocardial ischemia.
Given that the patient had elevated troponin at OSH (5.22) in the setting of chest pain, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a palliative catheterization.
Cath was deferred given patient's acute on chronic renal failure (2.6 from 1.8-2.0 baseline).
Ultimately, patient received optimal medical management without catheterization, including the addition of ranolazine and isosorbide mononitrate and was chest pain free the entire admission.
# CHF/Fluid management - late in the course of his admission he developed signs of congestion and overload (edema, mild hypoxia, etc).
COPD/PNA - Patient had radiographic opacity seen at OSH and was started on ceftriaxone/azithro there.
Antibiotics were held initially at [**Hospital1 18**] as patient had no leukocytosis or fever, however given worsening of symptoms, patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
Sputum culture returned rare gram negative rod growth, however due to a very low clinical suspicion for PNA antibiotics were not restarted.
# HTN: Continued metoprolol, added amlodipine 5. .
# HLD: Continued pravastatin.
# Muscle spasm: Continued tazanidine, changed from [**Hospital1 **] standing to [**Hospital1 **] PRN due to sedation.
