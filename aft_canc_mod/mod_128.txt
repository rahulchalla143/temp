Intravenous contrast was administered due to poor renal function.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral small effusions, with adjacent consolidations, which may represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
There is a nodular component of the right basilar consolidation.
The liver is shrunken and nodular, consistent with history of cirrhosis.
There is branching hyperdensity in the liver which appears to follor the distribution of portal vein branches; findings are concerning for portal vein thrombosis.
Evaluation of the abdomen is extremely limited by lack of intravenous or oral contrast.
There are no renal calculi.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is a massive ascites.
The definition of the bowel is extremely poor though large bowel thickening is suggested as is mesenteric congestion.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Urinary bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.
There is a rectal tube in place.
A small locule of gas is seen on image 74 of series 2 in the anterior abdominal wall which may be related to medication injection.
There is no definite evidence for free intraperitoneal air.
There is generalized body wall edema.
Hepatic cirrhosis with stigmata of portal hypertension.
Large volume of ascites, mesenteric congestion, large bowel thickening.

portal vein thrombosis, please use dopplers INDICATION: 56-year-old man, history of liver disease, ascites, GI bleed.
DUPLEX LIVER DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
A moderate amount of ascites is seen in the right upper quadrant.
There are large varices along the lesser curvature.
There is marked gallbladder wall edema with a wall thickness up to 12 mm, likely due to third spacing.
The gallbladder contains sludge but no stones.
Within the liver parenchyma, there are hyperechoic bands radiating in the periphery following portal vein branches that correspond to similar structures seen on the CT consistent with periductal fibrosis in this patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
There is an aneurysmal dilatation of the confluence of the portal vein measuring up to 2.5 cm.
Within the right portal vein, there is a contracted non-occlusive thrombus.
Minimal slow flow is detected in the right portal vein.
Non-occlusive thrombus in the right portal vein with maintained hepatopetal flow.
Patency of splenic vein, SMV, left portal vein with outflow via large umbilical vein, hepatic veins, and IVC.
Minimal slow flow in the right portal vein.
Aneurysmal dilatation at the confluence of the portal vein (2.5 cm).
Cirrhotic liver with periductal fibrosis consistent with the history of PSC and stigmata of portal hypertension including large varices at the lesser curvature and moderate ascites.
Sludge containing gallbladder with marked wall edema, likely due to third spacing.
Small right pleural effusion.
TTE [**11-10**]  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

He required multiple units of PRBCs and the hepatology service did not desire to do an EGD as they felt they would not be able to intervene on anything given his coagulopathy (INR of 6) and his unstable hemodynamics.
Eventually the bleeding stopped and his hematocrit stabilized with medical measure including a Protonix drip and an octreotide drip.
He was also in acute renal failure and acute liver failure, both felt to be due to his hypotension.
His liver failure was slowly improving but his renal failure continued to worsen.
He had been taken off the liver transplant list at [**Hospital1 336**] in [**Month (only) 205**] due to his vertebral osteomyelitis and his long term prognosis was bleak.
On HD 7, the patient had some hypotension in the morning again requiring one vasopressor medication.
He was initially stabilized with IVF and increased vasopressor medications.
The family also decided that they did not want to be present for his death.
He passed peacefully on [**2105-11-15**] at 8:20pm with doctors, nurses, and respiratory technicians at his beadside  Medications on Admission: vancomycin 750 mg daily actigall 600 mg tid pentasa [**Numeric Identifier 961**] mg tid vit k mvi protonix 40 mg po daily metformin 500 mg po bid xanax 0.5 mg po q8hr prn anxiety oxycodone 5 mg po q4hr prn pain MOM dulcolax prn tyelnol 650 mg po q4hr prn pain nadolol 40 mg qd   Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper gastrointestinal bleed  Endstage liver disease  Ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis  Discharge Condition: Deceased  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none
