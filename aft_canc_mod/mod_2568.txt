There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Mild periportal edema is noted.
The gallbladder is nondistended with surrounding wall edema which could be related to the adjacent colonic edema.
Exophytic upper pole right renal cyst is seen along with multiple hypodensities in the left kidney which are too small to be fully characterized.
There is pancolonic mural edema and thickening.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Extensive lymphadenopathy is seen within the periportal, mesenteric and paraaortic nodal chains without notable interval change from the prior study.
Dense aortic calcifications are noted.
A circumferential rectal mural thickening is noted.
Pelvic side wall, external iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy is also noted to a similar degree as on the prior.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion concerning for osseous malignant process.
Mural edema involving the entire colon extending to the rectum compatible with pancolitis and proctitis.
Unchanged extensive adenopathy compatible with provided history of CLL along with splenomegaly.
[**2139-9-24**] MRI/A Head: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, edema, mass effect or masses seen.
There is diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement.
There appears to be diffusely abnormal [**Month/Day/Year 15482**] signal involving the calvarium and the visualized upper cervical spine.
Multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are seen in bilateral periventricular white matter, most likely represents small vessel ischemic disease.
Chronic lacunar infarcts are seen in the right frontal white matter.
MRA BRAIN: Bilateral internal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries and basilar artery and their major branches show normal flow signal without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm formation.
Diffusely abnormal [**Month/Day/Year 15482**] signal in the calvarium and upper cervical spine, likely secondary to CLL involvement.
Diffuse pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement.
This may be secondary to tumor involvement.
However, it can also be seen secondary to intracranial hypotension from prior lumbar puncture, inflammatory or infectious etiologies.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
There is heterogeneous signal intensity of the [**Month/Day/Year 15482**], two focal T2 hyperintense areas in the L1 and L3 vertebral bodies with minimal enhancement.
These also demonstrate mildly increased signal intensity on the pre-contrast T1-weighted sequence and hence may represent atypical hemangiomas.
There is diffuse hypointense signal of the [**Month/Day/Year 15482**] likely related to the underlying condition of CLL/other amrrow abn.
On STIR sequence, there is no focal area of altered signal intensity to suggest a mass-like lesion in the lumbar vertebrae.
Minimal areas of [**Month/Day/Year 15482**] edema are noted in the endplates and in the facets.
There is disc desiccation at multiple levels.
Mild bulge, with bilateral facet degenerative changes are noted at multiple levels, with mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac and mild foraminal narrowing.
There is no significant canal or foraminal stenosis, on the axial images.
There is a small T2 hyperintense focus, at the posterior aspect of the S2 vertebral body measuring approximately 1.3 x 1.2 cm without enhancement and likely represents a Tarlov's cyst or perineural cyst.
No pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue swelling or masses are noted within the limitations.
No obvious abnormal enhancement is noted in the epidural space.
There is atrophy of the paraspinal muscles, with fatty infiltration.
Study limited due to levoscoliosis and motion-related artifacts despite attempts.
Within this limitation, multilevel multifactorial degenerative changes are noted in the form of facet degenerative changes and disc bulges without significant canal stenosis.
Possible mild foraminal narrowing at multiple levels.
No compression on the lower cord or roots of the cauda equina or abnormal enhancement.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo woman with CLL diagnosed in [**2131**], atrial tachycardia, CAD s/p stent the RCA on '[**28**] who initially presented to the oncology clinic today with one week of profuse watery diarrhea, fevers/chills, and an elevated WBC count, with atrial fibrillation with RVR.
C. diff colitis- The patient presented with fevers and severe hypovolemia secondary to severe C. diff colitis.
A CT scan revealed mural edema involving the entire colon extending to the rectum compatible with pancolitis and proctitis.
IV flagyl was switched to IV tigecycline after 7 days of minimal improvement.
After resolution of diarrhea on hospital day 12, IV tigecycline was discontinued.
CLL in CSF- An LP was performed without complication.
CSF was sent for cytology and flow cytometry, which revealed atypical lymphocytes with immunophenotypic findings highly suspicious for involvement by patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Afib with RVR- presented with sinus tachycardia to 140 [**2-18**] to hypovolemia.
After aggressive fluid resuscitation, the patient developed paroxysmal a fib w/ venticular rates in the 60-70's.
pna- The patient presented fevers and a possibile pneumonia by chest X-ray and was started on levoquin, cefepime, and vancomycin.
A CT chest was not consistent with a pneumonia and these antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Ophthalmology was consulted given the patient h/o retinal detachment.
Her symptoms and exam were consistent with a intravitreous hemorrhage without evidence of retinal detachment.
