There he had fever/chills, and a productive cough as well as rhinorrhea for the last week.
He denied CP, pedal edema or calf pain.
A CXR was done with no significant infiltrates.

Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction thirty years ago.
EF = 50%- Mild anterolateral hypokinesis 3.
Peripheral vascular disease - [**2096**] angio: Severe bilateral lower extremity peripheral vascular disease with severe bilateral SFA disease and single vessel runoff bilaterally.
Hypercholesterolemia   Social History: Widower, he lives with his daughter.
(1/2-1 PPD x 70 years)  Family History: His brother died of an MI at 68 years of age.
Physical Exam: T 97.2 BP 118/61 HR 102 RR 20  O2Sat 95 AC 0.3/550/20/5 Gen: NAD, comfortable and sedated HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, mmm, hard exophytic mass over left forehead NECK: no LAD, no JVD, no carotid bruit COR: S1S2, irregularly regular rhythm, no m/r/g PULM: moderate air movement, mild diffuse wheezing, no rhonchi ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt Skin: warm extremities, no rash, venostasis changes EXT: 2+ DP, no edema/c/c, no CVA tenderness Neuro: moving all extremities, sedated, PERRLA, reflexes 2+ b/l  Pertinent Results: EKG: NSR, HR 80, NA, NI, mild Tw changes in I, avl.
The heart, mediastinal contours, and pulmonary vasculature are unchanged in appearance, remarkable for tortuous aorta.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient is status post CABG, and there are marked coronary artery calcifications within the LAD and circumflex.
There are multiple small right hilar lymph nodes as well as a more prominent 12 mm lymph node.
There is no pathologic mediastinal or axillary adenopathy.
There is no pleural effusion.
There are multilevel degenerative changes in the osseous structures.
No suspicious lesions are identified.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta with multiple areas of mural thrombus.
No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
Emphysema, but no evidence for pneumonia.
CT HEAD [**2102-4-11**] COMPARISON STUDY: [**2102-4-1**], head CT scan, also performed for a history of mental status changes, interpreted by Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing "No acute intracranial abnormalities detected.
Unchanged expansile osseous lesion consistent with an osseous hemangioma.
There is no definite interval change in either the appearance of the brain or osseous lesion in the one-week interval between scans.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures observed.
If acute brain ischemia is a clinical consideration, MRI scanning, if feasible, is a more sensitive diagnostic modality.
However, given the patient's history, followup CT in three to six months can be obtained if clinically warranted to exclude an atypical distribution of small metastases.
New bilateral lower lobe dependent centrilobular opacities most likely secondary to aspiration or infectious bronchiolitis.
M with CAD s/p CABG, PVD & COPD who p/w hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely [**2-18**] COPD exacerbation and flu, with hospital stay complicated by DTs and prolonged AMS after being off sedation.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt presented with profound acidosis [**2-18**] hypercarbic resp failure and was intubated, found to have influenza complicated by newly diagnosed COPD.
CT consistent with emphysema and long standing tobacco abuse make diagnosis very likely in the abscence of PFTs.
Pt was extubated after 5 days but required reintubation [**2-18**] recurrent hypercarbic resp failure in setting of significant valium administration and MS depression.
Second intubation course was prolonged due to depressed MS and likely delayed clearance of benzodiazpines.
Pt has been afebrile, sating well on RA and secretions have decreased with mobilization.
Repeat Chest CT was performed to evaluate for metastatic disease from left frontal osteohemangioma.
Centrilobar opacities likely c/w aspiration that have been clinically silent and may be residual from repeat intubations.
# Altered Mental Status: Pt was initially treated with valium due to possible DTs, then required re-intubation for hypercarbic resp failure.
Pt had a prolonged 2nd intubation due to sedation that responded to flumazenil (likely benzo induced MS changes).
Pt was extubated on [**4-12**] and is currently alert & responding to commands but still disoriented, no focal deficits on neuro exam, though diffusely weak & deconditioned.
Per neuro surgery, it is very unlikely that osteohemangioma mass is contributing to MS.  Steroids could also be contributing to MS.
# New onset Afib: Etiology unclear, TSH was mildly decreased but T4 was WNL.
There was initial problems with HR control in the ICU, however, HR has been well controlled in 80-90s on Metoprolol with can be increased prn.
# Scull tumor: Neuro surgery was consulted for a CT read of invasive osteohemangioma.
Per neuro, this was not likely contributing to any MS changes but recommended CT chest for staging which showed two different 3mm pulm nodules, unlikely to be metastatic, will need f/u CT in 6mths.
# CAD: Pt s/p CABG in [**2082**] and denied any CP throughout admission.
Pt was ruled out for MI on admission and was continued on ASA, Plavix, Metoprolol, Pravastatin.
# PVD: Pt is s/p mult peripheral vasc interventions, denied any lower extremity pain thoughout admission, lower extremities warm & PT pulses palpable bilaterally.
# Prophylaxis: Heparin sc, bowel regimen & protonix  Medications on Admission: Clopidogrel 75 mg PO DAILY Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY Atenolol 25 mg PO DAILY Lisinopril 40 mg PO once a day.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Hyponatremia 6.
Acute renal failure 7.
Incidentally noted pulmonary nodules  Secondary: 1.
Coronary artery disease 2.
Peripheral vascular disease 3.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  Discharge Condition: Fair  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with influenza & COPD exacerbation.
You were intubated and required an ICU stay for respiratory failure and mental status changes.
You were noted to develop an arrythmia called Atrial Fibrillation, this has been rate controlled with medications.
Please discuss with your primary care physician to obtain [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up chest CT scan in [**3-23**] months to evaluate pulmonary nodules.
