Admission Date:  [**2107-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2028-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP IR guided biliary drain placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 78 year old woman who lives in [**Hospital3 **] and referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice.
Her symptoms started with bilateral, crampy lower quadrant abdominal pain and an increase in bowel movements without true diarrhea.
She also noted an 8 lb weight loss along with appetite loss since [**2107-1-12**].
She underwnet a CT of the abdomen on [**2107-4-7**] in her area and revealed a double duct sign with dilation of the main PD to 4 mm along with dilation of the gallbladder.
There was evidence of a hypodense focal lesion in the head of the pancrease measuring 1.4 cm as well as ill-defined hypodense lesions in the right and left lobes of the liver.
The EUS showed multiple small sub-centimeter cysts in the head of pancreas  without mass.
The PD was dilated to 7 mm in head and 5 mm in body and was tortuous with a few dilated side branches.
The CBD was dilated to 15 mm in diameter with no stones or strictures.
She was also found to have a small superficial ulcer at the antrum of stomach.
Subsequently, she had MRCP on [**5-6**] that showed biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation which appears to be due to compression or involvement by a 1.9 cm mass concerning for malignancy such as due to invasive neoplasm in the setting of side branch IPMN; partially cystic adenocarcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma.
Today, [**5-10**], she underwent an unsuccessful attempt for an ERCP.
Post ERCP, she developed low grade fever, relative hypotension, and tachycardia.
IR, therefore, was contact[**Name (NI) **] for PTC to resolve the biliary obstruction for a possibility of cholangitis.
In regards to review of systems, she was noted to have new dyspnea on mild exertion in the ERCP recovery room.
HTN 2.
Hyperlipidemia 5. tobacco use 6.
Family History: No pancreatic, liver, or GI cancers  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Frail elderly woman with generalized weakness and remarkable jaundice Eyes: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, remarkable jaundice  Ears/Nose/Mouth/Throat: MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Respiratory: Mild crackles at the very bases and decreased breath sounds bilaterally Cardiovascular: tachycardia, heart rate 106 regular with AS murmur Gastrointestinal: soft, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Tender diffusely without rigidity.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to answer questions appropriately without delirium or focol motor deficits.
Biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation which appears to be due to compression or involvement by a 1.9-cm mass with non enhancing and hypoenhancing components and adjacent periductal hyperenhancement.
These findings are concerning for malignancy, such as due to invasive neoplasm in the setting of side branch IPMN; partially cystic adenocarcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma.
Numerous hepatic lesions, at least one of which is consistent with perfusional abnormalities.
Others demonstrate both ring pattern of hyperenhancement and hypoenhancement and are concerning for metastasis although foci of infection could have a similar appearance.
Peri-biliary enhancement in segment VIII is consistent with chronic biliary obstruction or cholangitis.
Distended Courvoisier-type gallbladder with small stones or sludge.
There is no acute cholecystitis.
SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in MCG/ML  _________________________________________________________                              KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE                              | AMPICILLIN/SULBACTAM--     8 S CEFAZOLIN-------------   <=4 S CEFEPIME--------------   <=1 S CEFTAZIDIME-----------   <=1 S CEFTRIAXONE-----------   <=1 S CIPROFLOXACIN---------<=0.25 S GENTAMICIN------------   <=1 S MEROPENEM-------------<=0.25 S PIPERACILLIN/TAZO-----   <=4 S TOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA----   <=1 S     ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2107-5-16**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
IMAGING ERCP [**5-10**] IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to inability to cannulate bile duct, however, partial filling of the bile duct demonstrated distal stricture with proximal dilation and pancreatic ductal dilation.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Left pleural effusion.
Very small pericardial effusion.
LENI [**5-16**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT .
CT chest [**5-17**] Moderate bilateral effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Extensive fibrotic lung disease with an apical predominance.
3mm RML perifissural nodule is probably a lymph node.
No pulmonary mass.
There is no pathologic mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal contents notable for PTC biliary ring cath, small HH, right renal cyst.
He blood tests and examination were consistent with obstructive jaundice (AP: 504 Tbili: 17.4).
These studies so far suggest head of the pancreatic cancer with metastatic liver disease.
Post ERCP, she developed low grade fever, relative hypotension, dyspnea, and tachycardia.
I explained the very likelihood of metastatic pancreatic cancer as well as a possibility of cholangitis.
She would need IV fluid support, broad spectrum antibiotics aimed at biliary pathogens (E-coli and Enterococcus are the most important 2 pathogens), and discontinuation of her antihypertensive medications (except for Atenolol, gradual weaning unless she is frankly hypotensive or septic).
We will also order CXR PA/lateral because of subtle hypoxia.
*ICU COURSE* Pt was admitted from ERCP to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued monitoring given hypotension and pressor requirement during biliary drain placement concerning for post-procedure cholangitis.
CVL in R IJ placed for additional hemodynamic monitoring of CVP and volume resuscitation.
# Resp failure: Pt developed worsening O2 requirement concerning for volume overload and worsening pleural effusions on chest xray after large volume fluid resuscitation.
Her chest xray supported volume overload with evidence of pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis and her exam was notable for crackles.
Results of the cat scan were notable for extensive fibrotic changes throughout the lungs most likely c/w lymphangitic carcinomatosis related to her likely pancreatic ca.
Morphine IV was started for palliation of her dyspnea.
Lasix drip was continued with the hope that aggressive diuresis might improve her comfort given the extensive fluid collections noted on imaging.
She was unable to be discharged to an LTAC given her rapid decompensation on the intended day of her discharge.
# Hypotension: Likely related to sepsis physiology from post-instrumentation cholangitis.
She was initially started on unasyn, flagyl, and cipro for biliary microbial coverage; however, preliminary bile cultures revealed gpc's in pairs, gnr, gnc and so antibiotics were changed to linezolid and zosyn for better coverage.
Speciation revealed pan-sensitive klebsiella and rare strep viridans.
# Biliary stricture: New stricture, liver lesions, and head of pancreas mass since [**2105-2-12**], concerning for malignancy in setting of constitutional symptoms.
# Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic inflammation with drop in hematocrit secondary to hemodilution from aggressive volume resuscitation.
She was transfused 1u pRBC on the day after admission for low Hct likely felt to be hemodilution.
# Malignancy: Symptomatic with fatigue, weight loss, malaise for the past few months with imaging concerning for pancreatic mass causing biliary obstruction and liver metastases.
Initial family wishes were for IR guided drain placement with biopy/brushing to obtain official diagnosis and pathology however the pt's worsening respiratory issues prohibited this elective procedure.
CT chest findings were felt to be lymphangitic carcinomatosis related to her underlying malignancy however it is possible for her to have had IPF with chronic symptoms at baseline.
Medications on Admission: Alendronate 70 mg tablets po every week Atenolol 75 mg po daily HCTZ 12.5 daily Aspirin 81 mg daily   Discharge Medications: Deceased  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic ca, unknown underlying primary but likely pancreatic fibrotic lung disease   Discharge Condition: Deceased  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after you had low blood pressure and an infection in your bile.
You had an ERCP what was unable to open the compression in your bile system caused by the mass in your pancreas.
You developed worsening shortness of breath that we believe was secondary to volume overload.
We started you on a diuretic drip which took off excess fluid on your lungs.
We obtained a CT chest when you didn't improve after taking off fluid and it showed extensive scarring either [**3-16**] chronic underlying lung disease or scarring related to an extension of your cancer.
