Urinary tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 88-year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room for Neurosurgical evaluation of a pituitary hemorrhage.
She had a CT scan of her head which showed a hemorrhage into a previously known pituitary mass.
Then she was found to be at her baseline mental status.
She had no focal neurologic deficits.
Right carotid stenosis.
Pituitary adenoma times several years and previously refused surgery.
She is a pale and ill-appearing female in no acute distress.
Heart: Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs.
Neurologic examination: Limited because of patient's inability to cooperate.
There are no obvious focal cranial nerve deficits.
She underwent ophthalmologic examination which revealed no papilledema, but they were unable to assess peripheral fields.
It invades the cavernous sinus and encases the right internal carotid artery and contacts the medial inferior surface of the left internal carotid with associated areas of hemorrhage.
There is also compression of the optic chiasm and the floor of the third ventricle.
There was no hydrocephalus or shift of intracranial structures.
There was focal and confluent areas of T2 signal hyperintensity in the periventricular subcortical white matter consistent with chronic microvascular infarct.
No major territorial infarct was seen.
She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Neurosurgery, who did not recommend surgical intervention given the stability, lack of mental status changes, and lack of evidence for visual symptoms.
UTI:  Urinalysis on admission was nitrite positive, leukocyte negative, 0-2 white blood cells, and many bacteria.
Please recheck prolactin, TSH, and cortisol level in four days or if patient has decreasing blood pressure.
