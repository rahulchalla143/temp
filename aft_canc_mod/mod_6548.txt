Diffuse alveolar opacities throughout the lungs, right greater than left, which could represent asymmetric edema and/or infection.
Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to trace pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral, right much greater than left alveolar opacities could relate to asymmetric edema and/or infection.
ECHO [**2103-11-26**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old female with COPD, HTN, recurrent anemia, diastolic CHF who was admitted for dyspnea and anemia.
She was covered for a possible COPD exacerbation with nebs, prednisone and azithromycin (antibiotic course completed).
She also was started on a lasix and nitro drip for acute on chronic diastolic CHF (EF 60%).
Chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary opacities with pulmonary edema.
The patient diuresed well and dyspnea improved, making acute on chronic diastolic CHF the chief diagnosis.
The patient underwent a transthoracic echo that showed moderate to severe MR worsened since [**9-/2103**], which may be contributing to CHF exacerbation.
Cardiac enzymes were negative X3 for ischemic cause of heart failure exacerbation.
She was discharged on torsemide for diuresis and a prednisone taper.
#Anemia- Patient has a history of significant anemia, with acute decrease in HCT on admission from 30 to 21.
Etiology of anemia likely multifactorial, secondary to CKD, repeated phlebotomy.
#Acute on chronic kidney injury - Baseline creatinine is 1.5-2.0 over the past few months.
#Chronic Angina/CAD- Chronic angina has been controlled on ranolazine and isosorbide mononitrate.
Stress test in [**10/2103**] revealed reversible inferior defect on nuclear imaging.
Patient remained chest pain free throughout admission.
Ranexa was discontinued due to acute kidney injury.
# Code:DNR/DNI ==================================================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #The patient should follow up regarding her BUN/creatinine [**12-4**].

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 533**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Extended Care - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis:  Acute on chronic systolic CHF Secondary diagnosis:  COPD exacerbation, acute on chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the intensive care unit with shortness of breath and found to have an acute worsening of your heart failure and a possible exacerbation of your COPD.
You were also treated for worsening COPD with antibiotics and steroids.
You will also be discharged on torsemide to continue to remove the excess fluid form your body.
