Admission Date:  [**2136-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-7-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: HPI: 81 y/o M w/COPD on home O2, dCHF, Myelodysplasia w/excess blasts, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia from [**Date range (1) 24350**].
At that time he was found to be in ARF w/elevated CK, and had "evidence of CHF and COPD flare" as well as pancytopenia with 15% blasts.
Here he was initially in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia (93% on RA) and concern for blast crisis.
He was seen by Heme-Onc, who felt he did not have AML but had Myelodysplasia with excess blasts.
His renal failure resolved with hydration (0.8 on d/c, from 2.1).
He was doing well post-d/c per his daughter, but over the past few days has been more lethargic, decreased po intake, increasing shortness of breath.
His mental status remained at baseline (alert, oriented, interactive) with the exception of one episode of confusion last pm which resolved within minutes.
He has no dysuria but per the daughter has had diarrhea and urinary/fecal incontinence over the past 3-4 weeks with inability to tell when he is stooling or urinating.
He had no focal weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, or other symptoms.
At the OSH ED, he was tachypneic in 40s with o2 sat 80s, and was placed on bipap.

Family History: Fam Hx: identical twin brother died [**2-25**] from leukemia  Physical Exam: PE: P: 76 BP: 104/78 R: 24 100% on bipap Gen: uncomfortable male, not in acute distress, with bipap mask in place HEENT: NC, AT, perrl, anicteric, conjunctivae noninjected.
Lungs: good air movement throughout, no wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles, no dullness to percussion CV: RRR, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd, +bs.
Rectal: large external hemorrhoid, decreased rectal tone.
[**7-24**] MR L spine FINDINGS: There is a transitional vertebra between the lumbar spine and the sacrum.
Bone marrow signal is diffusely abnormal, consistent with diffuse bone infiltration by tumor.
There is a suggestion of cortical destruction in the posterior inferior endplate of L3, posterior superior endplate of L4, posterior inferior endplate of L5, and posterior superior endplate of S1.
Mild compression deformities are seen in all of the visualized vertebrae from T12 through S1, likely secondary to pathologic fractures.
There is no bone marrow edema on the STIR images to suggest that these fractures are acute.
At L3/4, there is a disc bulge and a more focal right paracentral herniation, which displaces the nerve roots medially and posteriorly.
In addition, there is a shallow, small epidural mass extending from the posterior vertebral body into the right neural foramen, which may represent epidural tumor or a mottled osteophyte- CT could provide differentiation between the two etiologies.
There is only mild associated narrowing of the right neural foramen.
At L4/5, there is facet spondylosis and a disc bulge with mild associated central stenosis and lateral recess narrowing bilaterally.
At L5/S1, there is a disc bulge and facet spondylosis with mild central stenosis and bilateral lateral recess narrowing.
These likely represent epidural fat, and less likely distended epidural veins.
This appearance is not consistent with epidural tumor.
The following preliminary report was given by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to a resident caring for the patient at 12:30 a.m. on [**2136-7-25**]: Abnormal signal in vertebral bodies.
No spinal cord compression.
Diffuse bone marrow infiltration by tumor, with probable cortex destruction at multiple levels.
Probable epidural extension of tumor into the right L3/4 neural foramen with mild foramen narrowing.
Small right paracentral disc herniation at L3/4, which displaces the nerve roots.
Mild central stenosis and lateral recess narrowing at L4/5 and L5/S1.
Hypotension:  Patient was likely hypotensive from dehydration secondary to diarrhea.
He had no diarrhea for the rest of the admission.
The stool was likely due to the diarrhea.
However it was noted that the patient had poor rectal tone.
There were no other neurological findings.
An MRI was negative for nerve impingement or cord compression.
Prostate Cancer - patient with negative PSA.
However  MRI did demonstrate tumor spread.
