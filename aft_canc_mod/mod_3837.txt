A CT was performed which showed a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe with contiguous and marked mediastinal adenopathy, compression and distortion of the superior vena cava, extending up into the superior mediastinum in the supraclavicular area and compression of the right brachiocephalic vein, narrowing of the trachea.
The patient had elevated CE at the OSH, he was started on Heparin despite the most likely diagnosis being demand ischemia in the setting of hypoxia.
He was on BiPap at the OSH for his decreased saturation.
He currently feels well except for some shortness of breath.
