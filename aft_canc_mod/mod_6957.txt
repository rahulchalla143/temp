Moderate-to-marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Areas of linear patchy bibasilar opacity most likely represent atelectasIS  [**2136-11-26**]- CT HEAD-IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
Chronic involutional changes.
Sludge in the gallbladder with no evidence of gallbladder wall edema to suggest cholecystitis.
No biliary dilation.
Complex cystic lesion within the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 2.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm.
Additional bilateral simple renal cysts.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 79F w/ PMH of dementia, sCHF w/ LV thrombus, ESRD on HD who presents with AMS, and elevated lactate  #Coagulase negative staph Bacteremia:The patient was growing coagulase negative staph in [**1-30**] bottles.
# AMS/dementia: Patient has known dementia with recent worsening of baseline.
Patient was recently discharged on [**2136-11-13**] for worsened dementia with increased hallucinations.
Her acute worsening of AMS likely related to hyoglycemic epidsode at home.
It is possible that she has imparied gluconeogenesis from her congestive hepatopathy and renal failure.
Unclear if patient had an underlying infection, leading to hypoglycemia.
urosepsis, although unclear if the patient has a true urinary tract infection, and if an infection was the cause of her hypglycemia.
last day of antibiotics [**2136-12-5**]  # right kindey mass- On right upper quadrant ultrasound the patient was  found to have a complex cystic lesion within the lower pole of the right kidney measuring.2.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm.
# Congestive hepatopathy- The patient has a history of transaminitis with increased AST/ ALT, Alk [**Doctor Last Name **] and normal nl bili noted inially in [**2136-9-29**].
Her LFTs are consistent with hepatocellular injury.
A RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of CBD diliation or cholecystitis.
It likley that her transaminits is from hepatic congestion if the setting of her systolic heart failture with ( EF of 20%).
Transminases will likley improve with optimization of her heart failure regimen.
She was admitted with an elevated INR 5.0 ( goal [**3-2**]).
Her CHF is likley contributing to her transamnitis ( see above).
The patient has follow up with in Heart Failure clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] on discharge  # ESRD on HD: HD on T,Th,Sat schedule.
Isosrbide added to help decrease afterload in setting of poor EF  # Hyperlipidemia- simvastatin was held in setting of transmintis.
( see above) can restart once AST and ALT less than 100  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # follow up MRI for further evaluation of complex mass on  right kidney mass # recheck LFTs, restart simvastatin once AST and ALT are below 100 # restart Coumadin on [**12-1**] 1 mg daily # recheck INR on [**2136-12-3**] # full code  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

You were also admitted with an elevated INR.
You were found to have a mass on the right kidney that is concerning for a cancer of the kidney.
