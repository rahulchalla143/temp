HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old male with extensive past medical history sent from dialysis for evaluation and treatment who has been unable to walk or the past eight months.
He de orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, MSSA sepsis treated, chronic atrial fibrillation, history of peptic ulcer disease, history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, history of benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of cerebrovascular accident, history of peripheral vascular disease, history of gastrointestinal bleed, history of prostate carcinoma.
Left lower lobe pneumonia in [**2112-5-4**].
History of gastritis and esophagitis.
History of right inguinal hernia without repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Echocardiogram done in [**Month (only) 956**] showed normal ejection fraction with mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation noted.
Vascular examination showed a pleasant male in no acute distress.
The lungs were diminished at the right base and abdominal examination had a palpable aortic aneurysm.
The foot examination showed a left foot cold with ischemic appearing black ulceration on the left medial heel and ankle with no erythema, fluctuance or drainage.
The pulse examination showed palpable femorals on the right, dopplerable on the left.
The foot x-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Arteriogram on [**2113-3-30**] showed a abdominal aortic aneurysm with a left common iliac aneurysm with plaque.
There was no posterior tibial pulse.
Recommendations were to hold his Coumadin, normalize his INR, begin heparinization for goal PTT between 40 and 60, obtain MRI/MRA of the left leg and the aorta to evaluate the aorta and in flow disease, consider cardiac workup with echocardiogram and PMIBI, continue antibiotics broad spectrum, follow culture results and tailor as necessary.
Multipodus splint to the right foot to prevent heel ulcerations.
There was a mild aortic stenosis and mitral leaflets appeared thickened, but they were unable to adequately assess the mitral regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared to previous study on [**2113-1-18**] there is probably a similar aortic gradient that is slightly higher.
There were no anginal or ischemic changes, but the patient did have premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions.
His nuclear portion showed an abnormal study with severe fixed defect involving the basilar portion of the inferior wall.
Medical attending evaluated the patient and a moderate cardiac risk for surgery.
The patient had a CTA of the abdomen and pelvis to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Findings demonstrated intrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of 4.9 by 5.2 cm.
There is an aneurysm of the left common iliac, which measures 1.7 by 2.5 cm.
There is an aneurysm in the proximal right internal iliac artery, which measures 1.4 to 2.0.
There is dense vascular calcification and multiple venous collaterals seen along the anterior subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen with collateral flow to the right common femoral vein.
There is moderate stenosis of the right external iliac artery.
There is dense calcification involving the ostium of the left renal artery and dense calcifications at the origin of the right renal artery.
There are extensive venous intercostal collaterals along the anterior abdominal wall.
These findings are consistent with severe vena cava occlusion.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
Incidentally there was gallstones in the gallbladder.
Bilateral adrenal enlargement may represent adrenal hyperplasia.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There showed significant infrarenal aortic atherosclerotic changes with aneurysmal dilatation extending to the common iliac.
There is diffuse atherosclerotic ulcerative plaque of the bilateral external and internal iliac arteries.
There is severe disease of the left superficial femoral artery, which occluded at the adductor canal.
After careful review of the arteriogram and CTA a long discussion with the patient's daughter and the patient was determined being as a high risk and his comorbidities and recommendations were a left below the knee amputation.
The wound was clean, dry and intact.
The skin edges were intact with no ecchymosis and no drainage.
renal continued to follow the patient for hemodialysis needs.
Renal recommended that the patient only receive narcotics a single dose q 24 hours supplement the patient's break through pain with extra strength Tylenol tablets two q 4 to 6 hours prn for pain.
Severe peripheral vascular disease with left leg ischemia status post below the knee amputation.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
