CC: sepsis HPI: she denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
ROS: afebrile, no chest pain PMH: CHF  discharge exam EXAM:97.2 119/72 HR 74 18 96 RA lung sounds clear without crackles or wheezes irregular s1 and s2 soft, non-distended/non-tender abdomen trace peripheral edema  DATA INR 4.1, Creat 0.8 I personally reviewed her chest CT with radiology demonstrating bilateral chest masses  Medical Decision Making:  #SEPTIC SHOCK: Pt presented with SBP in 90s which was unresponsive to fluids (but only received 1.5L) and lactate of 7.6.
Pt was started on vanc/zosyn for presumed urinary source.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine 1.7 on admission from apparent baseline of 0.9-1.0 (last [**2134-4-28**]).
This is most likely prerenal in etiology given hypotension on admission and FeUrea of 29%.
# Supratherapeutic INR: INR on admission 6.1.
Poor nutritional status and sepsis may have contributed to supratherapeutic INR.
Pt was given Vitamin K on admission due to elevated INR and antibiotics administration.
*Please note that cipro dosing is likely to cause elevated levels.
# ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES: Troponin elevated to 0.06 on admission.
Unfortunately, there was no documented EKG at that time.
Given that her HR was 165 on admission, it was felt likely that her elevated troponin is due to rate-related demand ischemia or acute renal failure.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Was in rapid afib in the ED which resolveed after 5 mg IV metoprolol.
Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation.
Metoprolol was held in setting of hypotension.
#Lung mass: Pt previously noted on CXR [**3-21**] to have bilateral pleural opacifications in the upper lung fields.
As far as our records indicate, she has not had these opacifications evaluated.
A chest CT documented large bilateral pulmonary masses with an appearance concerning for malignancy though given the rapid change in appearance on CXR radiology also felt a fungal infection could also be on the differential.
The family is in agreement with this and all questions were answered, though I reminded them about the difficulty in prognosticating her future health regardless of the lung mass given her age and possibility of future acute infections, etc.
#Chronic stable diastolic CHF:  Last ECHO in our system is dated [**2125**], but the patient was admitted in [**6-18**] for a CHF exacerbation.
Lasix was held initially the setting of hypotension and then resumed at her home dose of 20mg daily.
Nifidipine stopped as BP not elevated .
# DM2: Held glipizide while in house and does not need to be resumed as her FSBG ranged in the 130-190s and she was aymptomatic and even low dose of sulfoynurea has the potential for hypogylecmia if she does not eat well.
--she is medically stable for d/c today --consider that when she is leaving rehab that she either go home with vna services or set up with home hospice   Medications on Admission: - Aspirin 81 mg QD - Lasix 20 mg QD - Levothyroxine 50 mcg QD - Glipizide SR 2.5 mg 24 hr QD - Toprol XL 100 mg 24 hr QD - Toprol XL 50 mg 24 hr QD - Coumadin 3 mg QD - Mirtazapine 15 mg QD - Senna - Tylenol PRN - Zyrtec 10 mg QD   Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
12. alum-mag hydroxide-simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis Urinary Tract Infection Lung Mass (probable lung cancer) Chronic Diastolic CHF Afib  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with sepsis from a UTI leading to positive blood cultures growing E. Coli.
You also had renal failure that improved during this admission.
Lung masses were found on chest CT that are suspected to be lung cancer but given your age and medical problems, you and your family decided against performing a biopsy.
Because of your weakness likely from this acute infection you will benefit from 24/7 care.
