Admission Date:  [**2197-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-6-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2157-6-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement Radial arterial line placement Mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 3866**] is a 39 F with widely metastatic melanoma first diagnosed in [**11/2195**] after undergoing a biopsy of a nevus that had changed in appearance and had become pruritic and prone to bleeding.
Pathology revealed nodular-type melanoma, invasive to a depth of at least 4.6 mm, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level at least 4, extending to the deep and lateral resection margins with ulceration present at 8 mm.
There was involvement of a sentinel lymph node with extracapsular extension.
On [**2195-11-23**], she underwent pulmonary wedge resection of a metastatic nodule.
Her CT scan on [**2196-10-17**] revealed enlargement of several pulmonary masses and a right infrahilar azygoesophageal  mass.
Additionally, she was found to have multiple brain metastases measuring up to 2 cm.
On [**1-4**], she started on daily Temodar but after 6 weeks of therapy she was found to have widely progressive disease.
She then elected to undergo IL2 for her metastatic disease.
The team elected to discontinue infusion because of hypoxia and acute renal failure.
The patient grew progressively more tachypneic and hypoxic, prompting admission to the ICU.
Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or headache, but admits to nonbloody diarrhea.
Family History: (Per notes) Mother is alive at 59 with no medical problems.
Father has hypertension as well as some skin lesions, however, he has never had them biopsied.
CARDIOVASCULAR: tachy, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation but some dullness at bases.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis, but 1+ bilateral edema on hands and feet.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-26**] 11:13 AM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There are numerous intracranial metastases which are better demonstrated on the [**2197-4-26**], MRI.
Please refer to that report for description of the metastatic disease.
Please note that a non-contrast head CT is insensitive to the detection of metastatic disease, abscesses, and vascular anomalies.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Numerous intracranial metastases as demonstrated on the [**2197-4-26**], MRI.
There is asymmetry of the nasopharyngeal tissues with prominence on the right.
This is a nonspecific finding which could possibly relate to the presence of soft tissue metastases.
There is opacification of left sphenoid and bilateral posterior ethmoid air cells with aerosolized secretions and fluid level.
There is asymmetric prominence of the right nasopharynx with respect to the left, clinical correlation is advised.
Bilateral ostiomeatal complexes are patent.
No bony dehiscense.
IMPRESSION: Mild sinusitis as above.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST A right axillary node measures 15 mm in short axis diameter and appears new.
Limited non-contrast evaluation of right hilar lymphadenopathy demonstrates that the node designated as target lesion #1 measures approximately 43 x 26 mm (previously 35 x 24 mm).
Left hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 1.8 cm in short axis diameter are again noted.
There is no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion.
There has been progression in size and number of multiple diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases.
A right middle lobe lung nodule in series 2, image 33 measures 4.2 x 3.9 cm compared to previous when it measured 3.7 x 3.5 cm.
Parenchymal consolidation at the lung bases likely represents atelectasis, however, a superimposed infectious process cannot be completely excluded.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Limited evaluation of the abdomen without contrast does not adequately evaluate the numerous liver and splenic metastatic lesions.
The pancreas and right adrenal gland appear unremarkable.
A left adrenal lesion designated lesion 5 measures 38 x 26 mm compared to prior when it measured 36 x 28 mm.
Non-contrast evaluation of the kidneys again reveals a soft tissue mass near the mid pole of the right kidney posteriorly, which does not demonstrate any gross change in size.
There is no evidence of free air.
Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes are again identified, some of which measure up to 15 mm and appear larger compared to [**2197-4-6**].
Non-contrast evaluation of large and small bowel is unremarkable.
Moderate free fluid is present in the pelvis and is new compared to [**Month (only) 958**].
Multiple scattered subcutaneous soft tissue densities have increased in size including a 10- mm one anteriorly (2: 75) and 11-mm periumbilical one (2: 89).
A left breast nodule measures 18 x 17 mm, unchanged.
Osseous structures reveal increased sclerosis around the SI joints bilaterally likely representing sacroileitis.
A small adjacent right sacral bone island is noted.
Limited non-contrast evaluation demonstrates progression of metastatic disease with increased pulmonary tumor burden and increase in size of multiple lymph node groups as described.
Hepatic and splenic tumor burden not adequately evaluated.
Left adrenal and right renal soft tissue lesions as described.
New anasarca and free pelvic fluid.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3866**] is a 39 year old woman with malignant melanoma who received Interleukin-2 and developed hypotension, hypoxia and fevers requiring transfer to the ICU where she was intubated and placed on pressor agents.
She was weaned from the pressors, but required persistent respiratory support.
The patient developed oliguric renal failure, renal was consulted, but she did not require dialysis and her kidney function returned to baseline.
She had persistently high ventilatory requirements and was difficult to wean from the ventilator, despite treatment for pneumonia.
She contined to worsen, so CT torso was performed which revealed worsening metastatic disease.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: [**2-7**] Capsules PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
