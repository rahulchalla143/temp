She assumed that the bleeding was coming from her vagina but was not certain.
She only had one episode of bleeding but per notes she had a large amount of brigh red blood per rectum with clots.
It was not associated with lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or decreased urine ouput per the patient, but her rehab noted that she was complaining of crampy abdominal pain.
She was noted to have bright red blood on rectal exam with no vaginal bleeding.
On arrival to the MICU she has no specific complaints.
Specifically no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, lightheadedness or dizziness.
She has extensive left lower extremity swelling with slight tingling in her left foot.
She feels that her bleeding is from her vaginal tract.
This is an 81 year-old G6P6 female who was recently diagnosed with Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva in [**6-/2112**] based on a vulvar biopsy and imaging.
There was no palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy on exam.
A follow-up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2112-10-31**] revealed interval increased thickening of the left vulva.
There was interval increase in the size of the right  pelvic wall soft tissue density that had been seen on prior imaging.
Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted but was decreased in size from prior imaging.
Surgical excision of the vulvar lesion and surgical evaluation of  the right pelvic wall soft tissue density was pursued.
Intra-operatively, the left vulvar mass was 2 cm with a depth of  0.5 cm which extended to the right labium.
Pathology revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated in the vulvar specimen.
The pathology revealed a grade 2 lesion with a greatest dimension of 2.1 cm and 4 mm invasion.
Paraaortic and pelvic nodes were negative.
The patient has Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.
In [**Month (only) 547**], she reported having some back pain and had CT abd/pelvis.
This revealed a mass that is approximately 9 cm in size on the left pelvic side wall with hydronephrosis noted on the left side.
A biopsy of this mass was obtained on [**2113-6-24**] revealed squamous cell carcinoma.

EKG: normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST [**Street Address(2) 13234**] depression in V4, otherwise no acute ST segment changes.
Compared with prior dated [**2113-8-7**] ST depression in new.
Sigmoidoscopy [**2113-8-19**]: -Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids -Diverticulosis of the distal sigmoid colon, proximal sigmoid colon and distal descending colon -Blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon and distal descending colon -We did not find mass lesion during our procedure.
-Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to distal descending colon -Recommendations: Pt's bleeding is most likely secondary to her diverticulum.
However, the right side colon mass lesion can not be r/o now.
Colonoscopy [**2113-8-22**]: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Diverticulosis of the mid-descending colon, distal descending colon and sigmoid colon Blood in the descending colon and sigmoid colon Polyp in the mid-ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old female with a history of stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and recent diagnosis of DVT on anticoagulation who presented from rehab with bright red blood per rectum.
Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Differential diagnosis for lower gastrointestinal bleeding included diverticulosis, polyps, gastrointestinal malignancies, AVM, hemorrhoids, versus malignant invasion of known gynecologic tumor into rectum.
Even after heparin drip had been d/c'ed, she continued to have BRBPR, which excluded her as a candidate for future anticoagulation.
She did not have any brisk bleeding during her course, so tagged bleeding scan was not done and source of bleed was never identified.
IVC filter was indicated to allow anticoagulation to safely be held in the setting gastrointestinal bleeding and large DVT with potential for pulmonary embolism.
Vulvar Cancer:  Patient is s/p radical vulvectomy and chemoradiation but recently with new pelvic mass and associated hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection.
Goals of Care: Since anticoagulation could not be administered for DVT in the setting of GI bleed, goals of care were readdressed during this admission.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital on [**2113-8-18**] with bleeding in your GI tract.
Your heparin was then stopped, but you cannot have anticoagulation for your leg clot because of your GI bleeding.
A colonoscopy was done, and there was no clear source of bleeding in your GI tract.
This likely means that you have diverticulosis or a bleeding blood vessel that could not be seen with the colonoscopy.
You are also at risk for a clot to your lungs because the clot is not being treated.
You also had a urinary tract infection.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4149**] or go to the ER if you have bleeding from your rectum or vagina, fevers>100.4, severe nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or any symptoms that are concerning to you.
