He was found to have interval progression of his lymphoma and started  Rituxan-Bendamustine C1D1 [**2153-11-26**].
On [**11-29**] he sustained a mechanical fall on ice and sustained a right proximal femur fracture.
Patient also states that he experiences shortness of breath whenever he has his chemotherapy.

Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGY HISTORY: Significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma w diffuse mixed cell histology diagnosed in [**2130**], status post six cycles of CHOP.
Relapsed in the form of abdominal LAD in [**2150**] causing hydronephrosis (has a ureteral stent), path showed follicular lymphoma, treated with 6 x RCVP resulting in PR, last cycle was in [**12-28**].
- He was found to have interval progression of his lymphoma and started  Rituxan-Bendamustine C1D1 [**2153-11-26**].
-Hernia repair.
-Correction of an undescended testis in childhood and appendectomy.
-S/p nephrostomy tube placement for right ureter obstruction by lymphoma.
- Cavitating lesion found in left lung in [**2150**] on CT scan, underwent bronchoscopy after which revealed a likely a BOOP-like reaction although unclear to what (transient infection vs medication reaction).
He was never required to see pulmonology in follow-up - Hypersensitivity skin reaction and pruritis secondary to increased dose of amlodipine, [**2-/2153**] - left urethral stricture repair [**2153-7-3**] - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - CKD Stage III with GFR 43   Social History: Lives with wife.
Family History: Father died at 89 of old age; mother died of surgical complications of stone removal; sister with unspecified cancer at shoulder.
Family h/o heart disease.
Physical Exam: VS: T 98.1  HR 67  bp 150/81  RR 20 SaO2 95 5L GEN: Elderly man, uncomfortable, awake, alert HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP slightly dry  and without lesion NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate and rhythm, mechanical click, I/VI systolic murmur, no r/g.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi on anterior and lateral fields ABD: Soft, NT, ND, no HSM, bowel sounds present MSK: normal muscle tone and bulk EXT: right LE shortned and internally rotated with normal perfusion, no other abnormalities SKIN: No rash, warm skin NEURO: oriented x 3, normal attention, intact sensation to light touch PSYCH: appropriate   Pertinent Results: EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block.
ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent .
Elevated venous pressures and mild pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Right femoral neck lesion: - [**Month/Day/Year **] clot and bone fragments with features consistent with fracture; a Hematopathology Note will follow as addendum.
HEMATOPATHOLOGY: Right femoral neck and head, hemiarthroplasty: Cellular bone marrow with no diagnostic morphologic evidence of lymphoma.
No lymphoid aggregates or atypical lymphoid infiltrates are seen.
[**11-30**] hip: FINDINGS: The prosthetic device appears well seated without evidence of hardware-related complication.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic involutional changMes with low attenuating white matter disease in the periventricular and subcortical white matter likely represents sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Bilateral lacunes in the basal ganglia.
MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarct and should be considered in the correct clinical setting if there are no contraindications to the use of MRI.
[**2153-12-2**]: Sinus rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment changes in lead III are less prominent.
[**2153-12-2**] Radiology CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON IMPRESSION: No focal fluid collection or evidence of large hematoma to explain hematocrit drop.
Diffuse asymmetric enlargement of the right thigh relative to the left, likely representing postoperative edema with areas of intra- and inter-muscle postoperative hemorrhage; however, no large collection identified.
[**2153-12-4**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Old inferior myocardial infarction.
[**2153-12-5**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2153-12-6**] investigation of transfusion reaction: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 109953**] experienced a temperature increase of 2.6 degrees F over the first 100 minutes of a leukoreduced compatible red [**Known lastname **] cell transfusion.
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of hemolysis and the patient has had fevers during his hospital course that were not in the setting of transfusion.
As such and given that leukoreduction significantly reduces the incidence of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, the patient's fever is most likely due to his underlying illness and not the transfusion.
No change in transfusion practice is recommended at this time in this patient .
Post-operative changes with edema and small post-operative seroma, as described above.
Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.

3143**] TSH-1.8  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 71-year-old man with a hx of follicular lymphoma and a remote history of high-grade lymphoma, CAD, CABG, AVR on coumadin, HTN, CKD III who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a hip fracture.
# Right proximal femoral fracture: Pt had a mechanical slip-and-fall resulting in a right femoral neck fracture on [**2153-11-29**].
Pt was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] and had an open biopsy of right femoral neck and a right hip hemiarthroplasty (press-fit) on [**2153-11-30**].
Per ortho, procedure went well and Pt is weight bearing as tolerated on R lower extremity.
Was given linezolid x1 for prophylaxis.
On the second day post op ([**12-2**]), Pt had a large hematocrit drop from 26.0 -> 17.3 (see below).
Per ortho, wound looked good with obvious major bleeding.
Pathology from the site returned negative for malignancy.
Pain was controlled with oxycodone, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch.
# Hct drop/hypotension/anemia: Pt was transferred to the MICU for hypotention and a large 9 point hematocrit drop as well as confusion and word finding difficulty.
Most likely explanation was an acute bleed, especially given that he has been on a heparin ggt and coumadin post-op, in combination with recent Chemo txt, suppressing bone marrow production.
Non-con CT of abdomen and pelvis did show bleeding through right thigh, but no large hematoma or collection that could explain the degree of Hct drop.
Pt recently received chemotherapy 1 week prior, which may explain platelet drop but less likely to affect Hct.
No sign of GI bleed.
GI service was consulted, who felt that GI bleed was very unlikely and that scoping was unwarranted right now.
Unlikely to have been acute hemolysis since LDH and haptoglobin were normal.
Hematology was also consulted, who felt that hemolysis was unlikely.
Pt had another HCT drop on [**12-6**], On the [**Hospital1 **], his hct continued to fall and his rt thigh was very painful, so a CT was repeated of the thigh, but no bleeding was evident.
had a febrile transfusion reaction and the transfusion had to be aborted.
Pathology ultimately determined that this was unlikely to be a transfusion reaction and pt was continued on heparin gtt.
Could use transfusion criteria for HCT <25, given heart disease, however given recent acute illness and ?transfusion reaction, would consider more conservative approach and transfuse for HCT drop and/or symptoms.
He was on a heparin drip after his orthopedic procedure, but this was stopped after he developed a large Hct drop (see above).
His heparin drip was restarted on [**12-5**], then intermittantly stopped [**12-6**] (see above) and then again resumed when CT did not show evidence of acute bleeding.
No focal symptoms.
Ortho re-evaluated wound and felt it was fine.
Pt did have a pyuria on his admission UA for which empiric Levofloxacin was started, but this was stopped after his urine cultures were negative after 2 days.
Pt spiked more fevers throughout [**12-5**] and had significant shaking chills, and vancomycin and cefepime were started empirically.
Given that CXR and cx's remained negative without further fevers, these antibiotics were dc'd and pt has remained afebrile without a leukocytosis for >48hours.
Ucx revealed some yeast, but foley was subsequently removed.
# Delirium/word-finding difficulty: Pt triggered for word finding difficulty [**12-1**] evening.
Neurology was consulted, who felt his symptoms were most likely due to pain medications in the setting of hypotension and severe anemia.
Neurology evaluated and recommended MRI w/ DWI to rule out stroke, however patient and family have declined the study due to his severe claustrophobia and resolution of his symptoms.
