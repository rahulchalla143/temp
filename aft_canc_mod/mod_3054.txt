She was found to have a pancreatic mass and was referred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9886**] office for surgical management.
She initially presented to her primary care physician after being evaluated for liver function tests which were initially found to be elevated and were felt to be due to the starting of Lipitor.
The statin was subsequently discontinued, however, the elevated LFTs remained.
On workup she had a right upper quadrant ultrasound and that revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas.
This was done in [**2189-9-10**] when patient had no complaints of any abdominal symptoms.
Because of her history of chronic renal insufficiency, she was subjected to a CT scan without contrast that revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas as consistent with ultrasound findings.
There also appears to be pathologic retroperitoneal lymph nodes at the level of the pancreas.
Because of the limits of these studies, she subsequently, in [**2189-10-11**], had an open MRI which revealed a 7.4 x 5.2 cm mass in the region of the head of the pancreas with mild enhancement.
There were also noted bilateral periaortic adenopathy inferior to and at the level of the renal veins.
Subsequent CT guided fine needle aspiration fracture was performed which was reported as positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
