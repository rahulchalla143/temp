CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2115-10-15**] IMPRESSION: Increased consolidation of the left base and patchy right lower lobe opacities, which may be due to aspiration or developing pneumonia.
There was no evidence of any tumour ingrowth.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
A calcified spherical mass (2.6 by 2.6 cm) is present in the para-aortic region abutting the posterior wall of the left atrium.
Patient demonstrated aspiration with continuous straw sips of thin liquids.
Otherwise, no evidence of aspiration was identified with other consistencies of barium.. .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2115-10-18**] IMPRESSION: Interval increased consolidation of the left base with persistent right lower lobe patchy opacities.
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2115-10-18**] IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-24**] and [**10-15**]: Pneumonia in the right lower lobe has worsened since [**10-15**].
Severe left lower lobe atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion are unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is mild with respect to the right and less pronounced since [**Month (only) **].

The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Staging/treatment, tracheoesophageal fistula as above.
Shortness of breath.
Likely multifactorial secondary to lung cancer, pneumonia, and anemia.
Likely secondary to chemotherapeutic agents and anemia of chronic disease.
Most likely secondary to chemotherapeutic agents.
Pericardial effusion per OSH echo.
Likely secondary to cancer and chemotherapeutic agents.
