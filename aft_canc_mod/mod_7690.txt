The patient was reportedly in his normal state of health until approximately [**Month (only) **], when he developed a non-productive cough.
The cough worsened and he had occasional blood flecked clear expectorate.
A CT performed at an OSH revealed a large RUL mass with compression of the right mainstem bronchi and SVC.
He was also noted to have a large pleural effusion.
Per report, the patient then developed sinus tachycardia at the end of the procedure, which was reportedly thought to be secondary to either pain or dehydration.
On the floor, the patient immediately triggered for AFib with RVR with rates to the 140s and stable BP.
He was incredibly anxious and stated that he wanted to leave the hospital and no longer wants the procedure tomorrow.
After discussion with the patient and his wife, he agreed to take medication for treatment of his anxiety but otherwise deferred further medical management for his AFib.

Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and lymphocytes.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o AFib who presented to the IP suite for SVC venogram and bronchoscopy with right mainstem stent placement.
The obstructed SVC was stented with 3 stents; pt then developed sinus tachycardia and was admitted to SIRS (medical floor) on [**2165-3-14**] for observation until rigid bronchoscopy planned for the next morning.
Tachycardia subsequently resolved and pt was taken for rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy on [**2165-3-15**].
Plan was to stent right mainstem bronchus but this was not possible given obstructive nature of tumor and its friability.
Biopsy was taken and sent for stat pathology.
Pt was intubated for the procedure and extubated afterwards but became agitated and hypoxic.
Due to worsening hypercapnia and agitation, he was re-intubated and transferred to MICU.
He did also have a troponin leak that was believed to be [**1-23**] demand ischemia in setting of afib.
Medications on Admission: Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO prn for anxiety   Discharge Medications: 1. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety for 1 weeks.
Disp:*14 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Superior Vena Cava Syndrome Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
Secondary: Hypertension Chronic systolic congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you have a mass in your lungs that is causing compression on your right mainstem bronchus (the large airway).
You also had an episode of a fast heart rate, called AFib (atrial fibrilation) with rapid ventircular rate or RVR, which we think was worsened by your anxiety.
We gave you a medication called Ativan for anxiety, and started a medicine called metoprolol for your heart rate.
While you were here, we made the following changes to your medications: - You may start lorazepam (Ativan), as needed, for anxiety.
