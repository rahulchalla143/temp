Brief Hospital Course: PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION 83 yo M with h/o MDS and uretheral stricture with self-intermittent catheterizing admitted FOR with sepsis secondary to UTI.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS # Sepsis secondary to urinary source: Presented to ED with chills, abdominal pain and low grade fever.
Became hypotensive and had grossly positive UA in in setting of uretheral dilation for stricture and self-catheterization.
Switched off vancomycin after GS showed no gram positive organism.
Culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and switched to ciprofloxacin to complete 15 day course.
Underwent TURP earlier this year for obstruction followed by dilation of urinary stricture in [**Month (only) 216**].
Additional UA was obtained, which still showed large blood and WBC.
# MDS: Previously treated with azacitidine, last dose 6/[**2110**].
Remained markedly thrombocytopenic during stay, but stable in low 20's.
# Relative Hypocalcemia: Noted to be hypocalcemic on admission to 6.5.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS  # CAD: Stable, admission EKG showed no ischemic changes.
Metoprolol was held in setting of hypotension, but restarted on discharge.
# Elevated Alk Phos:  Has been in 200's since [**Month (only) 404**].
OUTSTANDING STUDIES -Urine Cx from [**8-24**] -Final reports of blood cultures  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Will need continued following for chronic urinary retention as patient did not tolerate intermittent self catheterization and currently has a chronic foley catheter.
Disp:*18 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 3894**] Health VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sepsis due to a urinary source Secondary: Urinary retention, MDS   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We found that you had a bad urinary tract infection and you went to the ICU because your blood pressure was low.
You continued to have problems with urinary leakage, so after speaking with the urologists, we decided to leave a foley catheter in place until you can follow up with your urologist.
