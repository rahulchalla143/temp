Admission Date:  [**2137-1-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-2-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-4-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Excertional Chest Pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CABGx2(LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM) [**2137-1-31**] Lymph node biopsy of LUL [**2137-1-31**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 95516**] is a 48 y/o Spanish speaking male with a h/o of HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse, CAD, recently diagnosed lung cancer who presented with chest pain over the last several weeks, described as pressure with radiation to both arms and associated with SOB, associated wqith excertion but also occuring at rest.
It is not associated with diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting.
Last chest pain was this morning.
Currently he is chest pain free.
He underwent ETT on day of admission during which he developed SSCP and dyspnea after 2.5 min which was [**6-29**] and progressed to [**10-29**] and then resolved with oxygen after 6 minutes.
0.5mm downsloping ST depressions were noted on lead II, aVF at 5.5 minutes exercise that resaolved 2 min into recovery stage.
Nuclear report showed moderate to severe reversible perfusion defects in the septum and anterior wall extending to the apex with associated hypokinesis consistent with a proximal LAD lesion, LVEF 45%.
He had a cardiac cath at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-23**] which showed 1 vessel CAD with a distal LM stenosis of 30%, LAD 50% proximal disease, LCx 40% proximal disease.
RCA was small, non-dominant, and without lesions.
After stress results patient underwent cath which showed 2 vessel disease with 60-70% LM disease, 70% pLAD, and 70% pLCx.
He had no intervention.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Diabetes Hyperlipidemia CAD Non-small-cell Lung Ca, diagnosed in past 1-2 weeks; T3 N2 disease making him stage IIIa lung cancer.
[**2137-1-29**] Exercising MIBI Moderate to severe reversible perfusion defects in the septum and anterior wall extending to the apex with associated hypokinesis consistent with a proximal LAD lesion.
Left ventricular cavity size is slightly larger on exercise images consistent with transient ischemic dilatation.
[**2137-1-30**] Head MRI Nearly uninterpretable study due to gross patient motion.
Possible left frontal developmental venous anomaly.
Perhaps the patient would be better able to tolerate a CT scan of the brain with resultant less image degradation due to motion artifacts.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage and the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mild hypokinesis in the apical anteroseptal and anterior walls.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2137-2-5**] Head CT No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction.
[**2137-2-4**] CXR Left apical lung mass and pneumothorax are relatively unchanged when compared to [**2137-2-2**].
Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly worse on the left when compared to the previous study.
Lymph node, mediastinal level five (A):  Mediational poorly differentiated carcinoma with squamous features, present within one lymph node (+[**1-20**]).
Lymph node, mediastinal level six (B):  One lymph node, no malignancy identified (0/1).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95516**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2137-1-29**] following an exercise tolerance test for a cardiac catheterization.
This revealed a 70% stenosed left main, a 70% stenosed left anterior descending artery and a 70% stenosed left circumflex artery.
A head MRI was performed to rule out metastatic disease which was not interpretable due to motion artifact.
On [**2137-1-31**], Mr. [**Known lastname 95516**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels as well as a mediastinal lymph node dissection.
As he was experiencing significant pain, the pain service was consulted who started a dilaudid PCA pump.
On [**2137-2-3**], Mr. [**Known lastname 95516**] became somewhat agitated and anxious.
This revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction.
Vancomycin was started for mild sternal serous drainage.
The pathology results of Mr. [**Known lastname 95517**] mediastinal lymph node biopsy revealed mediational poorly differentiated carcinoma with squamous features, present within one lymph node (+[**1-20**]).
