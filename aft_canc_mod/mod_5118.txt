Admission Date:  [**2187-1-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-1-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-1-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Metastatic adenocarcinoma of colon to liver  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Extended left hepatic lobectomy, segment [**5-30**] mass resection, segment 6, mass resection x2.
wound vac Intubation Swan-ganz catheter  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58-year-old female who underwent a right hemicolectomy, ileal transverse colostomy and cholecystectomy on [**2185-10-27**] for an invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum with invasion into the wall and into the pericolonic adipose tissue.
Incidentally, metastatic tumor was present in 7 out of 10 regional lymph nodes.
She was evaluated in [**2185-9-22**], demonstrating 7 lesions in the liver consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon.
Five were confined to the left lobe including the left lateral segment and medial segment.
However, she also had a lesion in the inferior aspect of segment 6 in the right lobe and a deep lesion at the junction of segment 6 and 7.
A CT done at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2185-11-30**] demonstrated multiple rim enhancing low attenuation lesions throughout the liver consistent with a history of metastatic colon cancer.
She also had a large amount of low attenuation ascites in the abdomen and stranding was thought to represent peritoneal involvement with tumor.
Over the past year she has been treated with chemotherapy and has had follow-up CT scans that have shown resolution of the peritoneal findings and ascites along with significant shrinkage of the liver masses.

Liver, segment [**5-30**], resection (R-S):  Metastatic adenocarcinoma with necrosis, not present at resection margin.
Small intestine with focal acute peritonitis and unremarkable mucosa.
Colon segment with peritoneal fibrous adhesions and focal acute peritonitis.
Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate waveforms in all remaining vessels including portal venous, hepatic venous and arterial systems.
2.6 cm hyperechoic lesion located anteriorly and inferiorly in the right lobe, most likely representing postsurgical change  Liver US: [**2187-1-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
No biliary dilatation and no intrahepatic fluid collection identified.
Scant trace of ascites in the perihepatic space.
Small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity.
Interval development of more focal left upper lobe and probable right middle lobe pneumonia.
Decrease in bilateral pleural effusions as described above.
No organized intra-abdominal fluid collections identified.
Can not exclude component of carcinomatosis.
Hyperdense collections along multiple surgical resection beds likely represent resolving postoperative hematoma and indwelling surgical glue and Surgicel.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
New left groin hematoma as above.
Interval development of a small bowel containing ventral hernia at the midline without signs of strangulation.
This is consistent with underlying dehiscence of the abdominal wall musculature/fascia of approximately 6.5cm  Echo [**1-24**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Widening of left upper mediastinum again can be seen with no significant change since the prior study and actually is due to a left upper lobe consolidation adjacent to the mediastinum.
There is no interval change in left basal atelectasis and right basal plate-like areas of atelectasis.
No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
Liver US [**1-25**] No evidence of a portal vein thrombosis.
CXR [**1-26**]  Findings: There has been no interval change in the position of Port Cath, PICC line, endotracheal tube, NG tube, the drainage tube of the right upper quadrant.
There has been interval clearing of the right upper lobe opacity.
New middle lobe density has developed.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
No pneumothorax is detected.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] general surgery service and taken to the operating room on [**2187-1-5**] for a left hepatic lobectomy, segment [**5-30**] mass resection, segment 6, mass resection x2, extensive lysis of adhesions, biopsy of the right lobe of the liver, and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
Patient did require pressors and fluid for hypotension and oliguria overnight.
Unasyn for empiric prophlaxis.
Urine output only marginal throughout.
Ultrasound for right arm swelling and returned normal without any clots.

Started on Vanco/Flagyl/Zosyn for empiric coverage given elevated wbc (29); C.Diff sent with sudden development diarrhea; CT abd repeated; A-line and CVL placed; and Vigileo started.
Placed on maximum volume of pressor support for hypotension.
On [**2187-1-13**] she received lasix with FFP to help with diuresis and improving respiratory status.
2u pRBC transfused to maintain intravascular volume.
She was pan-cultured for fever 101 as well.
Noticed erythema around incisional site, requiring multiple dressing changes for leakage.
Albumin infused intermittently for intravascular repletion.
HIT panel sent concerning for low platelets returned negative.
Patient succesffully diuresed with decreased vent settings.
A rash noted over patient's left flank.
ID consulted for concerns of resistant cellulitus.
Started on meropenem for better G- coverage for presumed cellulitis in addition to vancomycin.
With high drain output from abdomen, CT ordered, revealing wound dehiscence and bilateral pneumonia.
Dermatology agreed with diagnosis of cellulitus.
She continues to have oliguria with hypotension.
On [**2187-1-23**], patient repleted with IV hydration and albumin due to excessive drainage from wound vac.
CXR showing increased left lobe consolidation.
TTE to assess cardiac function, which showed normal EF with hyperdynamic state.
Patient desaturated overnight with bradycardia episodes to 30 and hypotension, responded with atropine.
From [**2187-1-24**] - [**2187-1-26**], patient continued to have worsening renal function with oliguria.
Patient received bronchoscopy, which revealed no major mucus plugging.
TEE performed instead ruling out hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock.
