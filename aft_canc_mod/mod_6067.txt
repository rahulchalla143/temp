wires/VAC placement [**2175-6-9**] sternal plating and closure   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 62 yo F s/p CABGx2 [**2175-4-3**] (LIMA to diag, Vein to OM) which was complicated by a pseudomonal sternal wound infection.
She initially returned on [**4-7**] with ongoing low grade fevers and "pustular bloody drainage" from the lower border of her sternal wound.
However her wound continued to have copious purulent drainage which was swabbed on [**4-11**] and returned with a pan sensitive pseudomonas.
Her wound was opened and debrided and noted to extend fairly deep.
As her wound cultures were performed while pt was on vanco, it was uncertain if any component of her sternal wound infection was due to a gram positive organism.
Her [**4-13**] Chest CT w/o contrast showed up to a 6mm dehiscence of the upper sternum with a small, gas-containing retrosternal collection.
She was seen in ID f/u on [**5-8**] at which time she continued to have a wound vac in place and due to persistently elevated inflammatory markers, it was decided to continue her abx until seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery on [**5-22**] at which time her wound vac was discontinued.
She has also noted the top of her sternal wound developing increasing erythema over the last few days with some erythema extending into her R. breast.
She has also noted an increase in right pleuritic chest pain over the past week and now has an element of constant pain through the respiratory cycle.
She notes her sternal wound has been healing well despite the ongoing drainage.
At a scheduled visit to the [**Hospital **] clinic today a new area of drainage at the midpoint of the sternal wound was noted, raising concern for a recurrence of infection.
