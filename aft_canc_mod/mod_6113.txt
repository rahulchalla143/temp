Patchy consolidation at the right lung base with obscuration of the right heart border; differential includes infection versus aspiration versus hemorrhage in the right middle lobe.
There is no evidence of obstruction or ileus.
No free air is seen inthe abdomen.
Patchy opacities within the lungs are concerning for infection.
A continuous diaphragm sign is noted, most consistent with pneumomediastinum.
No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
Evidence suggestive of pneumomediastinum.
Heterogeneous opacities within the lungs are concerning for infection.
Please refer to the accompanying chest radiograph from [**2184-6-3**] for additional details.
# [**6-3**] portal CXR Pneumomediastinum was present, but smaller on [**6-1**], progressed to increased mediastinal air and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck on [**6-3**], without subsequent change over five hours.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
Probable right lower lobe pneumonia is improving, due in part to increased lung volumes generally.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
# [**6-4**] portal CXR Lung volumes are decreased slightly.
There is a suggestion of a new, possibly cavitated nodule in the left mid lung at the level of the fourth anterior interspace and possibly one or two similar sized lesion at the same level on the right.
Mediastinal vascular engorgement reflects supine positioning.
