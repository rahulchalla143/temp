male with 4.9 x 4.4 cm AAA and h/o PUD s/p Billroth II years ago who presented with abdominal pain and dropping hematocrit.
In the work-up for the anemia, he was found to have a large gastric mass on EGD [**9-11**], which was not biopsied at the time of the inital study because the lesion was friable and his Hct was unstable.
He has also been found to have multiple hypoechoic hepatic lesions (likely cysts) and a multiple renal cysts (the largest in the right upper pole) on abd CT, as well as free fluid in the pelvis and nodular scarring of the right lung base as noted on CTA.
He was transferred to the medical service for further workup of his gastric mass and multiple medical comorbidities.
He subsequently developed acute onset of shortness of breath for which he was transferred to the MICU on [**9-16**].

STUDIES: EKG: Sinus 110 with frequent APCs, pseudonormalization of T waves, nonpathogenic Q waves anteriorly and laterally .
New bilateral moderate pleural effusions obscure evaluation of previously identified right lower lobe opacity and further characterization is not possible at this time.
Hypodense hepatic, renal and adrenal lesions better evaluated on the recent dedicated abdominal CT. .
Stable abdominal aortic aneurysm without evidence of rupture or dissection.
New ascites.
The possibility of hemoperitoneum cannot be excluded in this patient who is severely anemic.
Unchanged multiple hypodense lesions in the liver and kidney, and dilated intrahepatic duct post-cholecystectomy and mild prominence of the pancreatic duct.
Bilateral hypodense adrenal lesions, stable from 4/[**2189**].
male with AAA, anemia and large gastric [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU [**9-16**] for acute onset SOB, felt likely [**1-29**] vocal cord spasm.
#) Gastric Mass / Liver Lesions / Pulmonary Lesion: pt underwent biopsy of GI mas on [**9-14**] while on surgical service, diagnostic for gastric cancer, which showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring features.
Plan was for staging laparoscopy when he developed SOB resulting in MICU transfer.
post biopsy course complicated by bleeding requring 5U PRBC on [**2098-9-9**].
#) Anemia: baseline hct ~30,  some chronic component most likely 2/2 blood losses from the gastric mass; pt with acute bleeding after biopsy of gastric mass (hct down to 18) requiring 5U PRBC on [**9-10**] while in CSRU, stable Hct and vitals after transfusion s/p biopsy.
#) Leukocytosis: unclear etiology; pateint was c/o diarrhea prior to admission and for the first few days of hospital course; no prior antibiotic exposure; rising count after admission but afebrile; ?
response to recent EGD instrumentation vs. traumatic foley insertion vs. reaction to blood transfusion (saw in note that there was some question of reaction on [**9-10**] and blood bank w/u initiated) vs. C. diff colitis vs. viral gastroenteritis vs. GI upset from unknown source.
#) Traumatic foley insertion: pt with h/o penile prosthesis.
foley was removed without complication, though pt had mild ongoing bleeding.
# acute SOB: no history of lung disease, no CHF history, 65 pky smoking history with emphysema on imaging, was transferred from medicine floor to MICU on [**9-16**] for acute episodes of SOB and hypoxemia x2.
First SOB episode was at 3 pm earlier [**9-16**], SBP 170s, 100% 2L nc was switched to 100% NRB, patient was using accessory muscles with labored breathing, but could clearly state that he was having a hard time breathing.
In the MICU, his SOB spontaneously and suddenly resolved from extreme SOB on 100% NRB to a normal breathing pattern on RA over 10 minutes, with no further intervention or medication.
The episodes both started when he started thinking about his ex lap tomorrow for staging of his gastric cancer.
He sleeps flat in bed, has never been told he has emphysema or CHF, uses no oxygen or inhalers on a daily basis at home, can walk a few blocks before having to stop from SOB, can go up and down 1 flight of stairs, on no lasix or water pills at home (was written for lasix here to start on [**9-17**]).
He has never had psychiatric issues, depression, anxiety, panic disorder, but feels overwhelmed by recent cancer diagnosis.
etiology was ultimately attributed to vocal cord spasm as no abnormalities on physical exam, though ABGs were markedly abnormal.
Appears that patient had 2 anxiety/panic attacks over surgery that was to be for tomorrow, now cancelled.
cardiac enzymes mildly elevated felt [**1-29**] mild elevation in creatinine.
pt treated with Ativan prn for anxiety and discharged home with recomendation for further w/u if episodes recurred.
Outpatient Lab Work please have your CBC drawn when you are seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to ensure that it is stable (HCT=30 upon discharge)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Gastric adenocarcinoma Respiratory distress Thrombocytopenia AAA Hypertension Blood loss anemia Emphysema   Discharge Condition: Stable.
your aspirin and plavix were discontinued during this admission given your recent GI bleeding, and in anticipation of your staging laparoscopy.
you were noted to have blood in your urine during this admission, this was felt due to a traumatic foley insertion, you were seen by urology.
please follow-up with your primary care physician if you continue to have blood in your urine.
If you develop any black or bright red stools, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or any other concerning symptom please call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
