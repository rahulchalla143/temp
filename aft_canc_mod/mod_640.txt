Admission Date:  [**2125-2-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-3-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-10-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: OSH transfer intubated and ventilated  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation, ventilation  History of Present Illness:  The pt is a 54 yo female with stage III fibrosis hepatitis C with history of cryoglobulinemia, lymphoma, h/o IVDU including ICU stays for heroin and benzodiazepine overdose, PNA, Candidemia, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2-2**] after being found unresponsive in her own vomit.
In the field, the patient was hypotensive and hypoglycemic.
At [**Hospital1 2025**], the patient was intubated secondary to altered mental status.
The likely cause of her hypotension was septic shock; imaging showed a multifocal pneumonia.
The patient was started on very broad coverage antibiotics for pneumonia with aspiration, along with micafungin, given a previous history of fungemia.
Within 24 hours, the patient began to turn around, with lower pressor requirements.
Microbiology was only positive for MSSA on sputum sample.
Head CT demonstrated a left tempral gyrus contusion/shear injury of 7mm, representing a likely old concussion.
The leading diagnosis for the patient's AMS is a combination of her sepsis and delayed clearance of her sedative drugs.
Other contributors may include a recent hypernatremia (to 153), which is thought to be secondary to decreased free water.
Daily fevers: The patient has dialy fevers to 101-102, despite resolution of other septic symptoms.
CT of chest and abdomen showed multifocal pneumonia, cholelithiasis with stones in CBD and near cystic duct.
d. Thrombocytopenia, chronic and secondary to liver disease.
Past Medical History: history of IVDU depression sialolithiasis fine tremor peripheral neuropathy s/p prolonged ICU stay for heroin and benzodiazepine overdose multi-lobar pneumonia (M. catarrhalis) .

IMAGING / STUDIES: From [**Hospital1 2025**]: [**2125-2-6**] CT chest: Multifocal areas of consolidation, including inferior portion of RUL, the RML, and both LLs consistent with massive aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
[**2125-2-6**] CT abd/pelvis: Cholelithiasis and stones in the cystic duct.
[**2-7**] CT head: Punctate 7-mm hyperdense focus within the left middle temporal gyrus concerning for contusion or shear injury.
# LIVER AND GALLBLADDER US ([**2125-2-8**] at 1:17 PM): FINDINGS: There are no focal or textural abnormalities in the liver.
Ascites and pleural effusion are present as on the prior CT.
Stable appearance of minimally dilated CBD.
Cholelithiasis and sludge with a distended gallbladder.
There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffuse mild emphysematous changes are noted which are most prominent at the lung apices.
There are multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity, peribronchial nodules and a more focal area of consolidation at the right base.
Multiple small thin-walled cavities are noted within the right middle lobe and right lower lobes.
There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening and secretions are noted within the central airways.
There is collapse of the left lower lobe basilar segments with no obstructing endobronchial lesion is identified.
A small left pleural effusion is new.
There are no bony lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, images of the upper abdomen demonstrate new intra-abdominal ascites and stable splenomegaly.
Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacification, peribronchial nodules, focal right basilar consolidation and multiple small thin-walled cavities within the right middle and lower lobes.
These findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Multiple small, thin-walled cavitary lesions within the right middle and lower lobes could reflect pneumatoceles, thin-walled abscesses or septic emboli.
Near-complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
No obstructing endobronchial lesion identified.
# LIVER AND GALLBLADDER US ([**2125-2-12**] at 12:11 PM): FINDINGS: The liver contains no focal mass.
There is no progressive intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The gallbladder is notable for cholelithiasis and sludge layering dependently.
Note is made of gallbladder mural thickening, as well as pericholecystic fluid which is of little diagnostic utility in the setting of a small volume of ascites in general.
Previously characterized choledocholithiasis is not definitively seen, though is presumed to still be present.
Targeted ultrasound in all four quadrants reveals no large pocket of ascites for blind paracentesis.
Overall, minimal change with redemonstration of a slightly dilated common bile duct as well as cholelithiasis and sludge within the gallbladder.
Hepatic echotexture suggestive of hepatitis 3.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
# MRCP ([**2125-2-14**] at 8:49 PM): FINDINGS: There is large ascites, markedly increased from the prior CT and ultrasound studies, which slightly degrades image quality.
The liver is normal in size and signal intensity and density with no focal enhancing lesions.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The common bile duct measures up to 7 mm with no focal filling defects to suggest choledocholithiasis.
Upper abdominal varices are redemonstrated.
There is redemonstration of an enlarged spleen, which measures 16 cm in AP dimension.
There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis is noted within the partially imaged lower thorax.
No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary or pancreatic ductal dilatation.
No filling defects within these ducts to suggest choledocholithiasis.
Large ascites, markedly increased from recent CT and ultrasound studies.
Evidence of portal hypertension, unchanged from prior studies.
Within these limitations, there is no obvious focus of decreased diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.
On the axial FLAIR sequence, evaluation for focal lesions is limited due to artifacts.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are mildly prominent, likely related to mild volume loss.
There is diffuse increased signal in the left mastoid air cells from fluid/mucosal thickening/both, and minimal in the right mastoid air cells.
Slightly increased signal in the left transverse sinus on the T1 and FLAIR sequences may relate to slow flow.
However, this can be better assessed with MRV to exclude thrombosis given the fluid/mucosla thickening in the left mastoid air cells.
On the post-contrast images, there is no obvious focus of abnormal enhancement in the brain.
Within these limitations, no obvious acute infarction or mass effect.
No focus of abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma to suggest a mass lesion.
Slightly increased signal in the left transverse sinus on the T1 and FLAIR sequences may relate to slow flow/thrombosis.
However, this can be better assessed with MRV without contrast to exclude thrombosis given the fluid/mucosla thickening in the left mastoid air cells and h/o macroglobulinemia per Careweb notes.
# Neurophysiology Report EMG Study ([**2125-2-16**]): FINDINGS: Left median motor nerve conduction study showed moderately prolonged distal latency and severely reduced distal response amplitude.
A median motor response from the antecubital fossa was unobtainable, possibly due to edema and insufficient stimulation intensity.
F-response minimum latency was normal.
Left tibial motor nerve conduction study showed normal distal latency and mildly reduced response amplitude.
F-response minimum latency was mildly prolonged.
Left ulnar sensory nerve response amplitude was moderately reduced and conduction velocity was normal.
High frequency (50 Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation of the left ulnar nerve recording abductor digiti minimi did not result in an increased motor response amplitude.
Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the left first dorsal interosseous, deltoid, and extensor digitorum communis showed small amplitude, short duration motor unit potentials, poor activation, and moderate-to-severe active denervation.
EMG of the left biceps and abductor pollicis brevis showed no motor unit activity and moderate active denervation.
In this clinical context, the patient's electrophysiologic findings are most consistent with critical illness myopathy; however, other myopathic conditions cannot be definitely excluded.
In addition, the poor activation observed on needle electromyography is suggestive of superimposed central dysfunction.
# MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-2-16**] at 10:24 PM): FINDINGS: From C2-3 to T3-4 level, there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies and discs to indicate discitis or osteomyelitis.
No evidence of prevertebral fluid collection or intraspinal fluid collection seen.
Mild degenerative disc disease is seen.
The T1 and T2 vertebral bodies demonstrate small superior endplate defects anteriorly likely a Schmorl's node with sclerosis.
No spinal stenosis or extrinsic spinal cord compression seen.
No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Cervical spine MRI obtained without contrast demonstrates no evidence of intraspinal or paravertebral fluid collection or abscess.
No evidence of spinal cord compression or abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
No spinal stenosis.
The review of the previous MRI of the brain demonstrates no evidence of filling defect on post-gadolinium images.
No evidence of dural sinus thrombosis.
# LIVER AND GALLBLADDER US ([**2125-2-27**] at 7:49 AM): Normal liver echotexture without focal liver lesion.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
No evidence for choledocholithiasis.
Trace of perihepatic ascites is noted.
The gallbladder is only minimally distended.
There is minimal gallbladder wall thickening with some pericholecystic fluid; however, these findings are expected in the presence of ascites.
There is trace of fluid identified in the right and left lower quadrant, which is not large enough for either a diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis at this time.
Minimal trace of ascites, not sufficient for diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation, stable dilatation of the common bile duct measuring 8 mm with no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Sludge noted within the gallbladder with mild edematous gallbladder wall as expected with ascites.
Splenomegaly with multiple peripheral splenic infarcts.
No evidence of biliary dilatation.
Cirrhosis with established portal hypertension.
EEG [**2125-3-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a poorly organized mixed theta and delta frequency background which represents a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
It is also abnormal due to the presence of occasional left temporal and parietal sharp waves which may represent potentially epileptogenic cortex.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 54-year-old woman with a history of polysubstance abuse, HCV + cirrhosis and lymphoma who was transferred intubated and ventilated from OSH following treatment for septic shock [**1-24**] secondary MSSA pneumonia, passed away on [**3-11**] from liver failure and sepsis.
# Sepsis: She was initially admitted to an OSH and had a multifocal MSSA pneumonia.
Her hypotension was secondary to severe sepsis and was intially treated with fluid boluses and pressors which were eventually weaned.
Mini-BAL respiratory cultures colected on [**2125-2-11**] grew Stenotrophomonas, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Her liver function continued to deteriorate (see below) and so liver recommended starting vancomycin and zosyn [**2125-3-7**] in the setting of her continued deterioration from a hepatic stand point, which was done.
However, patient did not appear to be infected, was not spiking fevers, but WBC began to trend upwards as pt clinically deteriorated.
Patient grew psuedomonas from [**3-6**] sputum Cx, which was reported back with sensitivities on [**3-8**].
Patient had already decompensated severely from a hepatic standpoint, and was therefore made CMO on [**3-9**].
# Respiratory failure: Initially due to septic shock and multifocal pneumonia with hypoxemia from her pneumonia and some degree of fluid overload from resuscitation.
The patient also had persistent tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis.
These improved with treatment of her pneumonia and with subsequent diuresis for her fluid overload.
She had severe weakness that caused her difficulty clearing secretions, but was maintaining her sats in the mid to high 90s on shovel mask.
On [**2125-2-23**], she developed bleeding from an unclear location in her nasopharynx or hypopharynx, and required reintubation for airway protection given her difficulty clearing secretions.
# Liver failure: Patient has a history of hepatitis C, and recent abdominal imaging showed ascites, splenomegaly, and varices suggesting significant portal hypertension.
On admission, low synthetic function was evidenced by low albumin and elevated INR.
Elevated direct bilirubin and AST/ALT were worked up with MRCP, which showed cholecystolithiasis and sludge but no evidence of biliary dilation or  inflammation, and thus were attributed to worsening severe end-stage liver disease.
Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely also due to cirrhosis and hypersplenism.
She was followed by the liver team and treated with Lactulose and Rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
Patient had lactulose increased throughout her liver failure course with no improvement in sx of mental status.
She became encephalopathic as her LFTs worsened, and she passed away on [**3-11**] after becoming CMO and going into asystole.
?s lipase and amylase were very elevated on [**2-28**], but lipase trending down, amylase trending up.
When patient was put on Passe-Muir valve, she was able to verbalize only some very mild abdominal pain despite having been on aggressive lasix diuresis and getting tube feedings.
Therefore, we controlled her pain with 5mg oxycodone Q4H PRN and continued to monitor her amylase and lipase, which peaked on [**3-7**], and then trended down.
There was concern for critical illness myoneuropathy, and EMG was consistent with critical illness myopathy.
Her CK was noted to be very elevated on [**2-27**] to 1827, and then trended down afterwards.
This was thought to be secondary to muscle damage from ICU myopathy.
Hepatic encephalopathy was treated as above.
# Seizure: Patient had a tonic seizure in early afternoon of [**2125-2-17**], with fixed left gaze and flaccid extremities.
No electrolyte abnormalities were evident.
Seen by Neuro and considered to be likely toxic/metabolic (benzodiazepine withdrawal or liver disease) versus new CNS infection (less likely).
Of note, her benzos (Midazolam) had been stopped on [**2125-2-14**], and the timing fit with a benzo withdrawal state.
EEG showed "abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of a disorganized [**5-29**] Hz theta rhythm background with absence of normal sleep architecture.
Together these patterns are consistent with a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy, commonly seen with medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection.
There were no electrographic seizures seen."
Neuro consulted and determined that the seizure was most likely caused by benzo withdrawal even though patient had not had any benzos since [**2-25**] or by metabolic abnormalities.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Her creatinine was 1.5 on admission with a FENa of 0.44% suggestive of pre-renal failure.
After resuscitation, she became grossly edematous and tolerated aggressive diuresis initially.
She remained edematous and had a bump in her creatinine from 1.0 to 1.3 to 1.7, peaking on [**2125-2-22**].
Given her poor synthetic function and liver failure, she was given Albumin (25%) 50 grams total on [**2125-2-22**] in an attempt to increase oncotic pressure to mobilize edematous fluid.
