The dissection does not extend into the mesenteric, renal, or internal iliac arteries.
Calcifications and possible stenosis at the celiac artery origin are noted with a widely patent celiac artery just beyond the origin.
There is decreased perfusion of the right kidney relative to the left kidney, although the right renal artery originates from the true lumen.
The intramural hematoma at the level of the aortic arch is stable.
Dissection is stable since [**2171-4-16**] with no evidence of extension.
Decreased perfusion of the right kidney relative to the left kidney, although the right renal artery originates from the true lumen and is patent.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis are new from [**2171-4-16**].
On HD 3, patient had worsening abdominal pain and nausea in the morning.
