Admission Date:  [**2157-12-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-12-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2134-4-24**]     Sex:  M  Service:Neurosurgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 23 year-old high school teacher had a major seizure in [**2157-6-29**].
His MR scan with gadolinium showed a 2 by 2 cm left medial temporal lobe cystic lobulated lesion with enhancing solid components.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He does not use tobacco or alcohol.
ALLERGIES:  He had rashes from aspirin and Motrin.
He had anaphylaxis and rash with Penicillin.
His neck was supple with no adenopathy.
No thyromegaly.
His abdominal examination showed no organomegaly.
No masses or tenderness.
His neurological examination showed a slight left facial asymmetry.
His postop CBC showed an elevated white count, which came down over the period of three days.
He had increasing naming difficulties over the second and then third postoperative day and had marked expressive aphasia by the afternoon on the third postop day.
However, he seemed to be improving by the fourth postoperative day, but then was having very intermittent periods of almost normal speech and severe speech deficits particularly with naming and having problems with orientation.
A CT scan showed no evidence of mass effect from swelling or hemorrhage and an excellent result of removal of all of the area of tumor.
The EEG showed some slowing, but showed no evidence of seizure activity.
However, it was thought that he probably was having intermittent seizure activity in the area of the removal and posterior to the removal and so his Trileptal was increased to 600 mg twice a day.
Following that he had no further problems with increased speech deficit.
