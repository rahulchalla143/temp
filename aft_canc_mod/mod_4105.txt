Admission Date:  [**2126-1-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-4-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-8-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Mental status changes and increased oral secretion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Liver biopsy  History of Present Illness: 76 year-old male with hx of traumatic brain injury with bilateral SDH and R MCA stroke in [**10-4**] after being on coumadin, hx of multi-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia, MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia, VRE bactremia, s/p tracheostomy and PEG [**10-29**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with fever of 101.6, mental status changes, and increasing oral secretions.
She also states that the respiratory therapy at Rehab noted increasing secretions and thickening of secretions over the last 2-3 days.

Several small areas of increased attenuation seen within the left parietal subdural hematoma which were not present on the most recent prior study.
The size of the parietal subdural hematoma is essentially unchanged measuring approximately 11 mm in greatest dimension.
The tiny left frontal subdural hematoma is stable in appearance.
Encephalomalacic changes throughout the brain are stable.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are stable with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Opacification is seen within the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and bilateral mastoid air cells.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: Initially he finished 2 weeks course of Meropenem/Ampicillin for VRE and bacteremia and ESBL Klebsiella PNA.
Pt also noted to have ulcers of L knee, heel, decubitous.
Pt with episode of questionable seizure on [**1-21**].
EEG done on [**1-21**] with abnormal focal sezire from L parasagittal area.
His hospital course was complicated by multiple trips to the ICU for likely sepsis from either aspiration pneumonia and cellulitis/osteo.
Pt was stable until he became febrile on [**3-11**] and meropenem re-started.
Pt had a witnessed aspiration on [**3-12**].
On [**3-13**], Vanc re-started for persistent fever.
Stool was + for C.diff and Flagyl was started.
Pt also noted to have transaminitis, ultrasound showing hypoechoic lesions, and following abdominal CT showed multiple liver lesions.
The lesion was biopsied and the pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
The following day, he got abd CT which showed small pericapsular hematoma but not big enough to account for the hypotension.
He was clinically stable until [**4-5**] when he had another episode of fever and hypotension, so Vanc/meropenem were re-started and IVF given to maintain his BP.
He again remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable until [**4-23**].
At that time he spiked fever, blood, urine sent for culture and chest x-ray obtained.
Chest x-ray with no change/evidence of infiltrate.
Patient needs imipenem or meropenam given history of pseudomonas.
He had few episodes of urethal bleed when attempted to remove the foley in early [**Month (only) 958**].
Plan is to keep foley in place given significant clots/bleeding and difficulty in re-placing a new catheter and to minimize patient's suffering.
Again trasferred to Unit [**2-18**] for hypotension which responded to fluids and transfusion.
Finished course of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella on [**2126-3-2**].
It was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia, however also considered cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.
Hypotension resolved but did require periodic NS boluses over [**Date range (1) 15001**] weekend again.
Knee ulcer (as below) c/w polymicrobial contamination without radiographic signs of osteomyelitis.
Recurrent aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis also is a risk fact for recurrent infection.
On [**3-20**] became hypotensive to 40/P and was febrile with temp of 103, so cx'd again x 2 with mycolytics and given 4 L NS and total of 2 u. PRBC overnight.
perf (s/p liver bx and possible primary colon ca as risk factors) some mild peri-hepatic hematoma with small amount of blood tracking down to pelvis but insufficient to explain the degree of hypotension.
Upright CXR showed no free air below diaphragm.
Flagyl for two weeks beyond meropenem course for history of c. diff.
B) knee--seen by plastics, chemical debridement and wet-to-dry dressings with duoderm dressing changed daily; daily wet-to-dry dressings, no pressure on knee.
Liver mets: Patient was found to have transaminitis and RUQ u/s showed liver mass c/w abscess.
CT +/- showed multiple enhancing hypodense masses c/w metastatic disease or abscesses.
Pt received diagnostic liver biopsy on [**3-18**] consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Considering colon ca as a possible primary.
EEG showing abnormal epileptiform waves, likely from the SDH and R MCA stroke.
Dilantin was started for seizure prophylaxis.
MS did not return to previous baseline after treatment of multiple infections and resolution of subclinical seizures.
Repeat EEG showed no evidence of seizure while on dilantin.
Will need to continue to have dilantin levels checked.
At this time patient awakens to voice or direct stimulation.
Transfusion dependent.
Patient presented with zoster lesions which eventually healed.
Felt likely due to cerebral insults.
No intervention at this time.
Px: PPI, (unable to tolerate pneumoboots secondary to skin breakdown), has IVC filter, continue zinc and vit c, collagenase for ulcers.
Please note, care has been modified to accomodate wishes of wife and to limit's patient's pain and suffering.
For example, maintenance of foley catheter is needed for history of urethral clots/bleeding but optimally it would be changed with current UTI.
Given that other sources of infection identified and to limit pain/procedures in this patient with grave prognosis, have maintained line.
