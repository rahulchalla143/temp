Admission Date:  [**2117-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-9-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin Analogues / IV Dye, Iodine Containing / Ace Inhibitors / Benadryl  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: fever, respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Already intubated on transfer from OSH A line Esophageal balloon  History of Present Illness: 47-year old patient of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a 15-year history of Hodgkin's Disease, previously treated with chemotherapy complicated by bleomycin lung and two allogenic bone marrow transplants (2 and 6 years ago) complicated by heart failure and radiation fibrosis who presents as a transfer from an outside hospital after being intubated in the setting of a bleed during a bronchoscopy with subsequent development of ARDS.
Patient was in usual state of health until this past [**Month (only) **] when she presented to clinic with a fever and cough.
A sputum culture from [**12-25**] was noted to have sparce growth of aspirgillus fumigatus and terreus.
On [**1-25**], she presented to [**Hospital **] Medical Center with worsening fevers and shakiness for 48 hours.
Chest imaging showed what was felt to be worsening of her infiltrate (although it is unclear what this was compared to) and pneumonitis.
They performed a bronchoscopy on [**2117-1-26**] which was complicated by an extensive bleed leading to intubation.
She later developed ARDS and was started on IV steroids and pressors.
She developed worsening hypercarbia on [**2-9**] and underwent a workup for embolic disease.
A CTA was negative for PE but showed b/l pleural effusions R>L and a new left upper lung nodule of 1.4cm.
In addition, diffuse ground glass opacities are present.
A right gastrognemius thrombus and a left cephalic thrombus was found.
An MRI of the brain showed a new left parietal lobe infarcation.
A CT also showed old infarction.
A pigtail catheter drainage of R chest loculated effusion was planned for [**2-11**] but was not done.
Urinary incontinence 7.
46 yo female with a long history of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease, s/p autologous SCT [**2101**], s/p sibling donor allogenic transplant [**2110**], and s/p unrelated allogenic SCT with D 0 on [**2115-9-20**].
Her post transplant course was notable for "serum sickness" thought related to ATG with fevers, rash, and joint pains.
She had a relatively uncomplicated post-transplant course until she developed CMV viremia with CMV viral load on [**2115-9-30**] noted at 4000.
She developed a macular papular rash and was seen by Dermatology on [**2115-11-13**].
Biopsy was consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction, possibly related to Foscarnet or Bactrim.
She also was treated for a short period of time with Keflex for possible infected SK on her hand.
Subsequent EBV viral loads were < 8 and CT of the neck showed decreasing adenopathy.
Bone marrow biopsy was negative for lymphoma.
- Recurred in [**4-/2103**] with minimal disease and went to autologous transplant in 4/[**2103**].
- s/p nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor on [**2110-5-8**] with evidence for recurrent disease.
- Evidence for disease recurrence in [**8-/2111**] and status post four weeks of Rituxan, last given on [**2111-10-7**], supported with Leukine injections.
- Evidence for recurrent disease while on protocol and status post two cycles of Navelbine and gemcitabine.
- Evidence for recurrent disease in [**1-/2113**] and status post single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Velcade starting in [**1-/2113**] given for two cycles, however, complicated by fevers and abdominal pain requiring admission at [**Hospital **] Medical Center.
- Noted for progressive disease in [**2114-4-7**] and now s/p 2 cycles of Gemzar/Navelbine in [**Month (only) 547**]/[**2114-6-7**] with C2D8 on [**2114-6-20**].
- Plan to move forward with two more cycles of Gemzar/Naveline but developed fever, shortness of breath and increasing white count requiring admission in NY and then follow up admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed infection.
- Treated for PCP infection with IV Bactrim and currently on Bactrim prophylaxis.
- Persistent elevation in white blood count with increased abdominal adenopathy and began treatment with Methotrexate for two doses with minimal response.
- Plan had been to move forward with possible allogeneic transplant from an unrelated donor but noted for progression of disease in cervical adenopathy and abdominal areas with increasing white count and fevers.
She had initial response after two cycles with normalization of white count and resolution of cervical adenopathy but this grew again, and she received the 3rd cycle of DHAP.
She received a 4th cycle of DHAP on [**2115-8-5**] for further treatment while undergoing workup for allogeneic transplant.
- Received dose of Velban on [**2115-8-30**] due to increased white count and to temporize her disease prior to her admission.

Compared to the previous tracing there is no change.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Very mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
These revealed no evidence of intracardiac shunt.
There was trace late contrast in the left ventricle consistent with a probable slight pulmonary arteriovenous shunt.
Moderate right pleural effusion and large areas of consolidation in both lungs are new since a year ago.
Whether this is multifocal pneumonia or pulmonary edema is radiographically indeterminate.
ET tube ends just above the upper margin of the clavicles, but only 2 cm above optimal placement due to shortening of the tracheal length because of marked pulmonary radiation fibrosis.
Large calcified lymph nodes are treated lymphoma.
No pneumothorax.
The purpose of this device is unclear: temperature probe ?
There is no significant interval change in bibasal consolidations, bilateral pleural effusions, partially loculated on the left and mediastinal calcified lesion representing post-treatment changes of lymphoma.
There is wall-to-wall flow and normal compressibility in the left jugular vein.
Wall-to-wall flow is seen in the left subclavian vein.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal scan due to positioning; patient unable to cooperate.
No convincing evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-15**] 4:37 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-12**] through 9:  The improvement in widespread pulmonary opacification between [**2-13**] and 9 has stabilized.
While this may have been due to edema, the residual consolidation raises a possibility of multifocal pneumonia.
Moderate right pleural effusion is stable.
A left subclavian infusion port ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction and right internal jugular line in the upper SVC.
The small left and moderate right pleural effusions are unchanged.
There is unchanged right pleural thickening or loculated effusion.
There is no significant overall change in the appearance of the bilateral lung opacities, consistent with edema versus multifocal pneumonia.
The bulky hilar and mediastinal calcified lymphadenopathy is unchanged.
Persistent bilateral lung opacities, consistent with edema and/or multifocal pneumonia.
Unchanged small left and moderate right pleural effusions.
Possible loculated component of right effusion.
There is a segmental occlusive echogenic thrombus in the right posterior tibial vein, which does not extend proximally.
There is no left-sided deep vein thrombosis.
Occlusive segmental deep vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein, without proximal extension to other deep veins.
No left-sided DVT.
The small left and moderate right pleural effusions are unchanged.
Possible loculated component of right effusion and/or pleural thickening is unchanged.
There is no significant change in the appearance of the bilateral lung opacities, consistent with edema versus multifocal pneumonia.
Mediastinal and hilar calcified lymphadenopathy is unchanged.
Persistent bilateral lung opacities, consistent with edema and/or multifocal pneumonia.
Unchanged small left and moderate right pleural effusions.
Possible loculated component of right effusion.
A larger bore tube remains in place, possibly representing a feeding tube, and has been advanced further into the stomach since the prior radiograph.
With the exception of the change in tube positions, the appearance of the chest is relatively similar compared to the prior study of earlier the same date except for slight worsening of diffuse pulmonary opacities.
Widespread pulmonary opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left, appears slightly improved in the interval.
Extensive calcified lymphadenopathy and upper lobe volume loss with associated pleural and parenchymal scarring are again demonstrated as well as a moderate-sized partially loculated right pleural effusion superimposed upon pleural thickening.
Extensive parenchymal opacities are unchanged as well.
Large mediastinal calcifications are re-demonstrated.
There is no change in multifocal opacities and loculated bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusion, right more than left.
Multifocal pulmonary opacities and bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right, persist.
IMPRESSION: Removal of right internal jugular catheter.
Multifocal opacities are again noted, probably little changed since the prior chest x-ray, allowing for differences in penetration.
The interval change might be remission of edema, and the large scale consolidation could be multifocal pneumonia or a non-recoverable component of edema such as ARDS.
The moderate right pleural effusion which has been present since admission is unchanged.
An infusion port ends in the low SVC, nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and a tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 17914**] is a 47 year old woman with refractory Hodgkin's disease s/p autologous and two allogenic transplants presenting with respiratory failure from an OSH after BAL and airway hemorrhage.
# Respiratory Failure: Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Etiology: ARDS in setting of likely infection after hemorrhagic bleed during bronchoscopy in woman with poor underlying respiratory status due to previous radiation/chemotherapy vs aggressive Hodgkins recurrence.
Per neurology and neuroradiology imaging consistent with embolic events.
TTE with bubble ordered which revealed no evidence of intracardiac shunt.
No convincing evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity on repeat imaging.
Lower extremity study revealed occlusive segmental deep vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein, without proximal extension to other deep veins.
No left-sided DVT.
