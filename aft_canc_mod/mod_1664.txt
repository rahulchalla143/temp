Admission Date:  [**2144-3-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2144-3-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-2-5**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital 11212**] [**Hospital6 733**] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  (Per admitting Intensive Care Unit intern)  Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 36-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer to subcutaneous tissue, lung, liver, bone, and brain who presented from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for bile leak, status post cholecystectomy for a perforated gallbladder.
On the evening of [**2144-2-25**], the patient developed the acute onset of epigastric pain and presented to [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital on [**2144-2-26**]; where she was found to have an acute abdomen.
Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have free bilious fluid in the abdomen as well as adhesions of omentum to the posterior surface of the gallbladder, through which the bile was leaking.
There was no obvious gallbladder metastases.
However, there was a large palpable mass in the retroperitoneum (felt to be either pancreatic mass versus retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy).
Thus, a biopsy of a liver metastases was obtained.
There were no intraoperative cholangiogram.
There was no obvious indication of biliary obstruction; though, a right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2-27**] revealed 3.6-cm dilatation of the common bile duct, as well as dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts.
Postoperatively, the patient complained of shortness of breath.
A chest x-ray revealed total opacification of her left lung and was felt to represent infiltrates plus effusion.
The patient's left-sided pleural effusion was drained by thoracentesis; the fluid from which was found to be exudative.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denied a history of lower extremity edema, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and chills.
Metastatic breast cancer; diagnosed approximately two years ago.
No wall motion abnormalities were found.
There was some mild pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient worked for [**Doctor Last Name **] Elevator Company.
In general, awake, alert, comfortable, in no acute distress.
Mild scleral icterus.
No oral lesions.
Lungs revealed decreased breath sounds one third of the way up the left lung base with dullness to percussion.
No wheezes or crackles.
Abdomen was soft, mildly tenderness to palpation along the incision site.
No rebound or guarding.
Positive vertical incision, no erythema.
Extremities revealed no edema.
Pleural fluid analysis from the outside hospital reportedly revealed Gram stain negative.
Ultrasound performed on [**2144-2-27**] (at the outside hospital) reportedly revealed massive dilatation of the common bile duct (3.5 cm), with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct.
The pancreatic head and structures were not well visualized.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit course was notable for decreased urine output which responded to intravenous boluses.
Also, the patient was mildly tachycardic with oxygen saturations to 88% on room air.
These difficulties resolved over [**2144-3-3**]; and, later that day, the patient was called out to the Medicine floor, where she was transferred to the [**Hospital6 733**] Medicine Firm.
This revealed massive common bile duct dilatation with distal common bile duct obstruction.
Previous cholecystectomy with a leak through the cystic stump was noted.
Due to its exudative nature, and the patient's diagnosis, it was felt that the patient's pleural effusions would continue to recurrent despite any efforts at repeated thoracenteses.
However, at that time the patient wished to defer that option, as she was breathing well and without difficulty.
The patient was given a contact number for Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31343**] should she desire pleurodesis or other intervention in the future.
The patient's surgical sites and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site remained clean, dry, and intact, and without erythema or tenderness.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain collected approximately 300 cc of serosanguineous fluid on the day before discharge.
The patient's pain was well controlled on her intravenous patient-controlled analgesia.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Vital signs were stable, afebrile; very anxious for discharge.
Bile leak, status post ruptured gallbladder.
Metastatic breast cancer.
