HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, endstage liver disease, first diagnosed approximately 2 years prior to admission.
Recently the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] approximately 2 weeks prior to admission with right upper quadrant pain and headache and was found to have a distended gallbladder with stones.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  He denied any fevers, chills, rigors, upper respiratory infection symptoms, GI symptoms including diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, UTI symptoms or recent changes in headache or hematemesis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for endstage liver disease, hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, post traumatic stress disorder, depression, history of long QT, hypertension, grade 1 esophageal varices, endocarditis and poly substance abuse.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He is in no acute distress.
Abdomen appeared soft and nontender, and appeared distended.
No gross heme.
1+ pedal edema with sitting.
2+ lower extremity reflexes at knees.
Chest x-ray demonstrated no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Of note an echo on [**2106-12-30**] demonstrated an EF of greater that 55% with a patent foramen ovale.
A catheterization on [**2106-9-14**] demonstrated mild pulmonary hypertension.
PST's on [**2106-7-23**] demonstrated decreased diffusion capacity (isolated), ?
The patient was taken to the OR on [**3-1**] for orthotopic DCD liver transplant.
No complications occurred.
He was maintained on an insulin drop for hyperglycemia with blood sugars ranging to 143.
This demonstrated normal arterial, venous, and portal venous wave forms.
A tiny amount of ascites was noted on [**2107-3-1**].
Repeat chest x-ray was done that demonstrated satisfactory positioning of all lines and tubes without any pneumothorax and bibasilar atelectasis was noted with the left side greater than the right side.
On [**3-1**] he had pathology assessment of the native liver that demonstrated well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma 1 cm present in the right lobe.
A nodule of small cell dysplasia measuring 0.6 cm in diameter was present in the left lobe.
Iron stain demonstrated moderate iron deposition in hepatic sites and bile ducts.
It was recommended that the patient be evaluated to rule out iron overload disease.
The gallbladder appeared with mild autolytic changes and there was negative vascular and biliary margin.
A biopsy of the liver donor demonstrated predominantly macrovascular steatosis involving 20% of the liver parenchyma.
Bile duct hamartoma was noted with no significant inflammation.
Given the low platelet count, the HIT antibody was checked; this was subsequently found to be negative.
A chest x-ray demonstrated no overt evidence of CHF.
A repeat chest x-ray on [**2107-3-3**] demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis as well as discoid atelectasis in the right apical region.
Of note on [**2107-3-1**] the patient received intraop cardiac echo for evaluation of ASD/patent foramen ovale.
Conclusion demonstrated tiny atrial septal defect seen by color Doppler with minimal left to right flow.
It was noted that the left ventricle was grossly normal in function without significant wall motion abnormalities.
Aortic leaflet appeared structurally normal with leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation seen as well as 2+ moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
He also took oral pain medication in the form of Percocet for discomfort.
Psychiatry was called to discuss management of his history of depression and PTSD.
He did comment that his mood was somewhat depressed but he was given reassurance that the prednisone taper would help to alleviate some of this depressed mood.
