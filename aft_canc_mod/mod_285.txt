Admission Date:  [**2142-6-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-6-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-9-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] is a 77-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2108**], multiple transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the lungs, status post partial left nephrectomy and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion for the past four weeks.
He denied history of orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and reported no chest pain at the time.
He had diffuse rhonchi and crackles on his lung exam and evidence of volume overload on physical examination.
His chest x-ray demonstrated findings consistent with congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural effusion, bibasilar collapse, consolidation, and mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules, consistent with metastatic disease.
A repeat chest x-ray revealed worsening pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure.
Renal cell carcinoma.
Renal cell carcinoma was discovered during a work-up for abdominal pain in [**2135-5-30**], which revealed bilateral renal masses.
CT and MI scan revealed 3 cm mass in left upper pole and a 4 cm mass in upper right pole and patient is now status post left partial nephrectomy for cancer treatment as of [**2135-6-30**].
End stage renal disease.
Patient's end stage renal disease is likely secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as renal cell carcinoma status post left partial nephrectomy.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Patient is status post myocardial infarction in the [**2108**] and had recent chest pain in the past which has been worked up.
History of transient ischemic attack.
There has also been an episode where he became unresponsive with straining and extension of his right arm.
MI and MRA of the head showed small vessel disease and evidence for an old left-sided cerebral infarction.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Hemicolectomy for massive gastrointestinal bleed secondary to CMV colitis exacerbated by aspirin.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for renal cell carcinoma in both father and brother.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination in the Emergency Department, the patient was breathing heavily in mild distress in a bed.
No lesions in the oropharynx and upper dentures were noted.
No rhinorrhea was appreciated.
Pulmonary chest exam:  Rhonchi on expiration bilaterally with mild crackles, left greater than right.
heart exam: Regular, audible, but distant S1, S2, 1-2/6 systolic murmur heard loudest at the base, no rubs or gallops were appreciated.
Abdominal exam:  Nondistended, positive bowel sounds, soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Back exam:  No CVA tenderness bilaterally.
Extremity exam: [**11-30**]+ pitting peripheral edema, especially in the lower extremities.
AV fistula noted in the left upper extremity with good thrill.
Dermatology exam:  Very mild psoriatic rash on scalp, face and extensor surfaces.
His first chest x-ray revealed findings consistent with previous heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar collapsing consolidation in mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules consistent with metastases.
The patient also had an electrocardiogram done which showed no acute changes from previous studies.
There were still signs of left ventricular hypertrophy strain, but otherwise, no clear evidence for myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram on [**6-12**] demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55% and a small right to left intracardiac shunt, most likely consistent with atrial septal defect.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was noted, but there was preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
There was mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.
Shortness of breath:  The patient was transferred to the floor on the day of admission for further care and management, however, after a couple hours, he complained of increased dyspnea on exertion and had an oxygen saturation of approximately 80% on 100% nonrebreather with systolic blood pressure in the 160s.
At admission, he was ruled out for PE with CT angiogram.
He received hemodialysis on [**2142-6-12**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**] and had three liters of fluid removed with significant improvement of his shortness of breath, but still complained of productive green-yellow cough.
Given his rapid improvement, the patient was transferred to the floor on [**2142-6-13**] with further management.
However, three hours into the session, the patient experienced a dull pressure type of chest pain with no radiation, however, it resolved with oral nitroglycerin and morphine.
The chest pain only lasted a few minutes and there was no recurrence of chest pain throughout the hospital course.
His most recent echocardiogram was otherwise normal except for a mild right to left shunt atrial septal defect and his latest electrocardiogram indicated a possible new T wave inversion, however, Cardiology Consult was requested and the evaluation indicated no evidence of myocardial infarction or acute myocardial ischemia process, instead, they felt the electrocardiogram was consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy strain patterns.
Patient's shortness of breath continued to improve to the point where his oxygen saturation on room air was 92%.
He did complain of a dull pressure like substernal chest pain on the 17th after three hours of hemodialysis.
He has had episodes of chest pain in the past during hemodialysis as per Dr.[**Name (NI) 129**] notes.
His troponin T was in the low 0.20 range, however, this has been his consistent levels throughout this hospital course with no acute rises throughout this admission.
His electrocardiogram was consistent with a left ventricular hypertrophy pattern, but showed no acute evidence of acute myocardial infarction or process.
End stage renal disease:  The patient most likely presented due to volume overload secondary to end stage renal disease.
Hemodialysis sessions were done twice with total removal of approximately 6.6 kg of fluid.
It seems that he may not have had sufficient fluid removal in the past, therefore, we aggressively tested his lowest possible dry weight as tolerated and it seems that he may need to have a new setting for his optimal dry weight given his recent weight loss secondary to his metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Chronic renal failure.
Congestive heart failure.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He will also call his primary care physician or return to the hospital if he has any new symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.
