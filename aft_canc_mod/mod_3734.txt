Admission Date:  [**2149-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-10-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-10-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10644**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VP shunt  History of Present Illness:    62 yo female with a history of metastatic melanoma to liver and lungs with unknown primary on weekly taxol(last dose 11/8) who presented with nausea and vomiting for the past 6 days and increasing confusion for the past 2 days per her husband.
Pt complained of severe frontal headache as well as some mild neck stiffness w/o photophobia.
She also complained of diffuse abdominal pain which she said had been present since last [**Month (only) 547**].
CT head was negative and MRI showed question of leptomeningeal enhancement.
LP performed for hx concerning for meningitis which revealed xanthocromia with fourth tube with 35 wbc(2 neuts, 45 lymphs, 6 monos, 33% atypicals), and 356 RBC's with protein >583 and glucose 28.
Pt started on Acyclovir for herpes encephalitis, but leptomeningeal spread of melanoma was higher on the differential.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hydrocephalus, as demonstrated by LP and CT/MRI, secondary to leptomeningeal spread of her metastatic melanoma.
Pt seen by neurosurgery for placement of ventricular drain at bed side for a communicating hydrocephalus with functional obstruction by atypical cells.
Melanoma- dx on [**11-24**] due to elvated LFT with bx consistent w/melanoma began biochemotherapy [**2149-5-12**] but not tolerated due to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, changed to cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine started recently on weekly taxol 2.
Hypothyroidism 3.
HTN 6. diverticulitis 7. tubal ligation   Physical Exam: VS: HR: 61 BP: 118/43 RR: 12 SaO2: 95% Pain: 0/10 -Gen: pt is a well nutritioned pale women with significant alopecia.
-HEENT: pupils are 2mm bilaterally and due to their small size, difficult to assess for reactivitiy -CV: RRR, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops -Chest: CTA bilaterally -Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS+ (s/p morphine prior to CT scan) -Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis, edema .
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
No overt mass is seen.
This study, however, cannot excluded metastatic disease.
Further evaluation with contrast enhanced MRI may be performed to exclude metastatic disease.
Ventricular dilatation out of proportion to the degree of focal atrophy.
Prominent ventricular system including the temporal horns.
This may represent early hydrocephalus.
This is seen in association with high signal in the periventricular white matter, consistent with trans- ependimal CSF flow.
No obstructing lesions are identified.
No enhancing lesions are identified."
Melanoma-Leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with atypical cells in CSF were concerning for metastatic melanoma.
Cells sent for cytology and revealed melanoma cells.
The pt received 2 doses of intrathecal thiotepa with poor response and it was decided at that point she would be made [**First Name3 (LF) 3225**].
Headache-headache, nuchal rigidity, and xanthocromia and lymphocytic predominance on LP was concerning for HSV.
CT findings of enlarged ventricles suggested NPH and this was confirmed by response to serial LP's as above.
NPH due to blockage of CSF circulatory system due to leptomengial spread of melanoma.
Abdominal pain-Pt with elevated alk phos but actually lower than pt baseline.
Pain appears to be longstanding and she has no fever to suggest infection.
Morphine contributed to urinary retention as seen in high PVR so foley placed.
HTN-cont on her oupatient atenolol dose and HTN was well controlled.
Morphine sulfate 2-4mg IV/SC Q4hours PRN pain 11.
Morphine Sulfate 8 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 1-5 mg Injection q2h as needed for pain uncontrolled by acetaminophen.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: hospice or [**Location (un) 5089**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Leptomeningeal spread of melanoma   Discharge Condition: Comfortable  Discharge Instructions: You will be taken care of by a specialized staff at the facility which you are being transferred to who will make sure that you are comfortable.
