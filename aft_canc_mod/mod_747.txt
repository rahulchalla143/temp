Large mass arising from the third portion of the duodenum with cystic and solid components has increased in size since the prior exam.
In addition, there is new stranding around the mass and stranding extending into the paracolic gutters bilaterally, right greater than left.
The appearance is suspicious for new hemorrhage into the mass.

EGD biopsy of submucosal duodenal mass: nondiagnostic  CT-guided bx: nondiagnostic, blood only  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19314**] is a 76 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer treated with Femara and Megace, with known duodenal and liver masses, who presented with abdominal pain/bloating, and CT showed increased size of duodenal mass with hemorrhagic appearance.
On hospital day two she had new onset more severe abdominal pain and was admitted to the surgical service, however pain resolved, and she was not deemed to have a surgical abdomen.
EGD was undertaken to perform biopsy of the submucosal duodenal mass, which was nondiagnostic.
DIfferential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal stromal tumor, metastatic breast cancer, versus other malignancy.
Her abdominal pain was well controlled with 5-10 mg of liquid oxycodone every 6 hours.
She was found to have increasing edema and shortness of breath responsive to lasix with oxygen saturations in the low 90s on room air.
She was believed to be retianing water secondary to her megace, which was subsequently discontinued.
Towards the end of her stay her subjective dyspnea did not correlate to any decrease in oxygen saturation and her ambulatory sat was consistently 94%.
Urine culture was pending at the time of discharge but has since returned consistent with contamination.
We avoided heparin products given the patient's history of HIT and kept the patient on pneumoboots.
