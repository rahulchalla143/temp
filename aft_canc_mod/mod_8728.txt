Past Medical History: - Atrial fibrillation: off coumadin secondary to epistaxis - [**Date range (3) **] sinus syndrome: temporary pacer placed during [**11-20**] admission, was to return for permanent [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] placement, which was again deferred during [**1-21**] admission secondary to medical illness - hx of VT with torsades morphology in [**3-22**], was on amiodarone, recently stopped for hypothyroidism - Aortic stenosis-> echo [**8-22**] showing peak gradient 76 mm Hg.
- CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**1-21**] and [**2-19**] s/p ballooning of LAD - diasolic CHF (EF 70%) - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Chronic venous stasis - Squamous cell carcinoma: right medial calf, s/p excision [**11-20**], positive margins on 1st and 2nd excision attempts, needs XRT to area 6 weeks after the wound heals.
- UTI - rectal ulcers: possibly from constipation and straining - History of C diff colitis - Anemia: from blood loss after GI bleed - Urge incontinence - Depression - Colon adenoma in [**2141**]: last colonoscopy in [**2143**], no polyps - s/p hysterectomy - Hypothyroidism   Social History: Currently living in Chestnut park [**Doctor Last Name **].
Sclera anicteric.
Neck: Supple w/o JVD CV: RRR, nl s1, s2, III/VI SEM at apex Chest: mod bibasilar crackles 1/4 up lung fields, no labored breathing Abd: soft, ND, NT, no HSM, no tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
CXR [**3-22**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent opacity in the retrocardiac left lower lobe has the appearance of atelectasis.
Small left-sided pleural effusion.
CXr [**3-23**]: In comparison with study of [**3-22**], there is diffuse perihilar haziness extending out toward the periphery, consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
Substantial left pleural effusion persists, and there has been development of a right-sided effusion as well.
The retrocardiac opacification consistent with atelectasis or effusion is again noted.
CXR [**3-29**]: Dense opacity at the left lung base has increased, now completely obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with effusion.
Increased opacity in the retrocardiac region is consistent with atelectasis given increased leftward shift of the mediastinum.
There is a rightward curvature of the upper lumbar spine representing either scoliosis or positional factors given recent comparisons do not include this region.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated but quite elongated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.4 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Initial angiography in this left-dominant circulation revealed the following:Left coronary artery with diffuse moderate calcification.
LM minimal luminal irregularity.
Otherwise, the LAD had mild diffuse luminal irregularity.
There was a peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve of 70mm Hg which improved s/p valvuloplasty to 36mm hg.
Our pigtail catheter was inserted into the LV and pressures measured as above, confirming critical aortic stenosis.
Final pressure showed a reduction in the peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve to 36mm Hg.
Critical aortic stenosis 3.
Successful aortic valvuloplasty   Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted with chest pain.
However by admission, chest pain had resolved with SL nitroglycerin x 2.
No ischemic ECG changes noted.
That evening, she developed respiratory distress and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure.
She had severely labored breathing, extensive rales and pulmonary edema on CXR.
Overnight, her respiratory status improved with decreased hypoxia, less labored breathing and improved mental status.
In the setting of chronic low BP which had been labile in the past, she was kept in the ICU on a gentle lasix drip.
Given her recent admission with CHF and her tenous fluid status, she was evaluated for AVR and valvuloplasty.
She underwent cardiac catheterization and valvuloplasty successfully without complication and with decrease in peak gradient from 70 mmHg to 36mm Hg.
She had a brief episode of chest pain two days later which was determined not to be cardiac with rapid resolution with tylenol, unchanged EKG and negative cardiac enzymes.
On discharge, her breathing was unlabored, but she continued to have mod rales and an O2 requirement (98% 4LNC).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Aortic stenosis Secondary Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Your chest pain had improved by the time you were admitted.
Your labs showed that you did not have a heart attack.
If you have any of the following symptoms, you should return to the ED or call your PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain, difficulty breathing, palpitations, fevers, chills or any other serious concerns.
