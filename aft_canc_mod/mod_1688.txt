She had a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and diastolic congestive heart failure.
She initially presented to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital on [**8-1**] with worsening shortness of breath, weight gain, and peripheral edema, which had progressed over weeks.
A subsequent workup revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.
She was noted to have a left-sided pleural effusion as well as an adrenal mass.
CA125 was also markedly elevated at 1634.
A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an abnormal-appearing right adnexal structure.
A diagnosed thoracentesis was also performed which showed an exudate with abundant large atypical lymphocytes; suspicious for lymphoma.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 17 years, complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy.
Coronary artery disease; status post multiple cardiac catheterizations showing severe 2-vessel coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post right carotid endarterectomy in [**2115**].
Diastolic congestive heart failure with echocardiogram in [**2117-12-6**] showing an ejection fraction of 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
No history of tobacco or alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes in her mother and father.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed an obese, Caucasian female, in moderate respiratory distress, temperature was 99, blood pressure was 140/80, pulse was 78, respiratory rate was 26, SpO2 was 97% on 4 liters, weight was 101.8 kg.
No oral lesions were noted.
Lungs revealed absent breath sounds at the bases with dullness to percussion.
Heart sounds were distant, a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities.
Urinalysis showed 2 hyaline casts with some granular casts.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, revealing extrinsic compression of the left lower lobe bronchus.
A biopsy was obtained of the subcarinal nodes, which revealed B cell lymphoma.
The patient was noted to have melena and hematemesis.
An endoscopy was pursued, which showed extremely friable mucosa, suggesting possible involvement of the gastrointestinal mucosa.
This was complicated by tumor lysis and urate nephropathy.
She developed progressive shortness of breath with hypoxia while on the medical floor, and ultimately required intubation on [**8-15**] for worsening hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis; necessitating transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage which showed mucopurulent secretions in the left lower lobe with cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Chest imaging revealed multifocal pneumonia in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, as well as compressive atelectasis versus consolidation in both lower lobes and lingula.
There were large bilateral pleural effusions.
A left-sided thoracentesis was performed which showed an exudative process.
She continued to mount fevers and required ventilatory support despite continued antibiotic treatment and diuresis; likely as a result of her inability to clear her pneumonia and lymphomatous involvement of the lungs.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
