One week prior to admission to [**Hospital3 **] he developped a non-productive cough, fevers, and increased fatigue.
He had a 10 pound unintentional weight loss over the past 1-2 months.
He was working in his yard when he felt dyspneic and fatigued and sat down.
CXR revealed eosinophilic v. atypical PNA v. inflammation from COPD exacerbation, so he was started on Levaquin and Solumedrol and admitted.

While on steroids, he became hyperglycemic and he was transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt.
In the MICU he became hypoxic and was placed on a NRB.
CXR demonstrated bilateral airspace disease, pulmonary edema, and possible atypical PNA.

Left lower lobe lung mass, malignant until proven otherwise.
Cytology Sputum (expectorated) [**2149-9-3**]: POSITIVE, CONSISTENT WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.
No ultrasound evidence of above-knee deep venous thrombosis in relation to either lower limb.
There is significant thrombus identified within the right popliteal artery, which is almost completely occluded.
There is, however, some peripheral flow identified.
There is a small [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst seen on the right.
ART Ext [**2149-9-5**]: IMPRESSION: Severe right lower extremity ischemia with absent ankle signals and flat PVRs.
Mild/moderate left lower extremity occlusive disease with evidence of aortoiliac and tibial occlusive disease.
Aortobifemoral graft remains patent.
No previous imaging is available to determine the chronicity of occlusion.
Patent bypass from the left common femoral artery to left anterior tibial artery.
Diffuse interstitial lung disease and left lower lobe mass as identified on prior CT.  5.
Marked distention of the urinary bladder.
CT Head w/ & w/out contrast [**2149-9-5**]: IMPRESSION:  Mild brain atrophy and old lacunar infarct in the right thalamus, unchanged.
No contrast CT evidence of metastatic disease to the brain.
Again there are diffuse reticular markings more prominent on the right.
The radiographic findings are again consistent with severe pulmonary fibrosis, possibly complicated by asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, IDDM, and recently identified emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, & LLL lung mass, who presents with respiratory distress and hypoglycemia.
Respiratory Distress: On admission, the patient was admitted to the MICU where his presenting symptoms of dyspnea, cough, & hypoxia (<90%) had improved with inhaled bronchodilators, steroids, O2, and Levaquin.
The CT demonstrated paracentral and centrilobular emphysema in the upper lobes with extensive ground glass opacities and peripheral interstitial lung abnormalities in the right lung and the left lower lobe.
It also showed a 6mm anterior right upper paratracheal lymph node and a 1.9 by 1.2mm right lower paraesophageal lymph node.
Finally, a 4cm mass was seen in the left lower lobe of the lung, consistent with malignancy.
The etiology of his interstitial lung disease was unknown and he was scheduled to receive a bronchoscopy for further evaluation, but this was cancelled after the patient continued to trigger for hypoxic episodes with O2 sats to the high 60's-low 70's on 3L's.
These episodes of hypoxia were complicated by poor surveillance due to PVD.
As a result of his hypoxia in conjunction with other medical concerns (right popliteal thrombosis), his bronchoscopy was cancelled.
# Right popliteal artery thrombosis: On [**9-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 19122**] had an episode of [**10-25**] sudden onset right calf pain following a physical exam earlier in the day that was positive for dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
At the time of pain onset, the patient's right leg was cooler than the left with a thready pulse.
LENI's were obtained and he was found to have a nearly occlusive right popliteal artery.
Given his poor pulmonary status and new diagnosis of malignancy, vascular declined intervention.
As a result of the arterial thrombosis, his CK levels became elevated (4000's) and his Cr began to rise.
He was discharged to home on hospice with IVF's to minimize the kidney damage caused by impending rhabdomyolosis, SC Heparin 4 times daily to minimize the pain from his leg, and pain medications.
He has had frequent admissions to [**Hospital6 **] over the past few months for hypoglycemia, and he was briefly in the MICU at OSH for hyperglycemia [**2-17**] steroids.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], he continued to have episodes of hypo and hyperglycemia requiring an insulin gtt in the MICU.
This scale was refined in keeping with his decreasing steroid regimen.
As a result, his blood sugars ranged from 150-300's, but he had no further episodes of hypoglycemia or extreme hyperglycemia.
# Pulmonary Nodule: The patient was found to have a 4 cm pulmonary nodule in his LLL on CT at an OSH.
This was concerning for cancer, given his extensive smoking history, asbestos exposure, and clinical history of weight loss and fatigue.
A repeat CT was performed at the [**Hospital1 18**] per Pulmonology work-up and confirmed this 4 cm mass in the left lower lobe.
An expectorated sputum culture was also sent that was positive for squamous cell carcinoma on [**9-4**].
The patient and his family was told of the diagnosis on [**9-5**], but given his other medical concerns, specifically his arterial thrombosis of the right leg, there was no further work-up of the cancer as an inpatient.
He denies chest pain and had MI work up at OSH, and recent TTE showed EF 55%.
Cymbalta was recently discontinued, as OSH was concerned for eosinophilic pneumonia, but was restarted as an inpatient based on his clinical presentation and progression.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19122**] was admitted as FULL CODE, but became DNR/DNI during this inpatient hospitalization and he was discharged to home with hospice.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
[**Hospital 485**] Hospital Bed Dx: Respiratory Failure 17.
Disp:*2 week supply* Refills:*10*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of the [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Diabetes Mellitus Type II, Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, Right popliteal artery occlusion Rhabdomyolysis Coronary artery disease, Dyslipidemia, Depression, Hypertension, Peripheral vascular disease   Discharge Condition: Improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to an episode of respiratory distress and low blood sugars.
Pulmonologists were consulted to assess your respiratory distress and requested a CT scan of your chest.
It revealed evidence of emphysema as well as some fibrosis of the lungs.
The CT of the scan also revealed a mass in the left lobe of the lung concerning for malignancy.
A sputum culture obtained during this admission, confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell cancer of the lung.
There were no interventions made on the cancer while you were here.
A home visiting nurse will be able to monitor your blood glucose levels once you were at home.
Also, while you were in the hospital, you had pain your right leg that was determined to be a block in an artery in your leg.
Please continue to use this oxygen at home when you are active or if you feel short of breath.
Albuterol, 1-2 puffs every 4 hours as needed: This medication is used to help with shortness of breath.
If you have shortness of breath, you should use this medication and can take it up to every 4 hours as needed.
Please continue to take this medication each day even if you are not feeling short of breath as its effect is long-term.
Spiriva 1 puff once a day: This medication was also prescribed to help your shortness of breath.
Please continue to take this medication once a day even if you are not feeling short of breath.
Lasix, 20mg twice daily: In the hospital, you were placed on a medication called Lasix to help remove excess fluid from your body.
If you have any new shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness, dizziness, or feelings like you might lose consciousness, please call your hospice or your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
