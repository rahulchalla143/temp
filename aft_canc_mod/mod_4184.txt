Partial opacification of the entire mid and lower left hemithorax with associated left volume loss and leftward mediastinal shift.
A right hilar mass is again seen with remainder of the right lung clear.
IMPRESSION: Multiple abnormalities as described above without significant short interval change.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2187-9-12**] 1:12 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  Reason: IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old woman with recently dx lung ca [**8-1**] with increased SOB and outside report of lung mass compression of airway REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 72-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung cancer with increased shortness of breath.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a large mass within the left lung abutting the left heart border and invading the mediastinal airway and vascular structures.
This mass causes complete collapse of the left upper lobe bronchus and partial collapse of left lower lobe bronchus.
Measurable solid components measures 8.4 x 5.6 cm (2:25) and 3.1 x 3.1 cm (2:34).
This mass compresses the left main pulmonary artery to a diameter of 5 mm (2:21).
Additionally, the left main stem bronchus is narrowed to 3 mm at the hilum of this invasive mass and adjacent lymphadenopathy.
Large conglomerate lymph nodes in the subcarinal and right hilar region also causes narrowing of the right bronchus intermedius to 3.5 mm and compression of the right upper lobe bronchus.
Additionally, there is a very large right supraclavicular lymph node measuring 34 x 41 mm.
Within the remainder of the lung fields, multiple metastatic nodules and masses are identified, the largest within the right middle lobe measuring 28 x 35 mm.
There are no significant pleural effusions.
As described above, there is significant narrowing of the left main pulmonary artery.
There is probable narrowing of the left main pulmonary artery that is compressed between subcarinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy (2:26).
There are atherosclerotic calcifications seen within the aorta and coronary arteries.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Additionally, just above the gallbladder is a subtle rounded density, which may represent metastatic lesion measuring 5.1 x 4.7 cm, (series 2:54).
The adrenal glands are thickened, but no focal masses are identified.
Bone windows show no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Large central left lung mass with post-obstructive collapse of left upper lobe and partial collapse left lower lobe.
Associated large bilateral hilar and mediastinal conglomerate lymph nodes, which encase the airway and the central pulmonary arteries.
Additional findings of metastatic disease throughout the lungs and a large right supraclavicular lymph node.
Trachea and bronchi are encased/narrowed by conglomerate nodal disease, with most severe narrowing at left main bronchus proximal to left upper lobe obstruction.
Oval soft-tissue density structure in gallbladder fossa region, likely a distended, sludge filled gallbladder but solid mass is difficult to exclude.
Probable discrete mass within the right lobe of the liver superior to the gallbladder fossa.
On HD 1, she had an elevated WBC of 46.5 and her chest x-ray demonstrated complete whiteout of the left chest.
She was afebrile and was empirically started on vancomycin and meropenem.
On HD 2, she underwent an elective intubation and bronchoscopy which demonstrated extrinsic compression of the left and right mainstem bronchi.
She was continued on the antibiotics,  remained afebrile and intubated.
Status post stent placement, the patient was found to have a-fib and metoprolol and amiodarone were started.
She was extubated early in the morning, however, by mid evening it was found that she was having progressive respiratory failure and re-intubation was done.
Trials of pressure support for extubation failed with increasing respiratory rates and poor arterial blood gases.
On HD 8, it was decided that she would benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation for ventilator weaning.
She was continued on BIPAP for good part of the afternoon without difficulty.
Patient will undergo a speech and swallow evaluation and pending her passing the evaluation, she will resume a normal diet.
Lasix 20 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day for 7 days: Please re-assess fluid status and adjust accordingly.
Particle/Crystal PO once a day: As needed for potassium repletion.
Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]/ Interventional Pulmonology ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**]) for: fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, difficulty breathing, drainage from incision sites.
