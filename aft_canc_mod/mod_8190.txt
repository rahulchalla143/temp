Imaging  A. CXR ([**2200-7-2**]) [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    71 year old woman with pancreatitis now with nausea and abdominal pain and    bloating REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    evaluate for pancreatitis, obstruction, perforation Final Report INDICATION:  71-year-old woman with pancreatitis, now with nausea and abdominal pain and bloating.
Evaluate for pancreatitis, obstruction or perforation.
There is a nonspecific gas pattern within colon and small bowel, but no evidence of obstruction or free air.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent consolidation or left lower lobe atelectasis.
No evidence of obstruction or free air.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent consolidation or left lower lobe atelectasis.
FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatus hernia with approximately 50% of the stomach within the thorax.
The liver is not nodular in contour but demonstrates diffusely increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images and loss of signal on out-of-phase compared to in-phase T1-weighted images, consistent with hepatic steatosis.
No focal liver lesions are seen.
No biliary duct dilatation.
The pancreas is diffusely mildly enlarged and demonstrates abnormally increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images, consistent with pancreatitis.
No focal pancreatic lesions are seen.
There is marked peripancreatic fat stranding and a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
There is gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid that is confluent with the remainder of the peripancreatic fluid and likely secondary to the coexisting pancreatitis.
There is a duodenal diverticulum just posterior to the ampulla.
There are numerous small T2 hyperintense lesions throughout the spleen.
Following contrast administration, these are hyperenhancing on the arterial phase and demonstrate progressive enhancement on more delayed phases, consistent with hemangiomas; given the multiplicity of lesions, this is consistent with splenic hemangiomatosis.
No upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
There is a moderate scoliosis in the lumbar spine.
Pancreatitis without evidence of necrosis or other complications.
No cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
Large hiatus hernia.
Gallbladder wall edema is noted along with pericholecystic fluid, confluent with peripancreatic inflammatory change and likely secondary to pancreatitis.
Hepatic steatosis.
Duodenal diverticulum.
C. RUQ US ([**2200-6-29**]) INDICATION:  81-year-old woman with elevated transaminitis and elevated lipase.
COMPARISON:  CT from an outside hospital [**2200-6-29**]  FINDINGS:  The liver demonstrates diffuse increase in echogenicity, consistent with fatty infiltration.
No focal liver lesions identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is diffuse gallbladder wall edema, which is likely due to known pancreatitis.
No hydronephrosis or stones are seen.
Echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration.
However, other forms of liver disease including advanced liver disease or cirrhosis are not excluded.
Mild gallbladder wall edema likely due to known pancreatitis.
No gallstones or biliary dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: 71F history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, IBS that was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of pancreatitis likely drug-induced although unknown discrete precipitant with hospital course complicated by multi-articular gout especially lower extremities.
Patient required MICU admission given BiSAP score of 3 with uncomplicated course consisting of conservative and supportive measures.
At hospital discharge, patient was able to digest soft diet and had improving joint pain from gout  # Drug-induced pancreatitis The patient presented with classic symptoms of pancreatitis likely secondary to a medication although may also be idiopathic.
MRCP and RUQ did not reveal gallstone or biliary abnormalities although there was gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to pancreatitis.
She was fluid resuscitated with 6 L NS along with IV dilaudid for pain control.
Her symptoms improved significant by hospital day 2 with resolution of aforementioned laboratory abnormalities.
In addition, her NSAIDs and benazapril were held although uncertain if pancreatitis is idiopathic or really drug-induced.
She was discharged on PO dilaudid for pain relief of both gout and abdominal pain although any residual abdominal pain seemed to be functional rather than related to pancreatitis.
# Hypertension The patient was hypertensive during hospitalization given benzapril was held.
# Gout Patient complained of great bilateral toe pain that was concerning for gout attack.
# Fever: Patient had fever on [**7-5**] attributed to crystalline arthritis and resolving pancreatitis.
CXR did reveal a retrocardiac opacity that could be atelectasis vs. evolving infiltrate; however, clinically, she did not have any localizing symptoms to suggest a specific infection.
She subsequently was afebrile although assessment is limited in setting of steroid therapy.
CHRONIC ISSUES  # Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on her home statin  # Pending studies - Blood cultures dated [**2200-7-2**] x 2 are pending and no growth to date  # Transitional issues - ongoing management of pancreatitis and ?
