He then became hypotensive to 70s systolic; received 3L NS with BP up to high 80s systolic, which is near his baseline, and he was mentating well.

Past Medical History: - squamous cell lung cancer T3, N2 s/p L pneumonectomy [**2-/2151**] after chemo and XRT; bronchoscopy on [**12-22**] revealed erythema and abnormal appearance in the L bronchial stump suggesting recurrent disease.
Recent PET shows some FDG avidity along the pneumonectomy suture line with a comment about a foci of avidity in the AP window area.
There is also circumferential uptake around the pneumonectomy cavity.
There is also a note of poor anatomic delineation without a contrast CT.
There was also FDG avidity between the right atrial appendage and the left ventricular outflow track without anatomic correlate.
No definite bony lesions, no subdiaphragmatic lesions.

Only rare alcohol use and prior tobacco use (roughly 70 pack years); he quit smoking approximately a year ago just prior to be diagnosed with lung cancer.

# Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and hypotension in ED.
Likely source was pneumonia based on symptoms of cough, R sided chest pain.
Patient had completed course of Augmentin day prior to admission after admission for PNA at which time he was initially treated with vanc/zosyn.
CTA showed no focal infiltrate, No PE but did show ground glass opacities.
He was treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and cefepime for broad coverage.
He remained afebrile and normotensive and was transferred to the floor.
The patient remained afebrile for >48 hours and was d/c'd home and asked to follow up with the infectious disease clinic.
# A-flutter, s/p ablation: In sinus rhythm on admission.
Diltizem & flecainide held on admission [**1-17**] hypotension but were restarted after patient was weaned off pressors.
# Squamous cell lung cancer: Status post L pneumonectomy now with evidence of local recurrence as confirmed by biopsy during admission at [**Location (un) 620**].
His oncologist, thoracic surgeon and primary team felt that the patient should recover from his acute illness and his treatment will be decided upon as an outpatient.
