Admission Date:  [**2147-5-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-12-7**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old primarily Russian speaking gentleman who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit status post a meningeal resection on [**2147-5-3**], with no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively the patient had a seizure on postoperative day #1 with change in mental status and developed right hemiparesis and aphasia.
He also had an episode of atrial fibrillation.
Head CT at the time of the seizure and mental status changes was consistent with postoperative changes and no specific signs of ischemia.
He had a right facial droop.
MRI done on [**5-5**] on the diffusion images showed areas of restricted diffusion in the left parietal region just slightly posterior to the area of surgical defect, and this area was suspicious for acute infarct in the left parietal region.
It also showed evidence of postoperative changes in the left frontal region with blood products and some marginal enhancement in the surgical bed.
There was no evidence of midline shift, mass affect, or hydrocephalus.
There was also a small area of blood products in the right posterior temporal region which indicated an old area of hemorrhage from trauma or cavernous angioma.
He did convert to sinus rhythm and had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
On [**2147-5-7**], the patient had an EEG which showed left posterior parasagittal area, focal slowing and slow background.
Chest x-ray showed probably small opacity, early infiltrate on the right side.
.............. MRI scan on [**2147-5-11**], showed consistent postoperative changes with a posterior left frontal infarct without change and a right-sided subdural collection which is also unchanged from the previous scan.
No change in slight mass affect.
On [**2147-5-13**], the patient was found in respiratory distress with decreased oxygen saturations.
On [**5-14**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.6??????.
The patient was thought to have aspirated causing respiratory distress.
He had a repeat head CT at that time which showed no changes.
He was moving his left side spontaneously, squeezing to command on the left and moving his left leg purposely with right-sided hemiparesis as before.
The patient again ran into respiratory distress requiring frequent suctioning, and the patient was then transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2147-5-18**].
He was started on Heparin for his atrial fibrillation and then on Coumadin.
He had a repeat head CT on [**2147-5-24**], which is stable from his previous scans which showed the resolving blood in the tumor bed and the presence of an infarct.
He also of note had lytic lesions in the calvarium and apex skull consistent with question of multiple ....................; therefore, a UPEP and SPEP were sent on the patient which is pending.
