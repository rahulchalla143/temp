Judging from the complete extent of this mass, including its hemorrhagic elements, it is more likely intra- than extra-axial.
Primary and metastatic etiololgies need to be considered, and seem more likely than an extra-axial lesion such as a meningioma.
No source of brain metastasis is identified.
Somewhat distended gallbladder with some pericholecystic fluid.
There is evidence of periportal tracking.
Would recommend correlation with clinical and laboratory factors to rule out cholecystitis.
This study does not differentiate between an intra- and extra-axial mass as the origin of this lesion.
Bone Scan [**5-3**]: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
She was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
An MRI was done which showed a complex solid and cystic mass within the region of the right frontal lobe.
There was associated edema surrounding the mass.
Over the following days, she was evaluated by CT and Bone scan for other possible primary tumors but these results were negative.
She and her family were counseled to return to the hospital should her headache worsen or should she develop new or worsening neurological symptoms.
On discharge, her neurological exam was only remarkable for a L lateral rectus palsy.
