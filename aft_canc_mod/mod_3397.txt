Minimal residual patchy density persists .
Slightly limited examination due to large amount of motion artifact, however no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
Interval worsening of RML abutting fissure opacity may represent worsening consolidation or atelectasis.
No significant interval change to other patchy peripheral opacities and peribronchial wall thickening.
Differential remains infectious including viral etiologies or atypical bacterial pneumonias.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function with impaired left ventricular relaxation.
No structural valvular disease or pericardial effusion.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-5-9**] no definite change   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo M c stage IIIB IgG kappa multiple myeloma d+27 of auto SCT presents with worsened SOB.
# Hypoxia/SOB: Initial w/u negative for worsening PNA (no fever, CXR and CT showed improved appearance of prior infiltrates, and cough was improved since last admission).
Cardiac cause was investigated with BNP, echo and CXR, and there was no evidence of heart failure (patient did not improve with IV lasix).
Treatment for Melphalan toxicity is high dose steroids, and the patient improved dramatically with this.
# h/o pituitary adenoma s/p resection/adrenal insufficiency.
# Meningioma: S/p excision [**3-/2118**] and XRT.
# DM II - Not on oral regimen or insulin at home, but placed on insulin SS while on steroids.
Dyspnea secondary to Melphalan Pulmonary toxicity 2.
