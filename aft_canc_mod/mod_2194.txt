Admission Date:  [**2198-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-1-18**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: This is an 83-year-old man, Russian-speaking, with a left temporo-parietal glioblastoma multiforme, s/p resection in [**2197-11-24**], chronic Left frontal SDH and bilateral DVT's recently on Fragmin, and living in [**Hospital6 310**] receiving daily brain XRT.
He initially presented with right arm weakness and non-fluent aphasia after an XRT treatment.
The patient was in an ambulance on the way back [**Hospital6 310**] when he was noted to have right upper extremity weakness and non-expressive aphasia.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital where head CT revealed acute on chronic SDH.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where repeat CT and MRI revealed a stable, unchanged acute on chronic SDH.
Of note, the evening prior to transfer, the patient developed significant agitation requiring restraint.
Currently undergoing XRT/Temodar therapy (though patient does not know he has cancer, and the family wishes not to tell him that he has cancer) - Atrial fibrillation (has been on anticoagulated prior to glioma surgery, has been on Lovenox and Coumadin) - RLE extremity DVT with PE in [**10/2197**], which led to workup leading to dx of cerebral glioma.
- Pyloric stenosis s/p resection 20 yrs ago.
- h/o TB 40 yrs ago, treated, s/p lung resection (unknown which lobe) - CRI - Hypothyroidism - Anemia - Urinary retention  Social History: He lives at [**Hospital6 310**] at present.
No masses or organomegaly.
Extremities: 2+ edema bilateral  Neurological Examination: He was awake and alert, but not oriented to place or time.
Extraocular movements were full but there was saccadic intrusion.
Motor Examination:  He did not have a drift.
Coordination examination did not reveal gross dysmetria.
Increase in size of left subdural hematoma compared to the prior study, with new fluid-fluid level with areas of hyperdensities, worrisome for acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
Slightly increased shift of midline structures.
Increase in size of the post-glioma resection cavity with increased mass effect, worrisome for recurrence of the glioma.
MRA Brain ([**2198-1-11**]): Some increased mass effect in left hemisphere when compared to the prior study associated with some increased edema and/or recurrent neoplasm around the operative site together with slight increase in the left- sided subdural fluid collection.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES On the MIP sequence, there is some question of reduced flow in the lower basilar artery.
There is no evidence of abnormal signal in this area on the axial T2-weighted MRI sequences and this is felt to represent artifact.
There is no definite evidence of flow abnormality.
CT head ([**2198-1-11**]): No evidence of enlargement of the subdural hematoma since [**2198-1-10**].
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is hard to assess given the limited views but appears depressed.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is an 83-year-old man, Russian-speaking, with a Left temporo-parietal glioblastoma multiforme, s/p resection in [**2197-11-24**], chronic Left frontal SDH and bilateral DVT's recently on Fragmin, and living in [**Hospital 23645**] Rehabilitation Center receiving daily brain XRT.
He initially presented with right arm weakness and non-fluent aphasia after an XRT session, and was found to have extension of his SDH.
(1) Right Arm Weakness and Dysarthria: Possible etiologies include acute on chronic SDH with mass effect, seizure, GBM progression, toxic-metabolic or radiation encephalopathy.
He appears to have increased mass effects without clear recurrence of the GBM.
The patient has no clear toxic-metabolic causes.
The patient had an EEG with diffuse slowing though no seizure activity.
Over the course of the patient's hospitalization, his symptoms improved, including resolved right arm weakness and facial droop.
The patient initially failed speach and swallowing evaluations.
With improvement in his symptoms, the patient passed a video swallow with restrictions: Pureed consistency, thin liquids, crush all pills and aspiration precautions.
(2) Agitation Overnight: The patient had a few episodes of disorientation, likely in part related to language barrier and lack of a familiar face.
It is also possible that this was due to delirium or a component of encephalopathy.
In the interim he will receive no therapy.
(4) Atrial Fibrillation: Stable.
(5) DVT and PE: Large documented DVT with prior PE.
But he was asymptomatic and afebrile.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Solution Sig: [**1-30**]  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO every 6-8 hours as needed for heartburn.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Disp:*30 Injections* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Subacute radiation-induced encephalopathy Chronic and subacute subdural hematoma Glioblastoma multiforme  Discharge Condition: Stable, as evidenced by stable vital signs, laboratory data.
he was back to baseline neurologic function without apparent right arm or facial weakness.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with right arm weakness and facial weakness.
It is likely that this was due to bleeding within your skull.
There were no signs of re-occurrence of your brain tumor.
Reduce your lovenox injections to once a day 30mg to limit the risk of bleeding and provide some protection against clotting.
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] for further management of this ongoing problem.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital for any new or worsening, nausea, vomiting, weakness or any other concerning symptoms.
