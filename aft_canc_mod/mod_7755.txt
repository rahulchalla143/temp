[**2127-1-9**] Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning of secretions from the bronchus intermedius and right middle lobe.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old woman with a history of emphysema and a new right lung mass seen on chest CT from OSH.
She returns today following repeat chest CT which showed slight enlargement of the spiculated right upper lobe, FDG avid mass.
Since last being seen, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 44646**] continued R flank and iliac pain, for which she continues to be treated with low dose percocet.
She underwent an MRI at an OSH for this pain and was notable for possible disc herniation as well as possible "spine cancer" per patient.
Aside from this, Ms. [**Known lastname **] says she feels "a little tired" but otherwise has no complaints, with no SOB, cough or increased sputum production.

Mild interval enlargement of a now 2.1 x 1.6 cm spiculated right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with associated adjacent pleural thickening, presumed malignant.
Severe upper lobe predominant pulmonary emphysema.
Fusiform dilation of the ascending aorta and moderate aortic valve calcification of unknown hemodynamic significance.
No pulmonary embolism is main pulmonary artery.
Due to suboptimal opacification of lobar, segmental and subsegmental branches of pulmonary artery, assessment of emboli within these branches was limited.
There is no evidence of middle lobe torsion, however, it is remarkable for complete collapse secondary to the occlusion of middle lobe bronchus, likely from secretions.
Multifocal aspiration in left lung.
Complete occlusion of the right bronchus intermedius, likely from secrections with partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
Moderate, nonhemorrhagic, posterior right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of the adjacent lung, mild right pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema are likely following recent surgery.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she was able to use her incentive spirometer and her pain was controlled with a Bupivacaine epidural and a Dilaudid PCA.
Her chest xray showed a new LL lobe opacity and she subsequently had a Chest CTA done which ruled out PE but demonstrated RML collapse due to an occluded right [**Hospital1 **].
She had thick mucous plugging which was aspirated and she immediately improved.
She remained in the ICU for a few additional days for vigorous pulmonary toilet including nebulizers, mucolytics, chest PT and incentive spirometry.
She remained afebrile with a normal WBC (12K prior to starting ABX).
The Physical Therapy service evaluated her and recommended rehab for pulmonary toilet.
Although she is small and slight in stature she is able to tolerate a fair amount of narcotics and still has some discomfort but she also took Percocet prior to admission for multiple arthritic aches and pains.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
7. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
10. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for break through pain .
