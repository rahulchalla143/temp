Admission Date:  [**2148-2-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2148-2-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-10-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a complex medical history including multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2136**], now status post XRT and undergoing treatment with Decadron and thalidomide, status post laminectomy at L4, S1, and a left epidural tumor removal in [**2147-7-14**] complicated by months of hospitalization for various wound infections and debridements who presents with serous drainage from his back.
The patient underwent a laminectomy at L4-S1 and left epidural tumor removal in [**2147-7-14**] and was subsequently readmitted for fevers/wound infection with gram-negative rods and MRSA complicated by sepsis.
The patient underwent a debridement with flap closure of the lumbar incision in [**2147-8-14**].
The patient is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 1474**] where he presented with a one day history of serous drainage from his lower back.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 96/56 at his baseline with a heart rate in the 160s, in atrial fibrillation without ischemic EKG changes.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was noted to be afebrile with warm skin and nontoxic appearing.
The patient was noted to have slightly slurred speech thought secondary to Dilaudid.
The patient was evaluated by Neurosurgery who noted a 1 cm ulcer over the area of his back flap without pus but with evidence of serous drainage.
The patient's back was also notable for mild erythema and the plan was for reevaluation by Plastic Surgery the following morning.
Multiple myeloma with XRT and Decadron in the past, now on thalidomide.
Status post laminectomy, L4-S1, and left epidural tumor removal in [**2147-7-14**], complicated by three to four months of hospitalizations and various complications including MRSA debridement with flap closure, left parietal CVA, atrial arrhythmias, and a bilateral V-Y fasciocutaneous flap.
General:  The patient is not toxic appearing, in no acute distress with warm extremities.
No evidence of conjunctival pallor.
No lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachy, irregularly/irregular without evidence of murmurs.
Extremities:  No evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, mild pain with hip flexion.
Neurologic: No evidence of saddle anesthesia.
No flaccid droop.
Back:  Evidence of erythema of the patient's lower back with serous drainage from a 1 cm ulcer in the right lower back.
No evidence of expressible pus.
EKG revealed atrial fibrillation at 112 beats per minute, normal axis, poor R wave progression, no ischemic ST-T wave changes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  On the night of admission, the patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardiac and was evaluated by the night float resident.
The patient was briefly on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure control but after one day was weaned off and was hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Given his history of atrial fibrillation, the patient was also maintained on Coumadin with a heparin drip until his INR was therapeutic for 48 hours.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with serous drainage from his lower back with an extensive history of wound infections status post laminectomy and epidural tumor removal.
Given the patient's tachycardia and hypotension, there was a concern for sepsis.
The Infectious Disease Consult Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended vancomycin and Meropenem for broad spectrum coverage.
An MRI performed was significant for increase in fluid collection posterior to the body of S2 with residual fluid pockets posterior to the previous operative site.
The patient was also noted to have loose stools and a C. difficile toxin came back negative and the patient was treated with Flagyl.
ONCOLOGY:  The patient was admitted with a history of multiple myeloma on thalidomide and Decadron.
HEME:  The patient also has a history of anemia with a stable hematocrit throughout this admission.
The patient also has a history of a DVT and atrial fibrillation and was continued on heparin and Coumadin as noted above until her INR is therapeutic for 48 hours.
intake of free fluid was encouraged with a gradual resolution of his hypernatremia.
ENDOCRINE:  Given the patient's hypotension, there was a concern for adrenal insufficiency in this patient who has been on chronic steroids for his multiple myeloma.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed and the patient did not respond appropriately according to the sepsis protocol and was placed on three days of stress dose steroids for potential adrenal insufficiency.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
