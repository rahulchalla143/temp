EGD (2)   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV (viral load in [**2126-4-5**] was undetectable) and COPD on 3.5 liters of oxygen at home who presents from the PACU.
She was noted to have a right neck mass, presumably squamous cell carcinoma based on earlier biopsies, with unknown primary site, and had presented today for surgical biospy of right tonsil.
According to the ENT team, today in the OR the patient underwent a biopsy of an enlarged right tonsil, which was inconclusive based on frozen path sections.
A right neck mass excisional biospy was then completed, which was also inconclusive on pathology sections.
At that point, she was re-intubated by anesthesia and her oropharynx was re-examined.
There was some bleeding of her right tonsil which was treated with electrocautery and stitches.
She was noted to have some blood in her nose, felt to be from her tonsils.
She was noted to have clot in her distal airways that was cleaned out, without any evidence of active bleeding.
She was noted to have a large amount of clot in the antrum of her stomach without visible bleeding or ulcer.
Review of sytems: The patient denies hematemesis prior to present episode.
Also denies hemoptysis, reflux, dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, abdominal pain, fevers/chills, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, hematochezia, melena, diarrhea, change in bowel habits, cp, increased sob above baseline.

She used to work as a house painter, but not being able to work because of her respiratory compromise.

Right tonsil biopsies #1 (A): Tonsilar tissue and squamous mucosa with mild chronic inflammation.
No malignancy identified.
Right tonsil biopsies #2 (B): Tonsilar tissue and squamous mucosa with mild chronic inflammation.
No malignancy identified.
V.  Tissue in trachea (F): Blood clot and clusters of atypical squamous cells.
Imaging: [**2126-8-15**] CXR: Bibasilar atelectasis, cannot rule out infectious process, would recommend followup if clinically warranted.
[**2126-8-15**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position.
No pneumothorax has developed, and no new parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
On previous postoperative supine film identified atelectasis in the left lower lobe area is clearing up and only a plate atelectasis remains.
[**2126-8-16**]: CXR: Opacities at the right and left base have worsened since a day prior, with increase in size of a small left pleural effusion.
The upper lungs are clear and there is no pneumothorax.
Compared to the prior study, there is improvement of basilar aeration with no new abnormalities such as consolidation to suggest infectious process/aspiration.
[**2126-8-17**]: CXR: The current study again demonstrates development of volume overload and bibasal opacities that appears to be very similar to [**2126-8-16**] study obtained at 06:16 a.m. thus suggesting fluctuations in the lung appearance; it might be consistent with pulmonary edema.
[**2126-8-16**]: EGD: Blood clot at Fundus.
No active bleeding.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**2126-8-21**]: EGD: In the posterior pharynx there was oozing noted and an area of irregular ulcerated mucosa.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 55 yo woman with h/o HIV, severe COPD, recently diagnosed with squamous cell CA with neck mass now presenting with hematemesis.
# Hematemesis: Pt [**Doctor First Name 1638**] h/o reflux symptoms, ulcers etc.
Per ENT team and outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID, including this morning [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes), so this would put her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis.
Other possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion.
Per GI team, no active bleeding noted.
Repeat EGD showed oozing from the posterior pharynx near biopsy site, but was otherwise normal.
# Right-sided neck mass: The patient presented to the hospital for biopsy of a right neck mass and R enlarged tonsil  She has been followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71327**] in oncology.
Path from neck mass showed squamous cell carcinoma, but R tonsil shows just inflammatory changes.
# Diffuse back / Abdominal wall pain:  The patient had new onset back pain in scapular region bilaterally and mild abdominal wall pain that was felt to be musculoskeletal in nature.
Her pain was controlled with IV dilaudid, ultram, and tylenol.
On discharge she had not back pain, only pain at the site of her tumor, which was well controlled with ultram.
Secondary Diagnoses:  HIV, COPD, Psoriasis, ?
Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for a biopsy of a right neck mass and your right tonsil.
The biopsies showed squamous cell cancer of the right neck mass and nonspecific inflammatory changes in the right tonsil.
Bronchoscopy was performed and showed blood in your large airways, but no source of bleeding.
EGD showed a large clot in your stomach that was adherent to the stomach and unable to be removed in order to evaluate a source for the clot.
You were tested for an infection of your stomach that can cause stomach problems called H.pylori and the test was positive.
You will need to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding your neck mass and HIV.
If you experience any of the following symptoms you should call your primary doctor or go to the emergency room:  vomiting, coughing up blood, abdominal pain, blood in your stool or very dark stools, difficulty swallowing, changes in your voice, swelling in your face, fevers or chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.
