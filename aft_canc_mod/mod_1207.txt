HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old right-handed white female who presents with a history of seven to eight days with global headache and new onset of nausea with vomiting times one on the morning of admission on [**1-12**].
She called her primary care physician and was seen and evaluated at the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with a workup including a head CT and magnetic resonance imaging scan positive for a 2.5-inch tumor in the left parietal region with moderate surrounding edema.
She reports that in retrospect she has felt occasional vague weakness, and vague occasional dizziness, and "just not right" for the past three to five weeks.
She denies any visual changes or impairments to vision or hearing.
She denies any weakness, numbness or paresthesias of the arms or legs.
A tubal ligation.
ALLERGIES:  Reports an allergic reaction to TETANUS in the past.
She is a married woman with a supportive family.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother had epilepsy and breast cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical examination she was afebrile with stable vital signs, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.
She was a well-developed, well-nourished white female in no acute distress.
There was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities.
The neurologic examination showed the patient to be awake, alert, and conversant, and oriented times three with speech fluent and no dysnomia or paraphrasic errors.
The face was symmetric, and there was no drift.
There was no ankle clonus, and finger-to-nose test was intact without any dysmetric movements.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The CT from the outside hospital and the magnetic resonance imaging done at the [**Hospital1 190**] confirmed the presence of a 4-cm X 5-cm irregular shaped enhancing lesion with central necrosis and surrounding edema located in the medial left posterior parietal area with some lateral deviation and compression of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ventricle.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The impression was that of a 44-year-old right-handed white female with headaches times seven to eight days, and studies positive for a lesion in the posterior and medial parietal area, and she was therefore admitted on [**2-2**] for craniotomy and excision of this lesion.
The tumor specimen was given to the pathologist with frozen section showing a high-grade astrocytoma.
She spent the first night in the Postanesthesia Care Unit with postoperative check showing the patient to be neurologically stable and was subsequently discharged to the hospital floor on the first postoperative day, and subsequently to that was noted to be ambulating with minimal discomfort and minimal headache.
She was taking solid food and liquids by mouth without difficulty.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  A left parietal brain tumor.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:   Medications on discharge included Decadron and Zantac, and she was given a prescription for Percocet for relief of mild headache.
