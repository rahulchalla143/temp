History of Present Illness: Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4727**] operative note: The patient is a 79-year- old female with an extensive past medical history including thymoma, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] requiring immunosuppressive therapy, carcinoma of the colon, status post a sigmoid resection in [**2113**], and subsequent development of a lung nodule which we resected and found to be a well-differentiated bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
She developed a second lung nodule that was not FDG-avid and it was stable from prior exams.
She was noted to have a positive segment-VII lesion in the liver, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation on [**2117-6-23**].
She had a follow-up scan on [**2118-1-29**], that showed 3 areas of focal increased FDG uptake in the right lobe of the liver.
The liver biopsy in [**2-22**] demonstrated metastatic colon cancer.
She underwent a triphasic CT scan of the abdomen on [**2118-3-15**], that demonstrated 3 areas of hyperdensity in the right lobe of the liver.
She had a lesion in segment, one in segment VIII, and one in segment VI.
The superior two foci are adjacent to the fiducial markers and measure 3.3 x 3.1 cm and 2.7 x 1.9 cm, and a segment-6 lesion measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
Chest CT on [**2117-10-28**], demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
bilateral cataract surgery in [**2114**], hyperlipidemia, bleeding peptic ulcer in [**2074**], appendectomy in [**2068**], esophageal stricture and esophageal dilatation, significant anxiety constipation demyelinating polyneuropathy.
She does not abuse alcohol   Family History: Her father had bladder cancer and brother had [**Name2 (NI) 500**] cancer and one sister had lung cancer and a son with prostate cancer.
Her mother had anemia when she died.

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: 1.
Mild chronic cholecystitis.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with a colonic primary; see note.
Non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma with patchy, mild mixed portal inflammation and focal bile ductular proliferation, suggestive of a minor component of obstruction.
Minimal steatosis is identified (involving <5% of the parenchyma); no iron deposition is seen on iron stain.
Trichrome stain demonstrates focal, mild expansion of portal fibrous tissue.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with a colonic primary; see note.
Note:  Immunostains of the tumor are positive for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2, and negative for CK7 and TTF-1, with satisfactory controls.
Per the operative report she had dense adhesions in the right upper quadrant and a normal-appearing liver.
There were multiple lesions in the right lobe of the liver that could be palpated and were present by intraoperative ultrasound.
A lesion in the dome of the liver was adherent to the diaphragm.
She also had a second, separate, 1.5-cm nodule in the left lateral segment near the edge, consistent with metastatic disease.
There was no evidence of other extrahepatic disease.
Final pathology was available prior to discharge and showed both right lobe and left lateral segment as  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with a colonic primary with parenchymal resection margins free of tumor.
Immediately post op the patient developed nausea and vomiting and an NGT was placed.
