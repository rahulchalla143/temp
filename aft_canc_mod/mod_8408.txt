Admission Date:  [**2110-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-1-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14961**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement and removal PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo Russian speaking male with a PMH of CAD s/p MI, history of PE, CVA, who initially presented with sudden onset of LUQ pain after using the bathroom.
Per report, the pt was c/o LUQ pain and had guarding on exam.
He was also noted to be occult blood positive (brown stool) and had new TWI in V4-V6on his EKG with Tpn of 0.05 (rising to 0.07 on second set).
CTA showed moderate pulmonary edema and no PE.
CT abdomen showed findings c/w possible cholecystitis and a retroperitoneal sarcoma.
At 2 AM the pt was tripoding in distress, and experienced an episode of shortness of breath with RR 35.
H/o deep vein thrombophlebitis with chronic left venous stasis 5.
Cerebrovascular disease.
Gallstones and acute cholecystitis [**2093**] with multiple stones and obstructive jaundice, ERCP failed so had papillotomy 8.
Gastritis with GI bleeding [**5-7**] 10.
Inguinal hernia on R 12.
R carotid stenosis: 70-80% stenosis distal R carotid, 90% stenosis of suprabulbar R carotid 18.
He had an echocardiogram performed in [**2102**], which showed moderate ischemic myopathy with an ejection fraction of 45%, mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, and aortic sclerosis.
No EtOH, no smoking.
Large heterogeneous retroperitoneal mass is most likely a retroperitoneal sarcoma.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and idstended gallbladder with wall edema, sludge and stones, ndpericholecystic fluid/stradning [**Month (only) 116**] be from external compression by the mass, although given presence of gallstones, choledocholisthiasis cannot be excluded.
Ultrasound is ulikely to give significant additional details, consider HIDA scan to assess for cystic duct patency.
Please correlate with recent instrumentation or prior sphincterotomy.
3.6-cm exophytic hypodensity arising off the mid left kidney.
Nonemergent further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed for additional characterization.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
Recommend follow up CXR post diuresis to exclude underlying infection .
As such, there is very little drainage emanating from the pigtail catheter.
[**1-18**] CXR: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has not improved since [**1-17**].
Little if any pleural effusion is present.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**1-19**] CXR: There are continued bilateral alveolar infiltrates, central greater than peripheral right upper lobe and left perihilar with bilateral lower lobe volume loss/infiltrates.
The heart size continues to be mildly enlarged.
There are questionable small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**1-20**] CXR: Widespread pulmonary opacification which progressed between [**1-16**] and 17 is stable, accompanied by slightly larger small right pleural effusion.
The progression of findings suggests that the lung abnormalities are due to edema, though not necessarily cardiogenic.
There is no pneumothorax.
In the upper abdomen one can see a dilated colon and a percutaneous biliary drainage catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 104378**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with CAD s/p MI, history of PE, CVA, h/o gallstones and cholecystitis s/p papillotomy who presented on [**1-17**] with abdominal pain, found to be hypoxic in congestive heart failure and to have cholecystitis now s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
# CHF exacerbation: On admission, his chest xray showed mild to moderate pulmonary edema however admission vitals were O2 sat 95% RA.
CTA was done out of concern for PE as patient was noted to have LLE swelling.
The CTA was negative for PE and showed mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
He became short of breath the evening of admission after receiving 1L NS and was started on BIPAP for suspected flash pulmonary edema.
TTE was checked on [**1-18**] which showed regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (EF 25%), moderate calcific aortic stenosis, moderate pulmonary HTN and moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was seen by his cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] while in house.
# CAD/AMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 104378**] has an extensive cardiac history including CAD s/p multiple MIs in [**2087**], recurrent angina, RCA stenosis, and past thrombophlebitis and PE.
An echocardiogram in 05/99 showed EF of 45% with mild MR, AR and apical aneurysm.
On admission, his EKG showed new TWI in V4-V6 with troponin of 0.05>0.07.
He had elevated troponin without elevated CK which was felt to be due to demand vs. prior event.
CK became mildly positive on [**1-20**], MB remained negative.
EKG was unchanged, patient did not have chest pain.
As troponins have not trended down, concern for AMI given elevated troponins and change in EF from 45 to 25% on most recent echo.
# Cholecystitis: On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 104379**] chief complaint was LUQ pain radiating to RUQ after using the bathroom.
He had a CTA done to rule out PE as above, which showed pneumobilia, distended GB with stones and sludge and fluid around fossa.
He was febrile and tachycardic with a white count peaking at 27.
There was significant concern for cholecystitis and HIDA was done which was also consistent with cholecystitis.
The bile cultures grew GNR and enterococcus.
They recommended clinically following the patient for signs of cholecystitis.
On the day of discharge, the patient denies any abdominal pain.
He is afebrile with a slightly elevated WBC count.
# Retroperitoneal Mass:  The mass was presumed to be sarcoma.
# ARF: Mr. [**Known lastname 104378**] developed acute renal failure likely secondary to overdiuresis.
# Guaiac positive stool in ED: As Mr. [**Known lastname 104378**] is on aggrenox and Plavix at home with guaiac positive stool, aggrenox and plavix were held on admission.
# Delirium: During this admission, the patient has had moments of agitation.
He was treated with haldol for these episodes with good response.
There was concern for prolonged QT with haldol, so EKGs were checked prior to giving each dose.
# F/E/N: On admission the patient was kept NPO for cholecystitis and procedure.
Once his abdominal pain subsided, he was seen by speech and swallow who recommended pureed solids and nectar thickened liquids.
# Prophylaxis: He was kept on PPI as per outpatient and given subcutaneous heparin injections for DVT prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis CHF exacerbation CAD AMI Retroperitoneal mass Acute renal failure Hypertension Hypothyroidism Delirium   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You have an infection which needs to be treated with antibiotics.
You will also need follow up for further evaluation and possible biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass.
