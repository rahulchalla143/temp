She denies any h/o prior DVT or PE.
CTA ordered by PCP which showed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, saddle PE, LUL lung mass and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer of the aortic arch.
Given tylenol 1g po for low grade fever and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
HTN 2.
OA in her knees   Social History: Born in [**Country 16573**], she has 8 children, lives with her daughter, who is a nurse.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

There is no pericardial effusion.
Cannot exclude right atrial thrombus (views suboptimal) --------------  RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2181-1-9**] 7:54 AM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: evaluate aortic arch ulcer seen on CT at OSH Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman with bilateral/saddle PE's, new LUL lung mass and report of penetrating aortic arch atherosclerotic ulcer REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate aortic arch ulcer seen on CT at OSH CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT OF THE CHEST:  CLINICAL HISTORY: 77-year-old woman with saddle pulmonary embolism, new left upper lobe lung mass and reports of penetrating aortic arch atherosclerotic ulcer.
There are extensive pulmonary emboli involving the Upper and lower lobes.
Pulmonary emboli are seen in both main pulmonary arteries, segmental and subsegmental branches.
A linear thrombus is seen extending between the main left and right pulmonary arteries, compatible with saddle embolus.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications are seen throughout the thoracic aorta.
In addition, the aortic arch contains a prominent peripheral atherosclerotic plaque.
However, there is no evidence of aortic dissection or focal atherosclerotic ulcer.
Small subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are seen that do not meet CT criteria for malignancy.
There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal windows demonstrate large amount of thrombus within the pulmonary artery branches in this region, and this area therefore, may represent a focal pulmonary infarct.
Therefore, attention should be drawn to this region on subsequent examination to assess for interval change.
There is a small left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis (left greater than right).
Nonspecific pleural thickening is evident along the medial aspects of both hemithoraces.
In addition, there are several cystic lesions in the right kidney that are only partially included on an unenhanced portion of examination,and probably represent renal cysts.
BONE WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with a saddle embolus component.
Attention should be drawn to this region on subsequent examinations to assess for interval change.
Small left pleural effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Extensive peripheral plaque in the aortic arch.
No evidence of aortic dissection or focal atherosclerotic ulcer.

Normal flow, compression and augmentation are seen in all of the vessels of the right leg.
In the left leg, there is incomplete compression and slow flow seen in the common femoral and the superficial femoral veins indicating nonocclusive thrombus within those vessels.
No DVT is seen in the deep femoral vein or the popliteal vein of the left leg.
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus identified in the left common femoral and superficial femoral veins.
No DVT seen in the right leg.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 177**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2181-1-9**] 3:13 PM  -------------------   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77 yo previously healthy female admitted with extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, new LUL lung mass and atherosclerotic ulcer of the aortic arch.
She was started on  heparin drip and remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of hypotension or R heart strain.
Her most significant risk factor for PE was the new spiculated LUL mass which was concerning for malignancy.
She denied other risk factors including prior DVT, family history of hypercoagulable state, injury, or stasis.
After being stable in the ICU she was then temporarily transferred to cardiothoracic surgery to work-up a lesion concerning for aortic dissection (as below.)
Patient was transitioned to Lovenox without difficulty.
This was aggressively worked up in the setting of the patient's need for anti-coagulation for her pulmonary embolisms.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and a CTA with reconstruction was performed, which ruled out dissection.
#LUL lung mass: This finding is very concerning for malignancy , especially in the setting of new extensive pulmonary emboli and DVT without any other risk factors.
There is a possibility that the nodule may be infectious given her low grade fevers and initially elevated white count, but these may have also been a result of her multiple pulmonary embolisms.
Interventional radiology was asked to evaluate the films, and felt that the mass could likely be biopsied via CT-guided transthoracic biopsy, but felt it would be best to wait [**2-4**] weeks before proceeding.
# HTN: Patient's antihypertensives were initially held because of her risk of hypotension in setting of bilateral/saddle pulmonary emboli.
#leukocytosis, low grade temperature: Initially this was concerning for infection but patient had no localizing symptoms and no evidence on history to support an infectious etiology.
This was then attributed to her extensive pulmonary emboli and overall inflammatory state.
She was on a heparin gtt to treat her known PE and DVT's.
