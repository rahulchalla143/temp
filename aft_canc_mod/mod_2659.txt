At the rehab center, he reportedly had a temperature to 100.5, poor po intake requiring PPN, and abdominal distension prompting NGT and rectal tube placement.
Per the patient's family, the NGT emptied bilious fluid intially but the output appeared coffee-ground and melanotic this morning.
(Of note, the NGT had a single suction port and no air port which may have caused some trauma).
His wife notes that the patient was having some small bowel movements daily but no substantial output.
Her greatest concern was his ongoing abdominal discomfort which had been present at the time of discharge and attributed to a slight ileus.
He did not have any vomiting or unusual diarrhea.
He was on keflex at discharge for slight wound erythema but that had improved - no purulent drainage was reported.
Of note, he does have an extensive history of UTIs, urosepsis and pyelonephritis.
