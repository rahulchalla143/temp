Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Pre-opertively patient had been on coumadin which had been transitioned to lovenox and subsequently switched to fondaparinaux.
# Hypotension.
Post-procedure patient noted to be hypotension with MAPS in 50s and SBPs in 80s necessitating pressure support.
Initial hypotension attributed to fluid shifts s/p core valve and blood pressure augmented with neo.
Neo resulted in pronounced peripheral vasoconstriction with resulting left extremity cyanosis.
However patient persistently hypotension thought secondary to probable sepsis.
Patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics and decision made to aggressively hydrate with IVF and transition pressure support to levophed and vasopression.
On [**6-21**], the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring pressor support with levophed, vasopressin, and dopamine.
# Thrombocytopenia.
Platlets with precipitous drop while hospitalized; ~300 pre-procedure with nadir in the 60s.
Patients 4 T score ~6 (especially after UE US with evidence of new left brancial thrombosis).
Concern for HIT prompted transition to argatroban and send out of the HIT antibody.
Likely drop reflective of underlying infectious process as HIT ruled out and DIC labs negative.
# Acute Kidney Injury.
Patient with elevation in creatinine and decrease in urine production post-corevalve.
CT with evidence of renal infarct thought to have occurred intra-procedure.
Etiology to [**Last Name (un) **] likely multifactorial in setting of renal infarct as well as hypovolemia in setting of hypotension.
The patient remained oliguric for several days and became net + 13L.
# Peripheral vasoconstriction/left hand cyanosis.
Post-procedure patient with complaints of numbness and tingling in left hand.
Patient with hypotension s/p procedure necessitating augmented pressure support with neo.
Additional vasoconstriction in setting of neo in a patient with scleroderma likely resulted in aggravated peripheral vasoconstriction of left hand.
# Elevated LFTS.
Likely secondary to shocked liver in the setting of hypotension and sepsis.
Left cath undertaken in [**4-/2119**] as part of work-up for core-valve demonstarted left dominant system with singel vessel disease: ~50-70% lesion in OM1.
Patient without complaints of chest pain in house.
# Lung disease.
Pateint with history of extensive interstitial pulmonary fibrosis secondary to to amiodarone exposure vs scleroderma vs radiation injury (got radiation for breast cancer in the past.
Pre-procedure chest CT and severe pulmonary HTN on RHC which showed PA systolic pressure of 80mmHg in the presence of nopmal wedge pressure (16mmHg).
There was concern that the patient was not protecting her airway because of altered mental status and she was again intubated on [**6-21**].
# Scleroderma: Clinically suspected on past admission on the basis of her ILD and chronic GERD complaints.
Patient continued on PPI for treatment of GERD .
# Nutrition.
Of note patient is significantlly cachectic with hypoalbuminemia (Alb = 2.7 [**2119-5-21**]) likely [**2-22**] to her various chronic diseases and poor PO intake.
There was concern for mesenteric ischemia post-procedure because of complaints of abdominal pain, and TPN was started.
On [**6-22**], the patient was re-intubated for altered mental status and inability to protect her airway.
The patient was noted to have oliguria, worsening lactic acidosis, evidence of pancreatitis and persistent respiratory failure.
