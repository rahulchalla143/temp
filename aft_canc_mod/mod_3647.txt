Admission Date:  [**2130-12-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-1-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Roxicet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, Vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy thoracentesis Left VATS Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: 40 yo F with unresectable esophageal cancer who was recently discharged from the hospital secondary to right neck pain.
Notes indicate the patient re-presented on [**12-4**] with the chief complaint of "strange sounding airway" and dyspnea.
She was found to have a soft tissue infection lateral to the esophagus that likely represents microperforation, for which she was started on abx, and she required surgical tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction caused by her esophageal cancer.
Additionally, her MICU course was remarkable for persistent tachycardia and mild hypotension.
Her heart rate remains 120s at rest with brief episodes of rates as high as 150 when she is out of bed, sinus tachycardia at all times.
Evaluation as to the cause of tachycardia has included TSH (low normal), with fT4 pending; echo (nml LV and RV function, no echocardiographic signs of hemodynamically significant PE); ABG 7.46/41/114 was with pt breathing room air for 10 minutes, indicating that there is no apparent A-a gradient; a random cortisol level was low, but responded appropriately to cosyntropin.
Since she appears well, with good skin turgor and adequate urine output, despite the tachycardia and hypotension, she was transferred out of the ICU.

No cerebellar dysfunction.
No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
No mass lesions are detected within the airway to explain stridorous breathing.
Slight increase in cavitary lesion within the left lung apex.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a collection of air in the right neck, apparently just lateral to the esophagus, but possibly within a dilated esophagus, best seen on images 34-37 of series 2.
In this location it raises the possibility of an esophageal perforation.
Since it is difficult to determine the location of the lateral margin of the esophagus, it is difficult to distinguish an extraluminal collection from dilatation of the organ.
There is induration of the adjacent tissues, which could be a consequence of local infection, but also could arise as a result of prior radiation.
Small pharyngeal or paralaryngeal abscess, phlegmon or malignancy has grown over two weeks.
Slow growth of small left upper lobe lung cavity and a tiny right lower lobe lesion as well as a new left lower lobe lesion are concerning for multifocal metastases, or slow spread of an indolent infection.
Small growing left pleural mass is more characteristic of metastasis.
[**2130-12-6**] MRI SOFT TISSUE NECK, W/O & W/CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 12 x 8 mm collection of air with small amount of fluid just anterior to the right aspect of the esophagus at the level of the thyroid gland which likely represents esophageal perforation and/or abscess.
Additional considerations include esophageal diverticulum, although less likely.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-2-28**], no change.
No pulmonary embolism.
New left posterior pleural lesion.
Although this would be an atypical location for an esophageal carcinoma metastasis, the possibility of malignancy cannot be totally excluded and PET CT may provide additional diagnostic information.
Increase in right lower lobe and left upper lobe opacities and new left lower lobe opacity most likely represent infectios process; from the same or different [**Doctor Last Name 360**] 4.
Resolution of fluid collection in the posterior parapharyngeal space compared to the CT of [**2130-12-4**]., now fluid filled .
There is new left small pleural effusion with volume loss in the left lower lobe.

Paratracheal soft tissue with acute and chronic inflammation; no malignancy identified.
DIAGNOSIS: Pleura, left posterior plaque, biopsy (A-B):       Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
Pleura, left inferior plaque, biopsy (C-D):       Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
Lung, left upper lobe, wedge resection (E-J):       Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (see note).
Note: (E-J): Apart from the largest tumor nodule (2 cm in greatest dimension), multiple small foci of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma are present along the pleural surface.
Clinical:  Esophageal mass, neck pain.
It consists of a fragment of firm pink-tan tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm.
The pleural surface is smooth and shiny, and involved by a white mass measuring 3.0 x 1.5 cm.
The mass involves the pleura.
Brief Hospital Course: The following summary is divided into sections due to the patients prolonged hospital course:  # Esophageal Cancer/Cough/SOB: The patient presented with cough and SOB.
Her symptoms progressed and ENT was consulted.
The patient was found to have superglottic swellling and she was transferred to the ICU for concern of possible iminent airway obstruction.
A CT of the neck was concerning for perforation and this finding was reassessed with MRI which raised the possibility of abcess formation.
Speech and swallow followed for assessment for passy muir valve.
[**12-6**] - ENT - advised continued MICU care, trachea 3 mm at narrowest point and supraglottic edema, R vocal cord paralysis - Thoracics consult- likely not a tear; advised barium swallow and broad spectrum coverage, ddx perforation vs TE fistula; - Pt did not tolerate barium swallow - Added Vanco/Levo/Flagyl/Fluconazole - MR Neck - read PENDING (wet read by surgery - no ET fistula, no extaluminal air) - TFs - restart Ensure - Evaluated for worsening stridor at 0400; Inspiratory stridor noted on exam in all lung fields, but pt saturating well.
[**Date range (3) 71391**] - MRI suggestive of micro-esophagael perf, +/- infection - (Started on Vanco Levo Fluc yesterday [**12-6**]) - ?Worsening stridor this Morning ([**12-7**]) around 4AM, self resolved.
[**12-8**] - Had trachyostomy; tolerated procedure well.
[**12-9**] - c/od but no bed - ENT s/o - CXR shows trach well palced - tolerated trach proecedure well - no stridor, no n/v - restarted tube feeds - thoracics - 2 wks antibx but will follow on the floor - patient somewhat confused about cancer dx and prognosis - will need to have [**Doctor Last Name **]/[**Doctor Last Name **] to explain to patient what to expect for the future - continues to be tachycardic .
Concern that chest lesion is met, but not confirmed.
Re: reversibility of trach--if this was esoph perf [**1-29**] vomiting or [**1-29**] to radiation, likely temporary and may be removed s/p f/u bronch.
-Refusing depression meds, psychiatry, social work -Speech and Swallow tomorrow -Gave 1 L for tachychardia .
[**2130-12-11**] -Continuing cough apprecaited.
- hypotensive to 70's but not symptomatic.
Summary of ICU Course: Briefly, Mrs [**Known lastname 19688**] is a 40 yo F with unresectable esophageal cancer who was recently discharged from the hospital secondary to right neck pain.
Notes indicate the patient re-presented on [**12-4**] with the chief complaint of "strange sounding airway" and dyspnea.
She was found to have a soft tissue infection lateral to the esophagus that likely represents microperforation, for which she was started on abx, and she required surgical tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction caused by her esophageal cancer.
Additionally, her MICU course was remarkable for persistent tachycardia and mild hypotension.
Her heart rate remains 120s at rest with brief episodes of rates as high as 150 when she is out of bed, sinus tachycardia at all times.
Evaluation as to the cause of tachycardia has included TSH (low normal), with fT4 pending; echo (nml LV and RV function, no echocardiographic signs of hemodynamically significant PE); ABG 7.46/41/114 was with pt breathing room air for 10 minutes, indicating that there is no apparent A-a gradient; a random cortisol level was low, but responded appropriately to cosyntropin.
Since she appears well, with good skin turgor and adequate urine output, despite the tachycardia and hypotension, she was transferred out of the ICU.
40 y/o F with esophageal SCC s/p XRT, s/p tracheostomy for upper airway compromise with parapharyngeal abscess, now s/p VATs for LUL cavitary lesion and found to have metastatic esophageal CA.
Metastatic Esophageal CA: Patient s/p chemo and radiation.
The patient was noted to have a LUL cavitary lesion on CT scan in early [**Month (only) **].
Concern that new lung lesion is secondary to metastatic disease.
A new left sided pleural effusion was seen on CT on [**1-1**].
Cytology and cultures were sent and the patient was found to have an exudative effusion.
ID was consulted, fungal serologies and stool O&P were sent.
The patient underwent VATS on [**2130-1-11**] which unfortunately revealed carcinomatous plaques on the pleural wall which were confirmed frozen section.
Fungal serologies revealed strogyloides and the patient was given two days of Ivermectin.
The patient has been breathing comfortably with trach on 35% trach mask FM; ambulating without supplemental oxygen; transient dyspnea improves with nebs, anxiolytics.
On [**1-7**] the patient was noted to have increased TM requirements up to 50%.
This was thought to be potentially secondary to reaccumulation of her L pleural effusion.
# Healthcare Associated PNA: The patient developed fevers and had continued cough following her VATS.
# Parapharygneal Abscess.
ENT evaluated patient [**1-1**] no upper airway abnormality other than copious secretions.
A CT Neck and Chest on [**1-2**] revealed both tetropharyngeal and retrotracheal swelling as well as soft tissue density encompassing the esophagus.
This was thought to potentially represent post-radiation changes and phlegmon.
No evidence of a drainable fluid collection.
Neutropenia: Initially thought to be secondary to patients being on augmentin.
This was subsequently changed to Clindamycin/Unasyn or compazine.
Anemia: Currently at baseline, no signs of active bleeding.
Tachycardia: The patient has been persistently in sinus tachycardia 110-130 bpm.
The patient was evaluate while in the ICU that indicated a low probibility for PE, no signs of CHF, and potentially subclinical hyperthyroidism although TSH WNL.
There was thought that part of the ST was secondary to anxiety.
Anemia also potentially played a role.
# Depression: The patient remains on nortriptyline for depressed mood and will not take additional treatment.
Likely that some of this is related to coping with general medical illness as well as underlying depression and being away from her children.
