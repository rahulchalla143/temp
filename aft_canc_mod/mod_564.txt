Approximately 30min after her admission, she was found to be unresponsive, pulseless and apneic.
She had some electrical activity on the monitor, and had no pulse.
Past Medical History: 1) Aortic stenosis: last echo [**6-16**] with EF > 55%, severe AS (worse than prior echo) 2) Rheumatoid arthritis (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Rheum, on methotrexate) 3) asthma 4) HTN 5) LLE DVT 6) Pneumonia 7) Anemia of chronic disease 8) CAD 9)h/o thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology (negative HIT, and SRA) 10) Areflexive bladder (requiring chronic foley)   Social History: Lives with daughter.
No HSM or pulsatile mass.
The previously noted patchy opacity in the lateral left lung base is not included on the current radiograph secondary to positioning.
[**2149-11-29**] PA and lat CXR: IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
[**2149-11-30**] CT: wet read - head negative for acute process; CTA chest negative for PE or dissection.
low lung volumes in left chest and left ventricular mass that could be LVH.
Abdominal scan notable for hernia; no acute change in AAA; no ascites.
In the ICU, a R subclavian was ultimately placed - the patient had very difficult access.
A CXR ruled out a pneumonthorax.
The cardiac enzymes were not suggestive of an acute MI.
Interrogation of the pacer revealed that at approximately the time of the incident, she had a 13 minute episode of atrial tachycardia suggestive of afib; however, there was no way to know for certain what rhythm she was in.
It was felt that, perhaps, afib coupled with underlying severe AS may have resulted in hypoxia leading to PEA arrest.
Once resucitated, she was able to maintain a BP without pressors, and remained intubated.
At most, she would open her eyes and move, but no reproducible purposeful movements or ability to follow commands was seen.
