The patient had a chest x-ray done at his oncologist's office, which showed a small apical pneumothorax, new pulmonary nodules, and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed a moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial effusion with impaired ventricular filling.
Nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastasis to the left femur and to the adrenals bilaterally.
It was initially diagnosed in [**2111-11-24**] as an undifferentiated mediastinal carcinoma of unknown primary.
The patient had a recent diagnosis of a left femur bone metastasis and had radiation therapy to this region.
History of near syncope and dehydration requiring IV fluids and ............. 3.
Albuterol 1-2 puffs q4-6h prn shortness of breath.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, this is an ill appearing cachectic male appearing older than stated age in mild respiratory distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Lungs: Dull breath sounds at the right base, clear to auscultation on the left side with good breath sounds.
CHEST X-RAY:  Small left apical pneumothorax, new pulmonary nodules most likely due to metastatic disease, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without interval change in pulmonary vascularity.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus tachycardia at 103 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no pulsus alternans.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**5-16**], where the following was noted:  A low pressure tamponade was present with equalization of the pericardial and right atrial pressures.
pericardiocentesis was performed and 540 cc of clear fluid was removed and sent for evaluation.
The patient was then admitted to the MICU, where his pericardial effusion drained over the next three days.
This was confirmed by serial echocardiography which did eventually show resolution of the effusion on [**5-19**].
At that time he had moderate respiratory distress and was again maintained in good respiratory status with increased O2 administration and albuterol nebulizer treatments standing for the first 24 hours and then prn after that.
The patient did have mild tachycardia intermittently throughout his hospital stay thought to be related to his poor respiratory status.
Hematology/Oncology:  The patient was aware of his terminal illness.
Comfort measures including pain control and nausea control were continued throughout his hospital stay in addition to administration of a nonrebreather mask of 100% O2 for improved controlled of respiratory distress.
The patient was fully aware of the stage of his disease and the sites of metastasis of his lung cancer.
Pain:  His pain was controlled with Fentanyl patches and IV Morphine prn for control of breakthrough pain.
Disposition:  The patient was discharged to home on [**5-19**] with VNA services and with a new regimen for oxygen administration including 3-6 liters of continuous oxygen along with a liquid oxygen tank with a nonrebreather mask at 10-15 liters of oxygen as needed for comfort.
Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis.
Albuterol 1-2 puffs inhaled q6h prn shortness of breath.
Liquid O2 with nonrebreather mask at 10-15 liters as needed for comfort.
