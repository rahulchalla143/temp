Admission Date:  [**2206-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2206-9-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-5-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: [**Year (4 digits) 662**]  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**] Chief Complaint: Fall, Shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 74 y/o F with a h/o COPD on 4L O2 during day and 6L O2 at night, pulmonary hypertension, obesity hypoventilation, dCHF (EF > 55% in [**8-/2205**]), anxiety and multiple recent hospitalizations for dyspnea, thought to be due to her underlying untreated OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, who presented from home s/p a "fall".
She initially complained of two days of productive cough, worsening shortness of breath and subjective fever/chills.
There was initial concern that she was somewhat somnolent so she was given narcan 0.4mg x 1 with some improvement in her MS.  She refused to undergo a head CT and the ER physicians felt she understood the risk of her refusal.
She had a CXR that was read as improved mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no focal consolidation or infiltrate.
Despite her negative CXR and normal [**Known lastname **] count, there was concern for PNA so she was given cefepime, levofloxacin, with plans to give vancomycin as well and admitted to the ICU since she has baseline poor respiratory status.
At the time of transfer her VS were: 88, 137/79, 24, 94% on 4LNC, per report with no increased work of breathing.
She complained of shortness of breath that is unchanged from her baseline and feeling tired.
As there did not appear to be any acute process, she was transferred to the floor.
Prior to transfer, she had a panic attack and on further discussion notes that she has had progressive anxiety.
She is however, amenable to pulmonary rehab and further treatment of her anxiety.
She does endorse continued orthopnea, PND multiple times per week and possibly an increase in her LE edema.
She says that her cough is the same as it has been since her recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2206-8-20**] with a presumed viral URI.

- Illicits: Denies.
Family History: Father - Esophageal problems (unsure of the specifics), [**Name (NI) 5895**] Mother - Bradycardia, AAA 3 brothers all passed away: -Diabetes and heart attacks Sister: healthy  Physical Exam: Admisssion Physical Exam: VS  35.8  86  126/69  22  92% NC 6L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Microbiology: blood cultures ([**8-24**]):  [**1-14**] bottle coag neg staph [**8-26**] cultures no growth.
Imaging: CXR ([**8-24**]):  UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is continued moderate cardiomegaly.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists, but may be mildly improved when compared to the prior study.
Linear atelectasis in the right lung base is unchanged.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion, perhaps slightly improved compared to the prior study.
No new focal consolidation.
CXR ([**8-25**]):  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-24**], there is continued mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms suggests possible small effusions and atelectasis in a patient with low lung volumes.
Head CT [**8-25**]: FINDINGS: Again noted is encephalomalacia in the left cerebellum (image 3:3) and right occipital lobe (image 3:8), unchanged.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
There is no evidence of enhancing intraaxial or extraaxial lesions.
The ventricles and sulci remain prominent, compatible with age-related global atrophy.
No lytic or sclerotic bone lesions suspicious for malignancy are seen.
Thickening of the right maxillary sinus walls is again seen, likely sequela of prior chronic sinusitis.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new intracranial abnormalities.
MRI would be more sensitive for evaluating the status of intracranial malignancy and for detecting a seizure source, if clinically warranted.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 74 y/o F with a complicated PMH that includes chronic hypoxemia on home oxygen (4L during the day and 6L at night), untreated OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension and multiple recent admissions who presents after an episode of weakness at home with anxiety and shortness of breath .
#Dyspnea # Chronic hypoxemia #Obstructive sleep apnea #Obesity hypoventilation syndrome #Pulmonary hypertension  It is unclear if this is a true change from her baseline, as most of her complaints seem to be chronic and she has frequent dyspneic attacks which are closely correlated with anxiety attacks as well.
Her cough is unchanged from a recent admission and she is afebrile, with no leukocytosis or CXR findings that would support a pneumonia as the cause of her dyspnea.
Her current weight is 257lbs, which is 6lbs less than her recent discharge weight ([**8-20**]) which also makes a component of HF and volume overload less likely.
No wheezing on exam.
She has baseline severe OSA but does not tolerate CPAP.
We were also cautious about doing this because as her pulmonary physician has noted, she has substantial sleep apnea and is prone to CO2 retention.
She advised against starting an SSRI because the pt reportedly had some manic symptoms many years on SSRI.
#)Neovascular glaucoma c/b right eye blindness:  Continue home eye drops  #) Thrush: [**Month (only) 116**] be related to steroid inhaler use.
#) Neuro: The patient has a known seizure disorder (complication from CNS lymphoma).
Head CT was re-ordered as the patient does not remember the events prior to admission, results showed no acute changes.
