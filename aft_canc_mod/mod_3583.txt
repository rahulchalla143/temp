ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 53382**] is a 73 year-old male who initially presented to an outside hospital with a painless jaundice and a CA199 of 665 at which time he underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which was thought to be consistent with a ________ tumor and had a sphincterotomy and plastic stent placed with brushings at the time, which demonstrated atypical cells consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
He underwent CT scan, which did not show visible lesions and subsequently underwent removal of the plastic stent and the PTC.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2109-1-10**] and on that same day underwent cholecystectomy with a common duct excision and a left hepatic lobectomy and a pylorus sparing Whipple.
Intraoperatively there was noted to be a great deal of inflammation desmol plastic reaction in the porta hepatis and a mass at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts.
There was no note of excessive intraoperative blood loss and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition postoperatively from which he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
In terms of his hospital course from a neurological point of view the patient had no significant issues.
His pain was initially controlled with an epidural, which was managed by the Acute Pain Service.
This was weaned secondary to episodes of hypotension after which time narcotics such as morphine were used prn for sedation and pain control.
From a respiratory standpoint the patient remained intubated postoperatively for respiratory support, but the patient was planned to wean from to extubation on postoperative day five, but remained extubated secondary to complication of bleeding for which he was taken back to the Operating Room.
He did notably develop some pleural effusions postoperatively, but these were improving prior to discharge.
The final pathology from the surgery did reveal that he did have metastatic adenocarcinoma involving the lymph nodes and biliary ducts as noted.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay was notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix secondary to large amounts of fluid he received in the immediate perioperative period.
From a renal standpoint the patient's initial creatinine remained around 1.0 with slight variations, but was noted during the last week of his hospitalization to be slightly elevated and prior to discharge his creatinine was 1.4 with a BUN of 40.
There were no overt episodes of acute renal failure, although he did have some oliguria in the Intensive Care Unit for which he required albumin.
Notably the patient did have a G tube cholangiogram to evaluate for a leak via the T tube.
There was no evidence of leak and the intrahepatic right bile duct looked normal.
Hematologically as noted above the patient did have an episode of hypotension postoperatively along with a significant amount of a sanguinous output from his JP drain at which time he was taken back to the Operating Room and reexplored and found to have a bleeding vessel, which was then suture ligated.
After a two week course of the previously mentioned broad spectrum antibiotics he was switched over to Ciprofloxacin on postoperative days 21 and 17 for cholangitis prophylaxis.
In terms of laboratories prior to discharge his white blood cell count was 19.2 and was somewhat elevated, but the patient had been afebrile and no focal source of infection was noted.
