Biopsy revealed: Reactive changes consistent with radiation.
- [**2136-9-11**] CT torso (week 25) with mixed response;On [**2136-9-24**] MRI revealed mixed change in edema of two lesions in the brain - [**2136-10-11**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] started Avastin to help manage the inflammation and vasogenic edema seen on MRI.
Given her progression of disease on scan in [**2136-12-6**], we discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23804**] stopping Avastin and modifying her anti-seizure medications as necessary to determine whether she will be a candidate for study protocol as there are no other immune options available for her treatment.

There is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural abnormality, or central lymph node enlargement, and the heart is normal size.
[**3-14**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left occipital lobe lesion with expected postoperative pneumocephalus and trace subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No intraparenchymal hemorrhage is evident.
Redemonstration of edema associated with the right centrum semiovale and right vertex lesion.
Expected postoperative changes in the left occipital lobe including enhancement of the surgical cavity margins.
At the medial margin, the enhancement extends towards and abuts the falx, also likely postsurgical, however, residual tumor cannot be excluded, and attention on follow-up imaging is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 32 yo F with a PMHx of metastatic melanoma who has failed multiple treatments with measurable disease in multiple places including the left occipital lobe who p/f clinic prior to a scheduled resection of left occipital lobe brain lesion with a leukocytosis and increased LDH of unknown origin .
# Leukocytosis -etiology includes upper GI gastroenteritis, interstital pneumonia, atypical pneumonia in an immunosupressed patient, right buttock cellulitis or recurrent clot -plan -trend CBC, repeat is down signifcantly-may be from viral gastroenteritis that is now resolving -will send smears both for onc team and manual diff -CXR pa and lateral -check beta HCG -check urine legionella and induced sputum -will send patient for right buttock US to assess for abscess, overlying erythema in abscence of immunosupression would suggest a mild cellulitis but concerning in this patient -patient has a h/o MRSA infection in past and would likely need vanco but with wBC down trending will hold off for now -patient is satting well on RA and is not c/o CP, unlikely PE .
# increased LDH -in past has been as high as 900 -is likely from increased tumor burden -cont to monitor .
# h/o metestatic melanoma -cont to consider systemic treatments and neurosurgical intervention .
# Asthma -cont singulair and prn albuterol .
# h/o SZ -cont keppra .
#Prophy -scd's .
# dispo -pending infectios work up .
Surgery was without complication and she tolerated it well.
CT head post op revealed no hemorrhage.
This was deemed appropriate as pain was tolerable, PO intake was adequate and she was ambulating independently.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
