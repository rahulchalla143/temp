[**Name (NI) 18066**] Pt remained hemodynamically stable while on the floor with no signs of active bleeding.
Colonscopy performed on [**5-15**] demonstrated grade 1 non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids w/ anal tage, non-bleeding diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, small polyp in sigmoid colon o/w normal.
Likely source of bleed thought to be internal hemorrhoids.
Anemia As above, Hct increased with additional unit of PRBC, remaining stable.
Hemolysis and Fe studies were WNL.
Likely an acute on chronic picture with [**Month/Day (4) 18066**] worsening baseline anemia from MDS.
ST depressions on EKG Present on EKG from a yr ago.
Likely not ischemia as they have persisted.
Elevated troponins Pt presented w/ increased troponins which continued to be high on serial enzymes.
At baseline troponins have been elevated in the past, so likely [**3-12**] to chronic renal insuff.
and not demand ischemia  5.
CHF Pt with no overt signs of volume overload on exam while in unit.
