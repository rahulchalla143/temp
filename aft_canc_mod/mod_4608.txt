Admission Date:  [**2146-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-4-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 68839**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right great toe amputation  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with MDS, CAD, CHF, and CKD as well as multiple recent admissions for bacteremia secondary to a gangrenous toe who presented yesterday with fever and hypotension.
He is not able to endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain, dysuria/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.
He also endosres some loose stools over the past few days but no [**Age over 90 **] diarrhea.
No other abdominal symptoms and he denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
As the patient has had multiple admissions for bacteremia related to his toe gangrene vascular and podiatry were consulted regarding management.
He became hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS without much effect before before being started on norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.
He also defervesced and has been afebrile today.
[**Name2 (NI) **] report blood cultures from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab are growing gram positive cultures in pairs and clusters as well as gram negative rods.
Currently, he reports feeling fatigued but denies specific complaints.

Right great toe swollen with darker color and open wound at over the first MTP joint.
Bone with changes consistent with acute and chronic osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis.
Dense fibroconnective tissue with chronic inflammation.
Bone with marrow fibrosis compatible with chronic osteomyelitis  OTHER RESULTS ============== Chest Radiograph [**2146-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Right bundle-branch block.
Possible anterior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Transthoracic Echocardiogam [**2146-4-13**]: IMPRESSION:Prior (stable) antero-apical myocardial infarction with mild to moderately depressed LVEF.
No valvular vegetations seen.
Right Upper Extremity Ultrasound [**2146-4-13**]: IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of multiple bacteremias due to gangrene of the right great toe (initially precipitated by anatomical abnormality), myelodysplastic syndrome, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease presenting from rehab with fever and hypotension and found to be bacteremic again.
1) Bacteremia/Sepsis: Patient was clearly septic at presentation with hypotension requiring norepinehprine on the night of admission and positive blood cultures for MRSA.
On presentation to the ICU the patient received his daptomycin as well as a dose of pipercillin-tazobactam for broad coverage.
The most likely etiology of his recurrent bacteremia was considered to be his right great toe, which was status post multiple debridements, so this was amputated on [**2146-4-12**].
In order to rule out other sources of infection the patient had a CT abdomen and pelvis on recommendation on the infectious disease consult team, which showed no clear etiology of bacteremia though this was a suboptimal study due to the lack of IV contrast.
Given bacteremia with a PICC line in place the patient's PICC was discontinued on the recommendation of the ID consult service.
Surveillance cultures were persistently negative except for one set on [**2146-4-13**], which showed S. aureus raising concern for a persistent source of infection.
Given the patient has a pacemaker in place and had MRSA bacteremia there was concern for seeding, therefore TEE was considered necessary.
TEE did not show evidence of vegetations, but showed fibrous changes along the leads of Mr [**Known lastname 68840**] pacemaker.
Despite being on Daptomycin for MRSA and Ceftriaxone for Klebsiella, the pt continued to have positive blood cultures following amputation of the toe and TEE.
# Great toe gangrene: The patient has had chronic infection of his right great toe and he and his daughter had previously been unwilling to go through with amputation.
After he became bacteremic once again, however, they agreed to amputation.
Pathology on bone specimens revealed changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome / thrombocytopenia: Patient has history of transfusion dependent thrombocytopenia and chronic anemia.
# CKD: The patient has CKD with a baseline Cr of 1.7-1.9.
# CAD/CHF: Patient has a historical diagnosis of chronic systolic CHF with EF of approximately 40%.
Despite a history of CAD the patient is not on aspirin, statin, or beta blocker.
# Delerium: The patient was initially with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status presumed to be multifactorial and due to his infection and perhaps an element of ICU delirium.
This improved with transfer to floor and resolution of hypotension as well as treatment of infection.
The patient would continue to have short periods of confusion even on the floor but these were always brief, worse at night, and more consistent with sundowning, which was not considered concerning given the patient's advanced age.
He was restarted on tamsulosin after 24 hours of normal blood pressures and his foley was discontinued without incident.
Prostate exam was performed as part of an infectious work up and revealed no tenderness and UA's were persistently benign.
The pt was discharged with a condom catheter for urinary incontinence.
# Polymyalgia rheumatica: The patient has chronically (>1yr) been on prednisone for PMR.
Disp:*120 ml* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Season's Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: -Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteremia -Osteomyelitis of the right great toe  Secondary Diagnoses: Myelodysplastic syndrome Chronic systolic heart failure Chronic Kidney Disease   Discharge Condition: Pt breathing comfortably on room air.
We think the source of this infection was your infected toe.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizzyness, bleeding or any other concerning symptom, please return call your primary care doctor.
