Admission Date: [**2152-5-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2152-6-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-1-24**]        Sex:  M  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 62385**] is a 59-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted for cycle 1/week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
His oncologic history began in [**2148-7-22**] when he underwent right nephrectomy revealing an 11-cm right kidney mass with clear cell histology.
He did well until he developed hemoptysis in [**2151-7-23**] with CT scan showing a 3-cm right mediastinal mass and 2-cm right upper lobe nodule.
Bronchoscopy showed a fungating right upper lobe tumor with biopsy consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
During follow-up bronchoscopy in [**2151-12-23**] at an outside hospital bronchial washings revealed tuberculosis on [**2152-2-9**]; and he was initiated on tuberculosis medications at that time including isoniazid and rifampin.
MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypercholesterolemia, migraines, bilateral inguinal hernia repair, status post right shoulder arthroscopy, history of TB as above.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Reveals a well-appearing male in no acute distress.
LYMPH NODES: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
x14 potential doses.
During this week he received [**9-4**] doses with 6 doses held related to hypotension requiring ICU transfer.
Over the first several days he had the usual IL-2 side effects including fever, chills, nausea and diarrhea; improved with supportive medications.
However, on treatment day #4 he developed hypotension and was treated with slight increase in intravenous fluids as well as a fluid bolus x1.
Later that day he developed tachypnea and hypoxia with need for transfer to the intensive care unit.
On treatment day #5, his troponin was elevated - consistent with myocarditis - and he underwent an echocardiogram revealing left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 25% with global hypokinesis.
Cardiology evaluated the patient and felt this was consistent with myocarditis rather than acute coronary syndrome.
Later in the day on treatment day #5 he became more hypoxic and tachypneic and was intubated.
On [**2152-5-28**] he developed a fever; and vancomycin was added with cultures negative.
However, on [**2152-5-29**] he developed increased secretions; and Zosyn was added for probable pneumonia.
His tuberculosis medications were initially held due to transaminitis and were restarted with normalization of his liver function tests.
He remained afebrile and continued to improve rapidly over the next 4 days and was discharged home on [**2152-6-4**].
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post cycle 1/week 1 high-dose IL-2 complicated by hypotension and respiratory failure due to capillary leak syndrome.
