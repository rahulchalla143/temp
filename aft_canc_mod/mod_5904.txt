Symptoms began as palpitations while brushing teeth and then she was noted to have decreased O2 sats & SOB.
At [**Hospital1 80956**] as part of the work-up for the hypoxia, she was found to have multiple large PE's though she remained hemodynamically stable.
CT chest showed a left-sided effusion and a large right-sided PE with multiple other PE's throughout bilaterally, as well as evidence of right heart strain with a flattened intraventricular septum.
Attempts have been made to contact CT surgery regarding risks of lytics with recent CABG.

Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, as proximal as the distal right main pulmonary artery and involving bilateral lobar branches supplying all lobes bilaterally, with segmental and subsegmental involvement as well.
Slight bowing of the intraventricular septum, concerning for possible right heart strain.
Large left pleural effusion with associated overlying atelectasis.
Emphysema with pulmonary nodules as above.
Atrophic left kidney with numerous hypodensities, some of which are characterized as simple cysts, others of which are too small to characterize.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
The right ventricle is not well seen but may be dilated with mild basal hypokinesis.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
These findings could be consistent with a pulmonary  Admission: [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD WBC-6.9 RBC-3.89* Hgb-11.2* Hct-34.8* MCV-90 MCH-28.9 MCHC-32.2 RDW-15.1 Plt Ct-274 [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD PT-16.8* PTT-150* INR(PT)-1.5* [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD Glucose-93 UreaN-25* Creat-1.5* Na-139 K-4.3 Cl-100 HCO3-28 AnGap-15 [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2177-11-6**] 06:14AM BLOOD CK-MB-2 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-27 [**2177-11-6**] 06:14AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-26 [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD CK-MB-NotDone proBNP-1453* [**2177-11-5**] 02:45PM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-4.4 Mg-2.3 [**2177-11-5**] 02:49PM BLOOD Glucose-95 Lactate-1.1 Na-141 K-4.4 Cl-97* calHCO3-30  Discharge: [**2177-11-11**]  BLOOD WBC-6.3 RBC-3.14 Hgb-9.3* Hct-28.4 MCV-91  Plt Ct-184 [**2177-11-11**]  BLOOD PT-19.4 PTT-121.8 INR(PT)-1.8* [**2177-11-11**]  BLOOD Glucose-108 UreaN-23* Creat-1.3 Na-140 K-4.1 Cl-105 HCO3-24 AnGap-15   Brief Hospital Course: 73 yoF s/p CABG in [**10-6**] a/w large clot burden of bilateral PE's; hemodynamically stable with no indication for embolectomy/lytics on admission.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: The patient developed sudden worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia starting on the morning of [**11-4**].
She was brought to an OSH, where she was found to have multiple large PE's.
On admission, CT chest showed a left-sided effusion and a large right-sided PE with multiple other PE's throughout bilaterally, as well as evidence of right heart strain with a flattened intraventricular septum.
Given her PE were in the setting of surgery she should continue anti-coagulation for a minimum of [**1-31**] months.
Acute on Chronic Kidney disease: On admission the patient's creatine was up from her baseline of 0.8-1.0 to 1.5.
Given her history of cigarette use, followup with a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended in 6 months.
LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION: Patient with left plerual effusion seen on CTA.
The effusion should be followed up as an outpatient for resolution.
HTN:  Her BP meds were held initially for monitoring if hypotension in the setting of PE's.

Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had some blood clots in your lung and required heparin and coumadin, 2 blood thinners, to prevent the clots from getting bigger.
The CAT scan showed: Emphysema with pulmonary nodules as above.
Start Coumadin to keep the blood thin and prevent worsening of the blood clots.
Heparin intravenous drip to prevent the blood clots from getting bigger.
