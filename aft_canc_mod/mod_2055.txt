Admission Date:  [**2145-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-7**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress and aspiration  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD with removal of food impaction x 2 ERCP with major papilla sphincterotomy, stent placement, and biopsy of ampullary mass   History of Present Illness: 79 year old male with multiple sclerosis and paraplegia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, history of cerebrovascular accident and dementia was transfered from the [**Hospital3 **] after likely aspiration event during lunch.
The patient denies odynophagia, dysphagia in the past, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain.
He has had a 20 lb weight loss over several months most likely due to poor intake.
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for Esophageal-gastroduodenoscopy to rule out a foreign body aspiration.
Multiple sclerosis-paraplegia since [**2091**] 2.
CAD s/p CABG in [**2139**] 3.
CHF with EF of 25% 7.
L proptosis with visual loss 9.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds throughout.
No wheezes, rales or rhonci.
III/VI systolic ejection murmur at left upper sternal border.
ABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended with bowel sounds present and bilateral renal bruits.
No short term memory.
Spastic paresis in the legs.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2143-1-30**] sinus tachycardia is absent and ST-T wave changes are slightly more prominent.
Intervals: PR 122 QRS 84 QT/QTc 384/427 Axis: P 71 QRS 49 T -60  CXR [**2145-6-27**]: There is no radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
The appearance of the chest radiograph is unchanged when compared to [**2143-1-30**].
Long segment of narrowing and mucosal irregularity in the distal esophagus, may represent a stricture and/or ongoing esophagitis.
Two filling defects on the proximal duodenum probably corresponding to the abnormality seen on EGD.
MRCP [**2145-7-1**]: 1)  There is an enhancing 1.5 cm mass in the right lateral aspect of the ampulla, which only obstructs the common bile duct.
There are multiple surrounding lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 1.6 cm in short axis.
2)  Multiple tiny dependent stones within the intrahepatic biliary ducts and a single stone within the CBD.
The procedure was terminated due to trauma from the scope and duration of anesthesia.
Patient had minor hematoma formation/abrasions [**3-1**] vigorous instrumentation.
EGD also revealed a mass at the pancreatic ampulla and a mobile duodenal polyp.
The GI service recommended an upper GI with small bowel follow through to further elucidate the nature of the esophageal narrowing.
This study showed a narrowed esophagus with non-distensibility.
Patient underwent a speech and swallow evaluation with no evidence of aspiration with any food consistency consistent with normal oropharyngeal function.
The patient underwent a repeat EGD on [**2145-7-5**] which showed normal esophageal mucosa and no evidence of constriction, therefore dilation was not performed.
Ampullary Mass: Patient underwent MRCP which showed an enhancing mass, 15 mm x 11 mm at the right lateral aspect of the base of the common bile duct.
There was intrahepatic and extrahepatic duct dilatation with a common bile duct of 2 cm.
There were several enlarged periportal abnormal lymph nodes.
It was thought that the mass was consistent with ampullary adenoma or adenocarcinoma.
The patient underwent ERCP on [**2145-7-5**] which showed a large fungating malignant appearing mass in the major papilla.
A small spincterotomy was perfomed.
The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from pancreatic surgery who felt that the mass could be a benign adenoma or an adenocarcinoma.
If the mass were to be malignant then the patient would need to undergo a Whipple procedure, which would likely present too great a risk of morbidity and mortality for the patient.
This would necesitate a prior ERCP with removal of the metal stent and placement of a plastic stent.
Cholestasis: Patient had full obstruction of the common bile duct by the ampullary mass.
He did have mild RUQ pain to deep palpation, but did not develop fevers or signs of infection.
Urinary tract infection: Patient's urine culture initially grew coagulase negative staph.
Multiple Sclerosis: The patient was seen by the neurology service who were at first unsure that his presentation was consistent with multiple sclerosis.
An MRI of the C spine was obtained which showed mild degenerative disease at multiple levels.
No definitive evidence of central canal stenosis.
Some increased cord signal at C4 that could reflect demyelination consistent with multiple sclerosis.
The neurology service recommended follow up with an outpatient neurologist to discuss pharmacologic treatments for Multiple sclerosis such as interferon.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal impaction with food Esophageal narrowing and thickening Ampullary mass c/w adenocarcinoma, pathology pending Cholestasis Painless jaundice   Discharge Condition: Stable--improving serum bilirubin, afebrile.
Followup Instructions: Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21140**] in gastroenterology if you have additional swallowing problems or wish to discuss your condition further.
