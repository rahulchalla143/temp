On HD 2 pt's abdominal pain worsened and she was taken to the OR where she was found to have a possible right ovarian mass and necrotic small bowel.
Postoperatively she was noted to have a significantly decreased urine output, and a nephrology consult was obtained.
Nephrology confirmed the diagnosis of post IV-contrast nephropathy.
Pt was monitored in the SICU for the following 4 days to monitor closely her volume and renal status.
It was during this time that she developed one episode of hemoptosis after her swan was wedged.
The swan was removed and a CT surgery consult was obtained when a chest x-ray was read as having a possibly widened mediastienem.
CT showed no abnormality and CT surgery signed off.
On POD 11 she developed diarrhea and the suspicion of repeat c.diff enterocolitis was confirmed.
Pt was started on flagyl, but her white counts remained persistently elevated and a UTI of a poly resistant klebsiella grew.
On several occations, pt's PO2 dropped from the mid 90s to the high 80s, and her O2 requirement grew.
A swallow study during the day demonstrated no impairment, but aspiration precautions were initiated, especially at night.
