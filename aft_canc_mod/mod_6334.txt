[**7-8**] Imaging: CT Cspine: No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
Large C5-C6 posterior osteophyte with moderate central canal narrowing   CT abd: bladder rupture, + active extrav.
L sacral fx to the neural foramen.
non-displaced fx, though no definite fracture seen.
Congenital partial duplex left kidney with mild hydronephrosis in the upper pole moiety.
L adrenal nodule which can be further characterized by dedicated MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] adrenal protocol.
Two small hepatic hemangiomas.
Bilateral thyroid nodules.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2132-7-14**] IMPRESSION: Moderate white matter changes which could represent small vessel ischemic disease in the setting of underlying hypertension or diabetes.
Appearance is nonspecific, however, and differential would include demyelinating disease, vasculitis, Lyme disease or sarcoid.
Mild sulcal hyperintensity which could represent a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No evidence for hypoxic ischemic injury.
No evidence of bladder leak, at the site of prior rupture, with note made of suboptimal evaluation of anterior bladder wall.
Anterolateral mural irregularity on the left likely reflects post-surgical change.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented to ED, initially hemodynamically stable, with obvious deformity to left lower extremity.
She had a positive FAST exam and became hypotensive requiring large amounts of blood products as well as crystalloid resuscitation.
In the ED, she had remarkably bloody UOP and became hypotensive into the 50s.
CT scan of the torso [**7-8**] demonstrated: bladder rupture, + active extrav.
L sacral fx to the neural foramen.
non-displaced fracture, though no definite fracture seen.
Congenital partial duplex left kidney with mild hydronephrosis in the upper pole moiety.
On her imaging and trauma evaluation she was noted to have the following injuries: -Bladder rupture -Left LC1/2 with bilateral upper and lower pubic rami fx, ?
extends into acetabulum -Left sacral zone III fx -Left lumbar TP fx -Bilateral calcaneal fx -Left lateral malleolus fx -Left [**3-14**] MT head fx -Right Schatzker II tibial plateau The patient went to interventional radiology for her multiple pelvic fractures and bladder rupture and had an aortogram to evaluate for extravasation however the study was negative and no intervention was performed.
She was taken back to the OR on [**7-11**] for left pelvis pinning, repair of right tibial plateau, and abdominal closure.
For ~ a week she was persistently febrile up to 102 F and on CXR was found to have a left retrocardiac opacity; she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Given her continued fevers and cultures demonstrating yeast in the urine and sputum her antibiotics were restarted.
ENT was consulted for hoarseness and concern for vocal cord injury.
it was felt he the hoarseness was due to multiple intubations and no further interventions were recommended.
She has not displayed any behavioral problems and has consistently been cooperative with her care.
Because of her orthopedic injuries she is non weight bearing on both legs.
