Transthoracic lung biopsy - interventional radiology   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 112303**] is a 66yoF with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who is being transferred from the neurosurgery service for further evaluation of multiple brain metastases and a lung mass seen on imaging studies.
She was in her usual state of health through [**2151-7-25**] when she developed a frontal headache that was unresponsive to NSAIDs.
She had also described unsteadiness on her feet for a few days.
She presented to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where a head CT revealed a left frontal mass and multiple cerebellar lesions with effacement of 4th ventricle.
She was admitted to the neurosurgery SICU due to concern for mass effect and risk for hydrocephalus, though her vital signs were stable.
MRI confirmed the presence of the masses seen on CT with infra and supratentorial brain lesion suggestive of metastasis.
CT torso done for detection of primary lesion showed a large LUL lesion with satellite lesions in both lungs and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
She was started on dexamethasone and phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
Neuro-oncology was consulted, and recommended diagnostic biopsy of a lung lesion, with likely whole-brain radiation therapy for her brain metastases.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and recommended avoidance of transbronchial biopsy approach, as intubation could increase her intracranial pressure.
On arrival to the oncology floor, her vitals were:  Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No infection/drainage noted at tooth extraction site  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light,2.5 to 2.0 mm bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

#RADIOLOGY: []MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2151-7-27**] 5:52 AM IMPRESSION:  Numerous supra- and infratentorial enhancing lesions, with the largest lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere and left frontal lobe as above.
Considerations favour multifocal intracranial metastatic disease.
[]CT ABD & PELVIS AND CHEST W & W/O CONTRAST, ADDL SECTIONS Study Date of [**2151-7-27**] 10:20 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Findings are consistent with lung cancer originating in the left upper lobe with bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Multiple pulmonary nodules throughout both lungs are concerning for metastatic disease.
No evidence for liver or adrenal metastases.
[]CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2151-7-30**] 3:07 PM IMPRESSION:  Multiple pulmonary nodules as well as a dominant nodule within the left hilar region compatible with the patient's known metastatic neoplasm, with likely a lung primary.
Status post biopsy, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: []BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: 66yoF with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from the neurosurgery service for further evaluation of multiple brain metastases and a lung mass seen on imaging studies, c/f lung primary.
[]ACTIVE ISSUES: #.Brain and lung masses: Patient presented with headaches, dizziness, and unsteady gait.
After brain and body imaging revealed a lung mass with lesions in the brain, she was admitted to the neurosurgery SICU due to concern for mass effect and risk for hydrocephalus, though her vital signs were stable.
MRI confirmed the presence of the masses seen on CT with infra and supratentorial brain lesion suggestive of metastasis.
CT torso done for detection of primary lesion showed a large LUL lesion with satellite lesions in both lungs and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
She was started on dexamethasone and phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
Neuro-oncology was consulted, and recommended diagnostic biopsy of a lung lesion, with likely whole-brain radiation therapy for her brain metastases.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and recommended avoidance of transbronchial biopsy approach, as intubation could increase her intracranial pressure.
Patient has h/o GI polyp but otherwise no other onc history.
The plan is to consult interventional radiology to perform a CT guided transthoracic biopsy of the lung mass for tissue diagnosis.
In the event that IR considered this procedure to be too challenging, interventional pulmonology consented the patient for a bronch to obtain tissue diagnosis.
Neuro oncology had preliminary plan for whole brain radiation and possible decompression of cerebellar lesion.
Follow up CXR showed no evidence of a pneumothorax.
#.Dizziness and Nausea:  secondary to brain lesions, the most prominent of which is in the cerebellum which accounts for her dizziness and unsteadiness.
These symptoms resolved by day two of admission and she required no zofran in the 48 hours leading up to discharge.
She had no emesis and no falls during this hospitalization.
final pathology report pending from transthoracic biopsy.
