[**2195-8-1**]: New multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia with a suspected small left-sided pleural effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions have improved and associated with adjacent atelectasis, left greater than right.
There is no pneumothorax.
The patient is known with CLL: Deterioration of multiple axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
New bilateral pleural effusion and upper abdominal ascites are moderate.
The lung nodules related to Aspergillus infection have all improved.
There are no new lung nodules.
Left lower lobe consolidation is probably secondary to atelectasis.
Infection or aspiration are not excluded but are less likely.
Brief Hospital Course:  85yo man with CLL, CMV adrenalitis with adrenal insufficiency, chronic voriconazole treatment for invasive aspergillosis admitted for fever and cough due to pneumonia and a UTI with an indwelling foley cath.
# Fever/UTI/Pneumonia: Due to pneumonia and VRE/Pseudomonas UTI.
CXR initially showed question of multifocal infiltrates , however these resolved after diureses , therefore more likely were due to volume overload.
CT showed LLL iatelectasis and likely infiltrate.
Pt was initially started on Pip/tazo adn linezolide for HCAP pneumonia and UTI.
PIP/TAZO stopped [**2195-8-4**] and started cipro for pan-sensitive Pseudomonas in urine.
# Diarrhea:Initially treated empirically with metronidazole because of recent antibiotic treatment.
Diarrhea treated with a BRAT diet, loperamide and metamucil wafers.Diarrhea resolved and diet was advanced with good tolerance.
# Afib with RVR: At presentation in the ED.Likely [**1-29**] infection.
Pt deemed not a good candidate for anticoagulation given fluctuating plt counts with CLL and high risk for fall.
# Urinary retention: Due to BPH and sent home with Foley last admission.
Urinary retention being managed as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 151**] chronic Foley to be changed q4wks, last changed [**2195-8-1**] with purulent discharge which, per , urology , is likely from the skin/urethra.
Urine culture grew pan-sensitive Pseudomonas and VRE.
Last treated with alemtuzumab from [**11/2194**] through [**1-/2195**], discontinued due to infections.
# Adrenal insufficiency/CMV adrenalitis: Received stress-dose steroids in ED.
CT showed improvement.Continued voriconazole.
# Volume overload: Etiology unclear.
Echo [**2-/2195**] showed normal LVEF and no evidence of diastolic dysfuntion or rt sided failure .
Likely due to CLL adenopathy and acutely because of a.fib with RVR.
and fluid restricted to 2L/d.Dose of lasix will need to be titrated at home based on weight and LE  edema .
# DVT prophylaxis: Heparin SC.
Replete hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.
