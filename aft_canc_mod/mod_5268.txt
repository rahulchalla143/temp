Admission Date:  [**2148-6-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-11-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Known firstname 6169**] Chief Complaint: leukocytosis of unclear etiology  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bedside debridement of failed skin graft from outside hospital R IJ placement and removal PICC placement  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 58M with no significant past medical history who was admitted from clinic for further evaluation after being evaluated in Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] clinic for WBC of 83.9, with peripheral smear showing 8% blasts and atypical cells.
Patient reports that 4 weeks ago he developed a large "boil" on his right thigh, associated with fevers to 104.
Received tagged red cell scan which lit up in area of thigh lesion, but no other abnormalities.
Received skin flap over thigh lesion subsequently.
Tried topical steroids with some relief.
When the above issues were transpiring, patient saw a dermatologist and was started on oral steroids, and reports improvement in macular-appearing lesions on his body.
Was also on Doxepin for itching associated with rash.
On review of systems, patient denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or chest pain.
Reports unintentional weight loss over 40 lbs over the past year, from 260 to 219.
Reports having chills over the last couple of weeks, and fevers for 4 days as mentioned above.
No loss of appetite.
No melena or hematochezia.
No joint pain or myalgias.
No urinary complaints.
No cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy.
II/VI systolic murmur LUSB -> apex.
EXT: No clubbing or edema.
([**2148-6-13**]) CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are fully expanded and clear.
No pleural abnormality.
([**2148-6-14**]) CTA: IMPRESSION: No evidence for PE or dissection.
Slightly echogenic appearance of liver, borderline by ultrasound, but consistent with mild fatty infiltration present on the recent CT. 2.
Hypoechoic area near the gallbladder fossa, suggestive of focal fatty sparing, in spite of its mass-like appearance.
([**2148-6-14**]) ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the setting of tachycardia and hyperdynamic LV function.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion .
([**2148-6-13**]): Bone Marrow Biopsy --FISH: An expanded population of myelomonocytic precursor with increased myeloblasts (12% of total events) is present.
These findings are in keeping with the morphologic diagnosis of myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome (MPD/MDS), an overlap syndrome.
--Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy: Markedly hypercellular myeloid-dominant bone marrow with trilineage dysmyelopoiesis and ringed sideroblasts, consistent with a myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome (overlap syndrome).
See note Note:  Though blasts are increased both in peripheral blood and bone marrow they do not reach levels consistent with acute leukemia.
In addition, some of the morphologic findings, such as peripheral blood monocytosis and increased promonocytes in the bone marrow raise the possibility of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), perhaps the best well-defined MDS/MPD.
However, no history of monocytosis was elicited and in fact a year ago the patient reportedly have cytopenia.
Moreover, the neutrophilic and erythroid series exhibit extensive dyspoiesis, greater than usually seen in CMML with markedly elevated WBC.
Cytogenetic studies may be very helpful in further defining this condition since translocation of PDGFR is present in a fraction of CMML patients.
Though morphologically atypical for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), cytogenetic/molecular studies for [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome/bcr-abl need to be performed to rule out an atypical presentation of CML.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 58 year-old gentleman who was admitted from clinic for further management of leukocytosis of 80,000 of unclear etiology.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS Etiology of leukocytosis was multifactorial, including steroid use, possible infection, and underlying myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder, with the latter diagnosis predominating: - INFECTIOUS: Patient with recent R thigh carbuncle/abscess that was drained and debrided at outside hospital, then grafted.
Patient developed low grade fever thereafter, and it was felt that fever was due to cytokine release from lysis of cells secondary to chemotherapy (see below) and not infection.
No other localizing sources for infection could be found, CXR/UA/Blood cultures were without growth.
- HEME/ONC: Bone Marrow biopsy showed myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic overlap syndrome.
Given concerns for leukostasis from marked leukocytosis, patient started on hydroxyurea and prophylactic allopurinol was added to regimen.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management given concerns of respiratory demise from leukostasis.
Pulmonology team was consulted, felt that hypoxia was mainly attributable to fluid overload based on Chest CT findings.
Patient's symptoms improved with diuresis and was weaned off supplemental oxygen relatively rapidly.
Patient tolerated chemotherapy, and leukocytosis responded well.
Topical steroids were recommended as needed, but rash did not worsen and patient was not symptomatic from it.
Oral steroids were later added back to regimen as adjunctive treatment of underlying myelodysplastic disorder.
# EPIGASTRIC DISCOMFORT Patient with episode of diaphoresis and epigastric discomfort on evening of [**6-13**], with T spike to 101.
Suspected that this was due to plastics manipulation of abscess with SIRS-like response.
No EKG changes, CTA negative for PE or dissection.
Patient hsd been having similar episodes for the past 5-6 days, unclear whether this was due to underlying leukocytosis cuasing leukostasis, or GERD.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION 3 days after admission, patient went into Afib with RVR to 140s-150s.
ECHO showed preserved EF with dilated left atrium.
Chest CT confirmed presence of fluid overload.
No further episodes were experienced.
