Admission Date: [**2129-4-14**]        Discharge Date: [**2129-4-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-11-6**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old Creole speaking African American male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, who originally was admitted via the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 **] on [**2129-4-13**], with epigastric pain originally thought to be secondary to myocardial infarction.
CT scan performed at that facility showed a large liver mass and hematoma adjacent to that.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient is described as a moderately obese African American male in no acute distress.
There is no evidence of any lymphadenopathy in the anterior posterior lymph node chains.
The abdomen is noted to be moderately distended with some diffuse tenderness.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no evidence of any edema or swelling.
RADIOLOGY:  CT scan performed at [**Hospital3 **] shows a large abdominal hemorrhage and a perihepatic hematoma.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2129-4-14**], the patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of abdominal hematoma, liver biopsy and ligation of common hepatic artery and replaced left hepatic artery.
Soon after surgery, a renal consultation was requested and this confirmed chronic renal insufficiency with hemodialysis not considered to be necessary at that time.
Renal ultrasound performed showed no obstructive lesions or abnormalities in the kidneys  During postoperative day number two, blood product requirements remained extremely large including nine units of packed red blood cells, multiple units of fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
Soon after this, controlling hypertension became the main challenge with this patient delaying his extubation.
Ultimately, hypertension would necessitate Nitroglycerin, Lopressor, Hydralazine, Clonidine and an ace inhibitor.
On postoperative day number three through six, unit care was further complicated by the development of a pneumonia confirmed by x-ray.
Cultures of the sputum showed pansensitive Klebsiella and the patient was started on Levofloxacin originally 500 mg p.o.
On postoperative day number ten, examination of the patient's surgical wound showed a small area of drainage at the apex of the wound.
No large amounts of purulent material or wound breakdown were ever found.
While final pathology was not available at the time of this dictation, preliminary pathology and operative findings were consistent with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Hepatocellular carcinoma unresectable.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
The abdominal wound should be repacked twice a day with dry gauze.
