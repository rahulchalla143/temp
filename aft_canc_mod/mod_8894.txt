Patient was TTP in the RLQ, but could not further classify this pain.
CXR showed an enlarged cardiac silhouete, but no obvious consolidation.
Mental status started to worsen as patient became progressive more agitation.
In the ICU, patient remained lethargic and became disoriented.
On [**5-27**] mental status deteriation, deemed secondary to morphine and ativan adminstration/component of hypoglycemia, continued to deteriate and patient became hypercapneic and was intubated.
On [**5-28**] patient was started on CTX and azithromycin due to concern for PNA, sputum positive for gram possitive cocci, culture grew rare Asperigillos; Urine culture + for Garnderella and patient started on Flagyl.

Pelvis, Non-Obstetric -- Thickened endometrial stripe (5mm) on transabdominal US only.
No gross abnornmality of the myometrium is seen.
No bowel obstruction.
No acute CT findings to explain pain.
Transvaginal US ([**5-30**]) Endometrial stripe appears to be thickened up to 0.7 cm with a small fluid collection in the fundus.
Endometrial stripe appears to be irregular without evidence of flow within.
There is no evidence of free fluid within the pelvis.
There is no evidence of focal abnormality within the myometrium.
There is an abnormal appearance to the right upper zone.
Differential diagnosis includes parenchymal opacity, unusual prominence of vessels, or assymetric pulmonary edema.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
Changes in the right upper zone and right base and atelectasis at the left base is similar, allowing for technique.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo F with a past medical history of DM, CAD, CHF, CKD and Parkinson's presents with 2 weeks of vaginal bleeding, and noted to have ED course complicated by hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
Patient was intubated for poor mental status and hypercapnia, and once extubated on [**5-29**], mental status rapidly improved to "baseline" according to the family.
According the family, patient has dementia at baseline, and is not oriented to year secondary to illiteracy.
Hypoglycemia: Unclear precipitant as no dramatic changes to her sulfonylurea or insulin regimen.
Patient also on a betablocker which might mean she has asymptomatic hypoglycemia at baseline.
Additionally, ACS or sepsis could precipitate hypoglycemia but seems less likely as ROMI was negative and blood cultures were negative.
# Garnerella UTI: Asymptomatic UTI.
Vaginal bleeding: Given endometrial stripe on ultrasound, and age, there is concern for endometrial cancer.
Patient continued to have bloody spotting while in house.
Vaginal ultrasound showed thickened endometrial stripe to 0.7cm.
# Diastolic CHF: Initially euvolemic however diuretics were held after creatinine elevation in the ICU.
Patienty minimally volume up at time of discharge however symptoms of shortness of breathe resolved with no elevated JVP and trace edema in bilateral feet.
