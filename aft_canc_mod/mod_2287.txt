HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old male with an extensive past medical history, as noted above in the admission and discharge diagnoses, who has been having recurrent right pleural effusions postoperatively after his coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement in [**2129-10-15**].
Initially, this was attributed secondary to Dressler's syndrome which he had postoperatively which was treated successfully with Lasix and prednisone.
He had them tapped in [**2129-12-16**] and [**2131-3-15**] which initially relieved his symptoms of dyspnea.
The patient did undergo a cardiac echocardiogram which did not show evidence of CHF as the etiology of this.
From his pleural taps, his fluid analysis was negative.
The patient continues to have some dyspnea on exertion which is worsening and chest CT which was obtained to evaluate this showed a loculated right effusion.
The neck revealed scars consistent with previous biopsies but there were no palpable nodes and there was no JVD.
The chest was notable for prior sternotomy scar and right posterior incision from prior surgery.
Cardiac:  He was in regular sinus rhythm without any murmur, gallop, or rub appreciated.
There was no mass or hepatosplenomegaly palpable.
Extremities:  The lower extremities revealed mild bilateral edema on the right and there was a scar consistent with a prior right vein harvest.
The urinalysis was without evidence of infection.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on the date of admission, [**2131-6-4**], but the notable EKG changes of T wave inversion and ST segment depression in II and aVF with ST segment elevation in V1 and V2 forced the surgery to be cancelled and the patient was evaluated by Cardiology to rule out MI.
Cardiology had the patient undergo MI protocol and serial enzymes were obtained which did not evidence an acute ischemic event.
He also underwent an ETT-MIBI the next day which was performed and did not show any evidence of ventricular wall abnormality or ischemia and subsequently Cardiology cleared this patient for surgery.
It was noted that the patient subsequently went into a third-degree AV block and blood pressure returned to a rebound hypertension which required redosing of nitroglycerin.
The patient continued to remain in a heart block and bradycardiac and, therefore, transcutaneous pacing was initiated to which the patient did respond.
He did have an intraoperative TEE to guide the treatment which showed an EF of 40-45% with question of dyskinesis of the septum and anterior septal walls which was difficult to determine if it was related to previous cardiac surgery.
There was note of mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate MR.  Cardiology evaluated the patient immediately postoperatively in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit and discussed his complete heart block.
He did have an episode of acute renal insufficiency which was thought to be prerenal secondary to dehydration in which the patient's creatinine did subsequently recover after hydration was given.
There was note of intraprocedural complication and the patient was subsequently transferred to the floor from the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit the next day.
He did not have any further episodes of asystole and he remained on telemetry on the floor.
As the patient had been doing well postoperatively and subsequent to his pacemaker insertion it was determined that he could be discharged to home with proper follow-up as outlined previously with Cardiology and with Thoracic Surgery.
The patient's chest x-ray showed some bilateral pleural effusions but these were described as small to moderate and noted to be improved.
