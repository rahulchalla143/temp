He had been in USOH until today when he noted "weakness" and dizziness with standing.
Denies abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, SOB, fever, chills, lightheadedness, decreased PO intake, NSAID or steroid use.
His wife called ambulance to take him to ED for weakness and consripation and he had coffee grounds emesis x 2 in ambulance and subsequently in ED.
Denies any prior h/o GIB or similar symptoms.
NG lavage was positive for hemoccult positive coffee grounds which did not clear after 1L.
He was guaiac negative but was noted to have abdominal tenderness so CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained and revealed distended small and large bowel with air fluid levels suggestive of gastroenteritis.
GI and Surgery evaluated patient and recommended decompressing from above with NGT and enemas from below but no urgent indication for scope since HD stable.

[**2201-2-16**] MRI Abdomen:  Extensive dilated loops of small bowel and colon with apparent transition deep in the pelvis at distal colon.
Diffuse surrounding enhancement and suggestion of wall thickening of the colon is of unclear etiology, but given the lack of preferential FDG uptake on PET findings, this more likely is attributed to a fibrotic process from prior radiation treatment and/or stricturing from superimposed ischemic episodes than a high grade tumor.
[**2201-2-12**] PET/CT Abd: No FDG avid foci to suggest metastatic or recurrent colon cancer.
Multiple dilated loops of small and large bowel consistent with ileus.
Increased abdominal ascites in comparison to CT of [**2201-2-3**].
Right pleural effusion.
[**2201-2-7**] KUB: Upright and supine views of the abdomen show moderate-to-severe distention and wall thickening of the small bowel comparable to [**2-5**] and distention of the colon but no air in the rectum.
There may be gas in the sigmoid, but there is no gas in the rectum raising concern for distal obstruction, perhaps due to adhesions or more simply stool impaction.
[**2201-2-5**] CXR: Large dilated loops of bowel, no acute cardiopulmonary process .
[**2201-2-3**] CT Abd:  Distended small and large bowel with air fluid levels suggestive of gastroenteritis.
Extensive dilated loops of small bowel and colon with apparent transition deep in the pelvis at distal colon.
Diffuse surrounding enhancement and  suggestion of wall thickening of the colon is of unclear etiology, but given  the lack of preferential FDG uptake on PET findings, this more likely is attributed to a fibrotic process from prior radiation treatment and/or stricturing from superimposed ischemic episodes than a high grade tumor.

>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old man with colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy [**6-/2200**] and s/p bilateral ureteral stent placement initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for UGIB in setting of constipation and hematuria.
UGIB resolved, but constipation persisted.
After an extensive workup, was found to have a partial LBO likely secondary to malignancy.
Partial LBO:  The patient reported chronic constipation (BM q 7 days) worsening over the prior 3 weeks.
Had + flatus, but passing only very small stools.
KUB was suggestive of obstruction.
Flex sig and colonoscopy were initially attempted but failed to pass beyond 20 cm with poor visualization due to stool.
A PET/CT showed dilated loops of small and large bowel with no VDG avid foci.
A second attempt at colonoscopy showed an obstruction at approximately 30 cm beyond which the scope could not pass.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 9961**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4579**]d marked small and large bowel dilation with a transition point at the colosigmoid junction.
This is likely due to external compression from metastatic disease.
Clinically, the patient's abdomen remains distended and tympanic, but soft and nontender.
He continues to have flatus and very small, liquid stools.
There is no abdominal pain and no nausea/vomiting.
He was placed on TPN for persistent poor PO intake.
He was taken to the OR on [**2-19**] for palliative ileostomy.
UGIB:  The patient initially presented with coffee grounds emesis in setting of constipation.
The patient has not had a dramatic drop in Hct.
Remained HD stable during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay without current evidence of active bleed.
GI consulted performed EGD showing food in the esophagus without evidence of active bleed.
Foley has since been D/Ced and there is no evidence of UTI.
The patient is urinary incontinent.
PPx:  Pneumoboots, Heparin SC CODE:  DNR/DNI EMERGENCY CONTACT: Wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92899**]  Surgery: Patient continue to have symptoms of partial small bowel obstruction, poor food tolerance, abdominal distension and pain.
He had A MRI that showed extensive dilated loops of small bowel and colon with apparent transition  deep in the pelvis at distal colon.
On [**2201-2-19**] for exploratory laparotomy, we founded a copious amount of clear ascitic fluid in the abdominal cavity.
Palpation of the abdomen revealed carcinomatosis studding the mesentery, the small bowel, the residual large bowel and the liver.
There was a loop of small bowel in the right lower quadrant that was solidly adherent to the retroperitoneum.
He had a loop ileostomy in order to try to decrease acute symptoms of bowel obstruction.
They both understand the goals of care are palliative and comfort oriented, patient and family decided they would like to have hospice involvement.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
