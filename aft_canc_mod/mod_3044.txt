Increased size of primary rectosigmoid mass with conglomeration of pathologic lymph nodes.
New spinal metastases in T7, T8, T11, and new growth in L1.
Cortex markedly thinned but intact.
Pathologic fracture of right 5th rib and left pubic ramus.

# Hypovolemic Shock: Related to acute blood loss with possible overlap with sepsis from a pulmonary source.
Patient admitted with HCT down to 14.8 from 28 and reports of black stools x 1 week prior to admission.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was sent to the hospital by family because of cough and lavbored breathing.
He was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (though CXR was limited by position).
Given recent hospitalization, he was staretd on vanc/zosyn for HCAP cioverage.
He was also found to be severe acidemic with kussmal's breathing on admission.
The family iniitally wanted to maintain current level of care with pressors, antibiotics and no intubation.
# Abdominal Pain: etiologies of abdominal pain and distention include ischemic bowel vs obstruction vs peritonitis.
# Acute kidney injury: On admission Cr 4.5 up from baseline 0.8 and related to hypotension from acute blood loss and sepsis.
Given the patient's abdominal distention and the risk of obstruction, kayexalate was not given as this can cause necrotizing colitis in this case.
EKG showed persistent peaked t waves despite these interventions.
#Metabolic Acidosis: ABG 6.83/28/248, secondary to hypovolemic and septic shock.
Etiologies include underlying liver disease [**3-12**] metastatic disease, shock liver, GIB, and DIC.
