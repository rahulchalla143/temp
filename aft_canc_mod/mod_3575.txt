To summarize, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year- old woman who presented with a 60-pack year smoking history to an outside hospital with 3 weeks history of cough and weight loss.
Her work-up at that time included a CAT scan on [**3-12**] at the outside hospital demonstrating left lower lung collapse and a mass in the left hilum.
She underwent multiple bronchoscopies here, as well, demonstrating left main stem obliteration with tumor, with attempted but unsuccessful clearing of her airway to reinflate her left lower lobe which occurred with multiple bronchoscopies, attempts at ablation therapies, and stenting.
Her postoperative course was significant for ongoing pressor requirement which eventually subsided, and she was extubated on postoperative day six.
She subsequently developed rapid atrial fibrillation and Klebsiella pneumoniae with copious secretions.
She had to be reintubated, and developed a large right pleural effusion.
A tracheostomy was performed on [**5-14**] to assist with her pulmonary toilet, and her chest tube was placed around the same time to try to drain this large pleural effusion around the only remaining lung.
She is currently on the floor with a Passy-Muir valve, on tube feeds at goal, starting with POs with strict aspiration precautions, and going to the rehabilitation facility.
In the time between late [**Month (only) 547**] where she was set to go to rehab and the current time, she had an episode on the floor which was responsible for the delay, where she was tachycardic in SVT with decreased blood pressure and poor oxygen saturations in the 80s.
Hemodynamic instability.
Inotrope pressor requirements.
Hypertension history.
11.History of left carotid occlusion.
13.Multiple bronchoscopies in past, as well.
20.Enterococcus urinary tract infection.
22.Status post multiple chest tubes, all removed.
She is going to rehabilitation and will  need respiratory therapy, pulmonary toilet, trach education, frequent suctioning, frequent nebs, negative fluid balance, antibiotics for a short time, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing care to check wounds, cardiorespiratory checks, evaluation for home services with social work given her prolonged hospitalization and her elderly husband, speech therapy, [**Name (NI) 36422**] valve ongoing, as well as strict aspiration precautions, given that she has one lung, has suffered a tremendous amount of respiratory compromise over the past few months, and would find an aspiration event absolutely devastating and probably life-threatening.
