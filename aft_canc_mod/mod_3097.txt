Esophageal mass.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed, questionably secondary to esophageal mass.
History of chronic renal insufficiency.
Esophageal mass-pathology pending.
History of chronic renal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old male who had had multiple episodes of hematemesis along with associated nausea but without abdominal pain most recently, about two days prior to admission, on [**2104-7-14**], but noted that this had been going on for about two weeks.
According to the patient, he initially presented to an outside hospital and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which observed distal esophageal bleeding at 28 to 30 cm and was injected with epinephrine.
It was subsequently re-evaluated with an EGD which showed no bleed.
Notably on EGD, there was a significant tumor which was described as "large, ulcerating, bulky, extending 28 to 35 cm from the incisor".
The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for definitive evaluation of this tumor with a possibility of operative intervention.
He appeared to be in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Unremarkable, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, no ascites noted.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses, no notable clubbing or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and initially underwent a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in order to assess for the extent of the lesion and also possible metastatic disease if this was, in fact, a cancer.
Notably, the CT scan showed thickening of the mid-esophagus which likely corresponded to the known esophageal mass.
There was an enlarged subcarinal node but this could have also been a direct extension of the mass.
Right sided pulmonary nodules were seen and an 8 mm gastrohepatic ligament node and soft tissue nodules posterior to the liver were seen, which may have represented metastatic disease.
There was a right greater than left septal thickening and ground-glass opacity in the lungs, which were consistent with congestive heart failure, but there is a possibility of these being lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Incidentally, there were renal cysts and diverticula present.
Subsequent to this evaluation by cardiothoracic surgery, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy to evaluate the extent of disease and also to determine what treatment options the patient could undergo.
There were no definitive intraoperative findings aside from the likelihood that there was not any notable esophageal perforation.
On postprocedure day one, the patient was scheduled to have a clinic visit for further evaluation of this and we will schedule him for an outpatient PET CT scan for evaluation for metastatic disease.
