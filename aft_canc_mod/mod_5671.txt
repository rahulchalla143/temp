Admission Date:  [**2169-6-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-6-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Neosporin / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: fever, delta MS, incontinence   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement [**2169-6-21**]   History of Present Illness: HPI obtained from wife due to change in pts mental status.
76 yo with poorly differentiated lung carcinoma (likely small cell) on etoposide and carboplatin, recurrent sternal wound osteo/infection requiring debridements and flaps, s/p CABG in [**2166**], CAD s/p MI and CABG, DMII, HTN, COPD who presents after being discharged from [**Hospital1 **] rehab yesterday with fever.
He then became incontinent of urine and became "short" with her.
His wife notes that he becomes confused every time he has a fever, and states he was admitted in [**3-20**] with fever and confusion.
The pt was seen by thoracic surgery in the ED and it was felt the pt has a chronic chest fistula.
CT of the chest showed no drainable collections.
His first cycle was complicated by neutropenic fever, although he was receiving neupogen daily.
The pt reportedly had insomnia and sundowning at OSH with a negative head CT.   Past Medical History: Onc Hx per OMR: In [**1-16**] pt was in the doctor's office for routine checkup and was noted to have hemoptysis at that time.
He therefore had a chest x-ray that showed a right upper lobe mass which was followed by a CAT scan that showed a 2.2 x 1.9 cm right upper lobe nodule as well as a 7.5 x 4.4 x 6-cm soft tissue lesion in the anterior right chest wall anterior to the right clavicle, also diffuse moderate emphysema.
This was followed by a PET scan on [**2169-3-2**], which revealed an FDG-avid nodule in the right upper lobe with a maximal SUV of 24.6 that measured 2.2 x 1.9 cm, also a right hilar 9 mm lymph node with an SUV of 8.9 as well as increased activity in the sternal area in the surgically created muscle flap at the patient's sternal resection site.
He then underwent mediastinoscopy on [**2169-3-6**] with bronchial washings, which were negative, and also had an I&D and sternal debridement.
He was presumed to have nonsmall cell lung cancer and went in for a fiducial placement in the right upper lobe mass for CyberKnife.
At the same time they did an FNA of the nodule which was consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma with features of small cell.
--CAD - IMI in [**2165**], s/p CABGx4 in [**2166**], which was complicated by mediastinitis and sternal osteomyelitis and MRSA wound infection.
sternal wound infection requiring sternal debridement and omental flap reconstruction.
He subsequently developed multiple sinus tracts emanating from osteo.He had a pec flap repair on [**5-16**].
--incisional hernia -- s/p repair and recurrence --COPD/emphysema on home night time O2 --T2DM - controlled by meds and diet --HTN --hypercholesterolemia --GERD --anemia - monthly procrit --hyperlipidemia --prior right frontal lobe and left caudate infarct --h/o confusion, fever, urinary incontinence on admission [**3-20**]   Social History: Married for 52 years; taken care by wife at home.
Family History: FH: no h/x of cancer or CAD  Physical Exam: PE: Vitals: T 102.6 P 115 BP 120/78 R 24 Sat 96% 3LNC GENERAL:  overweight elderly male, lying on his side, A and Ox2-->somnolent, not answering most questions HEENT:  bilateral esotropia, PERRL, conjunctivae noninjected/anicter NECK: No LAD, supple CARDIOVASCULAR:  Tachycardic.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with distant breath sounds; noted by resident to have Cheynne [**Doctor Last Name **] respirations ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, protuberant, normoactive bowel sounds with a reducible ventral hernia.
CT Chest [**2169-6-16**]: FINDINGS: The soft tissue mass in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe previously measuring 3.2 x 1.8 cm is almost completely resolved, now 0.5 x 1 cm with a fiducial marker in it.
Right hilar adenopathy seen just below the first mass (I 2:23) has resolved.
A 1.3x1.3 cm LLL nodule with calcification within it is stable or even smaller.
Prominent centrilobular emphysema involves mostly the upper lobes.
The omental flap contains new areas of induration adjacent to the previous fluid collection in the sternotomy bed which is now a large thick walled cavity with a far wider connection to the surface, perhaps due to debridement.
It still has a long extent long contiguity with pericardium but there is no pericardial effusion or other fluid collection in the mediastinum.
Several, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1 x 2 cm, are stable.
There is no pleural effusion.
The imaged portion of the abdomen does not reveal any pathology within the liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas and adrenals.
Several large gallstones are stable, with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Almost complete resolution of right lung mass and hilar adenopathy.
New right middle lobe nodule, could be tumor or infection.
Unchanged left lower lobe nodule and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
Large, infectious cavity in the sternal bed, with large percutaneous fistula or tract formation.
There is significant soft tissue enhancement in this region, consistent with underlying infection.
However, the pericardial fat remains normal in signal and this anterior chest wall infection does not appear to communicate with the mediastinum.
A few subcentimeter lymph nodes are seen inferior to the two fistulae.
Limited imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates no significant abnormality.
The aorta is normal in caliber, with mild atherosclerotic disease.
Two large fistulae within the anterior chest wall at the sternectomy defect with significant soft tissue enhancement consistent with infection.
No communication to the pericardium or mediastinum.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 76 yo with poorly differentiated lung carcinoma (likely small cell) on etoposide and carboplatin, recurrent sternal wound osteo/infection with MRSA requiring debridements and flaps, s/p CABG in [**2166**], CAD s/p MI and CABG, DMII, HTN, COPD who presented after being discharged from [**Hospital1 15454**] rehab the day prior to admission with fever and mental status changes.
The pt was transferred to the ICU overnight for neurologic monitoring.
#Fever: The pt was admitted with fever of 102.6, RR 24, tachy to 110s, concerning for impending sepsis.
Given the pts somnolence and mental status changes, the pt was tranferred to the ICU as per above on the night of admissin.
CT of torso and CXR were unrevealing of any clear source of infxn but large soft tissue collection in anterior chest was visualized and read as a possible abscess vs iatrogenic tract formation.
Given his mental status changes, the pt was started on Vanc/Ceftaz (to cover pseudomonas) and Flagyl on the floor.
Head CT was negative for any acute change on admission.
The pt also became afebrile overnight in the ICU.
On transfer to the floor, the pt was continued on Vancomycin only to cover for possible soft tissue MRSA infection.
MRI of the pts sternum was ordered and revealed soft tissue enhancement in the anterior chest wall.
Radiology confirmed that the pts soft tissue infection was draining through his fistula.
Although the pts wound cx was growing pseudomonas (pansensitive), this was felt to be a colonizer (according to ID) given pt has been afebrile on Vancomycin.
The pt remained afebrile from HD#2 on.
# Diarrhea: The patient developed soft brown stool post chemotherapy with transient resolution on [**6-26**].
If diarrhea continues, would recommend resending the C dificile antigen test.
#Mental Status Changes:  Per pts wife, pt becomes confused with incontinence whenever he has a fever.
He was admitted in [**3-20**] with fever and confusion as well.
Sources included infection as discussed above.
There was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect on CT of the head on admission.
Remote infarcts in the right frontal and left caudate lobes were noted.
His glyburide was also held given the pt was confused and not eating.
On admission his lopressor/cozaar were held in the setting of possible impending sepsis.
#Small cell cancer in R lung: The pt received carboplatin/etoposide during this admission from [**Date range (1) 66873**] without any side effects.
His CT shows resolution of the 2 R lung masses, although there is a new RML nodule which denotes a mixed response.
#Anemia: Pt has baseline anemia with hct 25-30.
