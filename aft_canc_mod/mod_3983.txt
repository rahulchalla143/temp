There is compression of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and also the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], with contralateral mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.

There is minimal medial deviation of the uncus without frank uncal herniation.

However, due to decreased pneumocephalus, the leftward shift of the septum pellucidum and third ventricle is stable or minimally decreased.
In comparison to prior study, there is no significant interval change in the extra-axial and intraparenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding mass effect in the post-surgical bed.
