Past Medical History: PMHx: Pancreatic cancer - Adenocarcinoma, grade I, T3, [**3-12**] LN.
Myelodysplastic syndrome s/p splenectomy - diagnosed 15 years ago, ringed sideroblastic anemia diagnosed via BM biopsy.
Multiple GI bleeds [**2-15**] angioectasias from XRT.
Anemia Squamous cell carcinoma in-situ Diabetes BPH Gout Scarlet fever as a child Diverticulosis   Social History: The patient was married, had three children and quit tobacco in [**2122**].
Family History: His sister died of congestive heart failure.
No oral ulcers or lesions.
No hepatomegaly.
1+ pitting edema at ankles.
5/5 mm strength.
Urine culture: negative Blood cultures x2: no growth to date Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen negative .
Diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings are thought more likely due to edema and less likely atypical infection, given the rapid change.
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism is noted.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild degree of compressive atelectasis are noted.
Increased interstitial marking and increased prominence of soft tissue along the bronchovascular bundles suggest heart failure pattern.
CXR [**2-27**]: 1)  Marked improvement to bilateral pulmonary edema with mild amount of interstitial pulmonary edema remaining.
2)  Improvement of bilateral pleural effusions with small right greater than left effusions remaining.
A small area of right lower lobe opacification remains.

Upon admission, it was thought that the pt's dyspnea and hypoxia were multi-factorial, including fluid overload [**2-15**] elevated BPs in pt with known [**1-15**]+ MR, pneumonia, and possible metastatic disease in the lung parenchyma.
CTA was negative for PE and demonstrated new b/l pleural effusions.
A rapid resp viral antigen panel was negative.
The pt was diuresed while in the MICU and placed on CTX/azithromycin with improvement in SOB and a decrease in oxygen requirement.
CXR without nodules suggestive of metastatic dz; however CTA did reveal multiple subcentimeter nodules that may be concerning for metastatic dz.
However, his CA [**66**]-9 was not elevated on admission, thus making progression of pancreatic CA less likely.
While on the floor, the pt's BPs were noted to be persistently elevated to teh 170-180s/70-90s.
He will continue to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further care of his MDS and pancreatic cancer.
