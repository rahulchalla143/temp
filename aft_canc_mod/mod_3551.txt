The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Distal LV/apical akinesis to dyskinesis is suggested.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If indicated, a repeat TTE with echo contrast (Definity) or cardiac MRI may better assess regional/global LV systolic function and exclude apical thrombus.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, but there is new consolidation in the left lower lung, worrisome for interval progression of infectious process.
Loculated pleural effusion along the left pleural surface is unchanged.
Right basal consolidation has slightly improved in the interim.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2172-1-26**] 10:36 AM IMPRESSION: Limited assessment of the calf veins without evidence of DVT.
Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp.
SIRS / sepsis / septic shock: Most likely etiology of her shock was sepsis secondary to pneumonia.
She had a low grade fever with hypotension and an elevated white count.
Congestive heart failure, systolic, acute on chronic.
Likely produced in the setting of acute illness with IVF administration.
Coronary artery disease and chest pain.
Had intermittant chest pains which were somewhat different from her chronic chest pain.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.1 on [**2172-1-18**] and was 3.5 on admission.
She was volume resuscitated with 6L and her creatinine normalized to 1.0 prior to transfer to the floor.
History of malignant nerve sheath tumor (s/p removal from left anterior chest wall [**6-18**] and radiation [**2172**]).

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low [**Location (un) **] pressure, high white [**Location (un) **] cell count, hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and acute renal failure.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit and treated for a presumed pneumonia.
