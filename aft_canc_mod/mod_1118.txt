Upon arrival to the hospital, she was found to have a right flailed chest and a pneumothorax which was small.
Her hip was displaced and manually reduced, and she was found by ultrasound to have blood in Morison's Pouch.
She underwent exploratory laparotomy with discovery of a spleen laceration, and she underwent a splenectomy.
She had a head CT performed which showed frontal lobe lesion consistent metastasis.
She had a long hospital course including prolonged intubated, ARDS, Acinetobacter pneumonia treated with Cephalosporin which resulted in a rash, and she was subsequently treated with Gentamicin and Levofloxacin.
She also had left pleural effusions which were tapped twice.
She also had a right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis secondary to line placement.
She also had small peripheral pulmonary embolisms in her chest by CTA scan; however, she is on no anticoagulation due to the bilateral frontal lobe lesion consistent with metastasis found in her brain.
While in the hospital, she underwent a chest CT which showed a hilar mediastinal lymphadenopathy approximately 2 cm in size with abnormal left upper lobe lesion which was suspicious for small cell cancer given the patient's long history of smoking.
The patient underwent MRI of the head to evaluate her frontal lobe lesion which found frontal lobe lesions which were indicative of metastatic disease.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the floor on [**2106-9-27**], at which time she was complaining of no chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
She had a small amount of diarrhea but no dysuria or urinary symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of hypertension, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
General:  In terms of her physical exam, she had a depressed affect, otherwise there were no abnormalities.
Lungs:  Examination revealed bibasilar crackles, but she was moving good air throughout.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Right upper extremity was tender and erythematous.
Sputum cultures on [**9-23**] were consistent with many atypical cells, but no malignancy was observed.
MRI without contrast showed a left frontal temporal lobe at 3.1 x 2.7 cm, heterogeneous enhancing lesion without evidence of hemorrhage.
There was a left parietal lobe lesion representing a hemorrhage.
There was no evidence of ventricular dilatation.
There were multiple enhancing foci suspicious for metastatic lesions with some mass affect and shift of the midline.
Malignancy work-up:  The patient was seen by Pulmonary consult and underwent chest CTA which showed improvement of the left upper lobe lesion with no change in the mediastinal lesion.
She underwent an abdomen and pelvis CT which were negative for evidence of primary cancer or metastatic disease.
The patient was also seen by Neurosurgery who at that time were deferring any type of craniotomy or needle biopsy of brain lesions for diagnosis.
The patient decided to forego any further inpatient work-up of malignancy and defer to outpatient work-up in order that she might begin her rehab.
Hematology/DVT:  The patient has a right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis which was in the setting of a central line.
She subsequently underwent a right upper extremity ultrasound which showed that the patient still had persistence of clot in the right upper extremity with no evidence of the clot enlargement or increase in burden.
Depression/Psychiatry:  The patient continued to have a flat affect.
Per her discharge, we are awaiting the results of her thyroid stimulating hormone test to rule out hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Urinary tract infection:  The patient was found to have a positive pyuria and bacteria and was subsequently treated with Bactrim for a 10-day course.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was adequately stable with resolution of her right upper extremity edema and swelling with improvement in her physical ability to walk and to move around with improvement of her ability to tolerate pureed foods and with resolution of her requirement for oxygen to maintain oxygenation on room air.
Bipolar disorder.
Right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with primary care physicians for further work-up of her malignancy.
