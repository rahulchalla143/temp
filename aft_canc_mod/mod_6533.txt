History of Present Illness: 42-year-old female who underwent a proton beam therapy for an ocular melanoma in [**2158**].
She had recurrence in [**2163**] and again received proton beam irradiation.
She has been followed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 81582**] and on [**2167-11-17**] she was noted to have an elevated alkaline phosphatase of 189.
A CT scan on [**2167-12-31**] demonstrated a 4 cm mass in the dome of the liver in the right lobe (segment 7, 8) and a second 5 cm lesion in segment 4b (medial segment of the left lobe).
Pre-op MRI of brain was negative, and chest CT demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
Physical Exam: VS: 98.2, 115/50 NCAT, EOMI, moist mucous membranes Neck supple without anterior or posterior LAD Tachycardia, normal S1 and S2, no M/R/G Decreased BS at R. base markedly different from the L. base where she is quite clear to auscultation soft, distended, appropriately tender along the R. upper flank.

Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 37914**] note, at the time of exploration, she had a large mass in the dome of the liver that was adherent and superficially growing into the right hemidiaphragm.
There was a large amount of necrotic tumor in the segment VIII mass.
Ultrasound also demonstrated the lesion in the medial segment of the left lobe.
No other lesions were seen in the left lateral segment.
Please see the op note for surgical detail.
The ultrasound showed appropriate waveforms in the left portal vein, which is patent.
Limited waveforms of the left hepatic artery appear normal.
There is no fluid collection or ascites.
Of note, the biopsy revealed: Liver, right lobe: Metastatic melanoma, extending to within 1 mm of posterior resection margin.
