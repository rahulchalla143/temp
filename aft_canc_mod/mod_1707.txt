No large effusions are visualized.
Moderate perihilar haze.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2127-2-26**] 4:36 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient had an open right colectomy for her colon mass.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: By POD#1, the patient continued to have marginal UOP since the OR.
The patient was baseline anemic from her colon cancer, and she had an expected drop in her Hct with the addition of IVF resuscitation.
Several hours later, she developed acute shortness of breath with desaturation.
She was found on CXR to have pulmonary edema.
CARDIOVASCULAR: At the time when she developed pulmonary edema, the patient was noted to have an elevated troponin (0.1).
It was thought that she was not having an MI, and that this was likely demand ischemia.
For a short period of time after intubation on POD#1, the patient required phenylephrine for blood pressure support, but this was discontinued the same night.
On POD#2, as she was being transferred back to the floor, she developed atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Following her second extubation, she had no further respiratory issues and saturated adequately on room air.
HEME: The patient had baseline anemia (Hct about 27) associated with her colon cancer.
ID: Intraoperativley, the patient was found to have had a perforated colon cancer.
Her wound remained without signs of infection.
ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was monitored, and she had no active endocrine issues.
PROPHYLAXIS: This was maintained with subcutaneous heparin, aspirin when she developed elevated troponin, pneumatic boots, and ambulation when safe and cleared by PT.
She needs follow-up by her PCP for management of her atrial fibrillation and potential anticoagulation.
She was ambulating well with assistance, her bowel function had returned, her heart rate was controlled, and her pain was controlled by tylenol.
