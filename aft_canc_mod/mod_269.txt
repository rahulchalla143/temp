He was  treated with Casodex alone from [**10-1**] until [**3-2**] with minimal response.
Several months ago, he was treated with Casodex again,  which was [**Date Range 8910**] for rising PSA and elevated LFTs.

Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo m w/ chf, avr, ms, w/ h/o vomiting, fever, cough, febrile on admission, tachycardic, w/ elev lactate, and no obvious source of infxn.
1) sepsis- On arrival to the ICU pt afebrile c no WBC but tachyc, tachypneic c increased lactate.
CT of chest showed L pul infiltrate.
CT abdomen showed GB wall thickening but no evid of GI source.
Pt developed rash in UE after one vancomycin administration, so abx given more slowly subsequently.
No additional reaction noted.
Bedside swallow showed pt at risk for aspiration and so this likely contributed to his development of pna.
Fluids- elev cvp but pt likely always runs high given known severe MS.
Concerned that patient was relatively hypovolemic given h/o vomiting, elev lactate; therefore, initially given IVF boluses despite elevated CVP.
2) chf- Pt significantly overweight but as stated previously concern for hypovolemia.
Fluid status balanced between diuresis for possible volume overload in the lungs and need for increased perfusion to the tissues.
On [**2136-8-3**] pt hypotensive c decreased RR and fixed and dilated L pupil.
Pt's liver and cardiac enzymes as well as his lactate elevated, indicating inadequate perfusion of his end organs.
4) elev amylase/lipase- likely [**2-1**] ongoing vomiting, no clinical evidence of pancreatitis.
