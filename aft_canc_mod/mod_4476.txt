At that time he started to feel increasingly fatigued.
He noted that he was short of breath, even with minimal exertion, which was unusual for him.
He also started to develop chills and drenching night sweats.
About two weeks ago he started to notice a pain in his left side.
Last week he saw his PCP who thought he had a URI and a muscle strain and he was started on Avelox and Percocet.
Since then he has had intermittent nausea and vomiting.
He has continued to have nausea with minimal vomiting.
He returned to his PCP on day of admission who sent a CBC which was significant for anemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as a WBC of 16 with an abnormal differential.
Per patient's report, he has had "normal blood work" in the past and has never been anemic.
He has not had any other illnesses recently.
He denies any headaches or visual changes.
He has shortness of breath when climbing up the stairs or performing basic ADLs.
He notes intermittent chest tightness that "comes and goes" which is more chronic for him.
He had an episode of diarrhea yesterday.
No urinary symptoms.
No gingival bleeding or epistaxis.
No lower extremity edema.
Past Medical History: Anxiety and seasonal allergies  Social History: Patient is divorced.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Nonspecific hyperdensity in the posterior aspect of the spleen.
Prominent lymph nodes in the porta hepatis, and portacaval lymph node, with a large number of small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Left kidney is low positioned, but likely from an enlarged spleen.
Small left fat-containing hernia.
Transverse colon compressed below the tip of the spleen, of uncertain clinical significance, correlate with clinical symptoms (if any).
MRI HEAD [**10-3**]: IMPRESSION: Focal acute infarction which appears to be cortically-based, in a non-arterial vascular distribution involving the left frontal and parietal lobes.
Susceptibility artifact in the overlying veins and superior sagittal sinus is concerning for venous thrombosis.
The findings likely represent acute venous infarction.
A tiny focus of T1 hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe may represent a small focus of hemorrhage, which progresses rapidly to become much larger on the subsequent head CTs.
A wet [**Location (un) 1131**] was given by the resident to Brit Guims at 5:10 p.m. on [**2117-10-3**] stating "Cortically based infarct DWI/ADC abnormality in the left parietal area involving pre- and mainly post-central gyrus area consistent with acute infarct.
GRE blooming in the left M4 cortical branches may indicate clot and seen to vertex."
An additional [**Location (un) 1131**] describing the venous nature of the acute infarct and acute thrombosis of cortical veins and the superior sagittal sinus was given to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3461**] [**Name (STitle) 12332**] (Neurology service) at 11:00 a.m. on [**2117-10-4**], and the findings were fully discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], shortly thereafter.
CT HEAD [**2117-10-4**]: Large hemorrhagic transformation of left MCA territory infarct with severe increased edema and rightward shift of midline structures to 7 mm, up to 4 mm.
Possible left uncal herniation also.
CT HEAD [**2117-10-6**]:  Stable extent of large hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal lobes with stable rightward shift of midline structures.
No new areas of hemorrhage seen.
Evolution of left frontoparietal hemorrhage with increased rightward shift from 6 to 12 mm.
No new hemorrhage.
Splenomegaly with a moderate-to-large wedge-shaped area of hypoperfusion and a smaller ovoid area posteriorly of hypoperfusion, both of which most likely represent splenic infarct.
Minimally prominent bowel wall involving the descending colon with adjacent mesenteric stranding.
However, this might be consistent with the patient's clinical history of C. diff colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 42-year-old gentleman with a history of anxiety who presented from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital with fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and a peripheral smear showing 30% blasts.
ACUTE LEUKEMIA:  Patient with 30% blasts on peripheral smear and differential suggestive of acute leukemia.
Serial CBCs, tumor lysis labs, and coagulation profiles were sent to rule out tumor lysis and DIC.
Bone marrow biopsy on day 1 of admission showed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
On day #2 of trial, patient had LP with intrathecal Ara-C, and he was started on methyl-prednisolone 27mg Q8.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy was not performed at this time given the patient's overall condition, and the fact that given his elevated liver enzymes, he would not be a candidate to undergo further therapy at this time.
CENTRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS /HEMORRHAGIC CONVERSION  While on BMT service on [**2117-10-3**] in the morning, the patient was noted to be less responsive with global aphasia and right sided hemiparesis.
MRI at the time showed evidence for ischemic stroke in the left parietal lobe.
CT on arrival to ICU revealed massive hemorrhagic transformation of left MCA territory infarct with severe increased edema and rightward shift of midline structures.
En route to the ICU from CT, Mr. [**Known lastname 58834**] became extremely flushed, diaphoretic and nauseous, likely secondary to increased intracranial pressure from massive bleed and edema, and he began vomiting.
Due to intense systolic hypertension at the time of intubation (SBP 223) he received 20mg IV hydralazine as well as sedation with fentanyl, propofol and midazolam which normalized his blood pressures.
Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted and Neurosurgery considered placement of extraventricular drain to help relieve intracranial pressure and prevent impending herniation, but upon discussion with Mr. [**Known lastname 84579**] family including his brother who is his health care proxy, the procedure was declined.
The following day, Neurology evaluation of imaging revealed superior sagginal sinus thrombosis and  suggested 4 vessel angigraphy and possible angio-jet procedure to evacuate the thrombus.
He was not anticoagulated due to his persistent thrombocytopenia and intracranial hemorrhage.
Repeat CT was performed after the patient's return to the floor and revealed worsening midline shift.
However, he remained hemoplegic on the right side, other than occasional wiggle of the right toes.
However, he began to show more awareness of his environment in the last two days prior to his discharge.
HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA AND TRANSAMINITIS: Following chemotherapy, the patient was noted to have progressively increasing liver function tests and bilirubin levels.
While etiology of hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis were not clear, it was believed that vincristine was the most likely cause.
FEVERS:  In ED, patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin for neutropenic fever.
There was no indication of infection on CT.
While in the ICU, the patient also developed low grade fevers and was started on Micafungin for antifungal coverage, which was subsequently switched to Anidulafungin.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were stopped upon return to the BMT floor and resolution of patient's neutropenia as well as fevers.
He developed low grade fevers two days prior to discharge associated with loose stools.
Urinalysis was also significant for 9 WBCs although no bacteria.
CXR was performed and showed no evidence of acute pulmonary process.
The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin for empiric treatment of UTI and oral Flagyl plus Vancomycin for treatment of C. diff colitis.
He was given ativan prn for anxiety.
THROAT LESIONS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 58834**] complained of throat pain/soreness upon admission.
Inspection of the back of his throat revealed small nodules and erythema, suggestive of HSV reactivation.
C. DIFF INFECTION: While in the ICU, the patient was noted to have loose stools and tested positive for C. diff infection.
He underwent a 14 day course treatment with PO Flagyl, with resolution of his diarrhea.
He again developed low grade fevers, abdominal pain and loose stools two days prior to discharge.
CT of abdomen was performed and revelealed mild wall thickening in the descending colon, but no clear evidence of colitis.
He is scheduled to complete a 14 day course of PO Vancomycin and a 5 day course of PO Flagyl, after which he should be re-evaluated for persistent C. diff.
Oxycodone PRN for given for pain contol.
He was noted to have two areas of splenic infarction on CT of abdomen and pelvis performed on [**2117-10-27**].
No intervention was performed.
The patient was given Oxycodone via G-tube as needed for pain control.
RIGHT IJ VEIN CLOT: While in the ICU, the patient was noted to have right upper extremity swelling.
A Right upper extremity ultrasound found a clot in the right internal jugular vein, which provoked by right subclavian central venous line.
The patient was not anticoagulated given patient's chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Central Venous Thrombosis with Hemorrhagic Conversion, Hyperbilirubinemia and Transaminitis, C. diff colitis.
Discharge Condition: Afebrile, Vitals stable, Aphasia and Right Hemiplegia Able to follow simple verbal commands Unable to ambulate   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of your Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.
Subsequently, you developed elevated liver function tests, which is a sign of liver inflammation.
You also suffered a stroke (central venous thrombosis with hemorrhagic conversion) that left you paralyzed on right side of the body and unable to speak.
You were intubated for protection of your airway and monitored closely in the intensive care unit, where you were treated with mannitol and hyperventilation to reduce your brain swelling.
You neurological function slowly improved, but you continue to have many neurological deficits as a consequence of your stroke.
You should return to the emergency room should you develop any of the following: fevers over 101F, chills, unresponsiveness, severe pain not releaved by medications, new neurological deficits.
