Admission Date:  [**2144-5-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-6-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-12-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tramadol / Hydrocodone Bitartrate/Apap  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 109738**] is a 56-year old male w/ NSCLC, dementia, residual brain damage from drug OD in [**2118**], known brain tumour from lung CA mets and CVA who presents to the ED with altered mental status and lethargy.
Per pt's wife, he had been more lethargic than usual, refusing to get out of bed, and experiencing urinary incontinence.
She states he had been in his USOH (ambulating with a cane, A&Ox3, conversant appropriately) until the day prior to admission when he experienced extreme fatigue and slept all day until noon, when he normally gets up around 7am.
Per his wife, pt had been feeling more weak and had been wetting himself while trying to get up to go to the bathroom and urinating on himself in bed several times, more of a function of weakness and inability to reach the bathroom in time rather than incontinence.
He has residual left-sided weakness and numbness at baseline but per wife's report this has been worse lately.
Of note, he was hospitalized on [**4-28**] for changes in mental status, and was treated empirically for meningitis with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir.
His post-operative courrse was c/b PAC infection requiring removal and vocal cord paralysis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 109739**] neurologic problems began in [**2-/2144**] w/ L-sided weakness and difficulty with cognition.

Ca  Phos Mg [**2144-6-4**] 00:00      8.9 3.3  1.7 [**2144-6-3**] 00:30      9.2 3.3  1.8   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 109738**] is a 56 year-old gentleman with non-small cell lung cancer with known metastatic disease to the brain, s/p R-craniotomy and whole brain radiation, history of dementia and stroke, who presented with altered mental status and increased lethargy.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS- The differential for Mr. [**Known lastname 109738**] was broad given his immunocompromised state and obtunded presentation.
The patient and his wife made it clear that they did not want a lumbar puncture performed and understood the serious risks of turning down the LP including delay in diagnosis or even death.
Therefore, the initial differential included bacterial meningitis and HSV encephalitis especially given pt's lethargy and somnolence.
Also in the differential was worsening of pts malignancy w/ known brain mets, seizure, or other infectious etiology such as PNA.
Hyperglycemia could also cause this pt's AMS as FSBS was > 300 on arrival.
Also, he had colonic wall (ascending colon and cecum) thickening on CT which could represent infectious colitis but is a nonspecific finding; pt's wife did not endorse specific GI complaints but stool studies were sent.
Pt's outpatient Neuro-oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] was asked to comment on pt's status and he felt the picture was more consistent with encephalitis and agreed with broad antibiotic coverage, but decided to hold off on MRI until later, as pt just had MRI at the end of his radiation treatment which did not show new progression of disease.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] agreed with bedside EEG to rule out seizure and this was performed on [**5-26**].
[**Name (NI) **] Pt had evidence of left lower lobe consolidation on chest CT that was likely pneumonia.
This underlying infection was most likely the cause of his altered mental status.
Initially, broad antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired organisms and aspiration was initiated with vancomycin, cefepime (as above), flagyl for anaerobes and levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
LEUKOCYTOSIS- could be due to infection, inflammation, seizure or steroid use.
However, steroids are of chronic duration and leukocytosis is relatively acute.
# Altered Mental Status:  Pt was initially on abx for meningitis, which were subsequently stopped.
LLL consolidatio nwas seen on CT chest and pt was treated for a pneumonia with Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
Pt was treated for pneumonia as above.
# NSCLC with brain mets s/p craniotomy:  Treatment plan will be per primary oncology team.
Pt likely needs reimaging of lungs after resolution of pneumonia to evaluate for underlying cancer.
# Anxiety/Insomnia:  Pt was conitnued on home Clonazepam, Zolpidem.
Pt did have occasions when he stated that he wanted to eat, knowing that it will make him at increased risk for aspiration and complications from it.
However, after counseling him about it, pt would decide again that he wants to stay NPO and on tubefeeds to reduce risk of aspiration.
IF pt and HCP do decide to let him eat, he should be on ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
Pt has an outpt S&S eval on [**2144-6-25**] to reassess the situation at that time.
