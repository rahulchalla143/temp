Admission Date:  [**2181-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) Bilateral IR guided nephrostomy tube placement 2) exploratory laparotomy, resection of pelvic masses, bilateral salpingoophorectomy   History of Present Illness: 47yo F with abdominal pain for ten months worsening over the last week.
Pt saw a new PCP today who noted large abdominal mass on exam and sent her to [**Hospital1 **].
US at OSH demonstrated a 20cm mass in abdomen as well as lab abnormalities including hyperkalemia (K 6.1) with ECG findings, renal failure (creatinine of 11.5), hyponatremia (Na 121), leukocytosis (WBC of 20.1) and anemia (Hct of 17 s/p one unit of PRBCs) leading to x-fer to [**Hospital1 18**].
The pt reports increasing abdominal pain which is described as intermittent sharp pain worse in the LLQ.
The pt also admits to 55lb weight loss during this span, constipation, n/v and decreased PO intake.
She was given insulin/D50, calcium gluconate, and kayoxalate for her hyperkalemia and sodium bicarb for her acidosis.
Gyn was consulted in the ED regarding the large ovarian mass and recommended formal consult in the AM, CA-125, CEA, ureteral stents and further characterization of mass for planned excision at some point in the future.
Renal was consulted in the ED and recommended correction of underlying acidosis with barcarbonate infusion and continuation of treatment of hyperkalemia with kayexolate, lasix, calcium gluconate and insulin/D50.
HEENT: temporal wasting, EOMI, anicteric, mm dry Chest: CTA bilaterally CV: rrr, s1, s2, no m/r/g Abd: large palpable hard mass in LLQ, which is dull to percussion, slightly tender to palpation.
Back: no CVA tenderness, no spinal or paraspinal tenderness Ext: wwp, no c/c/e   Pertinent Results: Pelvic CT [**2181-12-12**]: "1.
Large complex multilocular cystic masses, originating within the pelvis.
The appearance is concerning for bilateral ovarian cystadenocarcinomas.
Bilateral marked hydroureter and hydronephrosis from narrowing of the distal ureters bilaterally."
Renal was consulted, and the pt initially required IV bicarb and bicitra, in addition to aggressive NS hydration, for tx of a metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.
Hyperkalemia resolved after administration of kayexelate, insulin, glucose, and D50 in the ED, and acidosis resolved within the first few days of hospitalization.
Nephrostogram confirmed good R nephrostomy placement, and it was felt that R kidney was probably more permanantly damaged from pyelonephritis as well as a more complete obstruction.
A Renal perfusion scan showed almost no flow on R, decreased flow L.  Her new baseline Cr ranges from 3.5 - 3.9.
Pyleonephritis with bacteremia: Pt grew pan-sensitive E coli from R nephrostomy tube and blood cultures, and was treated with a 2 week course of Levofloxacin.
A pre-op CXR showed no evidence of mass or PNA.
Mammogram was deferred as pt was felt to be too unstable for transport to the [**Hospital Ward Name **], however the Breast surgery service was consulted, and felt the mass was more c/w with a fibroadenoma on history and bedside US.
A MRI of the head was negative for metastasis.
Pain from the mass was treated with PO Oxycodone with good effect.
Small bowel obstruction: The pt developed nausea and vomiting and increasing abdominal distention on [**12-21**], and a portable KUB showed evidence of partial SBO.
Anemia: Iron studies were checked, and this was felt to be [**1-17**]: #1 anemia of chronic disease, [**1-17**] low epogen from kidney invasion + #2 bleeding into the tumor.
The pt initially required multiple transfusions to increase her hct to > 30, which was Gyn/Onc's goal given anticipated blood loss in the OR.
Her R nephrostomy tube continued to have a low output; her L nephrostomy tube was very productive, accounting for virtually her entire urine output.
FEN/GI: The pt had a small bowel obstruction caused by an adhesion tethering her terminal ileum; this was released during surgery.
The pt advanced her diet slowly without difficulty, and she tolerated a regular diet on POD#10.
Ovarian cancer:  Given the pt's diagnosis of unstaged clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, chemotherapy was initiated during the [**Hospital **] hospital stay.
Psych: Psych was consulted postoperatively given concern for the pt's episodic anxiety as well as depressive symptoms.
Psych felt that the pt's symptoms most closely resembled an adjustment disorder w/ depressive and anxious components, and recommended starting the pt on celexa as well as clonopin 1mg tid.
The pt was started on celexa w/o difficulty but was noted to be very somulent w/ the clonopin to the point where she slept all day and was not able to get out of bed.
Thus, the clonopin was discontinued; the pt continued to do well w/o any noted anxiety episodes.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**5-23**] hours as needed for break through pain: This medication is for break-through pain only; if you need to take it once a day or more frequently, please contact your doctor so that other pain medications may be increased.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for anxiety.
