The sensation was persistent and he felt as if his throat was closing.
Over the next several months the pt also began noting increase in belching and small amounts of regurgitation.
He denies any difficulty swallowing liquids.
On [**7-15**] his [**Month/Year (2) 263**] was found to be subtherapeutic 1.4, so his coumadin was increased from 1mg to 2mg and started on Lovenox 40mg QD.
Later that day he had some coffee ground emesis and worsening dysphagia.
The following day he had grossly bloody emesis and had noted dark stools for 2 days.
No NSAID use.
An EGD was performed which showed a 8 mm stricture at the GE junction, with salmon colored mucosa, and a frond-like/vilous non bleeding mass of malignant appearance.
Past Medical History: CABG x 3 ([**10-30**]) MVR s/p ICD placement ([**2-28**]) A.fib HTN Hypothyroidism   Social History: Denies ant T/A/D use.

Mucosa: A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a localized pattern, suggestive of Barrett's Esophagus was seen.
Protruding Lesions A frond-like/villous non-bleeding mass of malignant appearance was found at the gastro-esophageal junction.
Stomach:Other Unable to visualize extent of mass or the stomach fundus/body due to GE junction stricture.
Duodenum: Not examined Impressions: Stricture of the gastro-esophageal junction Barrett's esophagus Mass in the gastro-esophageal junction  ECHO [**2115-2-6**] Conclusions 1.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Severe global systolic and mild diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
The LAD had severe ostial and proximal diffuse diseased and was totally occluded after D1.
D1 70% stenosis at its ostium.
LCX had a 40% stenosis at the origin of a large OM1.
The OM1 branch had serial 70% lesions proximally.
The RCA mid-vessel tubular 60% stenosis and a 70% stenosis just before the RPDA.
There was anterobasal hypokinesis, anterolateral akinesis, apical dyskinesis/akinesis, inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis.
There was mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation.
In the MICU [**Name (NI) 263**] was elevated so it was reversed with Vit.
He went for on EGD which showed a 8mm stricture at the GE junction w/ non bleeding mass of malignant appearance.
Biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma.
For the remainder of the hospital  he had no bleeding and his HCT was stable.
2.Esophageal adenocarcinoma- Pt was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma after EGD with biopsy.
An esophageal ultrasound showed that his stage was T2 with possible involvement of lymph nodes.
A CT scan did not show any evidence of metastases.
4.HTN- Mr. [**Known lastname 48753**] blood pressure meds were initially held because of bleeding and low BP.
Pulmonary- On CT the patient was found to have evidence of interstitial pneumonitis.
He did have occasional crackles at the bases but had O2 sats in the high 90's.
Pulmonary was consulted they felt he had IPF, however treatment was not warranted at this time secondary to his need for cancer treatment.
Could be secondary to poor po and fluid intake.
