Admission Date:  [**2131-8-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2079-9-29**]       Sex:  M  Service:  NEUROSURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 51 year old gentleman with a history of prostate cancer was admitted to an outside hospital presenting with seizures.
His wife reported a tonoclonic seizure over night prior to admission with his eyes rolling back into his head, arms in extension and then flexion towards chest.
CT examination at the outside hospital showed a 2.0 by 2.0 radiodense lesion in the right temporal lobe consistent with hemorrhage with mild mass effect.
His chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rhonchi.
The extremities were warm with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
On review of the magnetic resonance scan of the brain, the stroke service noted a large area of bleed in the right temporal lobe and two small enhancing lesions suggestive of tumor.
At the time, they doubted that this was a metastases from the patient's known prostate cancer as this primary was unlikely to bleed.
Their assessment was that this was an inflammatory reaction likely due to aspiration.
However, as the patient showed no clinical symptoms of infection, they recommended no antibiotic treatment.
This study was motivated both by the patient's family's description of a change in the patient's bowel habits and as part of the search for the primary source of the patient's brain lesions.
On [**2131-9-7**], the patient underwent a craniotomy and evacuation of intracranial hemorrhage performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**], assisted by medical student Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44229**].
The estimated blood loss for the procedure was 100 cc and the patient received 300 cc of normal saline during the procedure.
Frozen section of this lesion showed high grade glioma with no definitive border seen around the lesion grossly.
The patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit with no drains and in stable condition.
The assessment of that service was that the patient's management for glioblastoma multiforme should include radiation therapy and a follow-up appointment with the radiation oncology service for planning of this procedure was scheduled.
As a S4 was heard on cardiac examination by the neuro-oncology attending, a CT angiogram was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolus.
This study was negative for pulmonary embolus.
On [**2131-9-14**], the patient was in stable condition and was afebrile with stable vital signs and was alert and oriented times three.
He was fluently conversant and his wound was clean, dry and intact and flat with the staples removed.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Glioblastoma multiforme complicated with temporal lobe hemorrhage, status post craniotomy and evacuation of intracranial hemorrhage.
