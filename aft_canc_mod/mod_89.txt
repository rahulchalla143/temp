Similar to the prior exam, there is slight accentuation of the interstitial markings.
Bibasilar atelectasis is evident.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
The osseous structures again reveal vertebral body height loss in multiple thoracic vertebral body segments.
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable examination with bibasilar atelectasis.
No definite consolidation noted.
No gross interval change from prior without evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage.
Evaluation for infarction is limited on this motion-limited study, and MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia (for which the patient would require sedation in order to obtain).
Mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
Renal U/S IMPRESSION: No renal abscess or perinephric collection.
Please note that pyelonephritis cannot be diagnosed on ultrasound.
CXR [**2-1**]: New opacification in both lower lungs could be pneumonia.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3095**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4369**] was paged   Brief Hospital Course: 68 YO M with IgA MM, IDDM2, CKD, and schizophrenia admitted to the MICU with AMS and hypotension found to have urosepsis and ATN.
# Urosepsis: Pt found to have high-grade E.coli bacteremia.
When sensitivities returned, found that e. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and patient switched to Cipro.
He had no other complications, no evidence of abscess on renal U/S.
Prostate exam benign (no tenderness on exam), scheduled for urology follow-up as outpatient.
He was last febrile on [**2-2**] and levaquin was started for possible b/l PNA on CXR (though no  hypoxia or respiratory complaints).
No aspiration on S&S.
R IJ removed, but contaminated and could not be sent for cx.
Will need total of two week course for treatment of urosepsis (will end on [**2143-2-12**]).
Currently dosed at levaquin 250mg Q48 in light of renal failure.
# Acute kidney injury [**2-26**] ATN.
No urine ketones.
Glipizide titrated down to [**Hospital1 **] dosing instead of TID dosing, adjusted for renal failure.
# IgA multiple myeloma.
Likely related to acute inflammation in the setting of chronic iron def anemia as well as myeloma.
Guaiac positive and scheduled for GI follow-up w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4370**] [**Name (STitle) 4371**] as outpatient.
# Thrombocytopenia.
