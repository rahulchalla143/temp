Pt with chronic COPD at baseline reliant on 4.5L O2 by NC at home and Spiriva, Advair and Albuterol nebs.
He had increasing dyspnea over past few months, most notably in the past few days.
SOB is present at rest and worsened with exertion, however he denies chest pain.
Cough productive of small amounts of white sputum.
No hemoptysis.
No fever, night sweats or notable change in weight.
Pt thought to have stridor on exam in addition to rhonchi and wheezes bilaterally.
CXR showed right suprahilar mass with left tracheal deviation.
CT chest with contrast showed large paratracheal mediastinal 7cm necrotic mass with airway and SVC effacement.
Pt alert and oriented x3 with labored breathing and frequent coughing.

Denies illicits   Family History: Significant for diabetes, HTN, and CAD.
Alert, oriented, in mild distress [**1-29**] frequent coughing.

The lung bases on the left and right show linear opacities with air bronchograms, most likely consistent with atelectasis.
However, a presence of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No other lung parenchymal abnormalities.
In the mediastinum however, there is increased density, notably in the right paratracheal compartment, associated with substantial narrowing of the lower third of the trachea and distortion of both the right and left main bronchus.
No pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions.
Sinus rhythm.
Left atrial abnormality.
Single wide complex beat, probable ventricular premature beat but consider atrial premature beat with aberration.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 76 152 86 388/416 21 36 50   Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo M with oxygen dependent COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus presenting with shortness of breath found to have large central mediastinal mass with airway effacement as per outside hospital radiology report.
Active Issues: # Squamous cell lung carcinoma:  Patient initially presented to outside hospital with hypoxia secondary to paratracheal mediastinal mass, which on pathology was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Patient received XRT while admitted but due to continued hypoxia and respiratory failure, poor progress and overall poor prognosis (see below) the family decision was to focus on comfort, and patient extubated and expired quietly and peacefully in the presence of family members.
# Hypoxia: Patient with progressive increase in dyspnea at rest over past few days increasing his baseline home 02 requirement.
Most likely secondary to necrotic paratracheal mediastinal mass with airway effacement that was seen on CT from outside hospital.
After procedure he returned to the ICU with diffculty managing secretions and was intubated.
Patient was extubated the following morning, however was intubated again due to difficulty in managing secretions resulting in hypercarbia.
Pathology returned as poorly differentiated squamous cell lung carcinoma and patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation of lung mass.
# Cellulitis:  Patient with traumatic skin tear on R lower extremity on admission, which appeared to be erythematous and indurated on hospital day 2, a change from admission exam.
# ATN: Patient developed increased Creatine with muddy brown casts in urine consistent with ATN.
