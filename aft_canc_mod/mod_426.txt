Flexible bronch was performed which showed ischemia of the area with the cuff on the right, and bilious fluid but no bleeding on the left.
pt continued to have stable, low-volume hemoptysis during the remainder of the admission.
The source was thought most likely to be pulmondary, given diffuse metastatic disease seen on CT, although bronch was without definite endobronchial lesion.
NSAIDS were d/c'd, and this was listed as an allergy on pt's med list given non-bleeding ulcer seen on EGD.
Pt only had one episode of desaturation during the admission to the high 80's on room air.
#) Gastric ulcer - GI was consulted given the concern for coffee grounds by lavage, and EGD revealed an ulcer in the stomach body, nonbleeding.
#) Breast CA - The patient has stage IV metaststic breast cancer.
#) [**Name (NI) 11431**] Fever - Pt had low-grade temps during the admission.
Thought to be due to infection vs. tumor vs. post-bronch.
Pt also had leukocytosis, which was chronic.
#) R forearm swelling: Pt had episode of mild R forearm swelling, possibly due to A-line while pt was in ICU.
- did not pursue u/s, given result would not change mangement (not a candidate for anticoagulation in setting of hemoptysis) .
#) HTN - held anti-hypertensive meds in setting of bleeding, also held on discharge .
