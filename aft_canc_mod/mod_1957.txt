Given an elevated Madrey score he was started on prednisolone 20mg twice daily with a plan for four week course with 2 week taper.
In the ED, there was concern for meningitis/encephelitis given fevers & altered MS w/ relative HD stability so he received broad spectrum coverage with zosyn 4.5 g IV, vancomycin 1 g, CTX 2g, acetaminophen 1g PR.
On repeat exam, neck was noted supple and he was felt to have subtle asterixis.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated and unresponsive to verbal stimuli and sternal rub.
Past Medical History: Alcohol abuse Alcoholic Cirrhosis c/b varices, encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis  Social History: Currently living in nursing facility.
He denies any prior illicit drug use or blood transfusions.

HEENT: MMM CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no excess sounds appreciated Lungs: Clear Abdomen:  Distended but soft, non tender Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation.
+ asterixis Skin: Seborrheic dermatitis present over eyebrows, scalp.
Images: CXR: Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings particularly at the lung bases.
Given this, there may be mild right base atelectasis.
No definite focal consolidation seen.
Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
CT Head: Moderate left maxillary sinus disease, but no acute intracranial process.
MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
Small pericardial effusion is present.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites is present.
The gallbladder is distended with a mildly thickened wall (likely secondary to hepatic disease).
Small amount of pericholecystic fluid is also seen.
There is a dilated recanalized umbilical vein, a portion of which has herniated through a small umbilical hernia (2; 60).
The small and large bowel show no evidence of ileus or obstruction.
There is no free air or lymphadenopathy.
There is no pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
A small left buttock hematoma is present.
BONES: There are no aggressive appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Small pericardial effusion.
Umbilical hernia containing a loop of the dilated, recannalized umbilical vein.
The left portal vein is patent, and there is a large patent umbilical vein.
No focal liver lesions, no biliary dilatation.
Trace of ascites in the perihepatic space.
[**1-17**] EGD: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus No evidence of active bleeding or ulcers Polyps in the antrum (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Polyp biopsy: Antral mucosa with hyperplasia of gastric pits, mucin depletion, and focal acute inflammation consistent with foveolar hyperplastic polyp; no histologic evidence of H. pylori seen.
Discharge labs:  [**2186-1-17**] 05:45AM BLOOD WBC-4.4 RBC-3.35* Hgb-11.8* Hct-33.8* MCV-101* MCH-35.1* MCHC-34.8 RDW-13.1 Plt Ct-44* [**2186-1-17**] 05:45AM BLOOD PT-17.1* PTT-33.2 INR(PT)-1.6* [**2186-1-17**] 05:45AM BLOOD Glucose-110* UreaN-7 Creat-0.7 Na-138 K-3.6 Cl-103 HCO3-31 AnGap-8 [**2186-1-17**] 05:45AM BLOOD ALT-43* AST-42* AlkPhos-57 TotBili-1.6* [**2186-1-17**] 05:45AM BLOOD Calcium-8.2* Phos-4.0 Mg-1.3*  Brief Hospital Course: Summary:  This is a 50 year old male with PMH of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis c/b varices and encephalopathy, and recent alcoholic hepatitis who presented with lethargy and altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection.
There was no evidence of intracranial pathology on CT Head.
In the ED, he was started on empiric treatment for meningitis with vancomycin/ctx/acyclovir.
An LP was not pursued given his low platelets and elevated INR from his underlying liver disease.
He was transferred from the MICU to the floor, where his mental status continued to improve off all antimicrobials and with lactulose/rifaximin.
# Respiratory failure: He was intubated in the setting of altered mental status in the emergency room.
# Cirrhosis:   Complicated by varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and alcoholic hepatitis.
Lactulose and rifaximin were continued - this will be very important to take at the extended care facility to prevent confusion and a repeat of the events that led to this admission.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal in setting of hypovolemia from marked stool output and decreased PO, improved with gentle IVF to baseline Cr 0.6-0.8. .
# Pancytopenia / Coagulopathy: Likely related to liver disease and history of alcohol abuse.
# Large flank ecchymosis:  Pt noted to have large ecchymosis over left flank - he does not recall falling, and denies pain at the site.
There was no tenderness, and no warmth.
His CBC remained stable and there was low concern for ongoing bleeding into the hip .
# Antral polyps:  Two sessile non-bleeding polyps of benign appearance were found in the antrum of the stomach, biopsies were taken and showed antral mucosa with hyperplasia of gastric pits, mucin depletion, and focal acute inflammation consistent with foveolar hyperplastic polyp; no histologic evidence of H. pylori seen.
# Seborrheic Dermatitis:  Patient had mild seb derm on admission, which improved with Ketoconazole cream .
Outpatient Lab Work Full chemistry panel with potassium and magnesium at least every other day starting [**2186-1-18**] until potassium and magnesium stabilize   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Highgate Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy Alcoholic cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
This was most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy (this happens when your liver is not working well, and cannot remove all toxins from your blood).
This revealed a few dilated veins which can be seen in liver disease.
