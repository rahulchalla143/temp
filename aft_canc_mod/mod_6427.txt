He underwent ERCP, which revealed an infiltrating mass causing obstruction.
He was discharged on a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, but developed a rash after only 3 days.
For the past 2 days, he has had worsening abdominal pain.
He also reports mild fevers (as high as 100.8 at home), as well as constipation (no BM for ~2 days).
He reports that the pain comes in waves, and was not controlled with long- or short-acting oxycodone.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Predominantly dependent patchy opacity at the bases of the lower lobes is presumed related to atelectasis.
Again demonstrated is the mass of the head of the pancreas, which has not appreciably changed over the short interval from [**2194-2-13**], again measuring approximately 4.4 x 3.6 cm.
Numerous relatively hypodense lesions scattered throughout the liver with relatively ill-defined margins are redemonstrated, concerning for hepatic metastases.
Moderate distension of the gallbladder is unchanged.
There is no evidence of gallstones, pericholecystic fluid, or appreciable gallbladder wall thickening.
A large portion of the administered oral contrast remains in the stomach, although some has passed into the proximal small bowel.
There are no dilated loops of small bowel or evidence of inflammatory change.
There is a moderate amount of retained stool distributed throughout the colon mixed with gas.
The colon is mildly distended with gas.
There is a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid which layers into the pelvis.
There is no evidence of herniation of bowel loops or incarceration.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**] is a 42 yo man with an obstructive pancreatic head mass of unknown etiology who presents with abdominal pain, fever.
There was persistant elevation in bilirubin concerning for obstructed drainage.
Persistant mild to moderate intra and extra hepatic biliary duct dilation was also seen.
The proximal sideport of the drain was withdrawn for better drainage of intrahepatic ducts and the patients LFTs and obstructive picture improved over the course of the hospitalization.
There was significant leukocytosis on admission and given his prior reaction to cipro and flagyl the patient was initially managed on IV Unasyn.
The patient had low grade temperatures to 99 during the course of his stay however on [**2-28**] the patient became febrile to 101.5 while on po abx.
The patient's pain was felt to be secondary to the external drain as well as the pancreatic mass and liver lesions.
Tylenol was avoided during his stay given his hepatic involvement and NSAIDs were minimized secondary to frequent planned interventions.
Pancreatic head mass: The EUS FNA biopsy was consistent with carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
A liver biopsy was obtained via CT guidance to evaluate for metastatic disease.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: ascending cholangitis pancreatic tumor   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating po, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and were treated for ascending cholangitis.
Your preliminary pancreas biopsy results are consistent with carcinoma.
You should return to the ER if you develop fevers, chills, worsening abdominal pain, nause or vomiting.
