Recently d/c'd from BMT service on [**5-18**] after treatment with high dose Cytoxan in preparation for stem cell mobilization.
Per pt and wife, he has experienced increased anorexia and some nausea with one episode of vomitting over the last week.
No fevers or chills.
No abdominal pain.
Notes thrush but no dysphagia.
Notes onset of cough with white sputum over the last day.

He does have skin breakdown near sacrum which doesn't appear to have changed significantly.
No pain at dialysis catheter site.
Mild HA but no vision changes.
No neck/back pain.
On evening of admission, he developed nausea and vomitting and then was noted to have temperature to 101.
Labs notable for neutropenia w/ trilineage decrease.
CXR w/ increased left sided pleural effusion.
History:  USOH until [**6-/2170**], when he developed a rotator cuff injury of his right shoulder.
However, he developed progressive pain in his right clavicle, associated with increasing fatigue.
On further evaluation he was anemic and had a high total protein.
He was hypercalcemic and had a component of renal insufficiency.
Bone marrow aspirate revealed a hypercellular marrow with 50% plasma cells.
On physical examination, he had a 3 cm expandable mass in his right mid clavicle.
He was diagnosed with a stage IIB IgA kappa multiple myeloma.
Intially IgA decreased on this treatment, but he developed progressive renal insufficiency.
- Prior to his progressive renal insufficiency, he did have an upper respiratory tract infection characterized by low- grade fevers and nonproductive cough.
Skeletal survey revealed multiple lytic lesions throughout his thorax.
There were lesions in his sternum, posterior ribs, and vertebral bodies.
Apparently, an MRI of the area did not reveal a lytic lesion.
The question was raised of avascular necrosis considering his recent use of steroids.
He was noted to have a lytic lesion in his C-spine and received local radiation therapy, and is advised to wear a cervical collar.
He continued to have ongoing renal insufficiency and was on 3-times- a-week hemodialysis.
- He was hospitalized in NH on [**2171-3-25**] with hypotension and fever.
Blood cultures were positive for coag-negative staph, and he was started on a course of vancomycin.
[**4-11**]: Noted progressive pain in his right hip.
He cannot walk more than [**Age over 90 **] yards because of pain in his right hip.
Repeat MRIs did not reveal lytic lesions.
IgA predominant multiple myeloma dx'd [**7-10**] progessive despite initial therapy w/ Decadron/Thalidomide/Zometa later changed to Velcade/Decadron now s/p recent high dose Cytoxan [**2171-5-18**] and awaiting stem cell mobilization 2.

# Febrile neutropenia:  Patient with nausea, vomiting and caugh prior to admission.
He was admitted to the ICU initially and received IVF for hypotension.
He was noted to have a pleural effusion which was tapped and revealed a transudate with no organisms on gram stain and cultures.
# Pleural effusion:  noted to have pleural effusion on echocardiogram so had a Chest CT which revevealed a large leftsided effusion.
Patient's sob and dyspnea improved significantly after thoracentesis.
2 days later sob worsened and on CXR was noted to have recurrance of pleural effusion.
Effusion was thought likely secondary to inflammatory reaction to the plasmacytomas seen on CT.  Rad/Onc was consulted for possible radiation to the plasmacytoma, however they did not believe that radiation would change management as pt had several lesions.
# Mutliple myeloma - Once afebrile pt underwent pharesis for stem cell collection.
Supportive meastures for pain control with fentynyl patch and oxycodone, cervical collar and levaquin and bactrim prophylaxis were continued.
Hypotension: on admission thought secondary to sepsis vs post dialysis hypotension.
# Diet: renal, neutropenic # Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen # Access: dialysis port.
