Past Medical History: Onc Hx: Adenocarcinoma of Unknown origin (?
The patient initially had presented in [**2188-12-9**] with vaginal bleeding her vagina.
Her cervix was biopsied at Women and [**Hospital 60658**] Hospital that showed malignancy involving her cervix and was treated with external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy.
Her vaginal bleeding resolved, but in [**Month (only) 956**] [**2189**] CT and PET scans showed multiple pulmonary nodules which were biopsied and suggested metastatic carcinoma of likely gastrointestinal tract origin and in [**2189-8-8**] she was found to have residual disease involving her cervix.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and gynecological oncology mentioned to the patient that she was not a candidate for surgical resection of her disease because of the wide spread metastases on her CT of the chest.
The treatment of her metastatic malignancy of likely gastrointestinal origin began fall of [**2189**] and consisted of FOLFOX with Avastin to begin, followed by FOLFIRI with Avastin.
In [**2190-3-11**], her treatment with FOLFIRI plus Avastin had to be held because she underwent toe amputations related to her diabetes mellitus.
In [**2190-7-9**], the patient noted recurrence of her bleeding vaginally, and the patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of gynecology oncology who felt that there was no possible benefit that could be obtained from local therapy or surgical options regard to her pelvic involvement.
[**Name2 (NI) **] chemotherapy has been held the last few months due to multiple admissions for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation.
Past medical history: COPD history of vocal cord polyp sarcoidosis type 2 diabetes mellitus Charcot's arthropathy diabetic retinopathy MRSA pneumonia [**7-15**] arthritis pseudogout end-stage renal disease adenocarcinoma of unknown primary with metastases.
LUNGS: Bilateral rhonchi in both lungs diffusely with very little air movement and expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
ABDOMEN: Normoactive bowel sounds, [**Name2 (NI) 499**] palpated with stool, mildly tender diffusely.
EXTR: Trace edema to the mid-tibia, slightly more prominent on the left.
Imaging: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-12-7**] IMPRESSION: Diffuse patchy parenchymal opacifcation with effusions without prior for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old female with multiple medical problems including DM2, COPD, recent MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, and metastatic adenocarcinoma of unclear primary (cervical v. GI), who presented with increased dyspnea, attributed to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.
She does have multiple contributing factors including COPD, MRSA pneumonia, HD-dependence, and presence of metastases in lung.
ICU team also felt there was a significant component of anxiety as the dyspnea responded well to ativan and morphine.
Her pain was controlled with Fentanyl patch and dilaudid PCA.
Pt began to have worsening functional and mental status, and after discussion with her family, her goals of care were shifted to comfort.
