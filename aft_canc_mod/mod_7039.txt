Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Post-polypectomy bleed Colon polyp with high grade dysplasia  Secondary: Diabetes Mellitus Hyperlipidemia GERD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because of bloody stool, which was a result of your recent polypectomy.
The pathology report from the removed polyp returned as "adenoma with high grade dysplasia."
This pathology infers a high risk of progression to colon cancer, therefore our gastroenterologists preformed a flexible sigmoidoscopy to re-examine the polypectomy site.
Please avoid ibuprofen and all other NSAIDS due to risk of further bleeding.
If you have any further bleeding, lightheadedness, or abdominal pain, please call your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] immediately or come back to the emergency department.
