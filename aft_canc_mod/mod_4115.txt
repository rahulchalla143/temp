[**11-11**] ccath: COMMENTS: 1) Resting hemodynamics on the ventilator revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with severe pulmonary hypertension and borderline low cardiac output on pressor support (neosynephrine) while tachycardic.
2) Pulmonary angiogram revealed no evidence of R or L main pulmonary embolism with normal blush to the right lung parenchyma and a known compressed left lung (large left pleural effusion).

4) Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the proximal CX lesion with a 3.0x15 mm Vision bare metal stent which was postdilated to 3.5 mm with a NC balloon.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
(see PTCA comments) 5) Unsuccessful PTCA was performed of the proximal RCA with a 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm balloon due to suboptimal guide support from the anterior origin 80% proximal lesion essentially unchanged, no dissection, and normal flow.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 74 year-old male with CAD status post 2-vessel CABG, s/p porcine AVR, chronic AF off anticoagulation, ischemic cardiomyopathy and persistent left fibrothorax s/p R decortication who presented with increasing DOE and oxygen requirement.
He subsequently developed a L hemothorax.
He was taken back to the OR to evacuate the hemothorax and became hypotensive after induction of anesthesia with propafol.
An echo showed RV failure and the patient was taken to the cath lab for presumed PE.
However, visualization of the coronary arteries showed a 90% ostial stenosis of L Cx and a tight calcific stenosis of the small, non-dominant RCA which underwent POBA.
Although the POBA to the RCA lesion was unsuccessful, the L Cx lesion was successfully stented with a BMS.
He then underwent a VATS for evacuation of his L hemothorax on [**11-18**] and was successfully extubated on [**11-19**].
He also has known hx of CAD s/p 2V CABG, and worsening tricuspid regurge, evidence of pulmonary hypertension on echo.
He also had a chronically low Hct,  which may be contributing to his dyspnea.
After surgery, the patient was found to have increasing respiratory distress and 02 requirement.
He was found to have a L hemothorax and was taken to back to the OR for a L VATS with evacuation of the L sided hematoma.
The evacuation of the hematoma was postponed due to the developement of hypotension during induction of anesthesia as described above.
He eventually underwent evacuation of his L hemothorax on [**11-18**].
Prior to discharge, the chest tubes were pulled as the patient was no longer dyspneic and sating well.
Cardiology was consulted for help with management.
As stated above the pt was taken to cath after becoming hypotensive in the OR prior to a scheduled VATS for evacuation of the L hemothorax.
They found a 90% ostial stenosis of L Cx wich was stented with a BMS.
CKs were remained flat indicating no acute coronary syndrome.
His PA HTN appeared to be longstanding as evidenced on prior echos and was likely related to chronic lung compromise secondary to hemothorax and fibrothorax.
The patient was transiently on Dopa post cath for his BiV failure but this was successfully weaned off.
Post OR hypotension: Although it was initially thought that the patient had a large PE while in the OR for evacuation of his L hemothorax, pulmonary angiography found no evidence for this.
A 90% ostial stenosis of L Cx was stented, but CKs were flat.
Therefore, the hypotensive episode was attributed to a propafol induced drop in pre-load, and subseuqent ischemia in the tight LCx and RCA lesions.
DDX for the hypotension also included adrenal insufficiency given his h/o prednisone use.
Chronic atrial fibrillation: Pt has history of GI bleed, and thus all anticoagulation was discontinued.
Given the patient's h/o bleeding (GIB and hemothorax) he was not started on heparin or coumadin.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy:  The patient was found to have pathologically enlarged lymph nodes and a BM biopsy concerning for MDS.
Bicytopenia: Anemia and thrombocytopenia.
The patient's low Hct was in the setting of multiple procedures and s/p L hemothorax.
Three days prior to discharge, pt's hematocrit showed a slow downward trend, which over the next two days prompted administration of 2uPRBCs.
He was found to be guiac positive but without evidence of visible blood or melanotic stools.
Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR throughout his entire admission.
This was thought to be due to poor PO intake.
ARF: The patient had a baseline Cr 0.9 which increased to 1.2 post cath.
This was thought to be due to hypoperfusion from cardiogenic shock in the setting of anemia and the contrast dye load.
The patient's renal failure resolved with post cath hydration and remained stable during the rest of his hospitalization.
