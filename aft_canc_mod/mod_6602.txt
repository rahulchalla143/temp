Admission Date:  [**2142-4-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-5-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**] Chief Complaint: hydronephrosis, acute renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ureteral stent placement Sigmoidoscopy   History of Present Illness: 86 year old woman with a history of [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] cancer and breast cancer presents with acute onset left flank pain x 1 day.
She awoke yesterday morning with intermittant flank pain, as well as nausea and vomiting (non bloody non bilious) x2.
Her VNA came for her usual visit, and noted that the patient looked unwell, so the patient was brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 1110**] where she has received most of her medical care.
She notes today that she had been having about 3 months of hematuria, but had no dysuria.
She also says she has been having daily BRBPR x >1 month, and was scheduled for a colonoscopy on [**4-7**] however was bumped to [**5-7**] due to scheduling reasons.
She reports intermittant aches and pains, over her legs and back, but nothing as intense as the flank pain yesterday.
OSH COURSE: She presented to OSH ed where a non con CT showed new metastatic disease to the liver, enlargement of known adrenal mass, and a soft tissue mass blocking the L ureter leading to acute left hydronephrosis.
Urology was consulted, and recommended cipro and pain control overnight; they planned to see the patient in the morning.
Overnight, her pain has resolved and she feels sleepy and sad, but well.
She has no pain at present and denies further nausea.

Acute left hydronephrosis and hydroureter to the level of a left retroperitoneal nodal metastasis which may be tethering the left ureter and obstructing it.
No renal stones identified.
Metastatic disease with multiple hepatic masses, large right adrenal mass and right para-aortic low density mass at the level of the diaphragm.
Soft tissue mass abutting/tethering the rectum and potentially tethering small-bowel loops in the pelvis, concerning for local recurrence.
Low density 2.8 x 1.5 cm right para-aortic mass may represent a necrotic lymph node.
There is dependent atelectasis at the lung bases.
No pulmonary nodules identified.
Low attenuation of intracardiac blood reflects anemia.
There are multiple low- density hepatic masses measuring 3 x 2.9 cm in segment IVb/V (2:24), 3.3 x 2.8 cm in segment VII (2:15) and 2.8 x 3 cm in segment VII at the right dome (2:11).
There is no appreciable intrahepatic bile duct dilation.
There may be a duodenal diverticulum.
There is acute hydronephrosis of the left kidney which is moderately severe, with moderate perinephric stranding.
Right hydroureter ends in the vicinity of an 18 x 16- mm left common iliac nodal mass (2:44) and may be tethered by this metastatic node.
There is a soft tissue mass occupying the right adrenal gland measuring 4 x 3.1 cm, consistent with metastasis.
The IVC is expanded with high-density material within it, also extending into the left renal vein, concerning for thrombus.
There are multiple calcified periaortic and paracaval lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm in the left para- aortic nodal station (2:32).
There are abdominal wall collaterals.
There is soft tissue mass tethering the rectum to the right pelvic side wall, consistent with local recurrence, measuring approximately 3.4 x 2.2 cm (2:60).
Evaluation is limited due to artifact from the right hip prosthesis.
A total right hip prosthesis is noted, with no evidence of hardware complication.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Acute left hydronephrosis and hydroureter to the level of a left retroperitoneal nodal metastasis which may be tethering the left ureter and obstructing it.
No renal stones identified.
Metastatic disease with multiple hepatic masses, large right adrenal mass and right para-aortic low density mass at the level of the diaphragm.
Soft tissue mass abutting/tethering the rectum and potentially tethering small-bowel loops in the pelvis, concerning for local recurrence.
Brief Hospital Course: 86yo female with a history of multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and breast cancer was transferred from OSH ureteral stent placement by urology.
After admission had several episodes of BRBPR.
# Hydronephrosis/UA positive - Soft tissue mass causing renal obstruction and hydronephrosis - likely necrotic lymph node.
She had abdominal CT scan which showed the node likely causing hydronephrosis, as well as a mass in the rectum, tethering the small bowel.
Prior to discharge, she underwent sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for obstructive symptoms, and sigmoidoscopy showed a large mass at the anastamotic site, but at the blind limb, which was not obstructing the functional limb.
#Renal failure - Cr 2.0 on admission.
Patient with good UOP, no history of renal disease in past.
# GI bleed - Has had slow bleed w/BRBPR for months, but had brisk bleeding on [**4-29**] associated w/Hct drop from baseline 37 -> 29.
She was evaluated by GI who planned for sigmoidoscopy (as per above showed a large mass at the anastamotic site, non-obstructive).
Her bleeding improved after the discontinuation of coumadin, with stable hematocrit.
# Depression - likely situational.
# h/o clot, now w/evidence of IVC clot extending into L renal vein on CT.  Coumadin held in setting of GI bleed.
Given risk and benefit of bleeding with large mass, coumadin was discontinued with family and patient understanding of the risk of clot.
# hyponatremia - Resolved with IV fluids.
.. # hypothyroid - continued synthroid .
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 3005**] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: acute renal failure hydronephrosis Recurrent [**Hospital 499**] cancer Acute blood loss anemia Gastrointestinal bleed IVC clot   Discharge Condition: Tolerating diet, stable labs, ambulating with physical therapy.
You also had an episode of bleeding from your rectum, and a sigmoidoscopy revealed a recurrent tumor where you had previously had surgery.
You were taken off coumadin and aspirin, and the bleeding improved.
