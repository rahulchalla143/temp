He originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**7-5**] for cholecystecomy and parastomal hernia repair.
He was discharged on [**7-8**] with Bactrim for an E coli UTI.
He returned to the hospital [**7-10**] for recurrent fever and was found to have a postoperative wound.
He was treated with ertapenem for Proteus and Klebsiella.
He then developed pyoderma gangrenosum about 2 cm above his wound.
He was discharged on [**7-17**], however had recurrent fevers and again presented on [**7-20**].
The patient underwent 2 CT scans of his torso to help evaluate etiology of fever which revealed LLL consolidation, likely PNA.
On the floor, the patient is asymptomatic and afebrile.

Test                          Result              Reference Range/Units ASPERGILLUS ANTIGEN           0.1                 <0.5 ================================================= Cytology and Pathology: Bronchial washings ([**8-7**]): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Abnormal B-cell leukemia cells comprise 57% of lymphoid gated events and ~1% of all events.
Peripheral blood smear review reveals rare large atypical lymphocytes with cytoplasmic projections.
Note:  A section of the cell block demonstrates a lymphoid infiltrate comprised of small-medium sized lymphocytes with small-moderate amounts of cytoplasm and round-oval nuclei with mostly vesicular chromatin.
Admixed are smaller lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei.
A review of the cytology prep (alcohol fixed, pap stain) demonstrates aggregates of mildly enlarged lymphocytes.
Overall the findings are suggestive of non-specific reactive lymphoid infiltrate.
No diagnostic morphologic nor immunohistochemical evidence of hairy cell leukemia is seen.
================================================== Imaging: Extensive Imaging from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] summarized elsewhere CT torso on [**8-2**] ([**Location (un) 620**]) revealed bilateral lower lobe lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia, interval improvement on the left but worsening on the right.
There is a small left pleural effusion which is new, interval improvement in small peristomal fluid collection.
CT chest ([**8-10**]):  FINDINGS: Consolidations in the medial and posterior basal segments of the right lower lobe are increased.
A rounded consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe is decreased.
Trace effusion on the right is also slightly increased.
On the left, consolidation in the basal segment of the lower lobe is decreased; however, there is new consolidation in the superior segment with minimally increased small layering pleural effusion.
A calcified right middle lobe granuloma is present (4:124).
A 3-mm nodule in the anterior right upper lobe (4:102) is stable over greater than two years from the examination of [**2114-10-6**].
Several prominent lymph nodes at the thoracic inlet and at the left paratracheal station measuring under 10 mm in short axis are similar to the prior examinations.
There are vascular calcifications notable within the left main and anterior descending coronary arteries.
No evidence of endobronchial lesion is seen.
There is a small hiatal hernia.
There is some tortuosity of the aorta, however, no aneurysm is seen.
There is evidence of remote right posterior rib fracture.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Decreased consolidations in the superior segments of the right lower lobe and in the basal segments of the left lower lobe.
Small pleural effusions, left greater than right, increased in size from the prior examination.
There is no axillary, supra or infraclavicular, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Multiple small mediastinal nodes measure up to 6 mm, not meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Coronary artery atherosclerotic calcification is present.
There are bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, which has slightly progressed compared to the prior CT and most likely represent atelectasis.
A small left pleural effusion is slightly increased.
Trace right effusion has decreased.
Scattered non-characteristic 2-mm subpleural nodules are unchanged.
Small hiatal hernia is present.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified.
Increased bilateral consolidations, greater on the left and consistent with atelectasis which extends along the aortic contour and corresponds to findings on chest radiograph.
Slightly increased small left pleural effusion.
Coronary artery atherosclerotic disease.
Apico-posterior left upper lobe consolidation has markedly improved.
Atelectasis in the lingula has worsened.
Bibasilar consolidations left greater than right are grossly unchanged consistent with atelectasis with the exception of a new area of opacity in the lateral right base(3, 47) .
Mediastinal lymph nodes are increased in number measuring up to 15 mm in the left lower paratracheal station.
There are no enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes.
Minimal cardiac enlargement and trace pericardial effusion likely physiologic is unchanged.
Coronary calcifications in the LAD and circumflex artery are unchanged.
A small left and trace right pericardial effusions are unchanged.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Irregularity of the posterior right seventh rib is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Improved consolidation in the left upper lobe, increased atelectasis in the lingula.
Though there is a new opacity in the lateral aspect of the distal right lower lobe (3, 47) superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was no gross aspiration or penetration.
Brief Hospital Course: 80-year-old male with hairy cell leukemia in remission, prostate cancer s/p cystoprostatectomy with ileal stoma, recently s/p cholecystectomy and parastomal hernia repair presents with persistent fever.
His wound has been followed by Surgery and is now healing.
At the time of admission there was no sign of active infection.
Pyoderma gangrenosum could cause fever, but was improving on steroid treatment.
Oncology did not believe that this represented a flare of his hairy cell leukemia.
CT scan revealed multifocal infiltrates, treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible pneumonia.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed, revealed neutrophilic predominance in both lobes but no clear signs of infection.
Following completion of antibiotic courses for both pneumonia and urinary tract infection, the fevers continued.
Chest CT revealed consolidation similar to those seen in [**2114**] when he was diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum.
On [**2117-8-27**], the patient was transferred back to the MICU in the setting of fevers, rigors, tachycardia, and respiratory distress, with rise in lactate to 9.6.
His fevers were attributed to sepsis possibly from VRE UTI; urine cx [**8-23**] positive for VRE.
Based on bone marrow biopsy results, was also less concern that fevers were secondary to his leukemia.
Patient had been afebrile for 5 days prior to discharge and had been transitioned off of IV antibiotics.
# UTI:  patient was initially treated for a UTI as source for his persistant fevers and UA cleared.
Patient continued to have fevers and a repeat urine culture grew both yeast and VRE.
Patient was sent to the ICU with respiratory failure and concern for sepsis and was therefore treated for these pathogens.
# Oral Herpes:  Patient developed a painful eschar on his bottom lip in response to the high dose immune suppressants.
# C Diff:  Patient was having high volume stool out put for several days with multiple negative C. Diff toxins.
Given his persistant fevers and overall tenuous appearing state of health he was treated emperically with metronidazole.
Patient was then switched to PO vancomycin as had little change in his stooling frequency.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: On [**8-27**], patient triggered on the floor for tachycardia, tachypnea and marked nursing concern.
Had desat to high 80's on NC, became tachypneic to the 40's and was placed on a NRB.
Was felt that his tachypnea was likely secondary to his underlying acid base disturbance, given elevated lactate and increased oxygen consumption in setting of fever and rigors.
Repeat CXR showed minimal improvement, and has patient had not been improving on vanc/zosyn for possible HCAP, antibiotics changed to linezolid/meropenem.
Meropenem was discontinued after several days without fever and patient continued to be stable on linezolid alone.
# A fib with RVR:  The morning following admission, the patient became tachycardic to the 170s with BP 80s/40s.
Further fluid boluses were given to support volume status.
The patient did not convert to normal rhythm and several hours later became tachycardic and hypotensive to 80s/40s.
# Abdominal wound:  Patient presented with a healing abdominal wound from recent surgery.
# Hypertension: Continued metoprolol 50 mg daily, ASA 81mg daily, was also started on lisinopril 5 mg daily prior to discharge for persistantly elevated BPs to the 160s.
# Pyoderma gangrenosum:  The patient has a history of PG at an abdominal sugical site and in the pleura.
This was initially decreased as his skin manifestations removed, but as his pulmonary symptoms increased there was concern for repeat disease in the pleura and lung.
Based on review of data, Pulmonary team ultimately felt it was unlikely the patient had pulmonary involvement of his pyoderma.
# Hyponatremia:  The patient was hyponatremic, likely due to hypovolemia, during his stay at [**Location (un) 620**].
During his stay, he had periods of hyponatremia in the high 120s to low 130s.
He was felt to have a low solute from his ileal conduit and poor PO intake.
His NaHCO3 dose was increased to TID with some improvement also thought to have a reset osmostat given the chronicity of his sodium.
Flow cytometry revealed an increased percentage of hairy cells, but not to the point of justifying treatment.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed to determine if the HCL had increased to the point that it would justify treatment to reduce fever and pyoderma.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 10% of marrow composed of hairy T cells, and per Heme/Onc this degree of involvement does not warrant treament, especially due to risks of neutropenia with treatment.
Patient should be actively monitored for any signs of fever, extreme hypertension, tachycardia, significantly altered mental status as possible signs of serotonin syndrome.
Will need to be seen for reevalution of surgical wound as an outpatient.
Iron studies revelead an anemia of chronic inflammation as well as an iron deficiency with an iron saturation of 14%.
3. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
14. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 3548**] [**Doctor Last Name 3549**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: 1. vancomycin resistant enterococcus urinary tract infection 2. yeast infection of the urine 3. hospital acquired pneumonia 4.
You started to taper off of your immune suppressants, and were treated with antibiotics and antifungals for a UTI as well as a presumed pneumonia.
You were briefly admitted to the ICU for difficulty breathing which was felt to be related to an aspiration event.
You were seen by our speech and swallow experts who determined you were not having chronic occult aspirations.
You also received treatment for a c. diff infection of your colon.
You had a bone marrow biopsy showing that your hairy cell leukemia was stable.
