RUQ U/S - Gallbladder wall edema/thickening in a distended gallbladder, without evidence of stones or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign.
Wall edema/thickening is most likely secondary to third-spacing of fluid; however, acute cholecystitis could have a similar appearance in the appropriate clinical setting.
Major diagnostic considerations would include lymphoma, however, the patient has reportedly previously undergone lymph node biopsy which [**Last Name (un) 19692**] negative for malignancy (all per surgery).
Other diagnostic considerations include Castleman's disease, HIV, connective tissue disorders, and mononucleosis, among many other disorders.
Incomplete identification of the appendix due to extensive lymphadenopathy, with free fluid in the right lower quadrant at the cecum and within the pelvis .
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Chronic loss of vertebral body height of T7, 8, and 9. .
CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process.
ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6174**] is a 41yo male with PMH notable for ITP s/p splenectomy presented with with fevers and abdominal pain, initially in septic shock and requiring pressors with blood cultures positive for streptococcus pneumonia, treated with antibiotics, dexamenthasone, and IVIG, with prompt resolution of unstable hemodynamics, with further uncomplicated hospital course.
Sepsis - patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated lactate, marked leukocytosis with bandemia, with eventual pneumococcal positive cultures.
Lumbar puncture, urine, and chest xray were all negative for signs of infection.
Abdominal pain - patient initially presented with mid-epigastric pain along the level of the umbilicus.
Surgery was initially consulted in the ED who did not feel that there was an underlying infectious process.
RUQ ultrasound was performed with no acute pathology.
Within 8 hours of arrival in hospital, abdominal pain resolved.
Liver function tests were mildly abnormal.
Lymphadenopathy - patient was noted to have diffuse mesenteric LAD on CT torso.
Question as to whether patient has Castleman's disease given immunoglobulin deficiency history.
Patient discharged to home tolerating PO feeds, ambulating on his own, with stable vital signs, afebrile for 3 days.
Please contact your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop any worrisome symptoms such as fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, vomiting, etc.
