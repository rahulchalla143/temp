The patient has had problems with mild to moderate pulmonary edema since transfer.
He had worsening shortness of breath afterwards.
He was noted to be in pulmonary edema on examination and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation and treatment of his pulmonary edema and possible transfusion for low hematocrit.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Lungs - coarse sounds throughout, no wheezes, crackles about half way up bilaterally.
Cardiovascular - jugular venous distention about 10 centimeters, carotids normal with brisk upstrokes, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with metallic opening snap.
Extremities - Positive pitting edema of the lower extremities to thigh  Positive pitting edema in arm.
Well healed scar on left arm, PICC in the right arm, dressings to both heels for decubitus ulcers.
Chest - well healed medicine scar, dressings to both chest tube sites with serosanguinous drainage.
Chest x-ray - right loculated effusion, increased left effusion.
Electrocardiogram - ventricular paced electrocardiogram,  Transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2123-8-18**], revealed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, severe left ventricular hypokinesis, decreased right ventricular systolic function, 2+ aortic insufficiency, prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid valve, positive ascites, positive left pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 54 year old man with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid valve, who has been on a trach mask since discharge on [**2123-9-6**].
He has chronic problems with pulmonary edema.
He presents on [**2123-9-20**], with increased shortness of breath and pulmonary edema in the context of having a chest tube pulled that day.
Cardiovascular - Myocardium - The patient's ejection fraction postoperative was 20 to 25% with severe left ventricular hypokinesis.
On admission, he had pulmonary edema and it was decided to continue to diurese him with a goal of negative two liters by the next day.
His Mavik was discontinued secondary to this low blood pressure.
His Digoxin was also discontinued secondary to increased Digoxin level.
In the setting of his decreased blood pressure, right femoral arterial line was placed.
The etiology of his shock was felt to be vasodilatory, sepsis versus myxedema versus adrenal suppression and the patient was started on Neo-Synephrine.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**2123-9-28**], showed an ejection fraction of less than 25% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
He seemed slightly fluid overloaded.
Because of low blood pressure in the morning following his Captopril dose, his Captopril dose was decreased to 25 mg t.i.d.
Coronary arteries - The patient's last catheterization was [**2123-4-16**], showing one vessel coronary artery disease which was stented.
Conduction - The patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with inducible ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiology study.
The patient will need pulmonary function tests at some point as an outpatient because of the possible side effect of pulmonary fibrosis with Amiodarone.
Valves - The patient has prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid valve.
The patient's Heparin drip was stopped for several days in the beginning of [**Month (only) **] because of a large left groin and thigh hematoma which developed.
It was restarted but then stopped again briefly because of bright red blood from his trachea, however, this stabilized and by discharge, he was back on the Heparin drip for several days.
Pulmonary - The patient has a history of congestive heart failure.
He presented with pulmonary edema and left pleural effusion.
Additionally, right chest tube was removed on [**2123-9-20**], no pneumothorax seen on chest x-ray.
He continued to require frequent suctioning and sputum was sent for culture.
In addition, the patient's chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary edema and possibly pneumonia.
Because of his history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, he was began on Levaquin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.
On [**2123-9-24**], the patient's right pleural effusion was tapped and it was found to be a transudate.
Left pleural effusion was still present.
At that point, his sputum culture was positive for Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and it was decided to treat that for ten days.
In the first few days of hospitalization, bronchoscopy was done showing dried blood, no active bleeding which was consistent with suction trauma.
Once he was identified with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, his Levaquin and Flagyl were discontinued.
On [**2123-9-28**], in the setting of decreased blood pressure, the patient requiring increased oxygen requirement and desaturation into the 80% range on FIO2 100% trach mask, the patient was ventilated with good oxygenation on FIO2 60% and PEEP of 10.
Chest x-ray on [**2123-9-30**], was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and right lower lobe pneumonia.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus with question of adult respiratory distress syndrome.
CT showed pleural herniation, no lung tissue.
On [**2123-10-6**], his Zosyn course of seven days for possible sepsis was finished and it was discontinued.
His repeat chest x-ray on [**2123-10-6**], showed decreased bilateral pleural effusions and no change in his right middle lobe infiltrate.
CT surgery indicated that the left bulge is a chest wall defect intercostal with no lung present on CT scan.
There is moderate left sided effusion and they recommend a thoracentesis but no treatment for the bulge.
The patient did experience two days of bright red blood from  his tracheostomy tube and interventional pulmonology was following him.
They did do a scope and found some superficial bleeding vessels and were planning to cauterize it but then the bleeding stopped on its own and it was decided to hold off on cauterization and scoping.
CT surgery was called to take a look at it and they decided that there was nothing to be concerned about, that there was pleural fluid in that bulge and could be treated conservatively and left alone.
Renal - The patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine on admission appeared to be at his baseline, however, he was also felt to be intravascularly dry with a high ratio of blood urea nitrogen/creatinine on [**2123-9-24**], with third spacing of his fluids so there was an increase in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine over the next three to four days with decreased urine output not responding to Lasix.
On [**2123-10-5**], he had a slight decrease in urine output and it was decided to transfuse the patient with two units of packed red blood cells to help mobilize his fluids.
His increased bicarbonate was thought to be secondary to diuretic treatment/transfusion/contract alkalosis.
His Lasix drip was also discontinued because of an increase in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.
On [**2123-10-12**], the patient was given fluid boluses of 250 cc times three, total of 750 cc for low urine output and a dry state.
Hematology - The patient was anemic on admission thought to be iron deficiency anemia, which seemed to be chronic.
The patient's baseline hematocrit at home or in the rehabilitation center was 27.0 to 29.0.
He did have guaiac positive stools, but his lavage was negative.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed gastritis and Barrett's esophagus but no active bleeding.
The patient did have a low haptoglobin and hemolysis workup was done.
Initially his hemolysis laboratories were negative as was his bronchoscopy negative for active bleeding.
On [**2123-9-28**], in the setting of decreased systolic blood pressure and increased hypoxia, central arterial access and central venous access was attempted and after multiple sticks bilaterally, right femoral artery and right femoral CVL were obtained, however, the patient received a right femoral hematoma, small and well circumscribed, and a left large hematoma, but remained clinically stable.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained on [**2123-10-5**], showing left groin hematoma and right psoas hematoma, 4.0 by 4.0 centimeters.
Ultrasound of his groin was negative for pseudoaneurysm and it was decided on [**2123-10-6**], to recheck his hematocrit at noon because of decreased from 32.0 to 28.0.
On [**2123-10-6**], it was decided to stop his Heparin drip for the decreased hematocrit but then on [**2123-10-7**], it was decided to restart it at 1000 units per sliding scale with goal partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 60.
On [**2123-10-8**], it was noted that his left groin thigh hematoma was less indurated.
He was thought to have hemolytic anemia, most likely due to his artificial valves.
The patient's right groin A line was pulled on [**2123-10-10**], and he developed a small right groin hematoma which remained stable.
His tracheostomy stopped bleeding after a couple days.
On [**2123-10-13**], the patient's hematocrit was 27.7 and it was decided to transfuse him one unit of blood, not so much for the thought of him actively bleeding anywhere, but more for intravascular volume.
Coumadin was given the afternoon of discharge as well 5 mg with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5 for valvular protection.
Infectious disease - The patient was afebrile on admission with copious secretions.
The patient completed Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia on [**2123-9-2**].
He was thought to have pneumonia on admission.
Sputum culture was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
For Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, Vancomycin was being dosed p.r.n.
On [**2123-9-29**], he was noted to have rigors and increased temperature from his baseline hypothermic of 98 to 99.
In the setting of an increased cardiac output and decreased SVR to the 200 to 600s, he was felt to have sepsis and he was covered with Zosyn for seven days to cover pseudomonas.
On [**2123-10-5**], the patient was afebrile with a white blood cell count of 14.0.
White blood cell count continued to decrease and he continued to remain afebrile until discharge.
Endocrine - The patient has diagnosis of hypothyroidism.
In addition, endocrine consultation was obtained for adrenal crisis on [**2123-9-28**], in the setting of hypotension, decreased urine output and respiratory failure.
Because of continued increased level of TSH and decreased level of free T4, the endocrine team recommended increasing his Synthroid dose to 0.2 mg q.d.
He was continued on tube feeds and Zantac for prophylaxis.
The patient was guaiac positive on admission and was evaluated for gastrointestinal bleed.
Video swallowing study from previous hospital admission showed positive aspiration.
FEN - The patient was in fluid overload on admission.
He was also thought to be intravascularly dry with third spacing.
The patient was not placed on intravenous fluids given his total body fluid overload and third spacing.
He was thought to be dry with low urine output.
On [**2123-10-13**], the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for intravascular volume repletion.
The patient does have a history of stroke in the past prior to admission with left finger numbness as a residual effect.
On [**2123-10-13**], when his ************* valve was successful and the patient was finally able to speak, he did seem to have a more elevated mood due to his feeling happy about being able to speak.
He was on Prevacid for gastrointestinal prophylaxis and multipedis splints.
Because of multiple attempts to place an arterial line, he had a large left groin hematoma.
Ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm and he was followed and the induration due to the hematoma did seem to decrease in size as did the tenderness.
Physical therapy who evaluated the patient during his hospitalization stay could not mobilize him very much because of his right groin femoral arterial line, however, this was maintained for longer than would have been ideal because of his intermittent decreases in blood pressure.
He did develop a small hematoma in the area but his remained stable.
The patient to be NPO and have a video swallow study on the day after arriving at the rehabilitation center, possibly [**2123-10-14**], or [**2123-10-15**], to compare with the previous one and to evaluate him for aspiration before restarting p.o.
The patient has a left chest wall bulge.
