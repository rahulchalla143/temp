ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 30984**] is an 84-year-old man with stage IV colon cancer with metastases to his liver and his pleura, who has been accumulating large right-sided pleural effusions.
The cytology at that time was negative for malignancy.
He had reaccumulated a large pleural effusion on his right side and was therefore admitted for elective drainage of this effusion, and insertion of a PleurX catheter for future management of his effusion.
He was admitted electively in order to allow his INR to become subtherapeutic, as he had been on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
His INR had come down to 1.4 by then and the plan was for him to undergo an elective drainage of his effusion on [**10-5**].
The patient became acutely hypoxic on the evening of [**2114-10-4**] secondary to what was felt to be worsening pulmonary edema, given the patient had not been taking his Lasix for several days.
On the morning of [**2114-10-5**] the patient became increasingly confused and agitated.
An arterial blood gas was drawn which showed a pCO2 of 112, indicating that the patient had developed some acute on chronic CO2 retention as his pH at that time was not significantly low (7.27).
Therefore, he was transferred to the ICU for drainage of his effusion and possible initiation of positive pressure ventilation if necessary.
The patient stabilized with additional diuresis not requiring a BiPAP mask, and on that same day underwent drainage of his pleural effusion, at that time 2.4 liters of clear fluid were drained.
There was no evidence of hemothorax or infection in the fluid.
The patient's respiratory status still remained somewhat tenuous although he symptomatically felt better and his mental status improved.
He was discharged afebrile with normal hemodynamics and as noted an oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters.
