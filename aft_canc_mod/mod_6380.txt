At the time of exploration she had a large mass occupying most of the right lobe and medial segment of the left lobe.
Unfortunately, the mass extended and obliterated the umbilical fissure such that it was not possible to develop a plane that would allow separation of the blood supply to the medial segment and protect the blood supply and bile ducts of the left lateral segment.
Intraoperative ultrasound confirmed dilatation of the left hepatic duct and the tumor extending right up to the left hepatic duct and the umbilical fissure behind the tumor that was obliterating the umbilical fissure.
She had moderate ascites at the time.
She had undergone preoperative right portal vein embolization in preparation for right hepatic trisegmentectomy.
It demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastasis.
The abdominal CT demonstrates significant response to chemotherapy with decrease in size of the lesion with less involvement near the umbilical fissure.
She notes that since she was last seen she has developed atrial fibrillation, for which she is on aspirin.
She has no history of smoking, IV drug use, marijuana use, tattoos, hepatitis, or piercing.
