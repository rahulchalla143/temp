Heart remains mildly enlarged with left ventricular predominance.
The mediastinal contours are unchanged, with mild calcification of the aortic knob again demonstrated as well as a mildly tortuous course of the thoracic aorta.
Streaky opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific, possibly reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Streaky bibasilar opacities, which could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo Male with hx of AVR, CAD s/p CABG, MDS- pancyopenia, non-hodgkins lymphoma, and Parkinson's who was relaeased from the hospital 2 months ago for a pneumonia who returns with a HCAP and new a. fib w/ rvr.
1) HCAP pneumonia/sepsis- Pt initially sirs criteria, and presented with dry cough x2 weeks, new weakness, and his CXR was concerning for a new RLL inflitate.
With the pt's history of Parkinson's disease, was at risk for aspiration due to dysphagia, and thus cause recurrent pneumonia.
Pt's dry cough did not improve with cough syrup, tessalon perles and nebulizer treatments and thus had an ENT consult which found mild irritation of vocal cords most likely related to acid reflux or viral infection.
Laryngoscopy did not show vocal cord paralysis and structurally normal.
Cough mildly improved while on the floor, but still with significant cough at discharge.
2) New Atrial fib w/ rvr in 120s likely due to stress of increasing cardic output in septic picture.
Other concerns included his thyroid medicine and new ischemia but TSH normal and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Echo was done which showed LVEF>55%, no thrombus.
Aspirin was held due to thrombocytopenia.
On stopping, patient tended to be borderline tachyardia with intermittent atrial fibrillation and bigeminal PACs.
When his pulmonary symptoms resolve, metoprolol should be considered if his tachycardia/afib persists at rehab.
4) MDS/Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: s/p chemo and BMT, chronic thrombocytopenia.
Pt had no bleeding issues.
Patient required transfusion of 1 unit of platelets prior to PICC line placement but otherwised remained above transfusion threshold without evidence of bleeding.
9) Left ear ceurmen: Stable.
# Transitional issues: - Consider starting patient on metoprolol for new atrial fibrillation, was started in house, then discontinued given reactive airways.
Should be restarted if he continues to have tachycardia/afib once pulm symptoms resolve.
- Patient started on high dose PPI while in house given ENT evaluation of laryngeal inflammation from possible reflux.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Living  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Health care associated pneumonia New atrial fibrillation  Secondary: Myelodysplastic syndrome Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Patient is afebrile with stable vitals.
Lung exam with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and transmitted upper airway sounds, breathing is nonlabored.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 35501**],  You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for symptoms concerning for pneumonia.
We treated your pneumonia with antibiotics and your fevers resolved.
