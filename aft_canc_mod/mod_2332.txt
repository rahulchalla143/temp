Ms. [**Known lastname **] has remained pancytopenic requiring transfusion support and has required periodic admissions with fever and infections.
Most recently, she was noted for acute increased pain and swelling around her left eye with fevers and she was admitted on [**2134-11-13**].
Clinical picture was initially concerning for orbital cellultis, which was ruled out by CT sinus imaging, showing only preseptal/periorbital involvement.
She was treated with Zosyn/Vancomycin for six days while hospitalized and her cellulitis markedly improved.
Wound swab of the left eye grew rare pseudomonas aeruginosa and sparse staph coagulase negative bacteria.
She more recently has had episodes of stool incontinence which has mainly occurred at night.
She underwent MRI imaging without contrast which did not show anything concerning outside of degenerative disc disease.
Her peripheral blast count has been increasing and she underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2135-1-10**] which unfortunately showed increasing blasts in the biopsy.
After further discussion of treatment options, the decision was made to [**Year (4 digits) 10836**] froward with more intensive chemotherapy with MEC in hopes of getting her leukemia in better control and then move forward with another DLI.
On the floor she reports progressive malaise over the past few weeks leading up to discovering her disease progression.
She also has been having mild bone pain of the legs for the past few weeks similar to past bone pain, but less severe.
She has no other complaints and no recent illnesses.

End of [**Month (only) 958**]/beginning of [**2133-3-17**], ongoing workup for weakness and confusion at OSH, and noted to have low blood counts including anemia and thrombocytopenia.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and she underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2133-4-28**], which revealed involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with monoblasts and monocytes accounting for 29% of the aspirate differential, categorized as AML, FAB subtype M5B.
Treatment course complicated by an episode of acute appendicitis with E. coli bacteremia and s/p appendectomy.
Neurologic workup during her admission to evaluate her symptoms of transient weakness, shakiness, and headaches were felt consistent with conversion disorder.
MRI of the brain was negative, LP was negative, EEG results were negative for any seizures and her symptoms resolved during the course of her initial hospitalization.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2133-12-11**], due to persistent low counts and increased monocytes on her peripheral blood did not show any evidence for leukemia although with possible dysplastic changes.
Admitted on [**2134-1-31**] due to worsening upper respiratory symptoms with temperature to 100.2, increased congestion/sinus pain and cough.
Nasal washings were positive for parainfluenza with no pneumonia.
In [**1-/2134**], platelet count continued to decrease and repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2134-2-18**] did not show any evidence for recurrent leukemia but was noted for Trisomy 8.
Because of persistent drop in her neutrophil count and platelet count, she underwent repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2134-3-4**] which showed increased blasts with CD34-blasts comprising 10-15% of marrow cellularity.
Noted for increased liver function transaminases and bilirubin with acute GVHD, Grade III.
Admitted on [**2134-3-27**] with fevers and right hand cellulits and sinus infection with conjunctivitis.

Admitted on [**2134-6-9**] for fevers with pneumonia.
She remained profoundly neutropenic, but because she was otherwise feeling well with no ongoing fevers, she was discharged home on [**2134-7-7**] to complete a course of Zosyn.
Repeat BM biopsy on [**2134-6-30**] showed a markedly hypocellular marrow (5% cellularity) with erythroid dominant hematopoiesis with mild erythroid dyspoiesis.
Diagnostic morphologic features of involvement by acute leukemia are not seen.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2134-7-15**] showed an erythroid dominant marrow with myloid hyperplasia and left shift.

Following her admission, she developed fevers for which she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
She complained of neck and jaw pain for which she underwent a CT revealed stranding/lymphadenopathy concerning for infection in the neck.
Her symptoms improved on these antibiotics and she remained afebrile.
Her symptoms recurred again in [**Month (only) 958**], with continued blasts on peripheral smear after MEC and 1 week post-DLI with extreme fatigue and gum pain felt to be related to recurrent leukemia.

Following completion of daptomycin course for 10 days, her fevers resolved and she was afebrile for 5 days prior to discharge.
After discontinuation of dapto and conversion to PO regimen of cefpodoxime, Ms [**Known lastname **] continued to be afebrile > 72 hours.
She was neutropenic at time of discharge, but afebrile.

You also did develop a jaw infection and a low blood pressure with fevers for which we kept you on several antibiotics and briefly admitted you to the intensive care unit.
You continued to have fevers which required us to keep you on antibiotics for several weeks.
The source of your fevers may have been a urinary tract infection, which cleared with the antibiotics.

(3) We are giving you oxycodone for breakthrough pain - you can take [**12-18**] pills as needed every six hours.
(4) You can apply caphasol gel to the mouth ulcers that you get to help decrease pain and irritation.
