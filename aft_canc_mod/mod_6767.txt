Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.

ST depression in lateral distribution and STE in avR and V1 in the setting of hypotension is suggestive of demand ischemia and underlying coronary artery disease, likely in a left main territory.
Initial TTE showed mild regional LV and septal wall-motion abnormality and LVEF 40%.
He was intermittently placed on a low dose of phenylephrine to maintain MAP>70 to prevent further ischemia associated with hypotension.
Subsequent cardiac catherization showed The LAD had diffuse proximal 80% stenosis involving the origin of a large D2, also with diffuse 70-80% disease.
# Pulmonary Edema.
Likely developed in the setting of NSTEMI leading to diastolic dysfunction, which is one of the first signs of cardiac ischemia.
CXR is consistent with pulmonary edema.
# Hypotension.
Could be secondary to general anesthesia, cytokines, but should rule out infection.
CXR without evidence of pneumonia.
# Prostate cancer s/p robotic prostatectomy.
Surgery proceeded uneventfully with minimal blood loss.
Patient initially endorsed pelvic pain upon arrival to CCU, but resolved on its own.
Patient developed hematuria that was wine-colored the day prior to discharge, but per urology team, this was ok in the setting of post-op and recent anticoagulation.
Hematuria resolved on its own prior to discharge.
# Hyperglycemia.

Discharge Instructions: You had your prostate removed and had a heart attack after the operation was complete.
A cardiac catheterization showed that you have 2 major blockages and will need surgery to bypass the blockages.
In the meantime, we have started you on medicine to help your heart recover from the heart attack and to prevent chest pain.
You also have been given nitroglycerin to use if you have chest pain at home.
You can take one tablet under your tongue, wait 5 minutes, then take another tablet if you still have chest pain.
Call 911 for any chest pain that does not go away with nitroglycerin.
You can also call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or the heartline if you are unsure what to do for chest pain .
Always call to inform, review and discuss any medication changes and your post-operative course with your primary care doctor  -For your safety and the safety of others; PLEASE DO NOT drive, operate dangerous machinery, or consume alcohol while taking narcotic pain medications.
-Colace has been prescribed to avoid post surgical constipation and constipation related to narcotic pain medication.
Discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops.
-Start prescribed antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin) 1 day prior to scheduled Foley catheter removal and for two subsequent days  -resume your regular home diet and remember to drink plenty of fluids to keep hydrated and to prevent constipation  [**Hospital 16237**] medical attention for fevers (temp>101.5), worsening pain, drainage or excessive bleeding from incision, chest pain or shortness of breath.
START aspirin every day to prevent another heart attack 2.
START nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.
Please call the Heartline or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for any chest pain at home.
