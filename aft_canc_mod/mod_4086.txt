She was doing well for several years.
Approximately one month ago she had an episode of chest pain which resolved and then another episode of chest pain one week later and dyspnea on exertion.
An echocardiogram done on [**2117-9-13**] showed concentric LVH with an ejection fraction of 50-55 percent, mild aortic insufficiency, severe AS with a peak gradient of 113, and mean gradient of 72, moderate MR, mild TR, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
TE on [**2117-9-21**] showed LVH with EF of 50-55 percent AS, mitral annular calcification with mitral valve thickening, and moderate MR.  Cardiac catheterization performed prior to this admission on [**2117-9-29**] showed severe native three vessel disease with a patent LIMA to the LAD, circumflex 90 percent with a PTI stent, saphenous vein graft to the OM had an 80 percent lesion, RCA 70 percent lesion with significant damping, mild aortic insufficiency, mild aortic arch dilatation.
No peripheral edema.
Congestive heart failure.
Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to Crestor which gave her splenomegaly and elevated LFTs.
Surgery was cancelled on [**2117-9-29**] for a platelet drop to a low of 60,000.
The patient was complaining of shortness of breath at home, orthopnea, and unable to have a conversation secondary to shortness of breath.
The patient presented to an outside hospital Emergency Department and was treated for CHF with much improvement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient's blood pressure was 124/63, heart rate in sinus tachycardia at 94, respiratory rate 25, saturating 97 percent.
She was short of breath with talking and at the time she was laying flat for a chest x-ray with significantly increased shortness of breath and heart rate.
She was alert and oriented, appropriate with a nonfocal neurologic examination.
The heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, grade III-IV/VI systolic ejection murmur that radiated to her carotids.
Her abdomen was soft, round, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
The extremities were warm and well perfuse with no varicosities and trace peripheral edema.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and CHF.
Bone marrow biopsy showed a question of early myelodysplasia syndrome.
The patient had an episode of epistaxis on the 15th and was seen by Dr. _________________ of Hematology.
On [**2117-10-11**], the patient underwent redo CABG with a vein graft to the RCA and aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm mosaic porcine tissue valve.
She had some low blood pressures.
She became unresponsive with bradycardia to asystole noted on the telemetry strip.
CPR was briefly initiated with bagging but she became responsive within several seconds and was sleepy but alert.
She had sinus tachycardia on EKG and stable diffuse ST changes that were unchanged since her recent EKGs.
On postoperative day number one, the patient had some metabolic acidosis and received 3 amps of bicarbonate which helped resolve this problem, lactate up to 11.6 and back down to 6.0.
On postoperative day number two, the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26, platelet counts dropped again to 79,000.
The patient had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
The patient was seen and evaluated by Case Management as part of the screening process.
The patient had decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional expiratory wheezes.
The patient had 1 plus peripheral edema.
On postoperative day number seven, the patient had a small amount of sternal drainage the afternoon prior but the incision was clean and dry on the morning of postoperative day number seven.
There was no erythema.
There was still some increased peripheral edema and elevated glucose.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult for diabetes management was called.
On postoperative day number eight, the patient still had significant peripheral edema, approximately 2 plus bilaterally.
The patient had some metabolic alkalosis from probable fluid overload.
The patient was seen again by the [**Last Name (un) **] fellow to evaluate her diabetes management and recommended having the patient following up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], beeper number [**Serial Number 57556**].
The patient had 2 plus peripheral edema.
Status post redo coronary artery bypass graft times one    and aortic valve replacement.
Congestive heart failure.
Aortic stenosis.
Mild insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
