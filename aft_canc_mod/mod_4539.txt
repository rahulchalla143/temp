ECHO [**2106-10-14**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic function.
Borderline dilated and hypokinetic RV.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT Chest [**2106-10-13**] here is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Small bilateral pleural effusionsand associated bibasilar atelectasis are new.
Bronchiectasis and bronchialwall thickening involving the anterior segment of the right upper lobe (2:28)is unchanged since [**2106-8-4**].
Allowing for the limitation of significant respiratory motion artifact, multiple poorly defined nodules in the left upper lobe: a 5-mm perifissural nodule (2:17) in the apical posterior segment, and two other ground-glass opacities in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe measure 5 mm each (2:18 and 20).
A 3-mm noncalcified left apical posterior segment nodule on aCT of [**2106-8-4**] is now calcified (2, 19), suggesting that it is a granuloma.
A 5-mm noncalcified superior segment of right lower lobe nodule is stable since [**2106-8-4**] (2:25).
Extensive adenopathy in the superior mediastinum, bilateral axillae, anterior mediastinum, tracheobronchial stations and the para-aortic space are again present: the largest right hilar node measures 18 x 26 mm compared to 13 x 21 mm on the prior study (3:46).
Confluent prevascular adenopathy has also increased in size and number (3:31).
A left upper extremity peripherally inserted central venous catheter tip terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.
The proximal esophagus is mildly dilated and contains food debris, possibly a mechanical effect of the extensive posterior mediastinal adenopathy.
The study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, only to confirm extensive para-aortic and retroperitoneal soft tissue masses which are incompletely visualized and stable perinephiric fat stranding.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
New small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Mixed interval change in size of extensive axillary, hilar, superior and posterior mediastinal adenopathy.
There is enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar adenopathy with slight interval reduction or stability of the axillary and posterior mediastinal masses.
Three new left upper lobe poorly defined nodules, in the setting of recent surgery could represent aspiration or infection.
Stable mild right middle lobe bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT & PLAN: A 69 yoM with PMH Paroxsymal afib, CLL, Parkinson's Disease, chronic sinusitis and MRSA pneumonia admitted for Pseudomonas sinusitis and called out of MICU after 4 day stay for Afib with RVR.
Culture data showed sensitivity to cipro and cefipime, however patient is allergic to fluroquinolones.
He was treated with cefipime and vancomycin, given history of MRSA sinusitis.
#: MICU course: On HD 4, he developed a fib with RVR and hypotension to SBP 70, he was transfered to the MICU where he was treated with fluid resussication and rate controlled with amiodarone and digoxin, he converted to sinus rhythm and both were discontinued and metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
CTA chest was performed which was negative for PE, ECHO showed borderline hypokenetic RV and normal LV systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was noted.
# Parkinson disease: Patient has slow scanning speech and a shuffling gait, no resting tremor appreciated on exam.

As you know, you were admitted for pseudomonas sinusitis.
In your hospital stay, you developed atrial fibrillation and were admitted to the intensive care unit for low blood pressure related to atrial fibrillation.
Your heart rhythm returned to [**Location 213**] and you were started on metoprolol to prevent return of atrial fibrillation.
We noted that you are anemic (low blood), although not in a dangerous range, we recommend that you have your blood checked in one week and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29469**] to discuss your red blood cell level.
We made the following changes to your medications: - Start Metoprolol 12.5mg three times per day - Start IV Cefipime three times per day - Start IV vancomycin twice per day  Followup Instructions: Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from Ear Nose and Throat to arrange follow up for this Thursday ([**10-21**]) or Friday ([**10-22**]).
