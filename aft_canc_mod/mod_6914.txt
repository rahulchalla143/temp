Left atrial abnormality.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-8-25**] there is no significant change.
Retrocardiac opacity likely combination of atelectasis and effusion.
A superimposed pneumonia in this region cannot be excluded.
CXR ([**9-9**]) FINDINGS: There is essentially unchanged presentation of the left pleural effusion and of a left retrocardiac consolidation, most likely consistent with atelectasis.
The right lung is clear without evidence of pneumothorax, consolidation or pleural effusion.
There is a right Port-A-Catheter in place with its tip ending at the superior vena cava  IMPRESSION: Compared to [**2194-9-6**], there is unchanged left retrocardiac consolidation, consistent with atelectasis and there is unchanged left pleural effusion.

The patient's mental status returned to baseline after antibiotics and a decrease in her VBG CO2.
A CXR was unchanged from prior, and ABG (thought to be venous stick) showed labs c/w hypercarbia probably secondary to over oxygenation after the trigger event.
There were no signs of acute pulm edema or CHF.
During her ICU course, her hypercarbia generally resolved on nightly BIPAP and NC throughout the day at 2-4L.
# Dyspnea.
The patient was slightly dyspneic at baseline on presentation.
The CXR was consistent with fluid overload.
# Diastolic Heart Failure.
The CXR was consistent with fluid overload.
The patient had an elevated BNP as well.
The lopressor was later stopped due to patient and family refusal.
She did not have any signs of acute CHF.
# Hyperkalemia.
The hyperkalemia was likely in the setting of acidemia.
Throughout the pt's hospitalization, the pt had episodes of hyperkalemia noted on AM labs that responded well to po Lasix and po Kayexalate.
# Crohn's Disease: The patient was continued on her home mesalamin.
