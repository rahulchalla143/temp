Shock: Patient felt to have picture consistent with sepsis, initially maintained on levophed and phenylephrine.

Endocarditis: Vegetations and perforation of mitral valve with 3+ mitral regurgitation; largest vegetation 1.5cm on anterior leaflet.
CT of head and chest done, negative for evidence of septic emboli.
CHF EF currently preserved, but with 3+ MR and mild AI, AS.
Will try to avoid high afterload states so as not to worsen MR. Monitor closely for evidence of hemodynamically significant perforation.
Patient given PRN lasix to eleviate SOB when volume overloaded.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient fluctuates between NSR and paroxysmal AFib.
Patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation.
week 3 of admission, patient in a fib, started dilt drip with no response.
patient maintained on amiodarone, but this was dc/ed secondary to hemoptysis.
given IV BBlocker, became hypotensive, given dilitiazem IV, and then started on drip.
Valves: vegetations and perforation of mitral valve with largest vegetation 1.5cm on anterior leaflet.
Hemoptysis: patient developed frank hemoptysis that eventually respolved within 2 weeks during hospitalization.
Etiology unknown, but possibley secondary to mitral regurgitation.
Amiodarone toxicity also possible, this was discontinued.
Pt treated by medical service until [**9-2**] at which time he was brought to operating room for MVR with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
