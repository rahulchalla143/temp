Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old man with s/p left parietal resection of a tumor REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for residual tumor with and wittout gad.
FINDINGS:  There has been evacuation of a large left parietal lobe hemorrhagic mass.
There was enhancement along the margins of the hemorrhage on the preoperative studies and there continues to be an ill-defined area of enhancement in the location of the most inferior component of the hemorrhagic mass - involving the white matter along the superior margin of the posterior left lateral ventricle.
Overall, there is marked decrease in mass effect related to the previous hemorrhage and edema.
There is no change in a smaller enhancing T2 intense mass which is in the left frontal lobe.
IMPRESSION: There has been evacuation of the hemorrhagic mass from the left parietal lobe.
There may be residual enhancing abnormal tissue in the deepest part of the surgical bed, within the white matter immediately adjacent to the roof of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
The left frontal lobe mass is unchanged.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2133-11-28**] 6:34 PM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for AVM, aneurysm, mass Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old man with new left sided head bleed REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for AVM, aneurysm, mass EXAM: MRI brain.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with new left-sided hemorrhage, for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
FINDINGS BRAIN MRI:  There is an area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema.
The mass measures approximately 4.7 x 4 cm in size.
In addition, an approximately 1 cm rim-enhancing lesion with mild surrounding edema is seen in the left frontal lobe.
There are no other distinct areas of abnormal enhancement identified.
There is no midline shift seen.
There is mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of acute infarct seen on diffusion images.
IMPRESSION: Left parietal hematoma with surrounding enhancement and additional 1 cm enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe are suggestive of metastatic disease.
INDICATION: Brain lesion, with history of renal cell carcinoma.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are bulky mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of which is conglomerate in the precarinal region.
This may be associated with some degree of lymphangitic spread as well.
Multiple scattered pulmonary nodules are also seen, primarily scattered across the right lung.
A couple of tiny 3 mm nodules may also be evident on the left.
Of note, there is an irregular tumor measuring approximately 1 cm in size, which is growing within the left mainstem bronchus, presumably representing invasion from a mediastinal lymph node through the left mainstem bronchus.
There are bulky left hilar lymph nodes, which measure up to 1.5 cm in diameter.
Large right hilar lymph nodes also measure up to approximately 1.6 cm in diameter.
No significant effusion is present.
No evidence of local recurrence at the nephrectomy site.
A punctate calcification adjacent to the gallbladder probably represents external calcification.
This does not quite meet attenuation criteria for adrenal adenoma.
Especially given the low density appearance of the thoracic nodes, this may represent a small metastasis.
There is no significant abdominal adenopathy or free fluid present.
No evidence of obstruction.
A small amount of air within the bladder likely represents recent instrumentation with Foley or straight catheter.
Examination of osseous structures show degenerative changes of the hips.
There is a somewhat patchy and nonspecific pattern of osteopenia within both iliac bones, as well as in the L5 vertebral body.
There is also a 6 mm lytic focus in the seventh vertebral body.
This is also somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Bulky mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, with multiple tiny nodules within the right lung, and a combination of tumor and atelectasis, possibly associated with lymphangitic spread in the left upper lobe.
Together and given the history, appearances are most suspicious for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Small lytic focus within the seventh thoracic vertebral body, as well as the L5 vertebral body.
Also nonspecific patchy osteopenia within the iliac bones.
These may represent small bony metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from outside hospital with a left sided high parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Repeat MRI on [**2133-11-28**] showed  intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a questionable underlying mass and a second lesion anterior to it.
He was admitted to the ICU for further observation and work-up and was taken to the operating room on [**2133-11-30**] for decompression, evacuation of hematoma, resection of underlying mass and biopsy (for further details please see dictated operative note).
Diet was advanced without complication.
A chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan was obtained to assess for metastatic disease (see results section) showing significant lung lesions as well as possible spine lesions.
Patient remained neurologically intact with only minimal left sided strength deficit.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehab - [**Location (un) **], NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Left sided high parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with suspicion of underlying tumor.
Discharge Condition: good neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: please seek medical attention if you experience fever > 101.5, nausea, vomitting, severe pain, numbness, weakness, tingling, double/blurry vision, mental status changes.
