Admission Date:  [**2120-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-11-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Bactrim / Sudafed / Ifosfamide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Intractable vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left subclavian hemodialysis line insertion Hemodialysis Left salpingo-oophorectomy Small bowel resection   History of Present Illness: Patient transfer from OSH .
HPI: Patient is a 57 y/o woman with a PMH of DM type II, HTN, obesity and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH on [**9-16**] with complaints of 5 days of intractable vomiting and fatigue.
She denied diarrhea or abdominal pain at the time.
On history she also noted increasing abdominal girth over the last year with a weight gain of 40 lbs in 1 year.
A RUQ US was done which showed no cholecystitis.
3 days after admission the patient c/o LLQ pain and had some diarrhea so a CT abdomen was obtained.
CT showed diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with a complex cystic solid mass in the left adnexa measuring 12x6x7cm.
Patient then underwent CT-guided intraperitoneal biopsy which was consistent with Burkitts lymphoma.
Her hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure felt to be secondary to tumor lysis syndrome and possibly a component of contrast nephrophathy.
The patient also had an episode of a fib [**2120-9-21**].
She was rate contolled with beta-blockers and anticoagulation was not continued because of hematocrit drop.
She developed acute renal failure and had urgent HD.
Following her HD treatment on [**2120-9-30**] she spiked to 101.8 and developed new oxygen requirements and placed on 100% NRB.
On the morning of [**10-1**] the patient became hypotensive to SBP in 80's responsive to fluid bolus.
The decision was made to transfer patient to ICU for close monitoring in the setting of hypotension, anuria and hypoxic respiratory failure.
In the ICU, she was found to have perforation and sent to OR.
Ultimately, she was found to have a perforated jejunum and s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]).
She is currently on TPN, and last PM developed atrial fibrillation, given amiodarone and converted to NSR.
Currently, she is feeling well with no complaints except mild abdominal tenderness which a controlled with percocet.
She denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: DM type II HTN Obesity Psoriasis h/o GI bleed [**2-8**] AVM on recent colonoscopy h/o squamous cell cancer of R leg   Social History: Lives with husband and step-son in [**Name2 (NI) 10358**] Mass.

Skin: Psoriatic lesions on b/l LE and upper extremities Neuro: AAO x3, moving all 4 extremities, non-focal   Pertinent Results: WBC 9.6 Plt 473 Hct 27.1 Na: 138 K: 4.4 Cl: 98 HCO3: 25 BUN: 51 Cr: 2.2 Ca 8.2 Phos: 4.9 Uric acid: 17.6 .
CT abdomen: Diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with high attenuation throughout omentum, complex cystic solid mass in the left adnexal region, large area of extensive massive soft tissue metastatic tumor occupying a vast majority of the left side of the abdomen, encasing some bowel loops.
Bilateral plueral effusions.
LE US: Negative for DVT .
DIAGNOSIS: Biopsy, "omental cake" High grade malignant lymphoma: The specimen consists of a core needle biopsies of soft tissue and fat, which is diffusely infiltrated by sheets of mediam-sized to large lymphocytes.
These lymphocytes are somewhat monomorphic, with a moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm and one mostly a single prominent nucleolus.
While many of these lymphocytes have smooth nuclear contours, others have irregularly-shaped nuclei.
These are mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies, and scattered tingible-body macrophages present.
There is no recognizable architecture present.
The submitted peripheral smears show no evidence of circulating Burkitt's lymphoma.
The above histologic and reported immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
Given the strong CD10 staining with high (>90%) MIB-1 fraction, Burkitt's or atypical Burkitt's lymphoma needs to be considered.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 y/o woman with h/o DM type II, HTN with newly diagnosed high grade lymphoma who had hospital course complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis, acute respiratory failure, and jejunal perforation s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy on [**10-2**].
Heme/onc (Lymphoma): The patient presented with large ovarian and omental masses and the OSH did a biopsy and felt the patient had Burkitt's lymphoma.
She was treated with (maggrath protocol) 4 days of CODOX-M ([**Date range (1) 68538**]), but unfortunately developed tumor lysis syndrome, hypotension and renal failure.
She was transferred to the ICU in the setting of hypotension, anuria and hypoxic respiratory failure.
In the ICU, she was found to have perforation and sent to OR.
Ultimately, she was found to have a perforated jejunum and s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]), once the patient was stable she returned to BMT.
The patient developed mental status changes and was only responsive to pain.
This is a rare side effect of ifosfamide, and so she was given methylene blue as a treatment and her mental status improved.
She tolerated the CHOP-R well and remained afebrile and without complications from the treatment.
Pulmonary (Cough): As above, the patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure, and was treated with oxygen as needed, nebs, and Zosyn for empiric coverage.
Her serial CXR's revealed LLL infltrate and pleural effusion, that remained stable, though on [**10-14**] her CXR revelaed new increased infiltrate/pulm edema on LUL.
In addition to the above measures as she was noted to have a persistent cough refractory to many anti-tussives, we stopped her lisinopril on [**2120-10-26**] and switched to valsartan.
Although she continued to have a slight dry cough, it was much improved and she remained afebrile and without exam findings through the remainder of her course.
Infectious disease:  As noted above, the patient developed abdominal tenderness and pneumoperitoneum, and was sent to OR.
Ultimately, she was found to have a perforated jejunum.
She was noted to have enterococcus infection in her peritoneal fluid and was treated with vancomycin.
She was found on CT abdomen to have a fluid collection in the pelvis, but this was likely related to her post-op state.
Though, as above to cover for possible GI abscess she was remained on zosyn, vanc and levo.
As her abdominal pain and fevers resolved all of the above medications were discontinued.
Finally, in terms of infection, the patient was noted during her course to have oral lesions consistent with HSV (swab was positive), her pain and lesions improved with acyclovir treatment.
By discharge she was afebrile and with no active ID issues.
Cardiology:  During the patient's course she was noted to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
On the floor she developed afib with RVR and responded to IV lopressor and IV diltiazem.
Cardiology was consulted and felt the patient most likely had peri-op MI and recommended continued beta-blockade.
In addition to the above, the patient's ECHO showed depressed EF from > 55% to 45%, she was thought to have mild CHF, but she imporved with diuresis.
On discharge she no longer displayed signs of fluid overload, and she was rate controlled with metoprolol.
Her sugars were followed closely as she was transitioned to a PO diet and she remained better controlled on lantus, SSI and a diabetic diet.
Renal: As above, at the OSH, the patient was found to have acute renal failure felt to be secondary to tumor lysis syndrome.
She developed acute renal failure and had urgent HD.
