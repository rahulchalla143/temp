Admission Date:  [**2113-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-1-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-11-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracoscopy, pleural biopsy, placement 24F chest tube, placement pleurx catheter   History of Present Illness: 64 yo W w/50 pkyr smoking hx has had several months of increasing SOB and cough was seen at OSH and found to have new L pleural effusion w/ complete lung collapse.
The patient developed SOB this AM w/ABG of 7.32/52/72 on NRB.
Patient demonstrated tachypnea and increased WOB.
CTA demonstrated substantial bil ground glass opacities, L hydropneumothorax; this was felt c/w re-expansion pulmonary edema.
She has multiple children and a supportive family.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: No comparisons.
The liver is normal in echotexture and without focal masses.
There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder contains multiple stones, but no distention or wall edema.
There is no renal mass, stone, or hydronephrosis.
There is no free fluid.
This study is limited due to patient body habitus.
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**1-20**] CTA: CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is also lymphadenopathy in the right hilum, with a node measuring up to 18 x 11 mm.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
It is difficult to assess for left hilar lymphadenopathy because of the presence of a partially collapsed left lung.
There is no pericardial effusion or evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is a moderately large pneumothorax in the left hemithorax, in spite of the presence of a chest tube.
There is also a small left pleural effusion.
There are also atelectatic changes within the residual lobes and ground glass opacity.
In the right lung, there are multiple areas of ground glass opacity and septal thickening.
In comparison to the chest radiographs, this appearance has progressed over two days, and although the appearance is nonspecific by imaging, pulmonary edema is suspected.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Persistent hydropneumothorax on the left, in spite of the presence of the chest tube.
Diffuse patchy ground glass opacities and septal thickening in the right lung, progressive over two days, which may represent pulmonary edema, given its rapid onset.
Pleural fluid cytology: Non-small cell carcinoma, consistent with pulmonary primary; see note.
This profile is consistent with a pulmonary primary.
Pleural biopsy: Pending  Brief Hospital Course: At the time admission to the MICU following previous hospital course documented in HPI, the patient was experiencing an acute exacerbation of her SOB.
CTA was obtained c/w lymphangitic spread vs. pulmonary edema.
Given the temporal relation to chest tube placement, it was hoped that the patient was experiencing re-expansion pulmonary edema that could be improved with lasix diuresis.
The patient did initially experience some relief with lasix, suggesting that this was at least a component of her shortness of breath.
Given diffuse disease evident in the lung, infiltrate could not be radiographically ruled out, so the patient was maintained on vancomycin, azithromycin and zosyn for broad coverage given her severe ilness.
No dominant mass was clearly visible on CT, raising the possibility of breast cancer.
At the time of diagnosis of metastatic cancer, the patient decided that she wished to be DNR/DNI.
On the patient's second MICU day, she developed afib w/RVR to 130s.
Ca and atropine were maintained at the bedside given use of multiple nodal blocking agents, but the patient never converted to sinus.
The larger MICU plan of care had been to reverse any treatable causes of shortness of breath, notably infiltrates via antiobiotics, pulmonary edema with diuretics, and COPD exacerbation with steroids, atrovent and albuterol.
Thus, the team discussed the poor prognosis for return to a good functional level and poor prognosis for survival beyond the short term.
Of note, her pleurx catheter was left in place as it was not causing discomfort and was a tunnelled line.
These combined opioids were succesful in controlling both pain and dypnea.
