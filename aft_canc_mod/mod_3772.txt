Admission Date:  [**2115-12-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-1-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-6-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: s/p Motor vehicle crash  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:  [**2115-12-18**] Exploratory lap and repair of diaphragmatic injury [**2115-12-18**] Washout and debridement of left open tibia fracture to bone; closed reduction left supracondylar femur fracture with manipulation; closed reduction left proximal tibia fracture with manipulation; application multiplanar external fixator; IM nail left femur and closed reduction right wrist fracture with manipulation.
He was found to have a tension pneumothorax, initially treated by needle decompression followed by placement of a left chest tube.
A chest x-ray suggested the presence of the stomach within the left chest, supporting the diagnosis of a traumatic diaphragmatic eventration.
He was also noted to have a comminuted closed femur fracture with intact distal pulses.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VITALS: T 96.2F, Tm 99.8F, BP 131/89, HR 115, RR 24, Sat 99%RA GENERAL: Well-appearing, no acute distress HEENT: Mild anisocoria, mucus membranes moist, no sinus tenderness NECK: Supple, trachea midline CARD: Tachycardic, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g RESP: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABD: Soft, non-distended.
Mildly tender to palpation over surgical scar.
EXT: LLE in brace, RLE leg wrapped; Right forearm in cast, LUE wrapped; non-pitting edema of UE, LE NEURO: Difficult to perform exam.
Pertinent Results: 12/12/07CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Stomach and spleen located within the thoracic cavity, very concerning for extensive left diaphragmatic rupture, with retraction.
Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
Patchy opacities predominantly at the right lung base, in the setting of trauma likely represent parenchymal contusions; aspiration is another diagnostic consideration.
Comparison with any CT done prior to the chest tube placement would be most helpful if available.
IMPRESSION: Extensively comminuted fractures of the distal femur and proximal tibia, with displaced and angulated fractures of the proximal femur and fibula.
IMPRESSION: No ultrasonographic evidence of DVT.
No pericardial effusion.

Patient was admitted to the Trauma Service and taken directly to the operating room for exploratory lap and repair of his diaphragmatic injury.
Orthopedics was consulted given his multiple bone fractures; he was taken to the operating room for washout and debridement of left open tibia fracture to bone; closed reduction left supracondylar femur fracture with manipulation; closed reduction left proximal tibia fracture with manipulation; application multiplanar external fixator; IM nail left femur and closed reduction right wrist fracture with manipulation.
There were no intraoperative complications.
Patient had difficulty with pain control initially.
PCA Dilaudid was initiated and the dose was quickly increased to 0.37 mg. Dilaudid 1-2 mg IV prn for rescue pain was also added and he did seem to benefit from this.
It was discussed with patient and his mother that at some point long acting narcotics would likely be initiated for long term pain control.
However, patient developed delerium in setting of opioid use, so opioids were discontinued and patient was started on ultram.
Tylenol is being avoided due to elevated LFTs.
NSAIDs are being avoided due to impaired bone healing.
Opioids are being avoided due to recent delerium.
Pain was adequately controlled at time of discharge on standing ultram.
Patient developed delerium during hospitalization.
LP performed [**1-1**] showed no evidence of infection.
Elevated transaminases.
Alk Phos continued to trend up on discharge, likely secondary to active bone remodeling.
Patient had elevated platelet count to 1.5 million, likely reactive thrombocytosis due to systemic inflammatory state due to trauma and multiple operations.
Patient had sinus tachycardia post-operatively to the 150s, that was thought to be pain and stress related.
Metoprolol was started to prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
Overall tachycardia is improving.
Patient reported difficulty sleeping due to discomfort, multiple braces/casts in place, etc.
He was getting standing seroquel at night with minimal improvement.
Benzodiazepines and ambien were avoided due to delerium.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Medical Center - [**Hospital1 3597**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: s/p Motor vehicle crash Right pulmonary contusion Left diaphragmatic rupture Left olecranon fracture Left femoral shaft fracture Left supracondylar femur fracture Left proximal tibia fracture Left distal radius fracture Delirium, resolved   Discharge Condition: Good.
You were found to have broken many bones and to have ruptured your diaphragm.
You also became quite confused after your surgery, which was thought most likely secondary to your strong pain medications.
If you have any symptoms of fevers, chills, night sweats, shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity swelling, upper extremity swelling, lightheadedness, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention.
