Admission Date:  [**2188-8-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2188-9-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2120-8-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  OMED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old Bermudan male who initially presented to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**8-25**] with a complaint of nausea and bloody vomiting for several weeks.
In addition, he described an abdominal pain that spread across his abdomen, and which was worse after eating.
He denied bright red blood per rectum, melena, diarrhea or constipation, denied any change in his bowel habits.
He was also hyponatremic, with a sodium of 127, likely due to volume contraction from nausea and vomiting.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy done on [**8-26**] showed diffuse friability, erythema and edema, with nodularity and ulceration of the mucosa with contact bleeding in the pre-pyloric region and antrum, with narrowing of the pylorus secondary to edema.
These findings were consistent with severe gastritis with ulcerations, and a mass could not be ruled out at that time.
Repeat endoscopy on [**8-29**] showed erosive gastritis with ulcerations as well as an ulcerated bleeding 3 to 4 cm mass of malignant appearance in the distal antrum causing a partial gastric outlet obstruction.
Biopsy results revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast revealed circumferential thickening of the gastric antrum, consistent with the patient's stated history of a pre-pyloric mass.
Extensive lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen, worrisome for metastatic disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusions as well as bilateral low attenuation adrenal masses which do not fit with the strict criteria for simple adenomas.
However, bone windows showed no suspicious or sclerotic lesions.
An echocardiogram on [**9-3**] showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%, essentially normal left ventricle, normal right ventricle, trivial mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
On transfer to the Oncology service, the patient denied any weakness, malaise, fatigue, dizziness or pain.
He denied any headaches, blurry vision, visual changes, throat pain, mouth pain, or trouble swallowing.
He also denies chest pain, orthopnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, palpitations, or shortness of breath, or any wheezing or any breathing problems.
[**Name (NI) **] did report some nausea, relieved with Zofran, and history of vomiting previously, but none the day of transfer.
He denies any abdominal pain or problems with bowel movements.
He denied any melena or bright red blood per rectum.
He also reported leg swelling that began in the hospital, and complained of right knee pain and right leg weakness.
He denies any leg tenderness or pain.
The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, femoral bruits, peripheral neuropathy, renal insufficiency that has since resolved, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease.
He has no known drug allergies.
He is a pleasant male, bagged with NJ tube taped in place, comfortable, in no acute distress.
Pupils were equally round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, bilateral arcus senilis present.
No ulcers, no thrush, no lesions.
The neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Soft heart sounds, no murmur.
His lungs were clear to auscultation in the upper lobes bilaterally, but decreased breath sounds in bilateral lobes.
No crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
He had a cough with some white sputum production.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, had hyperactive bowel sounds in all four quadrants, mass palpated in the epigastric area, but was nontender to deep palpation.
No guarding, no rebound.
He had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, strong bilateral pulses, no cyanosis, cool to touch.
His left PICC line with Tegaderm was intact, clean and dry, no erythema, warmth or tenderness, no signs of infection.
His hospital course on the Oncology service was significant for hyperglycemia on the prednisone, and total parenteral nutrition, as well as a deep venous thrombosis in the left axillar vein.
On discharge, the patient was stable, with a hematocrit of 26.3, which had been stable for several days.
