After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the TICU NPO with an NG tube, intubated on mechanical ventilation, on IV fluids and IV Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Fluconazole; with a foley catheter, JP drains x2, CVL, A-Line, and a G-J tube in place; and a Fentanyl drip for pain control.
He was transitioned to Dialudid IV PRN, and when tolerating oral intake, to Dilaudid 2-4mg PO Q3-4Hours PRN with continued good pain control.
CV: Patient with baseline history of CAD, CHF with an EF 25-30%, 3+ Mitral regurgitation, systolic ventricular dysfunction, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
On [**2112-11-5**], the patient experienced [**11-5**] abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,he was made NPO and tubefeeds were stopped, he was triggered for a sustained heart rate in 130s, an EKG revealed Afib with RVR.
Symptoms were believed secondary to hypovolemia.
[**Date Range **] Surgery was consulted to evaluate for possible SMA stenosis/mesenteric ischemia.
A CTA Abdomen on [**2112-11-7**] demonstrated patent mesenteric vasculature without evidence of embolic filling defects, and extensive atherosclerotic disease is present, though without evidence of critical stenoses.
On [**2112-11-11**], the patient underwent ultrasound-guided puncture of left brachial artery, second-order catheterization of superior mesenteric artery, abdominal aortogram, selective superior mesenteric arteriogram showing 70-80% stenosis of SMA, and primary stenting of superior mesenteric artery for stenoses for chronic mesenteric ischemia, which went well without complication.
Early chest x-rays in late [**Month (only) **] revealed a moderate left effusion as well as a small right pleural effusion.
Over the hospital course, these resolved with later CXR only revealing changes consistent with atelectasis.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged and adhered to throughout the hospitalization.
On [**2112-10-28**], however, the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
Abdminal/pelvic CT revealed portal venous gas and extensive small bowel pneumatosis features consistent with bowel ischemia.
The patient was emergently brought to the Operating Room, where he underwent exploratory laparotomy, which was negative, lysis of adhesions, right retroperitoneal drain removal, intra-abdominal drain placement, and subcutaneous drain placement (see Operative Note).
Due to loose stools, banana flakes were added, and the administration route changed to the G-port from the J-port of the G-J tube, with the J-port clamped.
He received IV fluid boluses when needed, including a 1 liter LR fluid bolus on [**2112-11-18**] and maintenence IV fluid over [**11-19**] and [**11-20**] for poor oral intake.
GU/RENAL: At the time of admission, the patient was experiencing acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.
He was subsequently able to void on his own without problem.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE/INTEG: After surgery on [**2112-10-15**], the patient had a midline incision with staples which remained clean and intact.
Post-operatively, the patient developed progressively worsening erythema and tenderness over his right flank.
On [**2112-10-19**], the patient was brought to the OR for right flank abscess incision and drainage, complex debridement of full-thickness skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and pulse lavage for a right flank abscess with soft tissue necrosis.
He was again taken to the OR on [**2112-10-20**] for extensive incision and drainage of subfascial intramuscular of a right thigh abscess.
The dressings were changed every third day with progressive improvement and development of new granualtion tissue.
Peritoneal fluid culture revealed polymicrobial gut flora with gram negative rods and anaerobes.
IV Fluconazole was discontinued on [**2112-10-21**] as preliminary findings revealed no fungus.
Vancomycin trough levels and renal functions were monitored closely during the admission, and IV Zosyn and Vancomycin dosages adjusted accordingly.
Also, he received 2 units of FFPs prior to incision, drainage, and complex debridement of the right flank abscess on [**2112-10-20**].
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible with assistance.
At the time of discharge on [**2112-11-21**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a low sodium regular diet with improved intake and tubefeeds at goal via the G-port of the G-J tube with the J-port clamped, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
