Admission Date:  [**2139-7-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-4-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**] Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2139-7-6**] Endoscopy with banding of esophageal varices   History of Present Illness: 48-year-old gentleman with hepatocellular versus intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with massive disease progression on reduced dose sorafenib therapy comes in with syncope and coffee ground emesis.
CT abd/pelvis prelim read shows advanced, infiltrative HCC with unchanged occulssion right portal vein seen on [**6-8**] scan, increase in ascites now moderate to large in volume.
Diffuse hyperenhancement of small bowel wall which may reflect ischemia related to GIB, small perf cannot be excluded.
Surgery did not think this was in vascular distribution, attribute [**1-10**] low flow state, do not think clot for them to retrieve or immediate surgical issue at the current time.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a 7.3 x 6.4 x 9 cm mass in the right lobe of the liver, extending in to the left lobe.
In [**2-/2138**], a CT scan showed the mass was enlarging and causing biliary obstruction.
On [**2138-3-28**] he had an exploratory laparotomy and nodule biopsy along with intraoperative ultrasound which suggested that the carcinoma was unresectable.
Since that time he has had seven cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin as well as sorafenib who has continued to have disease progression on those therapies.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: MVA in [**Country 3587**] with head trauma and diminished near vision and occasional low back pain.
His father has heart palpitations and is 87.
Anicteric sclerae.
NECK:  supple, no cervical or periclavicular LAD CARDIOVASCULAR:  RRR, no M/R/G RESPIRATORY:  CTA bilaterally.
no W/R/C ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, and moderately distended.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
IMAGING CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast [**2139-7-6**] Large amount of pelvic ascites is present.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Advanced infiltrate of hepatocellular carcinoma with probable occlusion of the right portal vein as described on previous CT. New interval increase in large volume ascites likely indicates disease progression.
Diffuse hyperenhancement of the small and large bowel likely related to occlusion of the portal system.
Lack of progression of oral contrast material beyond the stomach despite two-hour interval of administration.
There is no definite obstruction as there are no dilated loops of small bowel or air-fluid levels.
No definite free intraperitoneal air.
There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of free air.
KUB [**2139-7-6**] No gross evidence of change.
Contrast now in the colon thus no obstruction.
No supine evidence of free air.
EGD [**2139-7-6**] Findings: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy.
*Impression*: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation) Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy -Normal mucosa in the duodenum -Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
------------------ CT Torso [**2139-6-8**] CT Chest Thyroid and thoracic inlet appear unremarkable.
There is a massive confluent infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma .
Focal areas of Ethiodol uptake are identified within the more central necrotic parts of this tumor.
Aneurysmal dilatation of the left portal vein.
No definite metastatic disease is seen.
Large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable.
CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
There are degenerative changes, possibly represent old trauma, along the right inferior pubic ramus.
CONCLUSION: Massive disease progression with right portal vein and possibly middle hepatic veins are occluded.
No definitive extra-hepatic spread.
Brief Hospital Course: # UGIB  Given his history of right portal vein thrombosis there is concern he may have back up of blood flow to the esophageal and gastric veins which may have ruptured and led to his UGIB.
GI performed EGD with banding of 4 cords of non-bleeding, grade II varices that were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
- AST/ALT slightly elevated above baseline, however his alk phos is lower and t/bili only slightly elevated when compared to b/l.
Given these findings it is less likely he has developed a recurrent common hepatic duct stricture (s/p removal pigtail stent on [**9-15**]).
# GPC in ED blood culture, 1/4 bottles - possibly contaminant, however, pt was started on vancomycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending.
Cultures were obtained prior to EGD and pt has no lines of concern for infection.
Pt underwent Echo which showed no vegetations or signs of SBE.
Because all follow up cultures were negative and pt was afebrile and asymptomatic during his hospitalization the vancomycin was discontinued and he was startd on a two week course of clindamycin.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis Secondary to elevated lactate in setting UGIB with hypoperfussion.
# Hypercalcemia - On transfer to the floor pt was found to have elevated serum calcium (Ca 11.8, Alb 3.0).
# Liver cancer - Patient off treatment since early [**Month (only) 205**].

Disp:*126 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hepatocellular vs intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with portal vein occlusion UGIB secondary to portal HTN Anemia secondary to blood loss Hypercalcemia   Discharge Condition: stable; Hct stable > 48 hrs; no active bleeding; does not require supplemental oxygen; ambulating without assistance; tolerating po diet and meds   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU after you experienced upper GI bleeding requiring multiple units of blood.
During the admission, an endoscopy was performed in which you had multiple blood vessels banded in your esophagus to try to stop the bleeding.
During your hospitalization you were found to have high calcium levels in your blood.
We were also concerned about a possible infection in your blood, and so we did an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there was no infection there.
The study showed no signs of any infection.
There are several other new medicines you should take: the first is called Protonix (pantoprazole).
Please notify your physician or return to the emergency department in you have any return of blood in your stool or vomit.
