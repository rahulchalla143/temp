The right lower lung is now well aerated with minimal residual atelectasis.
Dense alveolar consolidation of the right upper lobe is seen and more confluent than on the study from [**10-5**] at 11:02 a.m. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Improved right lower lobar collapse with slightly worsened right upper lobe pneumonia.
[**2122-10-8**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-7**], there is little overall change in the combination of asymmetric edema and pneumonia in the right hemithorax, somewhat obscured by obliquity of the patient.
Brief Hospital Course: 68F with COPD, chronic systolic CHF, metastatic pancreatic CA, recent admission for COPD exacerbation in the setting of community-acquired pneumonia admitted with septic shock from healthcare-associated pneumonia.
The patient expired from respiratory and hemodynamic complications of septic shock.
#Septic shock: Most likely health care associated pneumonia in the setting of severe COPD, for which the patient required intubation.
Patient had negative viral screens and sputum grew coagulase positive staph aureus.
#Chronic systolic CHF: The patient had a h/o flash pulmonary edema in setting of low EF, most recent EF ~50% prior to admission.
Although there was intermittent concern that the patient's worsening respiratory status and hypotension were a result of poor forward flow in the setting of cardiogenic shock, her CVP and exam were not consistent with this.
# Pancreatic cancer: The patient presented with known pancreatic cancer with mets to liver and skin and pulm nodules seen on CT in [**2122-6-14**].
She had evidence of compromised liver synthetic function with slightly elevated INR.
Chemotherapy was held in the setting of her acute illness.
#Hyponatremia- Suspected to be secondary to hypovolemia based on dehydration on exam and labs.
#Macrocytic anemia - HCT at baseline throughout hospitazliation without evidence of active GI bleed.
