He was in his prior state of health until around Friday ~2-3 days ago when he noticed subjective fever, prodcutive cough with yellowish sputum and worsening shortness of breath.
He took his temperature on the day of admission and found it to be 101.4 F. He acknowledges chest pain only with cough, some difficulty urinating and occassional low leg pain which has been assoicated w/getting his chemo therapy.

Of note, he is chemo/radiation therapy for lung cancer and is schueduled for his next session next week.
On exam he was tachypneic, mentating well with difficult exam in the lungs with poor air movement.
CXR showed new RLL consolidates compatible with PNA and stable masses in RUL and RML.
Pt denied pain currently.
Noted he only had pain w/cough but was not currently coughing.

Multiple other small nodules are also seen throughout the right lung including the right lower lobe, unchanged.
An area of increased subtle density at the right lower lobe base appears slightly more prominent when compared to the recent scout radiographs of the chest CT of [**2115-3-29**], even given differences in technique.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion, stable.
Large right upper lobe and right middle lobe masses with small pulmonary nodules noted in the left lower lobe.
Stable small right-sided pleural effusion.
Although comparison to the recent chest CT is difficult given differences in technique, an area of increased subtle opacity at the right lung base could potentially represent an early pneumonia.
There is increased ground-glass opacity in the periphery of this mass (2:17).
This mass extends medially, invading into the mediastinum and causing obliteration of the right upper lobe apical bronchi, unchanged.
Multiple subcentimeter size nodules within the right lower lobe are grossly stable to somewhat increased in size.
A small pleural effusion on the right is larger.
There remains areas of linear enhancement along the pleura concerning for pleural metastatic invasion.
A 1.9 x 1.6 cm node along the right anterior mediastinum (2:20) has increased in size.
However, apart from the obliteration of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery due to the mass there is no evidence for pulmonary embolus.
No pericardial fluid is present.
There is a small left effusion.
There is fluid within the esophagus which is only somewhat distended.
There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: Again noted is a sclerotic focus within a right anterior seventh rib, unchanged since [**2112**].
There is slight thickening of the posterior cortex of the right clavicle, (4:4), stable since [**2112**].
Increased size of right upper, and right middle lobe pulmonary masses.
The right upper lobe mass invades into the mediastinum causing obliteration of the right upper lobe bronchi, and right apical pulmonary artery.
Increased size of a right pleural effusion with pleural enhancement concerning for pleural invasion.
Some areas of increased ground-glass opacity, particularly in the periphery of the large pulmonary masses.
While this most likely is due to tumor extension, pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
Small left effusion with stable subcentimeter left-sided pulmonary nodules.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery, but no evidence for pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 48 YO [**Year (4 digits) 8230**]-speaking gentleman with NSCLC, Chronic HBV, h/o positive PPD p/w pneumonia   Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] because of hypotension requiring pressors.
CXR with e/o PNA with RUL and RLL infiltrates in addition to known masses, also with fever and cough with sputum production.
A CT chest was done that showed worsening tumor, but no evidence of PE or clear infiltrate.
Home lasix was held in setting of hypotension.
He was noted to have urinary retention and abd pain, so foley was placed and drained 700+ mL of retained urine.
Foley was discontinued prior to transfer to floor due to patient request.On the floor pt remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable not requiring supplemental O2.IV antibiotics were discontinued and patient remained on levoflox with plan to complete a 10 day course.
On discharge pt instructed to restart tarceva as there is recent evidence that discontinuation of tarceva at time of progression can cause a flare of the cancer disease.

Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname **] you were admitted with fever and cough and diagnosed with pneumonia.
You were first admitted to the intensive care unit because of low blood pressure and when this stabilized you were transferred to the Oncology floor.
