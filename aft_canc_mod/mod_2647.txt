Admission Date:  [**2191-8-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2191-9-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-9-1**]     Sex:  F  Service:  BLUE GENERAL SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 17926**] is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism, iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, increased cholesterol, peptic ulcer disease, chronic constipation, and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder.
At the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back.
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder.
It also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct.
A HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of cystic duct obstruction.
The first imaging study that was done at [**Hospital1 18**] was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis.
A differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis.
In addition, also the MRCP showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder.
This biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma.
The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital.
Briefly, the surgery on [**2191-8-23**] revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery.
The patient's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter.
However, the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day.
In addition, the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells.
On postoperative day number two, interestingly, the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology.
Metastatic gallbladder cancer.
Blood loss requiring transfusion.
