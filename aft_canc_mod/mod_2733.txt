Admission Date:  [**2206-7-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2206-8-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: n/a   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]F w/PMHx of suspected bronchoalveolar carcinoma, CKD [**2-16**], CHF, Afib, DM2 on insulin, renal artery stenosis, brought in by EMS from nursing home due to respiratory distress.
The patient was noted to have progressive respiratory distress with a sat of 88% on nasal cannula, as well as a fingerstick blood sugar in the 500s this morning with poor response to 10 units of insulin.
PE could not be ruled out with a CT chest as patient had elevated Cr (1.9) so he was started on a heparin drip.

Hazy opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally is nonspecific, and could reflect an infectious or inflammatory process.
Mild pulmonary edema is considered less likely."
[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2206-7-28**]): "The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion."
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound ([**2206-7-28**]): "No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity."
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, atrial fib/flutter, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted with dyspnea likely secondary to an exacerbation of his heart failure in the setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, for which he initially required supplemental oxygen with 15L nasal cannula and was later transitioned to BiPAP, for which he was admitted to the MICU.
Possible etiologies for his respiratory failure were thought to include CHF exacerbation, pneumonia, PE, COPD exacerbation, or progression of his underlying cancer.
CHF exacerbation was considered the most likely diagnosis given his elevated BNP, pulmonary congestion on x-ray, known diastolic dysfunction, and respiratory distress.
CXR found evidence of pulmonary congestion.
He initially presented with an elevated lactate, which improved after a 500cc bolus.
Over the first 24 hours, his oxygen requirement decreased and he was successfully weaned from bipap.
Health care associated pneumonia was also considered considered as a source of his symptoms given that he had an isolated fever to 101F in the ED.
He was started empirically on vancomycin/zosyn/azythroycin, but this was discontinued after four days because he remained afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis or findings suggestive of PNA on CXR.
He was given standing atrovent nebulizers for a possible COPD exacerbation.
After transfer to the floor, the patient had an episode of hypertension, tachycardia and flash pulmonary edema and required IV lasix and his diltiazem was increased for further rate control and blood pressure control.
Given his renal function and adequate blood pressure control on diltiazem alone, ACEi and [**Last Name (un) **] were not initiated.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] found no evidence of thrombus, normal cardiac output, and normal atrial size.
#Clostridium difficile colitis: Patient had loose watery stools this admission and C. diff PCR was positive.
# Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): On [**2206-7-31**] the patient developed tachycardia to 130's with no visible P waves and a narrow complex QRS that was interepreted as SVT.
# Hypertension: His hypertension was initially managed with nitroglycerin drip, which was eventenually weaned.
He was started on captopril while in the hospital for afterload reduction, and was stopped due to renal impairment.
He was restarted on half of his home dose of furosemide on the floor for diuresis and afterload reduction.
# Diabetes mellitus: Initially had blood glucose 500 at rehab facility.
He was maintiained on an insulin sliding scale with no adverse effects.
# HTN/Renal Artery Stenosis s/p stent placemement:  Hypertension was managed with diltiazem.
# Incidental findings: There is some displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left, suspicious for thyroid mass on the right.
Upon reviewing records from [**Hospital1 3278**], the patient has a known thyroid mass.
#Transitions of care: - will need further titration of his diltiazem for rate control - continue to discuss the indication for anticoagulation givenhis atrial fibrillation - will continue a 14 day course of Flagyl as an outpatient - follow up on [**Hospital1 **] finger stick blood sugars and titrate oral hypoglycemics for further diabetes management - follow up on thyroid mass with possible biopsy, if within goals of care  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**],  You were recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with difficulty breathing.
While you were here, we performed tests that suggest that your heart failure was worsened by a fast heart rate.
This will be expected to cause a lot of diarrhea for the next 1-2 weeks.
In addition, we changed your oral diabetes medication, and you will now take glipizide 2.5 miligrams every day.
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions, comments or concerns.
