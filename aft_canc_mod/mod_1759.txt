Admission Date:  [**2103-8-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-9-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-3-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hypercalcemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 47 year old woman who carries a diagnosis of HTLV-associated adult T-Cell leukemia/lymphoma who presents from routine clinic appointment with hypercalcemia, with a corrected calcium of 15.5.
She received a liter of normal saline, but no bisphosphonate, and was subsequently admitted to the floor.
She was recently hospitalized from [**2103-7-11**] through [**2103-8-4**], also for hypercalcemia with acute mental status changes, which was attributed to progression of her hematologic malignancy.
Her post-chemo course was unfortunately complicated by DIC requiring multiple cryoprecipitate, C. dif colitis, CMV viremia, and a severe abdominal pain requiring bowel rest with TPN.
Since her discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] has been slowly regaining her strength, noting persistent fatigue which has acutely worsened today.
She denies acute confusion or mental status changes which accompanied her previous hypercalcemic episode.
She notes no pain or paresthesias or tetany.
Her last hospitalization was complicated by severe abdominal pain requiring bowel rest- she remains on home TPN and has been tolerating light meals due to a sense of fullness.
She also had CXR evidence of LLL pneumonia and had been discharged on levaquin, which she has taken.
Past Medical History: Stage [**Doctor First Name **] mycosis fungoides (Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, stage IV 1A) with transformation to CD-30 positive large cell lymphoma and development of HTLV-1 Adult T-cell Leukemia Lymphoma .
- [**10-29**]: The patient developed a pruritic, papular rash.
She was seen in the internal medicine and dermatology clinics on several occasions and was treated with antibiotics, triamcinolone, clobetasol, and IV triamcinolone w/ no improvement.
- [**2100-3-12**]: Skin Bx 1: LLE: Superficial and deep perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with perivascular and interstitial  eosinophils consistent with a hypersensitivity rxn.
- [**2100-7-13**]: Skin Bx 2: Atypical superficial and deep dermal lymphoid infiltrate containing CD30-positive cells and showing epidermotropism.
PCR analysis for the T-cell receptor gamma gene showed two sharp bands with a migration pattern suggestive of a clonal rearrangement.
Immunophenotypic analysis -> expanded T-cell population with increased CD4:CD8 ratio (15) and loss of CD7.
- [**2100-9-8**] CT scan: Infiltrating, hypo-enhancing lesion in the R. kidney (?infiltrating neoplasm vs pyelonephritis) compatible w/ lymphomatous involvement of the kidney but was not present on a follow-up scan on [**2101-1-21**].
- [**9-30**]: Photopheresis therapy through an indwelling central venous catheter, placed due to poor venous access.
- [**2101-8-4**]: The patient presented for a follow-up evaluation with clear evidence of disease progression.
Interferon alpha was increased to 6M units three times weekly and bexarotene was started at 150mg daily, decreased to 75mg daily due to poor tolerability.
- [**2101-10-18**]: Hospital admission for severe lower extremity pain at the site of new, large, papular skin lesions.
Biopsy showed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with large cell transformation, involving the panniculus with an unusual angiocentric pattern.
Side Effect: severe palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [**12-26**] to liposomal doxorubicin.
- [**2102-1-17**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 bortezomib plus gemcitabine, dose-reduced during Cycle 2 due to neutropenia.
- [**2102-2-9**] 3M units TIW Interferon alpha restarted - [**2102-3-9**]: Due to the observation that peripheral T-cells contained floret-like nuclei, immunophenotypic analysis was performed on peripheral blood, revealing findings consistent with involvement by patient's known T cell lymphoproliferative disorder as well as CD25 co-expression in a significant population of the neoplastic CD3+ lymphocytes, suggesting a diagnosis of HTLV-1 associated lymphoma.
- [**2102-9-26**]: CT scan: s/p 3 mo off therapy: stable to improved disease: lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, are stable to decreased in size since [**2102-7-28**], with no new pathologic LAD identified.
- [**2103-5-29**]: Treatment Discussion: Re: Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy: Progressive Disease and Difficulty tolerating therapy.
Physical Exam: VS: T98.9 BP128/86 P109 RR18 Sa02100RA GENERAL: Fatigued appearing female in no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, white plaques along lateral left border of tongue, pharyngeal wall nonerythematous without exudates PULMONARY: Minimal bibasilar crackles, otherwise clear to auscultation CARDS: RRR, normal S1, S2, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
no rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN: soft, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, mild tenderness to palpation of the RUQ which is chronic, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
SKIN: no rashes or lesions appreciated.
There is no pneumothorax.
New bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, are a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Superimposed infection on the left cannot be totally excluded.
There is no midline shift or mass effect.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is no acute infarct seen on diffusion images.
Following gadolinium, there is no abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement identified.
In particular, there is no leptomeningeal enhancement seen.
Soft tissue changes are visualized in the paranasal sinuses due to mucosal thickening.
Diffuse low signal is identified within the bony structures, which could be secondary to marrow hyperplasia.
It should be noted that on FLAIR images, increased signal identified at the sulci at the convexity is secondary to these images were obtained following gadolinium.
IMPRESSION: No acute infarcts or enhancing brain lesions are identified.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Nondistended air-filled large bowel loops are seen.
There are no pathologic intraabdominal calcifications.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
Interval development of right middle upper lobe airspace consolidation most consistent with pneumonia, with additional focus of opacity in the left perihilar region, possibly representing additional focus of infection, although enlargement of left hilar lymph nodes is difficult to exclude.
No intra-abdominal explanation for fever.
Colon is diffusely fluid-filled but thin-walled and without associated inflammatory change.
There is no loculated fluid collection or abscess identified.
Diffuse soft tissue anasarca.
No acute hemorrhagic mass seen, nor large area of edema or mass effect on non-contrast head CT.
These immunophenotypic findings and the presence of "floret-like cells" in peripheral blood smear are consistent with involvement by patient's known "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma".

Her hospital course was complicated by Mental Status changes which after ICE therapy necessitating an admission to the ICU without any acute evidence of an intracranial process.
Her hospital course at this time was also complicated by persistent ATLL, hypercalcemia, renal tubular acidosis, acute renal failure, C. Diff colitis, and CMV viremia.
Subsequently she developed hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Due to disease progression in addition to a persistent fungal infection and concern for aspiration goals of care were discussed with her family.
