Admission Date:  [**2113-7-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-9-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Benadryl / Taxol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Metastatic breast cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left frontal craniotomy for resection of tumor   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 61765**] is a 52-year-old right-handed woman, with a history of ER positive but Her2 negative breast cancer, who had a brain metastasis.
She had a neurological follow up and further discussion management of her brain tumors, after her FDG-PET and thallium-SPECT studies on [**2113-7-21**].
This is because her [**2113-7-11**] head MRI detected a new brain metastasis at the left parietal brain near the surface, and she also has worsening enhancement in the brain surrounding the surgical cavity on the right frontal lobe.
She has mild dexterity problem with the use of her left hand.
She then underwent a right partial mastectomy and there was no lymph node involved when sampled.
Her neurological problem began on [**2112-6-24**] when she experienced a sudden onset of left hand weakness during exercise class.
As she recalls, she had 2 episodes in [**Month (only) **] while driving in which she experienced transient left hand weakness that lasted for seconds.
She consulted her medical oncologist who ordered a head CT at [**Hospital6 2910**] showed a mass in her right frontal brain.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 771**] and had a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI that showed a 1-2 cm mass that was enhancing in the right frontal lobe.
Her left hand weakness has recovered and she has full strength there.
Past Medical History: right breast cancer s/p neoadjuvant chemo with breast conserving surgery L foot Achilles tendon rupture s/p repair Migraines Anxiety   Social History: denies tobacco use, [**2-1**] etoh drinks per week.
Motor Examination:  She does not have a drift.
She does not have a Romberg.
Pertinent Results: [**2113-7-28**] 02:36AM BLOOD WBC-7.4 RBC-4.09* Hgb-12.6 Hct-36.0 MCV-88 MCH-30.8 MCHC-35.0 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-218 [**2113-7-28**] 02:36AM BLOOD Glucose-154* UreaN-17 Creat-1.0 Na-144 K-4.3 Cl-109* HCO3-25 AnGap-14  MRI Head + - contrast  The patient is status post frontovertex craniotomy and CyberKnife radiotherapy for right frontal metastatic lesion.
There is a 13 x 10-mm plaque-like enhancing lesion at the superior aspect of the dissection bed, previously measured 12 x 8 mm (image 21, series 10).
This lesion remains suspicious for recurrent disease in the leptomeningeal/dural or less likely peripheral parenchymal compartment.
In addition there is a new subcentimeter enhancing leptomeningeal/dural lesion in the left parietal lobe There is no focus of restricted diffusion to suggest ischemic event and the peripheral intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses are preserved and these structures enhance normally.
Scattered foci in the periventricular and deep white matter which have high-signal intensity on T2 and FLAIR weighted images without demonstrable enhancement are stable and most likely represent sequelae of chronic microvascular disease.
IMPRESSION: Disease peogression with minimal interval increase in the plaque-like enhancing lesion at the superior aspect of the dissection bed and a new subcentimeter enhancing leptomeningeal/dural lesion in the left parietal lobe  MRI [**2113-7-28**](post-op) 1.
Expected postoperative changes status post right frontal craniotomy for tumor resection.
High signal within the resection cavity on T1- and T2-weighted images, likely reflecting a small amount of postoperative hemorrhage.
No definite residual enhancement identified in the right frontal region.
However, findings are somewhat limited secondary to high pre-contrast T1-weighted signal in this region.
Follow up imaging is recommended after resolution of post operative hemorrhage.
Small bilateral subdural air collections within the bifrontal regions, with a mild mass effect on the frontal lobes.
Stable-appearing dural-based enhancing lesion in the left parietal region,consistent with a dural metastases.
Pt tolerated this procedure very well with no complications and minimal blood loss.
Upon post operative exam she is AOx3, moving all extremities with full strength and without neuorolgic defecit.
Her dressing was clean and dry and no active signs of drainage.
Her pain was well controlled with PO and IV pain medications.
Her post op CT head showed no hydrocephalus, acute infarct or hemorrhage and was consistent with post op changes.
Pt doing well and no change from her neurological baseline.
She did have some complaints of nausea with IV pain medications and she was started on PO medications and her IV morphine was discontinued.
Her wound was clean and dry.
Follow up MRI showed Expected postoperative changes status post right frontal craniotomy for tumor resection.
High signal within the resection cavity on T1- and T2-weighted images, likely reflecting a small amount of postoperative hemorrhage.
No definite residual enhancement identified in the right frontal region.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).

Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
