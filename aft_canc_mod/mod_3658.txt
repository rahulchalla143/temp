Also of note, elevated alpha fetoprotein of 135.
CT of abdomen on [**6-16**] demonstrated a 4.3 x 2.9 exophytic mass within segment V of the liver which enhances slightly compared to the rest of the liver.
Also within segment V and to the right of the gallbladder there is a patchy area of arterial-phase enhancement measuring approximately 2 cm x 1.9 cm.
The patient underwent an MRI of the abdomen on [**2133-7-15**] demonstrating a large exophytic lesion, 2 lesions adjacent to the gallbladder, and a 4th lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver.
The other 3 lesions are indeterminate but do appear to be slightly hypervascular.

A recent chest x-ray on [**2133-7-2**] demonstrated a slightly asymmetrical opacity at the left 1st costochondral junction level, likely due to asymmetric degenerative changes at the site.
No pleural effusions.
Another preoperative chest x-ray was obtained, an apical lordotic, demonstrating a dense nodular density in the left upper lobe which measured 2.3 x 2 cm in dimension.
No evidence of pleural effusion.
While in the ICU the patient had intraoperative bleeding converted to open.
The patient had an acidosis trough.
On the back of his neck he did have a severe abrasion, believed due to positioning in the OR which had been treated with DuoDerm gel applied daily.
The patient had an IJ in place which was removed and sent for culture.
Wound care nurse did see the patient for his wound and felt that the patient should have VNA and have DuoDerm gel applied daily with a dry gauze applied on top of that without any pressure to the neck.
