The pt was in her usual state of health until 1 week prior when she began to notice oral lesions occuring over the lips and on the oral mucosa.
These lesions were painful and were limiting PO intake.
Over the course of the week the lesions largely improved with decreased pain and erythema.
She felt feverish and her temperature measured at home was 100.9.
Of note, Pt reports change in vision in the right eye which started 3 days before admission.
It does not interfere with her acuity, she denies diplopia, pain with movement, seeing halos, and associated headaces.
Also of note, pt noted diarrhea begining on Monday, which largely resolved by Wednesday.
Pt received Unasyn and Penacillin G.  Pt reported substernal Chest pain along with sinus tachycardia that subsided as tachycardia resolved.
Facial swellin was evaluated with CT face, which was concerning for subcutaneous air,raising concern for necrotizing process.
ENT evaluation found oral lesions which may be responsible for the entrance of air into her facial soft tissue structures.

A spinal device is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.
CT Sinus/Mandible/maxilla [**2186-12-24**]: Large amounts of subcutaneous emphysema involving the right side  of the face as described.
Findings are concerning for diffuse infection, however, other sources of subcutaneous emphysema such as line placement should be considered.
CT SINUS W/ CONTRAST  [**2186-12-27**] IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in right face soft tissue emphysema with persistent inflammatory changes of the right cheek and buccal tissues.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old female with PMH significant for Breast CA with last chemotherapy on [**12-16**] (Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin) and ANC on admission of 686 presenting  with increased right facial cellulitis.
Patient initially admitted to MICU for management given borderline low neutrophil count along with possible nectrotizing fascitis of right face.
Facial Swelling due to HSV :  This was initially thought to be a cellulitis.
ID was also consulted and patient was placed on daptomycin for Gram-positive coverage, Meropenem for GRN and anaerobe coverage, and Clindamycin to limit toxin production if indeed this was a toxin-mediated cellulitis or necrotizing process.
Facial erythema improved on 2nd day of admission.
A repeat CT sinus showed interval improvement with no abscess.
Given concern of ophthalmic involvement of a possible HSV outbreak, ophtho was consulted, and there was no concern for eye involvement.
# CAD:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5700**] had a complaint of substernal, nonradiating Chest pain in the Emergency Department.
Given her history of CAD with stents to the LAD and LCx; It is likely that in the setting of sinus tachycardia, she had some anginal symptoms.
EKG was without significant ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
Atenolol was briefly held due to an episode of hypotension, but was restarted without hypotension.
# chronic diastolic CHF:  Pt has history of CHF for which she takes lasix at home.
Echo from [**2186-10-13**] shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%), so CHF is presumably [**1-27**] diastolic dysfunction.
Held home lasix briefly because of hypotension, but was restarted at home dose prior to d/c.
Hypertension: Patient had one episode of hypotension on admission which responded to IVF bolus.
# DM type 1: continued home insulin [**Month/Day (2) 4581**] with [**Last Name (un) **] following.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for insomnia, anxiety.
Secondary: bilateral breast CA s/p b/l mastectomy, undergoing adjuvant chemo coronary artery diease chronic diastolic CHF Type 1 diabetes hypertension hyperlidemia hypothyroidism GERD   Discharge Condition: stable, improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with facial cellulitis (infection of the tissue below the skin).
We looked at your mouth, blood, urine, and stool, and could not find a bug that caused the infection .
You also began to develop lesions on your lip that look like they might be viral.
If you experience any symptoms that disturb you, such as fevers/chills, worsening facial or eye pain, or problems with your vision, please call your doctor or go to the ED.
