History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman diagnosed with a cancer of the distal esophagus, clinically stage T3 N1.
He underwent induction chemoradiation therapy admitted for esophageal resection.
Family History: Significant for sister who died of lung cancer and was a smoker.
Physical Exam: General: 53 year-old male in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membrane moist Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy Card: RRR, normal S1,S2 no murmur/gallop or rub Resp: decreased lungs otherwise clear GI: bowel sounds positive, abdomen soft non-tender/non-distended.
Chemoradiation effect in the distal esophagus with  mucosal fibrosis.
No residual tumor seen.
There is focal mucin without tumor cells in the lamina propria (see note).
III:  "Donuts" (AC): Fragments of esophagus and stomach, within normal limits.
(0/1) Note:  Mucin deposits are identified within the esophageal lamina propria and two lymph nodes, without associated tumor epithelium.
The staple line is inked blue and the specimen is opened along the length of the esophagus and stomach to reveal a focal area of erythema measuring 0.7 x 0.3 cm located 5 cm from the proximal margin and 3 cm from the nearest gastric margin.
In addition surrounding this area of erythema, there is a diffusely firm/bulging submucosa proximal to the GE junction extending to within 3 cm of the proximal esophageal margin.
This region is blocked out and serially sectioned revealing a firm and edematous submucosa but no definitive carcinoma seen.
The proximal esophagus and entire gastric staple line margins were frozen with the frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5395**] of : "Esophageal margin, no evidence of malignancy.
Gastric margin: No evidence of malignancy".
The paraesophageal soft tissue and fat is dissected with multiple possible lymph nodes identified measuring up to 1.5 cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: A=frozen section 1 remnant (esophageal margin), B-C=frozen section 2 remnant (gastric margins 1 and 2), D=GE junction, E-N=blocked firm area of esophagus proximal to GE junction including area of erythema, O=additional sections of normal stomach, P=largest paraesophageal lymph node bisected, Q=five possible lymph nodes, R=four possible lymph nodes, S=one lymph node bisected, T, U, V=five lymph nodes each, W-AA=representative sections of paraesophageal fat.
It consists of a fragment of red-tan tissue and mucosa measuring 5 x 3.5 x 2 cm with a 4 cm and 5 cm staple line present.
No pneumothorax has developed.
No new parenchymal abnormalities and no increase in heart size.
Mediastinal findings consistent with esophageal pull-through replacement.
IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings postoperatively, no development of pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
An epidural was placed for pain control managed by the acute pain service.
POD 3 - tube feeds increased to 60, physical therapy initiated with patient for assistance in ambulation  POD 4 - Chest tube and nasogastric tube discontinued, elevated sodium, free water bolus started  POD 5 - epidural and foley [**Last Name (un) **] discontinued  POD 6 - swallow study performed - no evidence of leak or stricture, clear liquid diet started.
