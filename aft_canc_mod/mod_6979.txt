No hemoptysis.
Also reports some slight orthopnea, but no weight gain or LE edema.
She also complains or worsened R hip pain.
She walks with a walker but this has been difficult due to her pain.
At [**Hospital3 **] her HR was 150s in sinus tach, BP 110/70, RA sat 80s, her BNP was found to be 4,000 and her D-dimer was elevated so there was concern for PE vs. CHF vs. PNA.
At [**Hospital1 **] ED her vitals were HR 120s, BP 120/70, sat mid 80s RA, 95% on NRB, CXR showed LLL infiltrate, CTA done which showed no PE but revealed a probable LLL postobx PNA, lactate was 4.5.
NSCLC: s/p RM lobectomy [**9-/2172**], recently started carboplatin/taxol, has been diagnosed with 3 lung cancers of different histologic type, a BAC in the right middle lobe in [**9-/2172**] that was T2; a T1N0 large cell carcinoma of the upper lobe in [**4-/2177**], in [**4-/2178**] wedge resection of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal glandular features, a T1Nx as this was by wedge resection and no nodes were sampled.

Elevated BNP.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
Abnormal septal motion/position.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild (1+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears mildly depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Eval for infiltrate - infection vs CHF  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old woman with metastatic ca, sats 80s RA, cough, elevated lactate.
Eval for infiltrate - infection vs CHF CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: History of metastatic lung cancer with decreasing O2 sats, cough and elevated lactate.
Evaluate for PE versus infiltrate versus CHF.
CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial system enhances normally without evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is dense consolidation in the left lower lobe, new from the PET CT of [**2181-1-25**], demonstrating diffuse air bronchograms, likely representing postobstructive pneumonia rather thean lobar atelectasis.
Loculated fluid in the left major fissure.
7mm spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe, seen on series 3, image 45.
There is diffuse interstitial thickening at the right lung base, with multiple ill-defined, confluent nodular opacities.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no significant pleural effusion.
Again demonstrated are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum in the subcarinal, pretracheal, and AP window distribution.
Bone windows demonstrate innumerable lytic lesions throughout the osseous structures diffusely better evaluated on the prior pet CT. Coronal and sagital reformatted images confirm the above findings.
IMPRESSION: 1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Dense left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and mild expansion and mass effect on the major fissure, likely relating to post obstructive pneumonia.
3) Confluent ill-defined nodular opacities in the right lower lobe, with surrounding ground-glass opacity and interstitial thickening.
The differential for these findings includes pneumonia, progression of pulmonary metastatic disease, and lymphangetic spread.
4) Diffuse extrapulmonary metastatic disease as described above.

# sepsis:  Developed sepsis from a likely postobstructive PNA/lobar PNA due to advanced malignancy.
She did not require pressures during her hospital course but progressively had shortness of breath, requiring ultimately bipap.
After extensive discussion with the family in regards to her goals of care, as she had metastatic lung cancer, and was becoming progressively short of breath secondary to the postobstructive pneumonia, she was changed to comfort measures only and was started on a morphine drip and ativan prn for comfort and ultimately died.
# PNA:  This was thought likely a complication of advanced metastatic NSCLC.
She was initially maintained on vancomycin and zosyn for three days until the outside hospital cultures showed pansensitive pneumococcus and she was changed to penicillin which was discontinued after two days, when she became comfort measures only.
