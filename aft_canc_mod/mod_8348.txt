HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old woman with extensive small cell lung carcinoma with metastases to [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and liver.
A cerebellar metastasis was resected in [**2108**] with whole brain radiation therapy.
More recently, she was discovered to have metastases to the liver which have also been treated a total of five cycles of chemotherapy with her last dose administered on [**2109-12-12**] (five days prior to admission).
The patient was doing well on the day after her last chemotherapy except for left shoulder pain which was relieved with the application of Bengay.
The following day, three days prior to admission, the patient developed a cough with yellow sputum production, and felt very weak, and slept the entire day.
Since that time, her cough has continued, and she has been feeling progressively short of breath.
The shortness of breath is worsened with exertion and describes pleuritic chest pain.
The chest pain is only present with coughing and not associated with nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
She has been having subjective fevers at home, but no chills or night sweats.
Both her husband and her son have been sick recently with an upper respiratory infection.
She denies hemoptysis of dysphagia, but she has been using her inhaler more frequently over the last three days.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient reports decreased oral intake over the last three days prior to admission with a bowel of soup and some Boost as her only oral intake during this time period.
She had one episode of urinary incontinence yesterday evening, but she has not had any problem since.
She denies bowel incontinence or abdominal pain.
No recent blurred vision, focal weakness or numbness, or difficulty with ambulation.
The patient was admitted directly from the Clinic for evaluation of shortness of breath.
Small cell lung carcinoma diagnosed in [**2107-11-30**], and status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of pulmonary embolism in [**2109-3-29**] at [**Hospital **] Hospital.
History of supraventricular tachycardia.
Question of transient ischemic attack in [**2106**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history medical history revealed her family history is strongly positive for rheumatic heart disease.
Her mother died at the age of 53 of heart failure, and brother also with rheumatic heart disease and died in his 40s.
She has no other siblings.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her neck was supple with a large well-healed surgical scar on the left posterior neck.
On chest examination, she had diffuse coarse breath sounds bilaterally with a prolonged expiratory phase and left basilar rales.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed good capillary refill with no lower extremity edema.
Sensation was intact to light touch in the bilateral lower extremities.
She had reproducible back pain to palpation in the left scapular area.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  During hospitalization, a chest x-ray on admission showed post radiation changes in the left perihilar region with hazy areas of increased opacity in the lower lobe (the right greater than the left, possibly indicating pneumonia; however, unable to access to motion artifact.
A [**Month/Day (1) 500**] scan on [**2109-12-24**] revealed no new metastases with improvement in known metastases in the left pelvis and T11.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the head on [**2109-12-23**] revealed no evidence of new metastases.
An transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2109-12-20**] revealed an ejection fraction of 60% to 65%, 1+ aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed sinus tachycardia and early R wave progression.
No ST-T wave changes compared to electrocardiogram dated [**2109-1-21**].
IMPRESSION:  This is a 63-year-old female with small cell lung cancer with multiple sites of metastases presenting with shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue times three days.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted for dyspnea, cough, and fever which was thought secondary to community-acquired pneumonia versus viral infection.
On hospital day two, she was noted to have progressive worsening of respiratory distress, and an arterial blood gas was performed which showed a pH of 7.22, a PCO2 of 61, and a PO2 of 354, and a bicarbonate of 26.
Due to her progressive worsening of respiratory symptoms and a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
She was started on steroids for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and her dyspnea improved significantly.
There was some concern for a pulmonary embolism given her history of pleuritic chest pain and hypercoagulable state, given her cancer, and she was restarted on heparin as her INR on admission was subtherapeutic.
Of note, her chest x-rays consistently showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm which appeared chronic in nature and was likely secondary to radiation-induced changes.
ONCOLOGY:  The patient has a history of small cell lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain, [**Year (4 digits) 500**], and liver; status post multiple rounds of radiation therapy and resections.
While in house, she had an evaluation of progression of cancer with a magnetic resonance imaging of the head which showed no new metastatic disease and a [**Year (4 digits) 500**] scan which showed no new metastases as well as improvement in known metastases in T11 and left pelvis when compared to a [**Year (4 digits) 500**] scan dated [**2109-6-14**].
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On presentation, the patient had subjective fevers at home with a low-grade temperature and 100.7 on admission.
Her admission laboratories were notable for a bandemia of 30%, and an absolute neutrophil count of 250.
As such, she was treated for a febrile neutropenia given her recent chemotherapy.
for empiric coverage.
As her presenting symptoms appeared consistent with community-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin was added.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she had a sputum culture which grew out yeast and was thought to be oropharyngeal in origin given her inhaled steroid use.
A viral culture was also performed and was negative for organisms.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, her antibiotics were switched from cefepime and azithromycin to Levaquin, vancomycin, and Flagyl; and eventually narrowed the spectrum to Levaquin as possible sources of infection were excluded.
She was continued on a 7-day course of Levaquin for pneumonia in the setting of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient with a history of supraventricular tachycardia, but no known coronary artery disease.
She had pleuritic chest pain during her hospitalization which was related only to coughing.
Her electrocardiogram was without changes.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on [**2109-12-20**] for evaluation of congestive heart failure given her symptoms of acute shortness of breath and diffuse rales on examination.
The echocardiogram showed no evidence of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 65%, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
A fractional excretion of sodium was performed on several occasions, and she was found to be less than 0.1%; indicating a volume depletion.
There were no episodes of hypotension to explain acute tubular necrosis.
Urine eosinophils were drawn to rule out acute interstitial nephritis, and were initially found to be negative.
However, a repeat sample (which was sent six hours later) showed moderately positive.
It was unknown how to interpret the test, as the patient did not have any other symptoms of acute interstitial nephritis and seemed to be improving with fluid rehydration.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a history of pulmonary embolism in [**2109-3-29**] which was probably secondary to hypercoagulable state given her neoplasm.
Her Coumadin was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.7, and she was started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit for possible pulmonary embolism.
There was no clear source of bleeding, and it was felt that her anemia was secondary to chemotherapy.
The patient also had a drop in platelets from 190 on admission to approximately 60 while in the Intensive Care Unit; which was also thought secondary to chemotherapy versus heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION/GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has known metastases to liver which showed some improvement by recent chemotherapy.
Her initial presentation included a history of poor oral intake for which she was aggressively rehydrated with intravenous fluids.
By the time of discharge, she had been taking adequate oral intake for approximately 24 hours without difficulties.
He also has known metastases to the thoracic spine.
She has recent complaints of left shoulder and back pain which was concerning for recurrence.
There were no focal deficits on examination, and a repeat magnetic resonance imaging on [**2109-12-23**] showed no new disease.
On numerous occasions during the hospitalization, the patient had some episodes of urinary incontinence; however, she felt this was related to her lack of mobility and inability to make it to the commode in time.
She had no episodes of bowel incontinence, and there was no focal deficits on lower extremity neurologic examination.
Therefore, it was felt unnecessary to a further workup for spinal cord disease at this time.
fingersticks secondary to high-dose steroids for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was found on several occasions to have blood sugars in the 50s.
It was felt that her hypoglycemia was secondary to insulin given from the sliding-scale in combination with acute renal failure with the insulin remaining in the bloodstream longer than normal.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Acute renal failure.
History of small cell lung cancer with metastases.
