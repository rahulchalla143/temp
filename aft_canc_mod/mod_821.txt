The patient was diagnosted with a pneumonia on [**4-22**] by CXR after developing fever and dyspnea while at rehab treated with vancomycin, azithro, and continued on pip/tazo.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 19464**] under Surgery, after initially underoing right inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy complicated by seroma formation.
At that time, he was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, and was also noted to have an atrial tachycardia and troponinemia felt to be an NSTEMI with peak CK 567, MB 49, TnT 2.23.
He has undergone IR drainage and drain placement, with serial cultures demonstrating Pseudomonas and Enterococcus, with plan for prolonged pip/tazo therapy with ID follow-up.
