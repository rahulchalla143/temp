Pt presented [**4-27**] after MRI as outpt "high-grade spinal canal narrowing at T6, and moderate spinal canal narrowing at T8," that was concerning for cord compression.
He was taken to the OR for laminectomy of T5-8, medial facetectomy, foraminotomy for extradural mass on [**4-29**].

There is a linear lucency along the right aspect of the superior mediastinum which may represent an angulated deviated trachea versus air within the mediastinum.
Other linear lucencies within the mediastinum are consistent with pneumomediastinum.
Extensive reticular nodular opacities are again seen bilaterally, consistent with known metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for pneumomediastinum.
Recommend further evaluation with chest CT. .
The acute change is concerning for lobar collapse and a large pleural effusion, possible hemothorax.
Multiple reticular nodular opacities throughout the remainder of the aerated lung is unchanged.
New severe white out of the left lung, probably collapse and large pleural effusion, possible hemothorax.
TEDs / pneumoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs.
On POD2 the patient was noted to have hypotension to SBPs 90's associated with tachycardia to 110's and hypoxia 90's on RA and a low grade fever.
He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring given his metastatic CA history and started on empiric IV antibiotics.
Pt is known to have metastatic disease.
However, pt became more somnolent, but still complained of pain when he was awoke.
He had episodes of hypotension to the 80s requiring boluses.
He was transferred to the MICU, where he was intubated immediately as was unresponsive and unable to protect his airway.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initial ABG revealed significant hypercapnia in setting of narcotics and altered mental status, so hypoxic respiratory failure was initially attributed to hypoventilation.
On bronchoscopy a new necrotic obstructing mass was noticed in his airway causing tracheal deviation.
Most likely the patient experienced an acute bleed of a necrotic tumor, which compressed his airway and led to inability to provide adequate mechanical ventilation.
# Hypotension: On the evening of arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient began to experience labile blood pressures, dropping to the 80s systolic while sleeping and climbing to the 140s systolic when awakened.
Transient hypotension was initially attributed to the use of Propofol for sedation (subsequently changed to Fentanyl/Midazolam) and perhaps large amounts of pain medication that were slow to clear secondary to impaired liver and renal function.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Thought likely secondary to Contrast Nephropathy based on timing and urine electrolytes.
# Metastatic Adenocarcinoma: Suspected lung primary and known bony and liver mets.
He also underwent a T5-8 laminectomy for suspected cord compression secondary to a spinal met on [**4-29**].
He suffered tremendous pain from his extensive disease, which was controlled with Fentanyl boluses in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# Coronary Artery Disease: EKGs obtained were consistent with prior and showed no evidence of acute ischemia.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with two negative sets of cardiac biomarkers.
# Diabetes Mellitus: On oral anti-hyperglycemics at home, which were held.
# Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic inflammation from underlying malignancy.
