Admission Date:  [**2131-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-10-10**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia, malfunctioning pacemaker  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pacemaker replacement Subclavian line placement  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 88 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident female who presents today at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a malfunctioning pacemaker as well as a left lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient reports that she has had an increasing cough over the past several days (pt has difficulty with specifics), and has increasing shortness of breath.
She does not report increased swelling in her ankles, but does report that her legs hurt.
The patient currently denies any fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, chest pain/shortness of breath, or pain with urination.
The patient reports frequent problems with constipation.
RBBB, history of wenkebach, 2:1 AV block 4.
Breast cancer L s/p lumpectomy 9.
COPD requiring constant O2 11.
History of gastric ulcer 13.
NECK: supple, no LAD, no JVD detected, no bruits CHEST: coarse BS and rhonchi throughout L lung field, transmitted to right.
Mildly diffusely tender to palpation.
New left lower lobe consolidation, suspicious for pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Tiny right middle lobe pulmonary artery filling defect, likely representing chronic pulmonary embolus.
Left 7th rib lytic lesion.
Consolidation within the left lower lobe and additional bilateral centrilobular nodular opacities consistent with superimposed infectious process.
Left lobe thyroid nodule may be further evaluated with ultrasound.
EKG [**9-27**]: A-V dissociation with ventricular paced rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-10-4**] atrial sensed ventricular paced rhythm has been replaced by the A-V dissociation with ventricular pacing.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Thyroid U/S [**9-28**]: Scans through the right surgical bed of the thyroid shows no evidence of residual thyroid tissue, masses or lymphadenopathy.
The left lobe of the thyroid is virtually completely replaced by a large solid and cystic mass, which is moderately vascular in the solid portions.
Large solid and cystic mass in the left thyroid corresponding to the lesion on CT scan.
Region of infrahilar opacity in the left lower lung is more pronounced today after showing substantial clearing between [**9-26**] and 20th.
This could be pneumonia, but was probably due previously to aspiration or atelectasis.
Lungs are otherwise clear of any focal abnormalities.
Tiny left pleural effusion or pleural scarring is unchanged.
Slightly worsening interstitial edema.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2131-9-28**], there has been no significant change .
CARDIAC: a. PERFUSION: Patient was chest pain free throughout her admission.
She became hypotensive for several days and her cardiac enzymes remained negative x3 following that episode.
No evidence for ongoing ischemia.
She was monitored on telemetry for her bradycardia which resolved with the replacement of her pacemaker.
She was on a beta-blocker, furosemide and an ACE-I on admission, but those were held once she became hypotensive.
PUMP: Ms. [**Known lastname 98288**] has a history of frequent CHF exacerbations.
She never developed CHF during this admission and it was felt that her SOB and cough was due to pneumonia rather than failure.
However, she then became bradycardic and hypotensive, with the pacer in what appeared to be VVI mode, and it was felt that her symptoms were likely due to pacemaker syndrome.
She had some mild bruising around the pacemaker site, but otherwise did well.
HYPOTENSION: Ms. [**Known lastname 98288**] developed persistent, refractory hypotension on the evening of [**10-1**] with her systolics in the 70s.
She received 6L of NS without any improvement.
She received another 7L of IVF, was started on hydrocortisone and fluorinef for possible adrenal insufficiency and her antibiotics were broadened for possible sepsis.
Once she was stabilized and her pneumonia was improved, she was taken for replacement of her pacemaker which she tolerated well.
On ultrasound, it was found to be a solid and cystic lesion in L lobe thyroid, concerning for malignancy.
PNEUMONIA: On admission, her CXR and physical exam were consistent with focal pneumonia involving the LLL.
Her cough improved, she remained afebrile, and never developed an elevated WBC.
DEMENTIA: Ms. [**Known lastname 98288**] has fairly severe vascular dementia.
PE by CT CHEST: On admission, a CTA was done and she appears to have a "tiny" chronic PE on the right side.
Given the reported history of upper GI bleed after her hip surgery, as well as her history of what sounds like an A-COM aneurysm, it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation outweighed the benefits in this case.
Aspiration precautions.
High protein, low sodium, heart healthy diet.
PPX: She was kept on fall and aspiration precautions.
She was continued on a PPI for GI prophylaxis and SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
She was given senna, milk of magnesia and lactulose for a bowel regimen.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 14991**] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pacemaker dysfunction Pneumonia .
Secondary diagnosis: CAD CHF Thyroid lesion Hypotension   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Please call your PCP or go to the ER if you develop any of the following symptoms: chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, cough, pain or swelling in either of your shoulders, worsening swelling in your arms or legs, low urine output, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any other worrisome symptoms.
You will need to have a fine needle aspiration performed on the mass in your thyroid gland.
