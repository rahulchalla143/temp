Bilateral nephrostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 64 yo F with metastatic breast Ca to brain, vertebrae and ribs, presenting for recent fatigue, nausea, and vomiting and found to have ARF.
She noted hematuria associated with right flank pain for 2 days, during which she passed clots.
She was seen today by her oncologist NP who noted abnormal labs consistant with ARF.
She denies frequency and urgency, but has had mild dysuria.
She denies fever, chills, and denies nausea currently.
- She was diagnosed with metastatic cancer to bone and her   vertebrae and ribs in the back in [**2114**].
Had whole brain radiation earlier this month ([**Date range (1) 94270**]/07) for bilateral frontal masses.
Cataracts .
Multiple tendon releases and carpal tunnel release in    bilateral hands over the years.
She notes an occasional drink and denies any   drugs.

Lingular consolidation and ill-defined bibasilar nodularity that may be inflammatory in nature.
A followup chest CT in three months is recommended to assess for stability.
High-density material in the distended urinary bladder suggestive of a hematoma which may potentially be the underlying cause of ureteral obstruction.No obstructing urinary tract calculi identified .
Diffuse sclerotic bony metastases.
Presumed hematoma within the bladder lumen.
Please correlate with subsequently performed CT.   Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted for acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, found to have b/l hydronephrosis and bladder hematoma.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt found to have abdominal/pelvis mets, explaining compression of ureters.
A 250cc old blood clot was removed.
There was mild bleeding from the mass at the bladder neck which was cauterized.
During this event, the ureteral orifices might have been cauterized which were difficult to identify because of her distorted anatomy.
No stents could be placed due to her anatomy but a 22F three-way foley with continuous bladder irrigation which showed clearing after the procedure.
Nephrology also followed the patient for her post-obstructive ARF.
Her hyperkalemia was managed and improved with improved renal function.
Repeat renal ultrasound showed near complete resolution of hydronephrosis.
# Respiratory failure: Patient required re-inbuation after dropping O2 sats and being unresponsive post-cystoscopy.
There were no signs of infection; her WBC is stable, and she has been afebrile throughout.
CXR done in PACU did not show any acute findings compared to recent CXR VBG of 7.03/84/95 is suggested of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She was likely oversedated, especially in setting of ARF reducing clearance of sedating meds.
# MS changes: She had CT head on [**6-11**] following decreased responsiveness after her procedure.
There were hyperdensities in the frontal lobes, subarachnoid hemorrhage vs. hemorrhage into known frontal mets.
Neurosurgery was consulted and did not feel that this was the cause of acute MS changes that prevented extubation.
No neurosurgical interventions were done.
The patient does have some baseline impaired MS. [**Name14 (STitle) **] and electrolyte derangements from ARF were the most likely contributors to her depressed mental status.
# Metastatic Breast Cancer (including brain metastases): Her Keppra was continued for seizure ppx.
# Anemia: Hct baseline of 33, here has been trending down since admission.
This was likely due to gross hematuria and the 250 cc blood clot found in the bladder.
Hemolysis labs showed elevated LDH but low-normal total bilirubin.
Anemia is likely due to marrow suppression and acute blood loss from bladder.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center at [**Location (un) 2199**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute renal failure Bilateral hydronephrosis Breast cancer (metastatic) Respiratory failure  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of an obstruction that was blocking your urine flow.
Return to the hospital if you note bloody or thick drainage from your nephrostomy tubes, if you have back or abdominal pain, if you have fevers, or if you notice any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
