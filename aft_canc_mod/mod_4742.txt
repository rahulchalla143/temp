When she last received chemotherapy on [**2183-9-2**], a third of the way through the infusion of carboplatin, she developed an intense feeling of heat and generalized body tingling, tingling and numbness of the lips, and chest tightness.
Her vital signs remained stable, but she later had vomiting and headache.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. T 98.1, HR 90, BP 126/67, 94% on RA  Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.
Denies constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - CT abd/pelvis on [**2182-2-28**] revealed a large mass centered in the sigmoid colon with pelvic lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- A colonoscopy revealed a fungating, ulcerated mass within the sigmoid colon causing a partial obstruction.
The biopsy of this mass revealed adenocarcinoma with papillary formation, suggestive of an ovarian primary.
This was a suboptimal tumor debulking.
Extensive firm retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was appreciated.
There was no evidence of carcinomatosis.
Pathology examination revealed serous carcinoma involving full thickness of the rectal wall.
Seven of eight lymph nodes were positive for malignancy.
Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were negative for malignancy.

Micro: None  Imaging: None  Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital COurse: 63F with stage IIIC poorly differentiated primary peritoneal carcinoma, now with disease recurrence and participating in a [**Company 2860**] clinical trial admitted to ICU for carboplatin desensitization.
Patient tolerated the treatment well without adverse effects.
Active Issues: # Carboplatin desensitization: Patient has experienced feeling of heat, generalized body tingling, numbness of the lips, chest tightness,nausea, and headache with prior carboplatin infusion.
The patient tolerated the treatment well and had no signs of hypersenstivity or adverse reaction.
# Stage IIIc poorly differentiated primary peritoneal serous carcinoma: Status post sub-optimal debulking surgery ([**2182-3-14**]) and 6 cycles ofchemotherapy ([**4-/2182**]/[**2182**]).
On [**8-11**] she started chemotherapy according to the clinical trial [**Company 2860**] #11-228 (Phase II, multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of ombrabulin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer treated with Carboplatin/Paclitaxel).
The second cycle was complicated by an allergic reaction to Carboplatin and cycle 3 was administered without complication with desensitization protocol.
She was admitted to the ICU for cylce 4 of carboplatin/paclitaxel with desensitization and tolerated it well without adverse reaction.
She will need to be readmitted to the ICU for future cycles for desensitization and monitoring.
Pending studies: None  Medications on Admission: Zofran for nausea   Discharge Medications: Zofran for nausea   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: -Stage IIIc poorly differentiated primary peritoneal serous carcinoma -Carboplatin desensitization   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **],  You were admitted to the hospital because you previously had allergic reactions to your chemotherapy, carboplatin.
