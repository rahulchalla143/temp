Admission Date:  [**2183-7-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2183-8-4**]   Service:  [**Company 191**]  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Gastrointestinal bleed with inferior ischemic changes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (dependent on insulin), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and dementia who is do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
The patient was apparently having increased lethargy over the past few days.
Rectal examination in the Emergency Department was notable for guaiac-positive stools.
She denied any chest pressure, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.
The vital signs were notable for tachycardia.
An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with ST changes consistent with an inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Bilateral cataracts.
Right tibiotalar fusion with open reduction/internal fixation.
Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
History of lower extremity cellulitis.
Coronary artery disease.
Degenerative joint disease.
No jugular venous distention appreciated.
No murmurs, rubs, clicks, or gallops.
A nondisplaced point of maximal impulse.
The patient did not express nonverbal signs of pain with palpation of the abdomen.
No abdominal bruits appreciated.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram #1 revealed sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute, diffuse ST segment depressions in the precordial leads with ST segment elevations in lead III of 1.5 mm, diffuse T wave inversions, with normal axis, and a Q wave in lead III.
Electrocardiogram #2 revealed a normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, normal axis and intervals, resolution of ST changes and T wave inversions (this was after a transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells).
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates, effusions, or opacities.
No acute processes.
It was the opinion of the Cardiology consultation that the patient's ischemia was related to demand induced by tachycardia induced by hypotension induced by blood loss.
They recommended not putting the patient on heparin or nitroglycerin.
They recommended no colonoscopy, serial hematocrit checks, and transfusions to keep the hematocrit above 30%, and iron sulfate.
The anemia was thought to be secondary to iron deficiency secondary to blood loss from a probable right colon cancer.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  Likely inferior ischemia/inferoposterior myocardial infarction secondary to tachycardia secondary to blood loss.
This was thought to represent a minimal decrease in expression from her baseline at the nursing home.
DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an insulin sliding-scale and had fingerstick blood glucose levels within the range of normal limits for the majority of her stay.
This was thought to be secondary to cognitive issues (e.g.
Nevertheless, she was placed on a thickened liquid diet and monitored for signs of aspiration.
Of note, she did not have any coughing or decreased oxygen saturations during her hospital course.
Amenia secondary to blood loss.
Myocardial infarction (inferoposterior); subendocardial.
