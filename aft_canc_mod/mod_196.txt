Since the previous tracing of [**2190-1-24**] intra-atrial conduction delay is less prominent and further intraventricular conduction delay is present.
CT head: No acute intracranial process.
Specifically, there is no CT evidence of a large vascular territorial infarction, although MRI is a more sensitive test to rule out acute ischemia or infarction, particularly in the setting of extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
2:12), likely representing old healed neurocysticercosis.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Moderate atherosclerotic involvement of the vessels of the head and neck, particularly of the proximal left internal carotid artery.
Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior akinesis and hypokinesis of the inferolateral and lateral walls.
There is milder hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 35%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD (LCx distribution).

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**] is an 86 year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension, CAD s/p stents x 6, cardiac arrhythmia, prostate cancer with pelvic recurrence and possible metastasis, collagenous colitis, and dysphagia who developed right upper extremity weakness (most prominent in the distal extremity) and dysarthria on the day of admission.
Head CT did not demonstrate an acute intracranial hemorrhage, but head MR revealed numerous acute, bilateral, cortical infarcts, particularly in the area of the left precentral gyrus.
The patient's history and examination were consistent with a cortical stroke, resulting in a "cortical hand" and mild dysarthria.
Echocardiogram did not demonstrate thrombi, vegetations, or other masses, though there was moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
EKG was notable for atrial and ventricular premature beats with LBBB, and telemetry revealed PVCs and runs of ventricular tachycardia.
Due to the bilateral nature of the infarcts and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias, the stroke was likely caused by thromboemboli of cardiac origin.
There may have been contributions from hypercoagulability of inflammation (collagenous colitis) and dehydration.
While hospitalized, the patient underwent swallowing evaluations, which revealed small amounts of aspiration while swallowing.
Due to worsened shortness of breath, he also received albuterol nebulizers q6h prn with improvement in his breathing as well as furosemide boluses.
Per family, his dyspnea has been long-standing and does not appear to have any clinical correlates including CXR and O2 saturation.
During his stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 6362**] dysarthria mostly resolved, though he continued to have distal right upper extremity weakness at the level of the wrist and fingers.
Given the bilateral infarcts consistent with embolic strokes, Coumadin was discussed with family and he was started on Coumadin with aspirin bridging.
Patient was also found to have urinary tract infection on [**6-14**] and was started on ciprofloxacin.

4. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke - embolic strokes likely from cardiac arrhythmia Urinary tract infection  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Mild dysarthria and complains of dyspnea but this is chronic.
R hand weakness - wrist extenstion [**2-13**] and some flexion of fingers but "cortical hand."
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital as "code stroke" for acutely weakened right hand and slurring of speech.
Given the acute presentation and NIHSS score of 4, he received IVtPA and was initially admitted to the ICU.
His MRI showed multiple, bihemispheric strokes likely embolic etiology.
He was monitored on telemetry which showed multi-focal atrial tachycardia and PVC's hence cardiology was also consulted who recommended titrating up metoprolol as tolerated.
He was also found to have urinary tract infection during this admission and was started on ciprofloxacin 500mg once daily on [**6-14**].
