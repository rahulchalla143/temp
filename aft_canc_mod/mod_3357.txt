There is slight enlargement of the azygos vein.
There also is subtle peribronchial cuffing and perihilar haziness, combined with moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.
Overall, these findings could be suggestive of moderate fluid overload.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, possibly caused by minimal pleural effusion.
The right costophrenic angle shows no evidence of pleural effusion.
There are no parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
Moderate calcification of the aortic wall at the level of the aortic arch.
[**3-3**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is newly appeared blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of newly appeared mild pleural effusion.
There still is slight enlargement of the azygos vein.
Combined with subtle peribronchial cuffing and perihilar haziness, these findings are suggestive of moderate fluid overload.
No focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
Moderate calcification of the aortic wall at the level of the aortic arch.
[**3-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimal improvement in moderate degree of pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions  [**3-5**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-4**], the pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits, as is the size of the cardiac silhouette.
As compared to the previous examination, there is a subtle increase in bilateral suprabasal atelectasis.
There are no signs suggestive of overhydration, no evidence of pleural effusion and no focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the surgery service for post operative evaluation and treatment.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid and Tylenol with good effect and adequate pain control.
On [**3-5**], the patient had an episode of nausea and emesis, and an ECG was obtained, which did show some ectopy/irregular rhythm, and ST changes for which cardiac enzymes were cycles, and were negative.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout this hospitalization.
The patient was put on Levofloxacin on [**3-6**] as he continued to have increased sputum (often green) and a rising white blood count post operatively.
His white blood count decreased with the addition of levofloxacin.
Mr. [**Known lastname 10378**] did have some coughing during eating initially, however passed a bed side swallow evaluation; he was, however, put on aspiration precautions.
The patient began experiencing some diarrhea post operatively, which was sent for c. diff and was negative; he was put on Flagyl for presumed c. diff, and should continue the medication until [**3-15**].
The patient had occasional small amounts of blood from the rectum/surgical site.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
He was put on Flagyl for presumed c.diff (though he was c. diff negative x 3), and levofloxacin for a respiratory tract infection.
He continues to have a small amount of bleeding from the rectum, which is normal post operatively, especially in his case, as he has had much erosion to the area.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
