There is blood in the left occipital and temporal horns.
There is a calcified posterior parietal mass without mass effect.
Multiple areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, concerning for hemorrhagic metastatic lesions.
Please correlate with any known history of malignancy and an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.
Intraventricular hemorrhage within the left lateral ventricle.
Sclerotic lesion within the right temporal bone, which may represent a metastasis in the setting of multiple brain lesions  CT torso [**2168-4-13**] 1.
No evidence for acute intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, or pelvic process on this non-contrast-enhanced CT. 2.
Distended bladder in the presence of a Foley catheter.
Scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules.
Differential diagnosis includes metastases in a patient with concern for malignancy.
8 cm right renal cyst containing a smoothly calcified septation.
Non-urgent ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted and if not done recently.
4 mm left thyroid nodule.
Non-urgent ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted and if not done recently.
Thick-walled cyst in the left inguinal region, possibly a seroma, but of indeterminate etiology.
Lumbar vertebral body compression deformities, likely chronic given the presence of vertebroplasty material, but chronicity cannot be determined on this study.
Interval progression of multiple supratentorial intraparenchymal hemorrhages which are associated with enhancing nodules suggesting metastatic bleeds.
Stable intraventricular extension without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
Innumerable foci of microhemorrhages scattered throughout the cerebrum which are compatible with hemorrhage in the setting of amyloid disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 y/o F s/p fall presents with multiple hemorrhagic brain lesions.
In ED, she had a general seizure and was intubated for airway protection.
CT torso was done which showed pulmonary nodules.
EEG did not show any seizure activity since she was placed on dilantin.
On [**4-14**]: A MRI was performed which was consistent with Interval progression of multiple supratentorial intraparenchymal hemorrhages which are associated with enhancing nodules suggesting metastatic bleeds.
Stable intraventricular extension without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
Innumerable foci of microhemorrhages scattered throughout the cerebrum which are compatible with hemorrhage in the setting of amyloid disease.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] of neuro oncology was consulted and given MRI results that patient has poor prognosis.
