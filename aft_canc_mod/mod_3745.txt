At the time of the surgery, he had a large mass in the left lateral segment at a site of previous resection that was densely adherent to the right diaphragm and required a left lateral segmentectomy and resection of a portion of the right hemidiaphragm.
There was a second mass lateral that was originally by CT thought to be in segment VI but in fact, most likely represented a large metastatic deposit along the resection margin of the previous segment VI resection.
This was a large necrotic tumor mass between the liver and the diaphragm and right side of the abdominal wall adjacent to Gerota fascia.
On POD 4 he had fever to 102.6.
He had been started on Vanco and Gentamycin on POD 0 as he has a St Jude valve and previous known bacteremia.
He was also felt to have pneumonia based on chest xray and O2 requirements and Gentamycin was discontinued and Ceftazadime added.
Other culture data from this admission showed E coli growing at the drain site and cultures were also sent from the JP drain fluid, both medial and lateral, which need outpatient follow up.
Incision looked slightly reddened, but is intact and without drainage.
