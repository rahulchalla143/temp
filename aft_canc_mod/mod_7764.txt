Left parietal metastatic lesion resection [**12-31**]   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 79388**] is a 58 year-old right handed man who preseneted to the ED from his PCP's office this afternoon after going in for an evaluation of right hand incoordination.
He has some difficulty with his language at present when giving the history, but by his account, he was going in to his PCP due to some difficulty using his right hand over the past several days.
While he was in the office he had a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted around 45 seconds.
There was no tongue biting or incontinence and a no report of focal symptoms prior to the seizure.
Following the event which self-resolved he was confused and on presentation to the ED was noted to be aphasic (difficulty with using the correct words)so a code stroke was called for which NIHSS was 5.
An initial CT showed a large 2.5 cm mass in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema.
He has a recent history of a melanoma on his backj that was removed.
He reports that they felt there were adequate margins and has been followed and reports no recurrence of disease.
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
HEENT: NC/AT Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: CTABL Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended Extremities: no edema, pulses palpated Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
He had multiple paraphasic errors while speaking "pactus - cactus, hand - glove, dursday - thursday"; has difficulty following commands including "stick out your tongue".
No visual neglect, has some moderate right sided tactile neglect.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
R arm pronator drift.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
Subjective pinprick loss on the right hand and arm.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.
Able to walk in tandem without difficulty.
Pertinent Results: [**2100-12-30**] 04:35AM BLOOD WBC-15.0* RBC-3.21* Hgb-11.3* Hct-33.3* MCV-104* MCH-35.3* MCHC-34.0 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-403 [**2100-12-27**] 07:10PM BLOOD PT-10.8 PTT-30.8 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2100-12-30**] 04:35AM BLOOD Glucose-128* UreaN-20 Creat-0.8 Na-142 K-4.8 Cl-105 HCO3-26 AnGap-16 [**2100-12-30**] 04:35AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-4.7* [**2100-12-27**] 07:10PM BLOOD TSH-0.65 [**2100-12-27**] 07:10PM BLOOD ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG  CT head [**12-27**]: A 1.6 x 1.9 cm hyperattenuating focus involving left parietal region with extensive associated vasogenic edema.
The above finding is concerning for metastatic disease, given patient's known history of melanoma.
There are three enhancing lesions as described above, two in the right temporal lobe and one in the left parietal lobe as mentioned above with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema.
These lesions are most likely concerning for metastatic disease given the history of melanoma.
Correlation with CSF analysis can also be considered given the location of the lesions close to the cerebral sulci, to evaluate for leptomeningeal involvement.
A small focus of negative susceptibility in the left parietal/occipital lobe without enhancement.
A small cystic focus in the pineal gland region measuring approximately 3 x 6 mm.
A small subcutaneous nodule in the left posterior parietal/occipital lobe, 7x3 millimeter.
Superficial subcutaneous nodules adjacent to the right deltoid and in the left anterior chest wall, measuring 8-9 mm may represent melanoma deposits, sebaceous cysts, or small lymph nodes.
Multiple small pulmonary nodules, the largest in the right middle lobe measuring 8 mm.
These more likely represent metastatic disease rather than a primary pulmonary malignancy.
Recommend short term follow up.
No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen or pelvis.
Stable left parietal hyperattenuating mass with surrounding edema suggestive of metastatic disease.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
Lytic lesion in the left parietal bone.
Lack of parosseous soft tissue abnormality along with MR features of the lesion suggest that it is likely non-aggressive in nature, perhaps an incidental hemangioma.
No new acute findings.
Blood products limit evaluation for residual enhancement, but the lesion appears to have been completely resected.
MRA Brain-Neck [**1-2**]: Occlusion of the proximal left vertebral artery extending distally through all its segments.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
If clinically indicated, a TEE with saline contrast or a transcranial Doppler with saline contrast would be be more sensitive for detection of a PFO.
Given the large lesion in the left parietal lobe identified on NCHCT done in the ED, he was started on dexamethasone 4mg q6h and Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] at admit.
He had no further seizures during his hospitalization.
MR brain obtained confirmed the suspicion of metastases in the brain, with not only the left parietal lesion observed but also two smaller right temporal lesions.
He also has nodules in his lungs that are suspicious for metastases and two subcutaneous lesions.
This was performed without complication.
Post op head CT revealed no hemorrhage but an incidental left cerebellar infarct.
The patient was neurologically stable and did not show any deficit but the stroke neurology service was consulted for further work up.
An MRI was performed to eval postop and revealed acute left cerebellar infarct but good tumor resection.
MRA revealed an occluded left vertebral artery.
Bubble study revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
His pain was well controlled.
8. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
11. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Left Cerebellar Stroke 3.
Left Vertebral artery occlusion  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
