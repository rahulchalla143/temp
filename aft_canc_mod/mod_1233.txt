Infectious disease:  The patient completed a three day course of ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.
He had a repeat urinalysis on [**2190-2-25**], which was negative for infection.
The patient subsequently remained afebrile without any localizing signs of infection.
ENT:  The patient was noted to have increasing stridor during his stay.
Given his history of subglottic stenosis, the ENT Service was consulted.
Per their recommendation, the patient had an X-ray of his neck, which revealed an hourglass appearance in the subglottic region at the level of the thoracic inlet, which is more severely narrowed as compared with prior X-rays.
