CTA Chest [**2168-2-5**] No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
Scattered opacities in the upper lobes, new from prior, likely early pneumonia or aspiration.
No evidence of pancreatitis.
RUQ US [**2168-2-5**]: Limited exam due to poor acoustic penetration.
Dilated CBD better seen on concurrent CT. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
CXR [**2168-2-5**]: Stable band-like opacity in the left lower lung is most compatible with chronic atelectasis.
Limited study without definite signs for acute interval changes.
Left lobe intrahepatic biliary dilatation has progressed with obstruction at site of known hepatic tumor mass.
Left intraheptic duct measures 10mm in diameter.
CBD is normal in caliber however with no right ductal dilatation 5.
7mm cystic lesion in pancreatic tail.
No peripancreatic fluid.
Multiple irregular filling defects noted at the main bile duct and left main duct.
-Hemobilia was noted, however, minimal bleeding was noted at the end of the procedure with good bile and contrast drainage.
-Tumor tissue were extracted and sent for cytology .
Chest x-ray [**2168-2-8**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2-5**]: Greater opacification at the base of the left lung could be worsened atelectasis or developing pneumonia, either of which can be attributed to aspiration.
Lung volumes are low on the right, but not as severely and without focal consolidation.
Heart size is difficult to assess given leftward mediastinal shift and obscuration of the left heart border by the elevated left hemidiaphragm.
There is no pulmonary edema in the aerated lungs.
Small left pleural effusion is presumed, increased since [**2-5**].
-Multiple irregular filling defects were noted in the CBD, the right and left hepatic ducts, the cystic duct and the gall bladder consistent with blood clots.
-Balloon sweeps were performed and large amounts o f blood clots were extracted from the bile duct -Due to the presence of blood in the biliary duct and due to the possibility of further bleeding, it was decided to place stents in the bile duct.
Otherwise normal ercp to second part of the duodenum .
There is global weakness of the pharynx.
There is no evidence of aspiration.
For details and recommendation, please refer to speech and swallow therapist note in the medical record from the same day.
Labs on Discharge: [**2168-2-12**] 05:17AM BLOOD WBC-10.2 RBC-3.79* Hgb-11.5* Hct-35.4* MCV-94 MCH-30.3 MCHC-32.4 RDW-15.6* Plt Ct-244 [**2168-2-12**] 05:17AM BLOOD Glucose-76 UreaN-7 Creat-0.4* Na-134 K-4.0 Cl-98 HCO3-27 AnGap-13 [**2168-2-12**] 05:17AM BLOOD ALT-206* AST-112* LD(LDH)-298* AlkPhos-690* TotBili-4.7* [**2168-2-12**] 05:17AM BLOOD Calcium-8.8 Phos-2.0* Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo M with PMHx of HIV on HAART, Hep C cirrhosis c/b HCC s/p TACE and RFA, and inclusion body myositis who presented to ED with dyspnea and hypoxia at rehab, found to have a new multifocal pneumonia vs. aspiration on CTA and an obstructive pattern of transaminitis.
# Pneumonia: CTA showed new bilateral upper lobe opacities, concerning for early pneumonia vs. aspiration, no history of prior aspiration or concern from nursing at [**Hospital1 **] that he has been aspirating.
Additionally, he has mild hyponatremia and elevated LFT's, although these are near his baseline it could also be legionella.
Pt was given antibiotic coverage for HCAP and aspiration with vanc/meropenem given PCN allergy.
# Abdominal pain: Patient reported RUQ pain at [**Hospital1 **] night prior to admission, which felt similar to prior "gall bladder pain" for which he received 1 dose of morphine with improvement in his pain.
Labs consistent with possible gallbladder pathology, elevated alk phos and t-bili compared to his admission 1 month ago where he had similar pain, however RUQ negative for cholecystitis.
Per MRCP, appeared to have CBD stone.
Went to ERCP and was found to have no stone, but rather blood clots and necrotic tumor tissue as well as tumor eroding into bile duct.
Thus, obstructive pattern and pain was secondary to tumor/clots.
Did have some hemobilia during the procedure which resolved.
He was already covered for cholangitis with Vanc/Meropenem as above.
On [**2-9**], again developed severe epigastric pain and [**Month/Day (4) 40597**] LFTs, including Tbili, indicative of re-obstruction.
Discussed this with ERCP who felt that LFTs could be monitored given pt was pain free and afebrile.
However, patient is at risk for re-obstruction.
# S/P hip fracture: Patient was on therapeutic dose Lovenox on admission in the setting of recent hip fracture and ORIF.
As pt was at risk for bleed, he was transitioned to heparin drip transiently instead.
# Hyponatremia: PT was mildly hyponatremic to 129, urine electrolytes with fairly high osms but Na is 32.
# Hep C cirrhosis c/b HCC: Patient with known hep C c/b HCC s/p  RFA and TACE.
AST/ALT werestable from his most recent admission, with no evidence of decompensation, no ascites on RUQ or encephalopathy will continue to monitor MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] LFT's.
Given above findings of tumor eroding through bile duct, patient is not likely to be an operative candidate.
# Inclusion body myositis was stable this admission.
# S/P hip fracture: PT received enoxaparin 30mg [**Hospital1 **] for DVT ppx, acetaminophen and lidocaine patch for pain control .
# Depression was stable this admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -full code -continue Vancomycin/Meropenem, last day [**2168-2-14**] -check LFTs every other day x1 week, then every 2 weeks; if RUQ pain or LFTs consistently trending up, will likely need percutaneous biliary drain -Repeat ERCP in 3 months -Of note, imaging revealed a 7-mm cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas likely represents a side branch IPMN and is unchanged when compared to prior imaging.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] & Rehabilitation Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Biliary obstruction secondary to tumor enlargement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and found to have enlargement of your tumor into the bile system.
If you develope abdominal pain again or your liver numbers go up, you will lkely need a drain to be placed in your gall bladder.
You appeared to have an infection in your lungs and are being treated with antibiotics for this.
The x-ray to evaluate your swallowing showed that you were swallowing well, but need some accomodations to your diets: soft solids and crushed meds along with sitting upright while eating.
