Admission Date:  [**2159-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Adult Low Dose Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**] Chief Complaint: CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pericardial effusion REASON FOR CCU ADMISSION: Monitoring post pericardial drain placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial drain placement [**2159-8-9**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 90050**] is a 69F with a history of recently diagnosed synchronous stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma by bronchial brushings) and renal cell carcinoma, currently s/p left nephrectomy and undergoing chemotherapy and radiation.
She underwent CT scan of her chest for re-staging of her lung cancer on [**2159-8-6**], which demonstrated an increasingly large pericardial effusion (had been previously noted on PET scan in [**Month (only) 116**]).
She has recently been experiencing worsening shortness of breath at home, which she notices only with exertion such as carrying a full basket of laundry.
She has had some associated cough, but no sputum production.
In addition, about 3 weeks ago she was seen at [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital for chest pain; she was ruled out for MI and planned for outpatient echocardiogram, which would have been today but she cancelled given her oncology appointments.
She has not had a recurrence of the chest pain.
She was seen today in clinic today by her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who noted her complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion and referred her to the ED for echocardiogram to evaluate for possible tamponade.
In the ED, echocardiogram showed brief right atrial collapse and impaired filling of the right ventricle consistent with early tamponade physiology.
She underwent pericardial drain placement with ~400 cc of bloody fluid removed, followed by rapid drainage of another ~150cc into the drainage bag.
Immediate post-procedure echo showed small residual pericardial effusion with no Fluid was sent for cytology.
No current SOB at rest or chest pain (only very mild site tenderness with drain placement).
Briefly, she initially presented in [**Month (only) 404**] with hematuria, and further work up revealed both a large 9-cm renal mass and a RUL 9-cm mass with mediastinal nodes.
On review of systems, she endorses bilateral chronic hip pain with walking (not new or changed), and dark stool secondary to iron use.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery (though had one GI bleed on aspirin in [**2154**]), myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills, nightsweats or rigors.
No recent cold or flu symptoms.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
She denies dysuria or other urinary symptoms.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea (sleeps with one flat pillow), ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD.
No carotid bruits noted.
CARDIAC: Distant S1S2, no distinct murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pericardial drain in place with ~150 cc of sanguinous fluid in bag.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
CARDIAC: Distant S1S2, no distinct murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Dressing in place at the site of pericardial drain, c/d/i LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
MICROBIOLOGY: - Pericardial fluid [**2159-8-9**]: Gram stain negative for organisms or PMNs.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with most of the fluid located over the right atrium and inferolateral wall.
There is relatively little fluid over the right ventricular free wall.
There is variation in tricuspid inflows, along with brief right atrial collapse and impaired filling of the right ventricle consistent with early tamponade physiology.
No significant respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve flows.
No significant variation in mitral inflows.
There is a residual small pericardial effusion along the infero-lateral wall and right atrium.
The effusion is very small anterior to the right ventricle and significantly improved compared to the prior study dated [**2159-8-9**].There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Post-procedure echo showed a small loculated residual effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
Cytology was negative for malignacy, but suspicion remains high for a malignant etiology.
Pt was asymptomatic at the time of discahrge and specifically denied CP/SOB/DOE, palpitations or lightheadedness.
If pericardial effusion reaccumulates, would consider CT surgery consult for pericardial window.
# RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER: No treatments were undertaken during this hosptial course.
# TACHYCARDIA - Pt remained tachycardic to the 100-120s throughout her course.
Initially it was felt this may have been [**2-28**] tamponade physiology, but tachycardia persisted s/p pericardiocentesis.
She was then transfused 2U pRBCs at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and bolused 1L NS due to concern for anemia/hypovolemia, but tachycardia persisted.
Review of clinic visits revealed that she has been persistently  tachycardic for several months, which may be related to the small loculated effusion that was not accessed by the tap.
The patient denied pain throughout her course and refused any pain medicaitons.
This is likely related to chonric disease, and pt was transfused 2U pRBCs during this admission.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: She had a low grade leukocytosis throughout her admission, which is consistent with her baseline.
She remained afebrile and normotensive throughout her course, pericardial and urine cultures were negative and CXR showed no evidence of pulmonary process.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# HYPERTENSION: Generally normotensive.
