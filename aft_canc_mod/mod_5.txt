No ASD is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy.
There is a sessile mural thrombus at the LV apex; the clot is mural and not mobile.
Overall LV systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and extensive apical akinesis.
There is no VSD.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not present.
MV leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no MVP.
Mild (1+) MR is seen.
LV inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2130-2-3**], a LV apical thrombus is now present  [**2131-7-9**] Stress Test: IMPRESSION: No significant ST-T wave changes in the setting of baseline ST-T wave abnormalities.
No anginal-type symptoms.
Abnormal study.
Severe, fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior wall and the a large region at the apex.
Moderately dilated LV.
Hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment IV-B on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**], demonstrates a slight delayed enhancement; however gross stability since [**2129-4-9**] CT abdomen and pelvis suggest a benign lesion.
However, this examination is motion limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely be excluded.
Filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction.
[**2131-7-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast 1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy.
Small amount of fluid along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy.
2) Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to Crohn's disease.
3) Ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer.
4) Unchanged nodular appearance of the left adrenal gland.
6) New bilateral pleural effusion.
7) Increased mucosal enhancement in the perianal region, with probable perianal fistula on the right, new since prior study.
8) Multiple hypodense lesions in the kidney, unchanged since prior study.
male with hx of Crohn's disease, afib, dilated CMP, h/o PE who presents after recent discharge for LGIB in setting of supratherapeutic INR on the same day when colon biopsies were found positive for Colon Cancer.
Patient was admitted for metastatic work-up and cardiology clearance prior to colonic mass resection.
## Colon Cancer: CT abdomen with 3-4 cm mass in ascending colon with enlarged LNs, biopsies positive for Ca.
Pt had CT of torso for staging, showing possible metastatic dz of a single nodule in the liver.
Pt at mod-high risk for moderate risk surgery.
Stress w/ no significant ST-T wave changes or anginal-type pain in setting of stress on [**7-9**].
ECHO on [**7-10**] showed mural thrombus and apical aneurysm.

## Recent GI bleed/Anemia: Hematocrit is stable at 26-30.
Pt denies any grossly bloody stools.
[ ]will send stools for guiac and monitor hct daily.
