EGD the morning of admission showed deep 3cm duodenal ulcer that was cauterized.
The afternoon of the day of admission she developed SVT to 194, was noted to be pale and diaphoretic and presumed to be bleeding.
Massive transfusion protocol was initiated.
She was taken to the operating theatre for an exploratory laparotomy, where a bleeding duodenal ulcer was found and oversewn.
The extent of general bowel edema prevented primary closure of the abdomen.
Post-operatively, she remained intubated and was transferred to the TSICU on general surgery and underwent IR angiography whereupon no active bleeding was found.
On [**2135-10-13**], she returned to the operating theatre for abdominal washout and placement of [**State 19827**] patch for open abdomen.
She remained hemodynamically stable with no further evidence of significant hemorrhage.
On [**2135-10-16**], final results of the liver biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary (likely pancreaticobiliary), and her family rendered her CMO, declining further aggressive interventions.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver, unknown primary.
