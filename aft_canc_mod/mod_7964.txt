Pt triggered on [**8-10**] afternoon for hypotension, low UOP, and hypoxia.
This was tried on the floor but patient became hypoxic and did not tolerate mask.
Also considered fluid overload and she seemed to improve somewhat with diuresis.
It was ultimately thought that sleep apnea was large contributor.

Family History: The patient's grandmother had coronary artery disease.
Her parent's died of cervical cancer and stroke.

No rebound or guarding Ext: edema throughout  Pertinent Results: EKG [**8-10**]: NSR NA NI, TW flattening V5-V6.
no apprec right heart strain other than small Q in III.
CXR: my read: linear atelectasis right mid lung but no evidence of PNA.
Right frontal epidural metastasis.
Multiple bone metastases.
[**8-9**] MRI C-spine w/o contrast: (PRELIM): Metastatic disease involving C5-C7 vertebral bodies with vertebral collapse and retropulsion and epidural component causing moderate compression  on the cord.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Trivial pericardial effusion without tamponade.

Also found to have brain metastases and the patient has been treated with Decadron.
She was determined to have capacity to make this decision and understands the risk of paralysis without treatment.
# Resp failure/hypoxia: intermittent and likely related to obstructive sleep apnea.
She was treated with an 8 day course of antibiotics for health care associated pneumonia with improvement in her pulmonary status.
# Altered ms: underlying psychiatric illness with intermittent hypoxia related to obstructive sleep apnea and brain metastases.
Her outpatient dose of clozapine was continued initially however the patient had periods of agitation during her admission and the clozapine was held.
# Hypotension: The patients home dose of lisinopril was held second to her hypotension on admission.
She may need to be monitored for hypertension and be re-evaluated by her primary physician when lisinopril can be restarted safely.
# ID: For her cough with productive sputum, the patient completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn.
Her cough improved and she remained afebrile for the duration of her admission.
At discharge she was complaining of dysuria and frequency, but was unable to provide a urine sample.
#Seizure: the day prior to discharge, she had new onset complex partial seizure manifested as left lateral eye gaze with blinking and incontinence.
She was started on Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] without any recurrence of seizure activity.
Bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic breast cancer-brain, bone C5-C7 spinal cord compression [**Hospital 77965**] Healthcare associated pneumonia Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Schizoaffective disorder with paranoia   Discharge Condition: Stable, refusing further intervention for metastatic breast cancer and spinal cord compression.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with arm weakness and were found to have breast cancer spread to your bones and brain.
You were treated with steroids, but declined further chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
You understand the potential for paralysis with untreated spinal cord compression.
Please call your doctor or return to the ED if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, inability to tolerate your medications or any other concerning symptom.
