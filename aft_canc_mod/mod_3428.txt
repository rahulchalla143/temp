HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, mildly distended, no tympany, diffusely tender to palpation, worst at ventral/parastomal hernia, large paraurostomy hernia, nonreducible, no rebound or guarding, decreased bowel sounds, no palbable masses DRE: Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was evaluated by the surgical service in the emergency department.
CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated free air and evidence of necrotic small bowel.
On abdominal exam the patient was soft, mildly distended, no tympany, diffusely tender to palpation, worst at ventral/parastomal hernia, large paraurostomy hernia, nonreducible, no rebound or guarding, decreased bowel.
Given these findings she was taken to the OR urgently for: 1) Exploratory laparotomy with extensive adhesiolysis (>1.5 hours) 2) Reduction of incarcerated hernia 3) Incision, debridement and drainage of periurostomal intra-mesenteric abscess 4) Resection of obstructed, necrotic small bowel with primary anastomosis.
5) Repair of injury of small bowel.
She required multiple pressors for septic shock and IVF resuscitation continued.
She also developed ARDS with poor blood gases requiring high PEEP, low volume with high frequency ventilation.
Her abdominal wall was noted with erythema and edema and she underwent ultrasound-guided aspiration of the ascites fluid from the right parastomal hernia sac.
She has a urostomy that has been noted to put out large amounts of fluids requiring repletion with intravenous fluids and because of this a PICC line was placed due to her poor peripheral access.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for fever or pain.
