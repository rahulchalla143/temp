Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2126-9-18**] Completion Right pneumonectomy with serratus flap   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 22867**] is a 64-year-old female with a history of stage IIIA non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2116**] at which time she underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol, surgery and then subsequent chemo and radiation.
She was doing well until [**2124-6-5**] when an irregular lesion was found in her right lower lobe on CT scan.
Core needle biopsy revealed it to be bronchioalveolar type carcinoma.
On her scan at that time there was also two other areas of ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe raising the possibility of multifocal disease.
On [**2124-6-14**], she underwent a reoperative thoracotomy, pulmonary lysis of adhesions and right lower lobe wedge resection.
Pathology revealed a 3.5 cm well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was originally identified as a pT2 N0 Mx lesion, but within the same wedge, a 1-cm satellite nodule of adenocarcinoma peripheral to the dominant mass was identified and therefore she was deemed T4.
She subsequently received Gemzar and Avastin for a total of eight cycles for presumptive adjuvant therapy.
After this time she underwent surveillance CT scans and most recently had a PET scan in [**2126-7-7**] which revealed a new nodular abnormality with increased activity in the right lower lobe.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid lateral and inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, laterally directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
[**2126-10-1**] CHEST, PA AND LATERAL Since yesterday, filling of the right pleural cavity with fluid progressed.
Subcutaneous emphysema on the right slightly decreased.
Tiny atelectasis in the left with tiny pleural effusions are unchanged.
No other change.
Status post right pneumonectomy with multiple air-fluid levels raising the concern for a fistula between the right bronchial stump and the right pneumonectomy space.
The hyperdense material in the right pneumonectomy space and the right extrathoracic collection are concerning for hemoraghe in the right pneumonectomy and extra thoracic hematoma.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema underneath the right breast tissue and adjacent to the right lateral chest wall.
Small left pleural effusion.
Her pain was well controlled with a Dilaudid/Bupivicane epidural managed by the acute pain service.
On POD #3 she developed atrial fibrillation with a RVR of 130-140's.
Her TSH was mildly elevated in the immediate postoperative state.
On POD #4 she remained in rapid atrial fibrillation.
An echocardiogram revealed mild LVH.
mild regional LV systolic dysfunction, lateral and inferior hypokinesis.
moderate PA systolic HTN and  a small pericardial effusion.
She was ruled out for Pulmonary Embolism by CT.
Her atrial fibrillation remained 80-100's.
The foley was removed and she voided without difficulty.
Her coumadin was held for an elevated INR.
On POD #13 she developed episodes of bradycardia with pauses in the 30's.
She was started on ACE for afterload reduction.
Her atrial fibrillation with RVR continued with HR at times spiking above 140's.
On [**10-6**], the patient and her husband, the nursing staff, and the thoracic surgery team felt that it was appropriate to discharge her with close follow-up.
