Wife states that for the past few weeks, he has had dyspnea on exertion, it had been attributed to anemia and he received pRBC trasnfusions, however, shortness of breath became more pronounced over the past 2 days.
He denied any chest pain or abdominal pain.
He complained of slight cough.
Per wife, he had fever to 101F at home the night prior to admission but afebrile in clinic.
EKG showed low voltage and bedside Echo with pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
CXR with pulm edema, bilateral pleural effusions.
Per records and discussion with family, there is no prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
(+) shortness of breath/DOE .
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD s/p MI [**2136**], s/p stent atrial fibrillation HTN hypercholesterolemia gout anxiety right wrist fusion [**2133**] GERD bilateral hearing loss .
Onc Hx: Metastatic Renal Cell 1.
Nephrectomy for clear cell carcinoma in 09/[**2140**].
Resection of a right seventh rib metastasis, which revealed metastatic high-grade renal cell carcinoma.
This was complicated by severe GI side effects and dehydration.
The dose was reduced and despite this reduction, he was admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] to a local hospital with rapid atrial fibrillation and  associated syncope which resulted in an accident while driving.
He sustained several rib fractures as a result.
Currently, cycle 8 of Sutent 2 weeks on/ 1 week off, plus Gemzar begun because of disease progression.
Family History: Mother, 89 h/o ovarian ca, Aunt w/ ovarian CA, father deceased 83 w/ CAD .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: crackles at left base anteriorly, no wheeze.
Pericardial drain with small amount of straw colored fluid Abd: soft, ND/NT, No abdominal bruits.
Ext: warm, trace ankle edema bilaterally.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Studies: EKG:  NSR HR 79, Nl axis and slight pr prolongation 208msec.
CXR:  Limited study with marked cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and bilateral pleural effusions, new since the [**8-13**] examination.
Significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
Pericardiocentesis revealed initial elevated pericardial pressure of 35mmHg subsequently decreasing to 13mmHg after drainage of 1.4 liters of serosanguinous pericardial fluid.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral thinning and hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%).
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECHO ([**8-28**]): Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis and inferior hypokinesis.
Overall LV systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
No valvular disease.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent around the right atrium.
Brief right atrial diastolic collapse but normal transmitral Doppler spectra.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-8-29**], the size of the effusion is slightly greater around the right atrium, but transmitral Doppler no longer suggests impaired filling.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 37025**] is a 58 year old male with renal cell ca with metastases to the lung, bone, liver and right adrenal who presented with 2 days of increasing shortness of breath.
In the ER, he was hypoxic and found to have pericardial tamponade.
Patient was known to have a pericardial effusion by CT on [**2145-8-9**] (2 weeks prior to admission.
Echo showed intermittent RV collapse suggestive of tamponade and a significant pericardial effusion.
On [**8-25**], Cardiology drained 1300cc of straw colored fluid, which was sent for cytology.
Drain output decreased and so the pericardial drain was removed on [**2145-8-26**].
Serial echocardiograms showed a gradual reaccumulation of pericardial fluid, but no acute signs of cardiac tamponade.
On the day of discharge, he was asymptomatic, denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness and was displaying normal vital signs.
Mechanical ventilation.
His repiratory failure was thought to be due to pulmonary edema from tamponade in addition to a questionable pnuemonia.
Patient had improvement of respiratory status after pericardiocentesis.
Patient has CXR consistent with pulmonary edema, likely secondary to decreased cardiac output from pericardial tamponade.
Patient had a fever to 101 on evening prior to admission and has possible infiltrate on CXR.
Atrial fibrillation.
Patient went into Atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**2145-8-26**] with a stable blood pressure.
He was started on a heparin drip on [**8-29**] because he reamined in atrial fibrillation for 48 hours.
This was treated with calcium gluconate, glucose and insulin, and kayexalate with resolution of hyperkalemia.
Acute Renal Failure.
ARF is likely due to decreased cardiac output as a result of tamponade.
Metastatic Renal Cell CA.
Lung metastases were treated with cyberknife.
Patient was anemic on admission, likely due to myelosuppressive therapy with gemzar.
Medications on Admission: CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Loperamide 2 mg po qid prn diarrhea Pantoprazole 40 mg  PO Q24H Lorazepam 1 mg  PO Q8H prn anxiety Clonazepam 2mg PO QHS Quetiapine 400 mg po qhs Zolpidem 5 mg PO HS prn Ezetimibe 10 mg PO daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: pericardial tamponade atrial fibrillation renal cell cancer pneumonia   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a build up of fluid around your heart which was treated with pericardial drainage.
You also had a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation which we are treating with aspirin and a new medication called Amiodarone.
Your Imdur was held while you were in the hospital due to low blood pressure.
We are also treating you for pneumonia.
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations or lightheadedness please seek immediate medical attention because this could be a sign of arrhythmia or of reaccumulation of fluid around your heart.
