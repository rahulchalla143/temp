Admission Date:  [**2121-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-3-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Protonix / Aggrenox  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 69f with metastatic renal cell ca, cva, and a recent admission for GIB who presents with one week of fatigue and pallor and was found to anemic at 26.6 (last hct from discharge [**1-16**] was 30).
She had a negative ng lavage, guaiac negative, egd negative, colonoscopy negative, capsule endoscopy negative; her fe studies showed a ferritin > [**2115**], and the thought was that this was related to anemia of chronic disease.
She felt better after her admission, with a "rosy" complexion; however, over the next few days she became increasingly pale and fatigued.
Past Medical History: Metastatic renal cell cancer (mets to parotids, lung, pancreas)- dx'ed in [**2111**], s/p R nephrectomy- [**2111**] h/o +PPD HTN TIA osteoporosis VRE--colonizer (rectal swab)  Social History: works as receptionist at [**Hospital **] Medical Society no tobacco, quit 40 years ago no alcohol   Family History: lung cancer- father  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.6         BP 124/50         HR 95         R 24         Sat 99% RA * PE: G: Elderly female, cachectic, NAD, nondyspneic     [**Hospital 4459**]: Clear OP, MMM, no thrush     Neck: Supple, No LAD, No JVD sitting upright in chair     Lungs: Distant BS BL.
The upper chest and thoracic inlet is excluded from the film.
There are patchy interstitial and alveolar opacities centered about both pulmonary hila.
No upper zone redistribution or effusion is identified.
The opacities most likely represent resolving changes due to pulmonary edema and are slightly decreased compared with [**2121-1-31**].
Density over left upper quadrant is consistent with calcification within the splenic artery.
Slight interval improvement in perihilar infiltrates thought to represent resolving pulmonary edema.
FINDINGS: Again seen are areas of T2 hyperintensity in the right posterior parietal and both occipital lobes.
Decreased signal centrally in the occipital lobe foci are consistent with necrosis.
Increased T1 signal in the rims of these areas is consistent with laminar necrosis.
Associated susceptibility within these foci are consistent with prior hemorrhage.
Diffusion sequences demonstrate thin rims of increased signal which may be related to susceptibility or T2 shine-through.
No other diffusion abnormalities are identified to suggest acute ischemia.
T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
TECHNIQUE: 3-D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
FINDINGS: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent without evidence of significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
Within the limits of this exam, no sign of an arteriovenous malformation is apparent.
Overall stable MRI appearance of the brain with redemonstration of posterior parietal and occipital lobe infarcts.
ABNORMALITY #2: Superimposed bursts of mixed frequency generalized delta and theta slowing were observed periodically.
No sharp features were associated with this slowing.
SLEEP: The patient remained drowsy throughout the entire recording with no stage II sleep observed.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of diffuse background slowing throughout the recording.
In addition, overlying bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing were seen.
No epileptiform features were observed with this slowing.
No electrographic seizures were recorded.
This EEG is most consistent with encephalopathy.
Common causes of encephalopathy include medications and metabolic disturbances.
Among the findings was an MRI that showed no focal findings, and an EEG that showed a toxic-metabolic picture.
She had a history of [**Doctor Last Name 4116**] syndrome ([**3-13**] bilateral occipital/parietal CVA felt to be likely in the setting of vertebro-basilar insufficiency), with an element of [**Doctor First Name 9893**] syndrome (anosgnosia of visual deficit) elicited by the neurologist, but otherwise had no new focal findings, and the encephalopathy was attributed to toxic/metabolic etiology, likely in the setting of hypercalcemia.
She was also found to be hyponatremic on admission; all of these factors, along with her malnutrition in the setting of malignancy, likely contributed to her presentation.
She was given IVFs aggressively, with resolution of the hypercalcemia and hyponatremia.
The patient's mental status improved, although she had a persistent poor PO intake.
She passed a speech and swallow study, but was noted to have had a poor appetite.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: On [**1-30**], the patient was noted to have coughed a bit after eating, cleared the food, but then developed acute respiratory distress that required intubation and transfer to the ICU.
The CXR showed findings c/w pulmonary edema, and the patient was felt by the ICU team to have developed flash pulmonary edema.
Her last Echo [**10-14**], showed a normal EF with some focal wall motion abnormalities.
Given her wall motion abnormalities, diastolic failure in the setting of ischemia was a distinct possibility, and the depending on the prognosis of the renal cell cancer, may warrant a stress test as an outpatient.
ANEMIA: The patient was noted on prior hospitalization to have had a negative workup for anemia including EGD/colonoscopy.
The anemia was attributed to chronic disease.
ELEVATED LFTs: Noted to have elevation, attributed to metastatic disease.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma Urinary tract infection Aspiration pneumonia Anemia of chronic disease Depression Oral candidiasis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Continue all medications as written.
