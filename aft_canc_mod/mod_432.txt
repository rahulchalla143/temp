Admission Date:  [**2171-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-10-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: as described in D/C summary  History of Present Illness: 89 y.o.
male with past medical history of prostate cancer (remoted), vascular dementia +/- coexistent Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, and gout who was brought in by ambulance from his nursing home today after being lethargic and found to be hypoxic.
Because of his dramatically reduced responsiveness the patient was brought in to the ED where initial vitals revealed an O2 sat of 86% on a nonrebreather.
SBP dropped into the 50's so the patient had a femoral CVL placed under emergent conditions and he was intubated after being started on norepinephrine.
ROS was unobtainable but per family patient had been touching his lower abdomen over the preceding days, which made them concerned for a UTI.
Past Medical History: -Vascular Dementia +/- vascular dementia -Cervical spondylosis -Gout -BPH s/p prostatectomy -?
Family History: His father died at age 84 of cancer of the throat related to cigar smoking and on an older brother had hearing problems.

Otherwise, no evidence of acute intracranial process.
Age-related involution and small vessel ischemic disease.
There is an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.
Subtle retrocardiac lucency may be due to a hiatal hernia.
Prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggests fluid overload.
An additional left base patchy opacity is also seen, which may be due to aspiration/pneumonia.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of right hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 89 year old male with severe dementia, hypothyroidism, and gout who presented with septic shock from multiple sources and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
It was decided that given his poor overall prognosis and worsening respiratory failure, he would be made CMO and terminally extubated.
The following is a brief problem based summary of his hospital course prior to expiration: 1) Septic shock: Presented with septic physiology: hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate and severe renal dysfunction.
Most likely etiologies were felt to be secondary to UTI given oliguria/ pyuria vs PNA given pulmonary infiltrate.
Additionally started on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics including vancomycin/ cefepime/ ciprofloxacin and flagyl which were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin given pan-sensitive enterococcus from urine culture and pansensitive proteus from blood.
Initially, the patient improved with decrease in lactate from 10.4 to 2.0, decreasing pressor requirement and defervescence.
On [**10-5**], patient developped recurrent shock physiology with fevers and hypotension that was attributed to VAP based on sputum cultures that grew MRSA, psudomonas and proteus.
2) Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated on arrival to ED for hypoxic respiratory distress due to acute bronchopneumonia in the setting of poor pulmonary reserve and poor functional status.
Patient had high minute ventilation throughout hospital course and respiratory pattern characterized by tachypnea with normal/ high tidal volumes.
He initially required little ventilatory response but with aggressive fluid resuscitation/ persistent septic shock he developped bilateral infiltrates from VAP with fluid overload vs ARDS.
Mechanical ventilation c/b development of a small right apical pneumothorax that was incidentally discovered on rountine CXR.
3) Anuric renal failure: Admitted with oliguria and ARF with creatinine of 5.8 from recent baseline of 1.8.
Renal ultrasound on admission had no evidence of worsened hydronephrosis or obstructive nephropathy.
Etiology of renal failure multifactorial from prerenal ischemia in the context of free water deficit/ dehydration and intrinsic renal injury from ATN secondary to sepsis.
Patient was aggressively rehydrated and treated for septic shock with gradual improvement in creatinine.
Of note, he did develop postoliguric diuresis with persistent electrolyte imbalances requiring aggressive repleteion  4) Hypernatremia: Present with Na of 162 in setting of severe dehydration/ poor PO intake from acute illness and underlying dementia.
5) Atrial fibrillation: During course of severe illness and pressor requirement developped atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Echo showed mild symmetric left ventrcular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic global systolic function and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Started on amiodarone via IV loading protocol for rate control given relative contraindication to AV nodal agents with hypotension  6) Troponin elevation: Likely simply demand in the context of hypotension and metabolic abnormalities.
