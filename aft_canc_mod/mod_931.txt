CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of Breath.
F with diastolic CHF (EF 55% on [**9-2**] echo), recent PE on [**2-/2181**], recent GI bleeding attributed to colon diverticuli seen on colonoscopy during recent [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization in [**2181-9-25**], transferred from OSH ([**Hospital1 **]) with respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema.
From [**10-11**] - [**2181-10-16**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for rectal bleed for 2 days.
Rectal exam with gross blood in rectal vault.
No other episodes of rectal bleeding in hospital.
Transfused 2 pRBCs and given vitamin K for colonoscopy.
The patient was admitted on [**2181-10-17**] to [**Hospital3 **] after episode of acute shortness of breath at [**Hospital1 1501**].
CXR showed pulmonary edema.
EKG initially in atrial fibrillation in ED and given cardizem x 1 with conversion to NSR.
Cardiology consulted and believed may be due to ischemia but hesitant to anticoagulate due to recent GI bleed.
Noted to have leukocytosis that has been trending up to 18,000 today.
Pt was cultured and placed on zosyn and vancomycin for broad coverage.
Noted to have a UTI also.
Past Medical History: - CAD - stress [**2170**] showed 1-1.
Exercise MIBI [**2175**]: nl study with EF 78% ; TTE [**11-1**]: hyperdynamic, EF 80% - LUL spiculated lung mass-likely bronchalveolar CA - recurrent R sided pleural effusion--likely due to dCHF, lower  suspicion for TB.
- Recent PE - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Hypothyroidism - GERD - Breast ca, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2177**], dx [**2162**], s/p XRT - urge incontinence - Osteoporosis - s/p CCY [**2175**] - s/p TAH, BSO age 40 - Macular degeneration  Social History: She lives in independent living at [**Location (un) 5481**].
No h/o colon cancer, GI bleed.
STUDIES: OSH EKG [**10-17**]: atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
Suggest CHF or volume overload.
CXR (my read): slightly congested pulm vasculature, R pleural effusion, no overt infiltrate.
EKG: NSR at 80 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no Q waves .
TTE [**2181-8-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild calcific mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-26**], pleural effusions are new.
CXR - PORTABLE CHEST, [**2181-10-21**] FINDINGS: Pulmonary vascularity appears engorged, but there is no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.
Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions are again demonstrated with adjacent areas of basilar atelectasis.
F with diastolic CHF (EF 55% on [**9-2**] echo), recent PE on [**2-/2181**], recent GI bleeding attributed to colon diverticuli seen on colonoscopy during recent [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization in [**Month (only) **] [**2181**], transferred from OSH ([**Hospital1 **]) with respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema.
# Acute Respiratory Failure/Flash Pulmonary Edema:  She required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of flash pulmonary edema.
Her lasix was restarted at a lower dose after the acute decompensation but will likely need uptitration of this medication.
# Acute Renal Failure: She had ARF likely in the setting of diuresis.
# CAD/diastolic heart failure:  She had no evidence of acute events and was continued on a beta blocker, aspirin, statin, beta blocker and aceI.
Her lasix was restarted at a lower dose after the acute decompensation in her respiratory status but she will likely need uptitration of this medication (was on lasix 80 mg po daily at home).
# Hyperlipidemia: resumed atorvastatin  # Hypothyroidism: held levothyroxine initially and then restarted.
# Urinary Incontinence: continued tolterodine  # CODE:  DNR/DNI --> no chest compression, no defibrillation, no ACLS medications.
