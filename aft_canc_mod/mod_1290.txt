Admission Date:  [**2126-5-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-10-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**] Chief Complaint: referred for evaluation of leukocytosis.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L PICC line placement pRBC transfusions Lumbar Puncture   History of Present Illness: 75yo man with h/o metastatic prostate ca, status post chemotherapy and XRT in [**2118**] and [**2119**], on Lupron, dementia, EtOH aubse, transferred from NH [**2126-5-17**] for evaluation of leukocytosis (WBC 18.9) and ARF (Creat 1.7).
Patient initially diagnosed with RML pneumonia and hyperanatremia for which he was being treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and 1/2NS hydration.
On morning of [**2126-5-19**] patient had generalized seizure involving tonic-clonic movements of right side.
Today patient again noted to have seizure like activity, tremoring in left arm and responsive only to pain.
Hospital course also complicated by onset of thrombocytopenia and 10-pt Hct drop on day one.
Hypernatremia and renal failure resolved with 1/2NS fluid hydration.
Antibiotic coverage expanded to include vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir as empiric treatment for meningitis.
Per records, NH had noted decreased po intake prior to hospitalization and complained of cough, no fevers or chills.
He was admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital [**12/2125**] for agitated behavior and started on Depakote at that time.
Past Medical History: -prostate ca adenoca s/p radical prostatectomy, neoadjuvant chemotx -shingles -Bilateral total hip replacement (Lx2, Rx1) -Lower back pain from T5/T7 fx -s/p head trauma in MVA in past   Social History: FHx: unknown .

[**5-19**]: CT HEAD: Left sphenoid sinus air cell mucosal thickening and air-fluid level consistent with acute-on-chronic sinusitis.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
A very small right parietal subdural fluid collection.
Alternatively, this could represent dural metastatic disease or benign intracranial hypotension.
Probable chronic infarcts, as noted above.
[**5-23**]: CT head: Tiny chronic right parietal subdural extra-axial fluid collection.
Heterogeneous opacity in the right lung base is worse, likely progressive pneumonia.
Additionally, worsening right perihilar opacity is likely pneumonia or possibly hilar lymphadenopathy.
New left lower lobe opacity is atelectasis or loculated fluid simulating atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusion are slightly increased.
There is no pneumothorax.
New mild, heterogeneous increased uptake of the upper thoracic spine and left posterior ribs, as well as greater tracer uptake of previously described left anterior iliac spine lesion.
Findings are compatible with progression of metastatic disease.
Band like increased uptake greater at T12 and new at T10 is most compatible with progression and development of osteoporotic compression fractures, respectively.
Focal increased uptake at right maxilla, more notable on today's exam; findings would be unusual for site of metastasis and may relate to sinus inflammatory disease.
Bilateral mastoiditis, left greater than right.
Three suspicious-appearing lesions in the right liver lobe, concerning for metastases.
[**5-31**] MRI C and T spine c gadolinium: 1)  No abnormal epidural fluid collections or soft tissue density in the cervical and thoracic spine.
2)  Compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body with retropulsed bone fragments extending into fixed narrowing the spinal canal without associated soft tissue component.
3)  Diffusely abnormal signal throughout the cervical and thoracic spine vertebral bodies that are consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
Approximately 3cm soft-tissue mass within suboccipital subcutaneous fat to the right of midline, clinical correlation suggested.
Gallstones with somewhat complex pericholecystic fluid, worrisome for acute cholecystitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
No definite intrahepatic ductal dilatation 3.
Redemonstration of target lesion in the right lobe of the liver, suspicious for metastasis as noted previousely.
Stable right mid lung pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
Well-circumscribed, oval nodule in the right mid lung.
Location is difficult to assess on a single-view chest radiograph, and this may represent an intra- or extra-pulmonary finding.
Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
Again these findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  76 yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer and dementia admitted with leukocytosis, ARF, RML pneumonia, and hypernatremia, transferred to MICU with ?seizure, unresponsiveness and thrombocytopenia.
1)  Seizure/mental status:  The patient does not have history of seizure disorder.
Depakote was previously started in setting of agitated behavior.
Head CT showed sphenoid sinusitis.
MR showed a small chronic subdural fluid collection.
The etiology of the seizure activity remained unclear, but may have occurred in the setting of fever due to infection as he was febrile at the time of transfer with evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
He had no further seizure activity.
His remained responsive only to pain for many days, and this was felt to be due to drug toxicity given high dose of Dilantin and Ativan administered to break his seizure.
He never regained his prior mental status, and at the time of transfer to the floor he was arousable to voice but not following commands.
While on the floor he had no further episodes of seizures, was followed by neurology who recommended eventual breidge over to keppra given pt's elevated LFTS [**1-10**] acute cholecystitis.
2)  PNA:  On transfer pt c fever, leukocytosis which was thought to be due to infection, found to have bilateral pneumonia that was treated with vancomycin, azitrhomycin, and ceftriaxone.
Both fever and leukocytosis improved by day three of MICU course.
However, on transfer to the floor, pt again began to have worsened leukocytosis, remained afebrile, had worsening R lower lung consolidation.
loculated R pleural effusion, interventional pulmonary consulted who did ultrasound, determined effusion to mostly be subdiagphragmatic, ?
loculated, and that risks outweighted benefits of thoracocentesis in pt with thrombocytopenia, small pleural effusion, and acutely ill. Placed on Vancomycin and Meropenem for treatment of PNA.
Towards the end of hospital course, pt became increasingly wheezy on exam, placed on albuterol/atrovent nebs.
3)  Anemia / Thrombocytopenia:  DDx initially included HIT, TTP, DIC.
Anemia labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
There was no evidence of acute hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia was attributed to chronic DIC vs undiagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome or prostate cancer infiltrating bone marrow per hematology.
4) Metastatic Prostate cancer: Repeat bone scan showed increasing metastatic disease.
RUQ u/s significant for multiple liver lesions suspicious for malginancy.
Had hypercalemia during hospital course, likely secondary to bone mets, given Pamidronate 90 mg IV.
5) Elevated LFTs: During last week of hospital course, it was noted that pt's LFTs trended upwards.
RUQ u/s significant for acute cholecystitis, could not r/o acute cholangitis.
He never had fevers, unclear if AMS at this point [**1-10**] to acute cholangitis or some other infectious/metabolic insult.
It was also thought that masses seen in liver coudl possibly be abscesses; however pt never stable enough to go down to radiology for further imaging.
Became severely jaundiced during last few days of hospital course, LFTs indicative of obstructive jaundice.
6) Total body anasarca: Pt with low albumin, low Hct leading to decreased oncotic pressure and was likely 3rd spacing.
Given mulitple pRBC transfusions c lasix c slight improvement.
Placed on TPN for nutrional needs.
7)  ARF: On admission, thought to be prerenal initially in setting of decreased po intake but FENA on admission was >1%, raising concern for intrarenal process, ATN vs TTP vs AIN.
Fe urea < 35%, indicative of prerenal causes, likely secondary to intravasuclar depletion from third spacing.
He was bolused c NS without much improvement in urine output.
8) Labile BPs / Pain: Pain likely a component of pt's elevated BPs; however remains unclear what was exactly causing htn.
9) Hypernatremia: Pt c hypernatremia during hospital course.
10) Hypercalcemia: Pt c hypercalcemia during hospital course, likely secondary to metastatic bone disease.
11) Mastoiditis/sphenoid sinusitis: Placed on Flagyl X 3 days for treatment of mastoiditis/sphenoid sinusitis.
12) T12 compression fracture - with retropulsed bone fragments extending to and narrowing the spinal canal.
Neurology and neurosurgery were called, stated that lesion was stable, and given pt's lack of mobility and risks > benefits of operating, no need for further intervention.
Hypernatremia and hypercalcemia treated appropriately.
NGT was d/c'd upon diagnosis of mastoiditis as per ENT, PEG placement discussed c GI and nutrition, risks determined to outweight benefits of PEG in pt due to active infection, thrombocytopenia.
Togehter, Dr. [**Name (NI) 10777**] (pt's oncologist who knows pt well from before) Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2504**], and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 9305**] felt it most humane and appropriate to forego aggressive and invasive efforts at resuscitation, given the irreverisble nature and poor prognosis of the underlying metastatic CA and DIC, but that reversible causes would remain aggressively treated.
