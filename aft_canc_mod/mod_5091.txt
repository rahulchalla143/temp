Excisional biopsy in [**2184-10-27**] revealed a greater than 11 mm thick, ulcerated melanoma with perineural invasion and mitotic rate of 8 per meters squared.
He was referred to Cutaneous [**Hospital **] Clinic, at which point 2 subcutaneous nodules along the right groin scar were noted and a left posterior shoulder subcutaneous nodule was noted.
Fine needle aspiration confirmed a melanoma at the site.
PET CT revealed widespread metastases in the lung, liver, subcutaneous tissues and bone.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  BPH, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2178**], left knee arthroscopic surgery complicated by left DVT, hypertension, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis of the right knee, melanoma as above, benign positional vertigo, history of pseudogout, history of C-7 narrowing with occasional nerve pain.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male in no acute distress.
Moist oral mucosa without lesions, multiple scalp nodules present.
LYMPH NODES: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
ABDOMEN:  Rounded, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no HSM or masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema.
SKIN: Right groin biopsy site healed without nodularity.
There are subcutaneous nodules above and below the biopsy site as well as scattered scalp nodules.
There is a left shoulder subcutaneous nodule measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm and a left low axillary chest wall subcutaneously nodule measuring approximately 1 cm.
x14 potential doses.
During this week, he received 10 of 14 doses, with 1 dose held for questionable neurotoxicity and 3 doses held due to development of tachypnea, stridor and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation.
He was not having significant hypoxia at this time.
He then became hypotensive, requiring initiation of phenylephrine and Levophed.
He developed Clostridium difficile diarrhea, improved on Flagyl.
Other side effects during IL-2 therapy included mild chills; development of an erythematous skin rash; nausea, improved with lorazepam; diarrhea, improved with Lomotil, and fatigue  During this week, he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 7.3, improved to 1.3 at the time of discharge.
He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 7.1, improved to 1.1 upon discharge.
He also developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 100 and peak AST of 117, improved to within normal limits at the time of discharge.
He was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count low of 55,000, without evidence of bleeding.
As noted above, he developed metabolic acidosis, felt to be at least partially responsible for his respiratory failure, with a minimum bicarbonate of 14, improved with bicarbonate repletion.
He had no evidence of coagulopathy or myocarditis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic melanoma, status post cycle 1, week 1 high-dose IL-2 complicated by respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
