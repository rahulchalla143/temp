INDICATION: Elevated white blood cell count.
Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe is unchanged allowing for differences in patient positioning, but has improved compared to an older study of [**2174-4-5**].
Additional multifocal areas of consolidation in the left upper and both lower lobes show interval improvement compared to the recent radiograph with residual opacity most prominent in the left lower lobe.
Small left pleural effusion has also slightly improved.

No aspiration or penetration was seen.
Delayed emptying of valleculae and piriform sinuses was seen most likely secondary to patient's weakness.
Please look at the speech pathologist's report in CCC for complete assessment and recommendation.
No aspiration or perforation is seen.
Slight retention of barium within the valleculae and piriform sinuses most likely secondary to patient's weakness.
No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Suboptimal image quality.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions: PRE CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, though can not completely rule out a small PFO.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is partial posterior mitral leaflet [**Name13 (STitle) **].
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
RV systolic function is somewhat improved - now mildly globally hypokinetic.
There is a bioprosthesis in the mitral position.
There is trace valvular MR.
A PA catheter was placed and a balloon pump was inserted for afterload reduction.
of endocarditis given that he had a back abscess drainded in [**Month (only) 404**].
TEE on [**3-25**] showed no vegetation or abscess.
He was seen by neurology for unresponsiveness, and was thought to have toxic-metabolic encephalopathy along with slow recovery from sedation.
He was followed by cardiology for atrial fibrillation, and remained on IV amiodarone, and was started on heparin and coumadin.
On [**4-6**] he complained of LLQ pain, CT scan showed retroperitoneal bleed.
He was again seen by vascular for decreased perfusion to his right foot.
His white count continued to rise, and he complained of RUQ pain, and had evidence of acute cholecystitis on ultrasound.
