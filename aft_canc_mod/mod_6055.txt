She was given [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol once in [**2117**], and was changed to [**Doctor Last Name **]-cytoxan for low counts in 01/[**2118**].
She tne received six cycles of cisplatin started in [**1-/2125**] and administered in the hospital because of the questionable history of allergic reaction to carboplatin.
- Since that admission, she showed signs of fluid retention, both in her legs and in her ascites but she did not have any evidence of congestive heart failure based on exam with normal lungs and flat JVD.
There was concern that perhaps her cancer was progressing and that is the reason for her tense ascites, but consideration was also given to worsening renal failure as explanation for increased ascites.
CT scan taken [**2125-9-21**] showed increased ascites, but otherwise stable exam with mesenteric masses and evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis that appear unchanged when compared to [**2125-7-25**].
- Her husband reported some recent confusion during their clinic visit on [**9-26**].
Due to her decreased creatinine clearance, a reduced dose of 500 mg per meters squared was chosen.
She was started on this dose on [**10-3**] and acutely tolerated it well.
On Sunday, her weakness progressed to the point that she could no longer stand.
- On ROS, the patient notes moderate to severe abdominal pain for the past several days, especially before meals and sometimes resolved with food.
She reported the above symptoms and was told to come to clinic.
ON TRANSFER BACK TO OMED FROM ICU:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 1661**] is a 70 y/o F with recurrent ovarian CA, s/p CABG, s/p MV repair, and hypothyroid, presented from onc clinic on [**2125-10-8**] with weakness, nausea, and decreased PO intake since gemcitabine tx on [**2125-10-3**] and on clinic visit [**10-8**] was found to be hyptotensive, decrease hct (from 33.0 to 17.1), and INR>60.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1661**] denied diarrhea, hematuria but did report very slight BRBPR on toilet paper.
She was trace guiac positive on admission.
She had diffuse ecchymosis over lower extremities, back, and buttocks.
On [**10-17**] she received 1 mg IV vitamin K. Her initial mixing studies were negative for inhibitors.
Shortly after receiving the 6 units of blood, patient became SOB secondary to fluid overloaded state.
She was diuresed and responded well to lasix; however, creatinine began rising (above baseline of ~2.6) likely because of hypovolumia and decrease blood flow to kidneys.
Patient was subsequently gently hydrated, with impoved renal status.
Nutrition is still an issue for patient, as she has decrease appetite.
Past Medical History: 1.Relapsing papillary serous ovarian CA as above--hx onc therapy: She was diagnosed in [**2117**].
She is status post carboplatin and Taxol times one in [**2117**], changed to [**Doctor Last Name **]- Cytoxan because of low counts in 01/[**2118**].
Status post oral etoposide times one, discontinued because of mouth sores in 11/[**2123**].
Status post carboplatin times two, discontinued because of an allergic reaction that occurred in 12/[**2123**].
Status post cisplatin times three from [**1-/2124**] to [**4-/2124**], discontinued because of rising creatinine.
Status post weekly Taxol but discontinued because of disease progression.
Started on cisplatin 50 mg/m2 in [**9-/2124**] status post two cycles at that time, discontinued because of rising creatinine.
Status post two cycles with Navelbine, discontinued because of disease progression.
Status post seven cycles of cisplatin started in [**1-/2125**] and administered in the hospital because of the questionable history  of allergic reaction to this medication given the fact that she had an allergic reaction to carboplatin in the past.
