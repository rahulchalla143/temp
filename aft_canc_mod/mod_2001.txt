Respiratory Distress On admission to the ICU, he met sepsis/sirs criteria with most likely sources of infection being pulmonary.
Other possible source given RUQ pain on exam would be hepato-biliary.
There was no diarrhea to suggest fecal source.
UA was without evidence of infection.
He did have joint pain but no physical evidence to suggest septic joint.
RUQ ultrasound to evaluate liver/gallbladder showed no acute processes.
His elevated LFTs were deemed to be most likely from new liver mets seen on CTA of chest.
The respiratory distress was likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (see hemoptyis section below).
However, after transfer to the floor, his respiratory status worsened, and given the worsening DIC it was likely that diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may have redeveloped.
Goals of care were changed to DNR/DNI with no escalation of care for ICU transfer or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy His DIC was most likely secondary to his metastatic esophageal cancer; it has improved/resolved with chemo in the past.
Hemoptysis His hemoptysis was most likely [**1-15**] alveolar hemorrhage from DIC given appearance on chest CT. Repeat cxr did not show progressive hemorrhage, but patient continued to have episodes of hemmoptysis.
Shoulder Pain His shoulder pain was concerning for potential bleeding into joint, metastasis, or septic joint.
However, there was no evidence of septic joint.
Xray of the shoulder showed degenerative changes with no fractures.
Metastatic Esophageal Adenocarcinoma with Bone Marrow Involvement For his metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma, he received cycle 6 of oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
On the night of [**8-25**], he became less responsive, likely secondary to hypoxia and/or hypercarbia from respiratory failure.
Goals of care were discussed with family and they did not want escalation of care (no ICU transfer, no non-invasive positive pressure ventilation).
