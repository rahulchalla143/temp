Bilateral chest tubes  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 80 year old Russsian speaking man with coronary artery disease, decreased LV function without prior symptoms of congestive heart failure, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation (on coumadin) status post pacemaker and a recent diagnosis of malignant ascites (non small cell CA vs. adenocarcinoma), primary unknown who presents with  hypoxia at 88% on RA.
Per the patient and his daughter, the patient began having increased dyspnea over the past two to three days which was associated with a mild increase in pedal edema and a large increase in his abdominal ascites.
He had mild abdominal pain, decreased appetite, mild nausea without emesis.
He denies any recent travel, and has been relatively immobile.
Past Medical History: HTN GERD BPH s/p thymectomoy with partial sternotomy in '[**59**] (for mediastinal mass seen incidentally on CT) CAD (last cath here in '[**47**], showed minor branch coronary artery disease in the OM2, sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] CHF (last TTE here in '[**51**], EF 30-35%, mild-severe MR, mild-mod TR) Afib (on coumadin) h/o pulmonary nodules s/p pacemaker placement [**2149**] s/p R cataract surgery   Social History: Lives in "community center".
No scleral icterus noted, conjunctiva pink.
Slightly elevated JVD Chest: Decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally, R>L.
Dullness to percussion at both bases bilaterally.
CV: RRR nl S1, S2, no m/r/g.
No hepatosplenomegaly noted.
No tenderness upon palpation.
Mild 1+ edema at the feet bilatearally.
A spot was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff.
[**11-15**] CXR: Interval redevelopment of moderately large left-sided pleural effusion.
Increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis, effusion, or consolidation.
The patient was assessed by interventional pulmonology and thoracic surgery and the decision was made to defer thoracentesis and proceed with a VATS.
The patient had a left sided VATS with biopsy and pleurodesis on [**11-20**].
He tolerated the procedure well but required several boluses of fluid rafter the procedure for low UOP and BP.
He also spiked a fever to 101.5 and had low oxygen sats with increasing oxygen requirement.
Overnight he was triggered for hypotension with a BP of 102/60 (down from 120s-160s in the PACU) and had an episode of desaturation to 85% on FiO2 50% FM + 4L NC in addition to tachypnia.
The patient's O2 requirement continued to increase until he required a NRB.
Talc pneumonitis versus pulmonary edema (as seen on CXR and with effusions visualized on U/S).
In the MICU the patient had a right chest tube and R subclavian line placed.
An [**11-21**] echo was positive for right atrium and ventricle dilitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation suggestive of possible PE.
Small subsegmental pulmonary artery embolism in the left lingula.
Right middle lobe consolidation may reflect pulmonary infarction, or consolidation.
Troponins were found to be elevated to 0.17 and thought to be secondary to increased heart strain.
ARF:   The patient had an episode of ARF with creatinine elevated to 2.1 from baseline of 1.2.
This was thought to be secondary to third spacing and poor po intake of fluids resulting in decreased intravascular volume.
Anemia: Patient iron labs sent, determined to have low iron and low TIBC consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
