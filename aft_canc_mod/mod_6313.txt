She has had a progressive decline in cognition and general health beginning in [**7-12**], at which point she had recurrent ITP.
She was thought to perhaps have URIs but eventually went to her PCP who found that her LFTs were elevated.
Imaging revealed multiple small nodules in her liver worrisome for metastatic malignancy.
However, CT guided biopsy in [**2-11**] was w/o evidence of malignancy.
Then in [**3-13**], she began to notice a decline in her cognitive function.
She found that she was having difficulty "connecting" with people and completeing tasks.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] felt at that time that her exam and history were most consistent with PML.

There are bihemispheric confluent areas of increased signal within the centrum semiovale extending into the white matter of the cortical gyri without involvement of the cortex.
There is a solitary 9-mm round oval area of increased signal within the right deep cerebellar white matter with feathery edges and no mass effect.
There is no  enhancement and only mild atrophy.
There is no significant evidence of leukomalacia at this time.
Diffusion weighted studies appear normal with no evidence of hemorrhage.
MRI scan of the spine [**2108-4-15**] shows no intramedullary signal changes.
There are degenerative changes at C5-C6 with some impingement of the thecal sac on the left side.
There is mention of submandibular and subclavicular lymph node enlargement on this study.
Mild-to-moderate hyperintense signal in the subcortical and periventricular white matter could be due to small vessel disease and/or associated therapy-related changes.
Mild brain atrophy.
No evidence of abnormal brain parenchymal enhancement or acute infarcts.
Mild diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement is a nonspecific finding and could be related to previous lumbar punctures.
CT torso [**2108-6-2**] INDICATION: History of cognitive decline, history of liver nodules concerning for metastatic disease on outside hospital imaging.
FINDINGS: There are multiple innumerable hypoechoic nodules.
Overall, there is enhancement of these nodules that appear to be more conspicuous on the portal venous phase.
No evidence of intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
There are multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes, all of which measure subcentimeter except for three portal lymph nodes measuring 1 cm in short axis.
There has been previous splenectomy with surgical clips seen in the left upper quadrant.
The bilateral kidneys appear unremarkable with no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
No evidence of free fluid or free air in the abdomen.
No evidence of abnormality.
There is an 8 mm pericardial lymph node.
There is basal atelectasis within the bilateral lower lobes.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions.
No evidence of suspicious bony lesions.

Innumerable hepatic nodules with an appearance mostly in keeping with multiple metastases with the largest in segment VI measuring 5 mm.
Multiple subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes with 1 periportal lymph node measuring 1 cm.
No evidence of gastric, colonic, or pancreatic visible tumors.
----------------- [**2108-6-3**] MR of thoracic and cervical spine MRI SCAN OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE  CONCLUSION:  Relatively minor changes of cervical spondylosis, and a small T2-3 disc protrusion.
Moderate-size pleural effusions.
Heterogeneous marrow signal pattern.
ADDENDUM: [**Last Name (un) **] was performed: this revealed an increased number of EBV incorporated large cells.
This raises the possibility of left basilar opacification consistent with atelectasis or, in view of the clinical history, possibly aspiration.
ultra sound liver biopsy [**2108-6-5**] TARGETED ULTRASOUND-GUIDED LIVER BIOPSY: A limited ultrasound examination of the liver was performed, demonstrating numerous lobulated hypoechoic masses within the liver, consistent with lymphoma.
A lobulated lesion in the left lobe measuring 3.7 cm was deemed most amenable to biopsy.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided targeted liver biopsy of one lesion in the left lobe as described.
CT chest [**2108-6-5**] INDICATION: Mental status change and liver nodules.
CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: When compared to the prior CT abdomen of [**2108-6-2**], small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have increased in size.
There is no evidence of aspiration or focal parenchymal consolidation.
Microscopic apical subpleural nodules are too small to characterize.
There is right apical scarring.
Subtle nodular thickening of the right major fissure and right lower lobe intersitium could suggest lymphangitic tumor spread.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
There is a 6-mm pericardial lymph node.
The airways are patent to the level of the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally, although there is generalized bronchial wall abnormality.
While not tailored for infradiaphragmatic evaluation, multiple liver hypodensities concerning for metastases are best characterized on the recent CT abdomen scan.
A 16 x 14 mm lytic lesion within the right humeral head disrupts the cortex.
LP [**2108-6-6**] Cerebrospinal fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Shoulder xray [**2108-6-6**] HISTORY: Lytic humeral lesion seen on CT showing liver disease.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific lytic lesion humeral head is consistent with metastasis.
Bone Scan [**2108-6-7**] IMPRESSION: No definite osseous metastases.
Symmetrically increased tracer uptake in both shoulders is likely degenerative.
No definite photopenia in the right humeral head to correspond to the patient's known lytic lesion.
OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY  Prior to the initiation of the study, the patient had an episode of seizure beginning with tonic stiffening of the upper extremities and slight rightward deviation of the head for approximately 30 seconds followed by generalized clonic activity of both upper and lower extremities, which lasted approximately 1-1/2 minutes.
The patient was kept in an upright position to minimize aspiration risk and 2 mg of IV Ativan were administered just after termination of the clonic activity.
IMPRESSION:  Unsuccessful swallow study due to seizure.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-9**], there is increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with aspiration involving the right middle lobe.
There is also some increased opacification in the left perihilar region and possibly at the left base.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-9**], there is increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with aspiration involving the right middle lobe.
There is also some increased opacification in the left perihilar region and possibly at the left base.
CXR [**2108-6-13**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which is appropriately positioned.
Right perihilar and right upper lobe opacities are resolving.
There remains left retrocardiac atelectasis and a small left-sided pleural effusion.
No interval change in degree of mild diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, which is a non-specific finding and may be related to previous lumbar punctures, this appearance is not typical of lymphoma or PML.
Mild-to-moderate hyperintense signal in the subcortical and periventricular white matter is non-specific and could be due to small vessel ischemia and/or post-treatment changes.
No microglial nodules are observed.
No viral inclusions are detected.
IMPRESSION: Minimal, likely hemorrhage within right frontal cortex and pneumocephalus in the right frontal lobe, consistent with post- surgical change.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
[**2108-6-21**] cxr FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-20**], there is again a diffuse infiltrate of pulmonary process presenting as marked prominence of the interstitial markings.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.
Increased, almost complete left lower lobe atelectasis with mucus filling multiple segmental and subsegmental bronchi without visible focal lesion.
Scattered non-enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes except for one 11 mm precarinal lymph node.
Left small pleural effusion improved.
No residual right pleural effusion.
Multiple liver hypodensities worrisome for metastases from lymphoma or other primary should be compared with same technique of prior abdominal CT. 6.
Stable lytic lesion of the right humeral head disrupting the cortex.
Unchanged biapical scarring and right lateral meningoceles or dural diverticula.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Low normal global left ventricular systolic function.
Technically limited to exclude regional wall motion abnormality.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
The mitral regurgitation appears less prominent [**2108-6-29**] MR head with and without contrast IMPRESSION:  1.
Subacute hematoma in the right frontal lobe at the biopsy site, with moderate surrounding edema.
Superimposed infection within the hematoma cannot be excluded by imaging if the patient has infectious symptoms.
Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, unchanged compared to the preoperative study of [**2108-6-15**], which is of uncertain etiology but unlikely to be related to lymphoma.
Persistent fluid in the sphenoid sinus.
Opacification of the right lateral mastoid air cells.
Rim-enhancing area in the right frontal cortex in the site of previous biopsy.
Essentially unchanged appearance of the abnormality in the right frontal cortex.
Unchanged mild pachymeningeal enhancement.
New area of susceptibility in the left globe causing adjacent artifact.
This may be secondary to metal overlying the left eye, and clinical correlation is recommended.
[**2108-7-5**] EEG FINDINGS: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the persistently slow background and due to the mixed frequency slowing in the left temporal region.
The first abnormality signifies a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
The focal slowing indicates a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere, but the tracing cannot specify the etiology.
There were no epileptiform features.
Unchanged appearance of innumerable hepatic nodules in keeping with multiple metastases, grossly unchanged.
Marked increase in left pleural effusion and slight increase in the right pleural effusion.
Increased number of peribronchial ground-glass and consolidative opacities suggests more prominent multifocal airspace disease.
No evidence of pathologically enlarged nodes.

Opacification of the base of the left lung could represent either pneumonia or residual atelectasis.
An intervening chest CT, on [**7-5**], when there was more left lower lobe consolidation was equivocal in this regard.
Peribronchial opacification in the right mid lung is another candidate for pneumonia, unchanged since [**7-3**], and alternatively could be residual edema improved since [**7-1**].
There is no right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.

She has a past history of Hodgkin's' lymphoma in [**2092**] now with recurrence and was admitted for diagnostic work-up of cognitive decline.
She initially has seen by the neurology service and there was concern for PML or other brain pathology.
During her admission she developed dysphagia and problems speaking.
She has a swallow study with a seizure.
She developed orthostatic hypotension with syncope.
She had ICU stays on [**8-7**] for hypoxia and syncope and [**Date range (1) 5489**] for aspiration PNA.
# Hodgkin's lymphoma - on [**6-2**] she had a abdominal CT that showed innumerable liver nodules.
It was thought her mental decline was due to a paraneoplastic syndrome, since other causes were ruled out.
Her dysphagia was also likely to neuropathy secondary to her disease.
# Seizure - Just prior to a video swallowing exam on [**2108-6-11**], the patient was observed to have a tonic clonic seizure lasting approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.
She had post-ictal confusion, no fecal or urinary incontinence, and her vital signs were stable during and after her seizure.
She had an EEG on [**7-5**] that only showed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy consistent with her paraneoplastic syndrome.
# Aspiration pneumonia - The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated transient hypoxemia that was believed to be aspiration PNA she was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl initially.
She went to the ICU in setting of hypoxia from 714/-[**6-20**] after her brain bx.
Aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema were the leading diagnoses.
Then again after chemo on [**6-30**] that pt had orthostatic hypotension with syncope and temporary hypoxia believed to be a mucus plug.
Then after her last CT scan on [**7-5**] showed bilateral increased pleural effusions (worse on left) and bilaterally lower lobe consolidations she was switched to vancomycin and aztreonam.
She is on day 9 of both, she will need treatment for 6 more days, or until her cell counts recover.
She has had no resp sx since her last ICU stay.
# Cognitive decline: After full neurology work up including brain bx, her mental decline was likely secondary to paraneoplastic syndrome from her Hodgkin's causing encephalopathy.
Pt has had evidence of memory difficulties and hallucinations on multiple exams here at [**Hospital1 **].
The brain biopsy was on [**6-16**] and was inconsistent with lymphoma or PML.
While in the ICU, head imaging showed edema around her biopsy site that was concerning for infection, but MRI was not consistent with this.
Neuro felt that the amount of edema was consistent with post-biopsy.
Her mental status slowly improved after her chemotherapy which reenforced the diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
# Dysphagia: Daughter gives history of difficulty swallowing liquids and solids.
She has since had multiple episodes of orthostatic hypotension, always responsive to fluids.
These episodes have decreased since starting on fludrocortisone.
Sinus tachy on EKG.
Tachycardia may also be worsening her diastolic dysfunction leading to increased pulmonary congestion.
Her home Lopressor was held due to orthostatic hypotension.
# Anemia: Low MCV anemia, suggesting either chronic blood loss or iron deficiency.
Of note, patient must get irradiated blood due to previous stem cell transplant.
# h/o ITP: Has been on a long taper of home prednisone.
Steroid therapy was discontinued per oncology recommendations at the beginning of her hospital stay and her platelets progressively fell to below 100,000.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea for 7 days.
