She explains having fairly acute onset of her dyspnea while lying in bed at rest last night and shortness of breath has been constant over the past 24 hours.

CT head showed no intraparenchymal hemorrhages and revealed stable post-operative changes in posterior fossa.
Neurosurgery was consulted regarding her ability to safely start heparin gtt given her metastatic brain lesions and felt it was safe to start with plan for no bolus dose, PTT goal 40-60 and repeat head CT once she was in this PTT range.
In ED, bedside TTE done and showed no overt effusions, no RV strain or collapse.
Appeared to be in no acute distress.
Past Medical History: Parkinsons Disease -Stage IIIa (T1N2MO) right-sided lung CA s/p chemoradiation (CT-guided biopsy  [**2125-1-8**] at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital revealed adenocarcinoma.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yo female with history of Parkinson's disease, metastatic lung cancer (undergoing brain XRT), and h/o pulmonary embolisms who presents now with hypotension, and new saddle PE in setting of being off of her usual Coumadin for several weeks.
She was transferred to the floor on [**7-13**] and then transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-15**] for acute hypotension, found to have GNR bactermia secondary to UTI; then tx back to floor and did well.

She had been on home Coumadin which was discontinued mid-[**Month (only) **] for neurosurgery and never restarted until she began her home Coumadin dosing 2 days prior to admission with no bridging.
INR on admission was 1.2 range and CTA confirms large saddle embolus.
Management options for any thrombolysis contraindicated as patient with intracranial brain metastasis.
#Sepsis due to E coli bacteremia: She was re-admitted to the ICU on [**7-17**] for hypotension and was placed on pressor support and empiric antibiotics.
