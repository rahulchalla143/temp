Admission Date:  [**2120-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-11-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Glucocorticoids,Systemic Classifier  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Posterior Fossa Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 82489**] is known to have metastatic melanoma.
Her melanoma history starts with some ulcerating lesions in the posterior shoulder about [**Doctor Last Name **] years ago.
She was eventually seen when it has got such a big size and there was ulceration and exudation when an MRI showed a 9.7 x 7.1 x 7.9 cm mass in that shoulder, which was lobulated.
A CT scan on [**3-29**], [**2119**], showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
She had a staging brain MRI in [**2120-4-19**], which showed no metastatic lesion.
She had a short course of high-dose IL-2, which was completed in [**2120-6-19**].
Her neurological and neuro-oncological history starts when she was noticed to have a 3-week history of some dizziness and decreased coordination in her left hand.
She went to the [**State 1727**] emergency room and had a head CT, which showed a posterior fossa mass.
This showed a central 1.7 cm mass deep in the left cerebellum along with dentate nucleus, which contributed to her symptoms.
She was commenced on Decadron, which improved her symptoms and she was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the Neurosurgery for consideration for radical resection.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] thought this is a deep seated and resection of which might moisten her coordination and left upper limb symptoms and the patient was not keen to have surgery.
She does not have any other higher function, cranial nerve, sensory, motor, or neurological dysfunction.
Family History: Her father has had some nonmelanoma skin cancers.
Her one paternal uncle who died of metastatic melanoma.
She has two sisters who have nonmelanoma skin cancers as well.
No other history of cancers in the family.
PERRL, she has no pronator drift, or alternate cerebellar findings.
As on the outside hospital study, there is a left cerebellar lesion measuring 1.5 x 1.4 cm with surrounding vasogenic edema causing slight mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or obstructive hydrocephalus.
No additional lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: Left cerebellar lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema, concerning for metastasis.
MRI Head [**8-22**]: FINDINGS: As seen on the preceding CT scan, there is a mass centered within the anterior medial aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere, demonstrating predominant T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity.
There is extensive adjacent edema involving the dentate nucleus and more superior cerebellar hemisphere, as well as extending into the brachium pontis.
There is heterogeneous enhancement.
No associated leptomeningeal enhancement is identified and no additional lesions are seen.
There are otherwise scattered T2 hyperintensities within the subcortical and deep white matter in a pattern suggestive of small vessel disease.
IMPRESSION: Solitary heterogeneously enhancing mass within the left cerebellar hemisphere with mild mass effect.
Primary differential considerations would include metastatic disease or lymphoma, primary tumors such as hemangioblastoma and abscess.
The restricted diffusion without significant susceptibility artifact suggests a highly cellular tumor as seen in lymphoma.
WE favor metastasis or lymphoma.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
