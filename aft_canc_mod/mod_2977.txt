Admission Date:  [**2127-11-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-12-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2100-5-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a 27 year old female with a past medical history of neurofibromatosis type #1, hypertension and depression, who was found by a neighbor lethargic and vomiting on [**2127-11-24**] in her apartment.
While her labs indicative of liver function continued to improve, her laboratory values also showed worsening renal function with creatinine on the day of transfer to the Regular Medicine Floor of 3.2.
The patient reports being under a lot of stress the last two weeks but denies any inciting event for her suicide attempt.
Reportedly there was also drug paraphernalia found in her apartment after her suicide attempt.
On transfer to the General Medicine Floor, the patient reported abdominal discomfort.
She denied any fever or chills.
General appearance:  Well developed, well nourished, comfortable, in no acute distress.
Sclerae and conjunctivae anicteric.
No palatal or sublingual jaundice.
Neck:  No masses or lymphadenopathy.
There was a right internal jugular central venous catheter in place without erythema or discharge.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally; no rhonchi, rales or wheezes.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, mildly distended.
Some tenderness over the epigastrium.
There is no rebound or guarding.
No splenomegaly.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
HYPERTENSION / DEPRESSION, STATUS POST SUICIDE ATTEMPT WITH INGESTION OF TYLENOL P.M. TABLETS:  Her liver function tests were improving but renal function continued to decline.
They recommended continuing Mucomyst past the 17 dose protocol until there was no evidence of end organ function.
As the patient was currently experiencing evidence of acute renal failure secondary to Tylenol induced acute tubular necrosis, Mucomyst was continued at a dose of 4200 mg intravenously q. four hours.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE SECONDARY TO ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS: Again, the patient was seen by the Toxicology Service in consultation.
They recommended continuing Mucomyst until there is no evidence of end organ damage.
Initially, there was felt to be no need for acute hemodialysis; however, the patient's serum creatinine continued to climb to a peak value of 9.2.
At that time, she was also experiencing acidosis in the form of a bicarbonate level of 13 to 14 even with intravenous bicarbonate replacement.
She was also experiencing electrolyte abnormalities in the form of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia.
She was also exhibiting signs of fluid overload.
She needs to have her serum chemistries checked at least every two days and the Renal Team will make the decision for hemodialysis based on her laboratory values.
Renal ultrasounds were performed which showed no evidence of an obstructive component to her renal failure.
NAUSEA AND EMESIS:  The patient had persistent nausea and multiple episodes of emesis daily of non-bloody, non-bilious material.
Originally, this was felt to be likely secondary to her uremia; therefore, it should have improved after initiation of her dialysis sessions, however, it was not improving.
There was no evidence of any impressive elevations of these enzymes.
She was managed initially conservatively with symptomatic relief with Zofran, Phenergan and Compazine with intravenous fluid hydration; however, she remained unable to tolerate any oral intake.
This prompted initiation of total parenteral nutrition.
The patient continued to have intermittent and persistent abdominal pain; however, on the [**2127-12-9**], her abdominal pain was acutely worse rating 10 out of 10 in severity.
At that time, an abdominal series x-rays were obtained which were without evidence of obstruction or perforation.
She also underwent an MRI of the abdomen which demonstrated no abnormality.
The Gastroenterology Service was consulted for esophagogastroduodenoscopy to rule out gastritis or ulcer.
She underwent endoscopy by the GI Service which demonstrated evidence only of mild gastritis.
There was concern that the patient's persistent nausea and emesis was medication related due to her Mucomyst.
Two days later, she experienced a dramatic improvement in her abdominal pain, nausea and emesis.
Prior to discharge, she was able to tolerate oral intake without any further nausea, vomiting or emesis.
OPIUM ADDICTION:  Per report by the patient's parents and family members, there was evidence of opiate drugs and paraphernalia at her apartment.
This resulted in an episode of lethargy and stuporousness.
This resulted in the patient being paranoid, cold, tremulous with evidence of piloerection.
There was some concern that she was undergoing acute opium withdrawal; therefore her pain control needs were reassessed and her morphine dose was titrated down appropriately.
If possible, pain relief needs should be managed with non-opiate medications.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  A routine chest x-ray to rule out any pulmonary infiltrate or evidence of fluid overload demonstrated an enlarged cardiac silhouette that was concerning for a new pericardial effusion.
Echocardiogram demonstrated a small circumferential pericardial effusion; there was no evidence of tamponade.
There was no evidence of impending tamponade.
There was a question whether her effusion was secondary to her uremia due to acute renal failure.
Follow-up echocardiogram on [**2127-12-20**], showed ejection fraction of greater than 60% and a small pericardial effusion which appeared smaller than her prior study.
LOW GRADE TEMPERATURES:  On several occasions, the patient manifested low grade temperatures in the range of 99.0 F., to 101.0 F.  Multiple work-ups were unrevealing for any source of infection.
Of note, her dialysis catheter and PICC line did not demonstrate any erythema, exudate or discharge.
Serial chest x-rays were negative for any evidence of infiltrate.
HYPERTENSION:  It was felt that the patient's elevated blood pressure was likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.
However, was concerning as she had a history of previous hypertension and it is unknown how hypertensive she was as an outpatient.
Of note, hypertension is common in patients with neurofibromatosis, number one, and it is often essential hypertension; however, it can also be due to renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia which is also common in patients with neurofibromatosis.
As her hypertension improved with dialysis, the decision was made not to pursue a work-up for fibromuscular dysplasia.
Unfortunately, the patient likely also has substance abuse issues which complicates her degree of insight into her suicide attempt.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As the patient was unable to maintain adequate oral intake in the setting of persistent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, she was nutritionally repleted with total parenteral nutrition.
Of note, they do not expect the patient to require hemodialysis for very much longer as her laboratory evaluations of renal function continue to improve.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Stable, afebrile, hemodynamically stable; tolerating oral intake without nausea or vomiting; ambulating independently.
Acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis as a result of Tylenol overdose.
Depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, status post suicide gesture.
q. day as needed for constipation.
four times a day for one month for acute gastritis.
