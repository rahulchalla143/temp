Placement of permanent pacemaker   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 70072**] is a 71 yo male who with a PMH of hypertension and MI, who presents with back pain of 2 weeks duration.
He states it felt as if his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.
Over the next few days, he began to notice a pain in his upper back.
He describes that pain as similar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.
When the pain first began, it was intermittent and could be brought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk and eating.
He noticed that his pain gradually became more intense, and more intolerable.
He reports occasional chest pain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his pain would become severe.
At the time of presentation to an OSH, his pain was constant, not relieved with Advil or acetominophen, and he reports it as a [**9-26**].
He also developed a dry, non-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling of nausea that developed when he would cough.
At times, when the pain would become severe, he began to feel feverish and developed sweats.
Recalls one episode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized.
Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.
He estimates that he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due to decreased appetite and pain with eating.

There is degenerative disc disease at multiple levels.
At C4-C5, there is a small central disc protrusion without evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.
At C5-C6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte bar producing moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
There is no evidence of abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disease as described.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM: IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at T7-T8.
There is involvement of the disc, and there is an epidural mass.
The features in general suggest that this may be a malignant process rather than an active infection, although granulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.
The findings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this is not entirely excluded.
Mild disc bulging.
No evidence of focal disc protrusion.
No evidence of a destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region.
CT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]: Again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and superior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.
There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of bone fragments into the ventral part of the spinal canal.
The degree of cord compression is better evaluated on the previous day's MRI.
Again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this locale.
No new abnormalities are identified.
There are emphysematous changes in the lungs.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]: CT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.
The small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is not well characterized in this study.

Chest CT [**2100-12-7**]: The multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are subcentimeter ranging up to 9 mm in the right paratracheal, 8 mm in the outer pulmonary, and 1 cm in subcarinal are.
There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
The extensive mural thickening also involve the origin of the left subclavian and left carotid and innominate arteries.
The assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild centrilobular emphysema involving predominantly the upper lobes.
The bilateral pleural effusion is small with adjacent lung atelectasis.
Additional area of focal pleural thickening is in the right upper lobe, series 4, image 45.
No other lung nodules or masses are identified.
The gallbladder is markedly distended measuring up to 6 cm in diameter with some high-attenuation of the posterior portion suggesting vicarious excretion.
[**2100-12-17**] U/S:  IMPRESSION: Negative bilateral lower extremity DVT study.
[**2100-12-27**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left pleural effusion and new relatively large area of consolidation in lingula and left lower lobe since prior study of [**2100-12-24**].
Decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion with loculated components.
High attenuation within a loculated fluid collection in the left upper hemithorax suggests component of possible hemothorax and is unchanged.

Calcium Phos  Mg [**2101-1-1**] 06:30AM          7.0*   2.9 2.0   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygeal fracture, and CAD, who presented with back pain of 2 weeks duration, found to have a T7-T8 epidural mass on MRI.
He subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent colpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by post-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper extremity venous clot, and delerium.
## Epidural Mass: Patient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2 weeks duration, that he rated as [**9-26**] on admission.
Patient had decreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological deficits, and back was non-tender to palpation.
No leg weakness, sensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.
MRI on admission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some moderate cord compression.
Found to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for infectious process.
Based on imaging the differential of the epidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma), vs malignancy vs AV malformation.
The patient denied any history or exposure to TB, however he was in North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s during the Korean war.
Recalled one episode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized.
Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.
Serial neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord compression and were normal.
On [**12-3**] the patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology  and pathology.
Gram stain and culture returned positive for GPC.
When organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and flagyl were discontinued.
ID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam (unclear age given no regular medical care).
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.
There was no evidence of granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.
Although the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess, an underlying process could not be excluded.
Given possibility for underlying malignancy an SPEP/UPEP were sent.
PSA was 1.0 and chest CT showed no lung nodules.
Given the location of the abscess and involvement of T7-T8 vertebrae with T7 collapse, the patient was taken to the OR for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by ortho spine.
## NTEMI - Two days after his second surgery, the patient developed chest pain.
The pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild hypotension.
His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.
## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated by a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.
He was resuscitated successfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, or electricity.
Telemetry revealed complete heartblock.
The bradycardia appears to have been triggered by excessive vagal tone.
No baseline for comparison.
Fe studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
Patient reports no hemoptysis, hematemesis,melena, or hematochezia.
Late into his CCU stay, he developed guaiac positive stool.
## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to medications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in sleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.
He was started on an aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of large amount of narcotics.
Since being on the antibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in place.
The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. the antibiotics themselves.
## Hypertension:  Patient has a history of hypertension but had never been treated.
BP was initially labile and elevated readings seemed to correlate with pain.
When pain was better controlled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150 at times.
No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous catheter.
## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum culture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.
He did not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia (no fever, normalizing WBC, no definitive consolidation on imaging).
Antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some shortness of breath.
He also developed a large pleural effusion and underwent a thorocentesis.
The fluid was exudative and likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was negative (he has been on antibiotics).
## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and pneumo-boots with slow GIB.
Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to medications and loose stools.
Haloperidol 1 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Vertebral osteomyelitis NSTEMI Complete Heart Block s/p external pacemaker placement and then perm.

You underwent 2 surgeries to remove as much of the infection as possible and to stabilize the spine.
However, after the surgeries you had a small heart attack.
You had some blood in your stool.
