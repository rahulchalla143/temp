Stable cardiomegaly with stable to slightly improved mild congestive heart failure.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes.
Q waves in the inferior leads consistent with prior infarction.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with bleeding originating in the region of the hepatic flexure.
C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2118-12-4**] 7:04 PM  Reason: please eval for site of bleeding Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old woman with BRBPR and blood loss anemai.
The catheter was used to subsequently engage the origin of celiac axis and superior mesenteric arteries.
Selective celiac and SMA arteriogram were performed at anterior-posterior and lateral projections.
There was no evidence of extravasation of contrast.
No inferior mesenteric artery was identified secondary to aortic bypass graft.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2118-12-4**]  GI BLEEDING STUDY  Reason: P/W BRBPR-PLEASE ASSESS GI BLEED  HISTORY: bright red blood per rectum  INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 30 minutes were obtained.
EKG [**12-4**]: Sinus bradycardia Short PR interval Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect Inferior infarct - age undetermined LVH with ST-T changes No change from previous .
EKG [**12-7**]: Sinus bradycardia Short PR interval Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect Inferior infarct - age undetermined LVH with ST-T changes No change from previous .
EKG [**12-10**]: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response, rate 118.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-12-9**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.
RENAL U.S.  [**2118-12-12**] 11:54 AM  RENAL U.S.  Reason: obstruction  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old woman with CAD s/p MI, CHF, massive LGIB s/p 19 units of prbcs, now with ARF cr 0.8->1.9 in setting of labile HTN.
Also with ongoing hematuria.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: obstruction INDICATION: CAD, status post MI with acute renal failure in the setting of labile hypertension, ongoing hematuria.
There is a small roughly 4-mm nonobstructing stone within the interpolar region of the right kidney.
There is no hydronephrosis.
A small approximately 1 cm anechoic cyst is demonstrated within the right parapelvic region.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT: Investigation of transfusion reaction  CLINICAL/LAB DATA: The patient is a 63 year old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease (NSTEMI with stent placements in [**10-31**]) peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary edema, breast cancer and a recent diverticular bleed at the splenic flexure who was admitted for a GI bleed and falling hematocrit.
At 18:30, after the patient had received 375 cc, the patient was witnessed to have hematuria, which was also present before the transfusion, per the resident caring for the patient.
Fever, chills/rigors, respiratory distress, chest pain, nausea and vomiting and back pain were not described.
Urine: color=red with 6-10 WBC and [**5-6**] RBC, prot/creat=1.6,  DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient experienced isolated hematuria 3 hours and 45 minutes after receiving 375 cc of B positive compatable blood.
No fever, chills, respiratory distress, hypotension or other signs of hemodynamic instability were noted after the transfusion.
The possiblility of an immune intravascular hemolytic transfusion reaction with this clinical picture is highly unlikely.
Non immune causes of hemolysis include mechanical (heart valve, roller pump), osmotic, intrisnic red cell defect.
Repeat testing of antibody screen and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) would be warrented if continued hemolysis occurs without other found causes.
BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT  [**2118-12-15**] 9:38 AM  BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT  Reason: obstruction, mass - cause for dysphagia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old woman with massive LGIB, CAD s/p MI, now with hemolytic anemia, ARF, also with dysphagia to solids REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: obstruction, mass - cause for dysphagia HISTORY: 63-year-old woman with massive lower GI bleed, CAD, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, now with upper dysphagia to solids.
There is no aspiration into the airway and no significant retention in the valleculae or piriform sinuses.
No structural abnormalities are detected in the region of the pharynx and cervical esophagus.
There is a small axial hiatal hernia and a small amount of gastroesophageal reflux was observed during the exam.
No definite Schatzki ring was observed, however, the barium tablet delayed significantly at the gastroesophageal junction before passing into the stomach.
No esophageal mucosal abnormalities were identified.
IMPRESSION: No abnormalities identified in the hypopharynx and upper esophagus.
Small axial hiatal hernia with associated gastroesophageal reflux.
Although no Schatzki ring was identified, there was delayed passage of the 12.5 mm barium tablet across the gastroesophageal junction.
Left atrial abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-12-10**] cardiac rhythm now sinus mechanism.
Colonoscopy [**2118-12-4**]: Indications: Gastrointestinal bleeding with positive tagged RBC scan at hepatic flexure  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the cecum was reached.
There were no complications.
Limitations: Poor preparation of the whole colon due to bleeding.
Findings:  Protruding Lesions Many semi-pedunculated non-bleeding polyps of benign appearance and ranging in size from 4mm to 8mm were found in the hepatic flexure.
Excavated Lesions Multiple severe diverticula with extensive openings were seen in the sigmoid colon , transverse colon, hepatic flexure and ascending colon.
There was also fresh blood seen at the hepatic flexure and less blood in general at the cecum/ascending colon.
Multiple diveriticula were seen beneath the clot, but no active bleeding was seen.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon , transverse colon, hepatic flexure and ascending colon 2.
There were multiple diverticula and polyps underneath and nearby the clot, respectively.
Source of bleeding is most consistent with diverticular bleed at the hepatic flexure.
Patient will need repeat colonoscopy for polypectomies after acute GI bleeding has resolved.
EGD: Indications: Dysphagia  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Patchy erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the antrum.
Impression: Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results Check H. pylori serology Esophageal manometry Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire procedure .
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 63 yo woman w/ CAD, labile HTN, CHF (mildly depressed EF, 1+AR, 2+MR), Afib, PVD, FM, breast CA in remission, s/p NSTMI in [**10-31**] c/b pulmonary edema, s/p 2 stents to D1 and LCx (failed), also c/b strep viridans endocarditis admitted with massive GI bleed.
Patient had episode of GI bleed w/BRBPR in setting of taking [**Date Range **], Coumadin.
Patient received a total of 19 units of pRBCs , 2 units of FFP, and reversed with 10 mg SC Vit K for this episode of GI bleeding.
Patient is s/p 2 positive tagged cell scan at hepatic flexure and colonoscopy showing a clot at the hepatic flexure.
Patient was then stabilize in terms of GI bleeding and maintained a stable Hct >30.
On the floor, the patient had labile HTN with BP ranging 180s-200s.
Renal consultation was placed and it was felt that the initiation of an ACE along with relative hypotension was the cause for this increase.
Her Hct drifted below 30 without any evidence of ongoing GI bleeding (although she remained guaiac +).
Her urine remained dark and the workup for hemolysis began since patient had elevated LDH to [**2112**], haptoglobin <20 and elevated bilirubin to ~2.5.
Patient never experienced any fevers, chills, flank pain however and her Cr.
Urine hemosiderin was persistently negative suggesting an extravascular process.
Lower GI bleed: Patient bled in the setting of a supra therapeutic INR and while taking [**Hospital3 **] post MI and hx of A.fib.
She did not have a history of bleeding had a colonoscopy with polyps over 5 yrs ago without any follow up.
Her bleed was found to be secondary to diverticula located at the hepatic flexure.
She also had colonoscopy confirming diverticular disease.
Interventional Radiology also performed angiography but was unwilling to perform embolization due to the risk of necrosis.
CAD s/p NSTEMI: Patient was considered high risk for ischemia given her massive LGIB and recent MI.
She experience one episode of CP with the bleed without EKG changes, CE negative.
Later on patient experience chest tightness with shortness of breath in the setting of Hct ~25.
There were no new EKG changes and CE were negative x 3.
Upon discharge she is chest pain free.
Labile HTN: Patient with severe HTN with hx of flash pulmonary edema and hypertensive emergencies.
She was initially taken off all outpatient meds given her large GI bleed.
began to increase and it was felt that relative hypotension was the cause along with initiation of the ACEI.
Patient received a renal MRI/MRA to rule out stenosis that was negative on the right and unable to assess on the left due to artifact from aorto-[**Hospital1 **] iliac stenting.
Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Patient had transient episode during her last admission, spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm and was started on Coumadin, and sent out on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor and was to have an outpatient EP study.
Given her massive GI bleed Coumadin was discontinued.
Patient also had some short runs of SVT to 150s on [**12-13**].
Her Cr began to rise prior to her episode of hemolysis.
Evidence of hemolysis with increased LDH, low hapto, increased T. bili, ?delayed transfusion rx vs. G6PH deficiency, drug reaction, infectious (Bactrim for UTI).
Patient s/p transfusion reaction screen - no evidence of immune mediated hemolysis however could be false negative.
The patient should have a micro coombs assay sent as outpatient as the clinical suspicion for a COOMBS  + alloimmune  hemolytic anemia remaisn high as the patient seemed to only hemolyze in the setting of red cell transfusion.
CHF: Evidence of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with mildly reduced EF.
No active issues during this admission, no evidence of fluid overload.
Shortness of Breath.
Patient experienced intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, primarily wit ambulation/exertion and SVT.
Patient complained of dysphagia to solids.
Barium swallow was performed which showed showing distal narrowing and delayed emptying at the level of the GE junction (see results section).
EGD was performed that did not show any lesions/masses, not consistent with achalasia.
Her dysphagia was thought to be secondary to a [**Month/Day (2) **] disorder.
Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to massive red cell transfusion.
