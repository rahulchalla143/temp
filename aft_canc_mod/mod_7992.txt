At the time of the surgery, the patient had a large mass in the IVC.
On chest xray done to verify line placement, it was noted the patient had a massive right-sided pleural effusion, possibly representing hematoma, with collapse of right lung, and leftward shift of the mediastinum and heart.
When that chest tube was removed, there was pneumothorax which had remained stable.
O2 requirements diminished.
Clot culture was sent at time of VATS, which was reported no growth.
