Admission Date:  [**2135-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-2-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-10-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 86yo M with PMH of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the right lung, with endobronchial disease, s/p broncheal stenting in [**2133**], with multiple episodes of non-massive hemoptysis, and recent rigid bronchoscopy with balloon dilatation of Bronchus intermedius, who is admitted to the MICU with hemoptysis.
Two days prior to admission he had worsening of his chronic cough with associated retching and nausea.
He felt feverish and noted maximum temperature 98.2 at home.
He developed dyspnea and returned presented to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**] hospital.
Non-Con CT chest showed known pulmonary mets apparently unchanged from [**2135-1-4**] thought the final read was not available.
CXR showed elevated right hemidiaphragm with minimal mediastinal shift to the right.
He was not given any blood transfusions or intervenous fluids.
He was seen by IP who recommended bronch with rigid scope and admission to the ICU for close monitoring.
Of note, patient underwent bronchoscopy [**2135-1-17**] with where stenosis of the bronchus intermedius stent was noted and treted with balloon dilation of the right middle segment/bronchus intermedius and tumor ablation with electrocautery of granulation tissue within the stent and in the distal end of the stent.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: - in [**4-/2122**] Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] had a right-sided kidney lesion found incidentally.
Ureteral & vascular margins were  free of tumor, no vascular invasion was seen.
- in late [**2132**], developed recurrent hemoptysis which prompted ENT  evaluation & chest imaging, which showed a compressive mass in  the right bronchus.
He had a flexible bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] complicated by significant bleeding & was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2133-1-14**].
Chest CT showed a mass encasing the right pulmonary artery & invading the bronchus intermedius.
- on [**2133-6-18**] developed hemoptysis requiring Sutent hold through  [**2133-6-23**] & again [**Date range (1) 36573**].
He returned [**2133-8-25**] & reported scant hemoptysis x 2 days & his Sutent was stopped.
- on [**2133-11-25**], saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for bronchoscopy which showed stent in good position, no endobronchial lesions were seen.
- [**2133-12-29**] with ongoing cough, sputum production.
- in follow-up [**2134-2-2**], his cough had improved but plts were low, necessitating hold - on [**2134-2-17**], restarted once plts 98 - follow-up [**2134-3-2**], He was doing well apart from ongoing respiratory symptoms of cough, sputum production & scant hemoptysis/mild epistaxis.
At that time  we discussed possibly resuming Sutent earlier than 2 weeks off therapy if respiratory symptoms persisted.
He had stopped Flonase due to epistaxis.
- on [**2134-4-1**] bronchoscopy w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which showed a large endobronchial lesion in the [**Hospital1 **], friable w/ stent [**03**]% occluded.
- on [**2134-6-8**], for follow up, doing well apart from 2-3 days of pruritic rash on left sided torso consistent with herpes zoster.
He developed pain at  the site which continued despite use of Tylenol and was prescribed a lidocaine patch.
- On [**2134-7-13**] CT appeared to show overall minimal decrease to affected area and decreased compression of the right main stem  bronchus.
Notable is interval development of a left adrenal nodule with rim of enhancement given characteristics and rapid growth concerning for metastasis.
Interval resolution of the right pleural effusion.
- On [**2134-9-30**] pulm rigid bronch revealed his metal stent well-covered with granulation tissue was visualized in the bronchus intermedius.
An 80% stenosis to the right lower lobe was seen distal to the stent, and the bronchoscope could not pass.
His wife was recently diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and is being seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**] from Breast Oncology.
He drinks one scotch every three weeks   Family History: Father mastoid infection and died in his 50s.

Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with substantial opacity involving the right hilum and nearby cardiophrenic sulcus appear similar compared to the recent prior examination.
Regarding the lung parenchyma, no definite nodules are demonstrated radiographically.
IMPRESSION: Similar medial right basilar opacity which is nonspecific but shows air bronchograms, perhaps associated with radiation fibrosis in the appropriate setting, although coinciding malignant mass in the area is not excluded.
[**2135-2-2**] Bronchoscopy in brief: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
There were no complications.
There were no abnormalities of the left sided airways.
There was a stent post jutting into the RMSB but was not damaging airway.
There was a mild increase in bleeding from the proximal aspect upon entering the stent.
Tissue ablation with electrocautery was used to achieve hemostasis with good effect.
There were no complications.
[**2135-2-3**] Bilateral U/s Lower Extremities: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT within right or left lower extremities.
[**2135-2-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No new areas of consolidation to suggest an acute pneumonia.

# Hemoptysis: While we initially entertained other reasons for the hemoptysis, the obvious source seemed to be his lung metasteses.
On the night of his admission he underwent rigid broncoscopy by IP who saw that he had a fractured bronchus intermedius stent with friable tissue around it, causing right main stem bleeding.
The tissue was cauterized, otherwise without incident, and then the patient was taken back to the MICU.
In the MICU that morning he had a fever to 100.4, which was believed to be from the procedure, and no cultures were taken, no antibiotics were given.
At discharge, he was walking around the floor relatively quickly, without shortness of breath or coughing.
# Chest Pain: The patient had an episode of chest pain on the night of his floor stay, and then again during the day on [**2-3**].
The pain he said was typical of a chronic CP that he has intermittently.
Because of this we cycled two troponins, which were negative, got a CXR which didn't show new focal consolidation, and got lower extremity U/S, which was also negative for DVT.
On the other hand, he has little pulmonary reserve, and PE could be devastating.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient is currently off the Sutent per his oncologist, who agreed that it was good to stop it for now.
# Post herpatic neuralgia: affecting left abdomen.
3) His amlodopine and atenolol were stopped during this admission due to concern of hypotension and blood loss.

3) Shortness of breath.
4) Intermittent chest pain.
To summarize, you came to the hosptial because you were becoming increasingly short of breath and you were coughing up more blood than usual.
The interventional pulmonologists performed a bronchoscopy which showed that one of the your stents was broken, and that you had some bleeding tissue around the stent.
On the day after your procedure you had a slight temperature, but that quickly went down and nothing came of it.
