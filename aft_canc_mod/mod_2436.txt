OMED Course: # Dyspnea: She presented with several weeks of progressive dyspnea and developed a significant oxygen requirement shortly after arrival to the floor requiring ICU transfer.
Her dyspnea is mulitfactorial including advanced NSCLC, new diagnosis of PE in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes, pneumonia, and volume overload.
The multiple conditions contributing to her dyspnea were managed as discussed below.
Most likely related to underlying malignancy.
# Pneumonia: She was started on Azithromycin prior to admission by her oncologist due to concern for CAP after presenting with cough and dyspnea.
Admission CTA on [**2169-10-15**] showed new (from [**2169-9-21**]) ground glass and interstitial opacities throughout the RLL and inferior RUL concerning for atypical pneumonia.
She was started on Levofloxacin on admission and broadened to Vancomycin and Cefepime on [**2169-10-16**] for a worsening CXR.
Blood cultures from [**2169-10-15**] showed no growth.
Portable CXR on [**2169-10-21**] showed a stable right sided infiltrate but increased left pulmonary edema.
# Volume Overload: Cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary edema was noted on recent CXRs.
Her left sided pulmonary edema may be due to elevated right heart pressures in the setting of her right sided PEs.
Pulmonary edema is likely contributing to her dyspnea.
Some radiographic improvement was noted on ICU imaging, but recent CXR showed increased left sided pulmonary edema.
# Anxiety: Moderate anxiety at baseline treated with Citalopram, exacerbated by recent illness.
Likely contributing somewhat to her tachypnea and respiratory distress.
# Advanced NSCLC: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**] here.
# Anemia: She has developed a normocytic anemia since starting a new regimen of chemo in [**Month (only) **].
Most likely due to marrow suppressive properties of regimen.
No signs of active bleeding.
# Hypertension: Her BP remained fairly stable in the 100s systolic.
