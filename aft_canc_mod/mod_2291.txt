Thereafter, she complained of nausea with occasional vomitting and has been unable to keep down any of her oral medications.
She also has had diffuse abdominal pain consistent with her prior flares of pain as well as her typical diffuse headache.
The headache in particular was worsening and, for her, this is a sign of poorly-controlled hypertension so she came to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She was given 4 mg of IV ondansetron, [**1-11**] inch intropaste, 1 mg of IV hydromorphone x3, 1000cc of NS, and was put on a labetalol drip which had to be increased up to 2 mg/min.
A head CT showed no acute abnormality (including hemorrhage) and an abdominal CT showed some possible mild colitis, though it is unclear if this is due to her recent peritoneal dialysis.
Malignant hypertension - Baseline BPs 180's - 120's - History of hypertensive crisis with seizures - History of two intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were thought due to the posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, associated with LE paresis in [**2140**] that resolved 4.

Brief Hospital Course: 24 year old woman with CKD V and severe hypertension due to SLE admitted with flare of chronic abdominal pain and hypertensive urgency.
MICU course: Current plan on transfer 24 year old woman with CKD V and severe hypertension due to SLE admitted with flare of chronic abdominal pain and hypertensive urgency.
Her clonidine patch and hydralazine was held and she again became hypertensive with SBPs 190s.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**12-10**] after resolution of her hypertensive urgency with a decreased blood pressure regimen due to her hypotension in response to home doses of her medications.
The patient's pressures responded and additional narcotics were held due to her mental status.
A possible component to the patient's malignant hypertension is likely due to OSA.
Abdominal pain: The etiology of her abdominal pain is unclear, but has been a chronic issue for her.
A CT scan was performed that showed bowel wall changes that are likely secondary to recent peritoneal dialysis and unrelated to pain.
The patient's pain was initially treated with hydromorphone, but because of the patient's lethargy on [**12-11**] they were initially held.
She continued to complain of severe abdominal pain.
History of SVC/subclavian vein thrombus: The patient was found to have a subtherapeutic INR on admission 1.3.
