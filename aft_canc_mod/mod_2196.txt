CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
There is a type B dissection, as noted previously with the false lumen beginning shortly after the takeoff of the left subclavian artery, about 2 cm more distally.
There is some narrowing of the true lumen at the diaphragmatic inlet, as low as 2.3 x 0.6 cm in axial dimensions.
At all levels, there are few calcifications along the outer wall of the aorta.
The celiac, and superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are supplied by the true lumen which is well opacified.
As noted on the prior MR, the dissection extends into the proximal right external iliac artery, where it appears that the distal arterial distribution for the right leg is supplied by the true lumen.
At the site of the gastroesophageal junction, the axial dimensions of the aorta are somewhat larger than before, mostly because of expansion of the false lumen since the prior study.
There is bibasilar atelectasis and tiny right effusion, but otherwise the lungs are clear.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is contrast in the gallbladder, probably from a recent CT.
Although there is motion artifact limiting evaluation of the upper abdomen, the pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or free air or fluid.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in the bladder, and a large right diverticulum, which could be due to prior obstruction.
There is a trace free fluid only, but no pelvic or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There is very extensive involvement of sclerotic metastatic disease, attributed to the history of prostate cancer throughout the visualized skeleton.
Type B aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta and terminating in the right external iliac artery.
Large bladder diverticulum.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7832**]   Approved: MON [**2165-6-24**] 8:33 PM Procedure Date:[**2165-6-24**]  INDICATION: 80-year-old man with dysphasia and thoracic aortic aneurysm.
No comparison studies.
Within the upper esophagus, there is limited filling seen at the level of the aortic arch and lower trachea, corresponding with site of adjacent thoracic aortic aneurysm with dissection.
Distal to this region, there is no evidence of stricture or abnormal dilatation.
Mucosal abnormalities were difficult to assess given limitations of the study and lack of double contrast.
No evidence of hiatal hernia.
IMPRESSION: limited filling of the upper esophagus at level of the aortic arch, likely secondary to mass effect caused by thoracic aortic aneurysm.
No evidence of hiatal hernia.
Evaluated for possible surgery or stent grafting.
CT scanning repeated as well as esophageal evaluation done.
Also diagnosed with mass effect of aneurysm on esophagus as well as aging motility.
