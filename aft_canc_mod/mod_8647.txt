Admission Date:  [**2138-3-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-2-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hemodialysis, placement of a dialysis catheter   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a 63 yo M s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**3-15**] polycystic kidney disease on tacrolimus and prednisone, metastatic prostate cancer, and MGUS who presents with fevers from his rehabilitation facility.
He developed leukocytosis and loose stools during this hospitalization for which he was treated with flagyl empirically for two weeks ending on [**3-8**].
Per his wife, he developed a fever to 101F the evening prior to admission, without any associated chills or sweats.
He also complained of left thigh pains.
Review of systems is otherwise negative for headache, vision changes, neck stiffness, cough, chest or abdominal pain, rash, discharge or redness from his urostomy site.
He has had loose stools, nonwatery, without any gross bleeding in ~2 weeks.
Past Medical History: Polycystic kidney disease s/p cadaveric transplant x2 [**2118**]/[**2131**] Metastatic prostate cancer (mets to spine) on Lupron Chronic LE edema SCC skin HIT MGUS Hx c. difficile RUE cellulitis UGIB [**3-15**] gastritis Gout  Social History: Married, admitted from [**Hospital3 **]  Family History: noncontributory   Physical Exam: General chronically ill appearing, no acute distress HEENT sclera white conjunctiva pink, L eye a little swollen with crusting Neck supple, LIJ in place Pulm lungs clear bilaterally CV regular rate S1 S2 II/VI systolic murmur Abd soft +bowel sounds well healed scar RLQ mild discomfort to palpation RLQ, urostomy with pink stoma no exudate or erythema Extrem 2+ pitting edema bilateral LE with faint erythema of skin bilaterally, patient says this is a chronic issue for him.
Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, compared to the previous study of [**9-13**].
While the majority of this could represent anasarca, there is a more focal area of soft tissue density in the medial right thigh (not fully evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast), which most likely represents hematoma, although a metastatic focus or an area of infection cannot be entirely excluded.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Moderate congestive heart failure.
Renal Ultrasound 2/5/8: Transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant shows normal echogenicity and vascularity.
There is no hydronephrosis, calculus, or perinephric fluid collection.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the more distal segments.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is very mild mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is a very small anterior pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2138-3-20**]: Worsening of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions with overall distention in mediastinal vasculature consistent with volume overload.
Given his recent history of C diff and urine cultures positive for pseudomonas, he was treated with vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl empirically.
There was no obvious source for infection; blood cultures as well as PICC line cultures were negative.
During the course of his hospitalization, he devloped worsening pulmonary edema with anuria, making it difficult to support his blood pressure with IV fluids.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Unclear etiology for acute worsening, perhaps secondary to volume loss from recent C.diff, possibly secondary to pseudomonal UTI, though per renal there is possibilty of chronic pseudomonal colonization of patient's urine.
He developed anuria and was dialyzed by renal.
Pulmonary Edema Likely multifactorial causes including aggressive fluid replacement, worsening heart failure, acute renal failure and possible pseudomonal UTI.
Echo demonstrated new wall motion abnormality; however, upon review of the Echo with cardiology, the feeling was that the basal wall akinesis was in fact present on prior TTE.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended PA catheter placement to ellucidate etiology, catheter was not placed due to comorbidities and change in goals of care.
ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant Treated with tacrolimus and prednisone.
Metastatic prostate cancer.
He was given ativan and morphine for symptomatic control.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fever and low blood pressure.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection which was treated.
You also required dialysis because of your end stage renal disease.
