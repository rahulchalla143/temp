Past Medical History: -PRIOR TREATMENT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18817**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] wide local excision of a 1.5-mm thick superficial spreading melanoma from his inner aspect of his left thigh in [**2121**].
This report was remarkable for bilateral calf DVT into the femoral and popliteal veins with probable pulmonary embolism on CT scan.
He developed biopsy-proven recurrence in left inguinal area, which on review, was felt to be within the lymph nodes with evidence of extracapsular extension into the resection margin.
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] left inguinal node dissection on [**2132-10-4**] with pathology revealing metastatic melanoma with a soft tissue, not extending to the margins.
Mr. [**Known lastname 18818**] course was complicated by urinary tract infection and thus being off of the interferon from [**2133-8-21**] through [**2133-8-31**] being on antibiotics.
Mr. [**Known lastname 18818**] interferon was discontinued on [**2133-11-19**] due to prostatitis flare.
He was diagnosed with prostate cancer [**2134-3-25**] with biopsy-positive prostate cancer [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+3.
-- CT torso [**2135-8-8**] which showed a 25 x 23 mm right upper lobe nodule and a 3mm R. apical nodule with no other disease in the chest, abdomen of pelvis.
FDG avid bilateral hilar nodes 3.
FDG avid lesion in the inferior left abdominal wall 4.
FDG avid mass in the left scapula and multiple FDG avid skeletal sites.
-- [**2135-8-29**] MRI Brain: No evidence of intracranial metastases.
BRAF V600E Mutant -- [**2135-9-20**] consented for DF-HCC 09-406 (RO5185426 or Dacarbazine).
Deemed ineligible due to prostate cancer.
-- [**2135-10-25**] C1D1 Dacarbazine 1000mg/m2 -- [**2136-2-23**] CT torso with no new lesions, slight decrease in groin met, stable bony disease -- [**2136-2-23**] MRI brain without CNS disease -- [**2136-5-22**] C11D1 Dacarbazine 1000mg/m2 .

Minimal plate-like areas of atelectasis at the left lung base.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
[**2136-6-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
[**2136-6-27**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**6-22**], there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of pleural effusion.
However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
Persistent high signal in left iliacus muscle on STIR imaging in keeping with intramuscular edema but muscle expansion has decreased with further decreases in size of intramuscular fluid locules.
Stable bone mets in right upper femur and right inferior pubic ramus.
[**2136-6-22**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
No evidence of metastatic disease.
MRI with and without contrast would be more sensitive if there is high clinical concern.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2136-6-20**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Unchanged sclerotic metastasis in the upper thoracic spine.
Asymmetric enhancement and edema extending from the medial inferior left psoas muscle, majority of left iliacus muscle with extension into the proximal left thigh to involve the left iliopsoas, left obturator externus, pectineus, adductor muscle group, quadratus femoris and gluteus minimus musculature with mild enhancement and edematous changes.
In addition, there are small locules of rounded fluid in the left iliacus muscle posteriorly, which demonstrate non-enhancement centrally with the largest pocket with layering debris measuring approximately 1.3 x 2.3 cm.
This constellation of findings is concerning for an infectious or inflammatory process in the correct clinical setting.
Inflammatory neoplastic process is also a possible consideration.
Left femoral neck likely osseous metastatic lesion is stable in size in comparison to prior comparisons.
No pathologic fracture.
Small left hip joint effusion with likely reactive edema in the medial and posterior left acetabulum.

Also foley catheter placed prior to admission for urinary retention while on morphine.
MRI [**2136-6-17**] demonstrated inflammation of his left iliopsoas muscle and a left hip effusion.
Infectious Disease was [**Month/Day/Year 4221**] and Interventional Radiology aspirated the left hip, which showed a WBC > 20,000 and GPCs (eventually speciated to MSSA).
During surgery, the severity of the infection led to a left femoral head resection.
Pain was intially controlled with parenteral narcotics with assistance from the Palliative Care service.
Once MSSA was speciated, vancomycin was changed to nafcillin after a successful nafcillin desensitization in the ICU without hives, edema, or anaphylaxis.
He was restarted on warfarin with an enoxaparin bridge for DVT treatment considering his past histories of DVTs and PE.
He also required RBC transfusions for anemia of inflammation.
# MSSA septic hip and infective myositis: Hip wash out and femoral head resection [**2136-6-22**].
Repeat MRI without evidence of fluid re-accumulation.
Physical therapy: No weight bearing to left hip changed to weight bearing as tolerated.
Ortho and reconstructive surgery F/U in [**3-14**] weeks with repeat MRI +/- arthrocentesis prior to hip replacement.
# Fever: Due to septic joint and infective myositis.
# Nafcillin desensitization: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mr. [**Known lastname 18817**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**] nafcillin densensitization and received a total of 3 doses of nafcillin while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without hives, edema, or anaphylaxis.
He was also hemodynamically stable without periods of hypotension throughout the desensitization.
# Acute renal failure: Stable.
# Metastatic melanoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] is planning to enroll Mr. [**Known lastname 18817**] into a clinical trial after resolution of current infection.
# Prostate CA: PSA 19.2, increased from 10.5 on 12/[**2134**].
Changed nitrofurantoin to vancomycin [**2136-6-19**] for MSSA UTI and septic arthritis, then to nafcillin with sensitivities, then to daptomycin due to [**Last Name (un) **].
# Hyperglycemia: Mild.
# Urinary retention: Developed in setting of narcotic analgesia.
Low retic suggested decreased production, likely anemia of inflammation.
# DVT PPx: On chronic antociagulation for h/o DVT/PE.
# Precautions: Fall.
# CODE: FULL.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for left hip pain thought to be due to either metastatic melanoma or prostate cancer.
However, MRI revealed a severe infection of the hip joint (septic arthritis) and surrounding muscles (myositis).
You were started on IV antibiotics and Infectious Disease specialists and Orthopedic surgeons were [**Hospital 4221**].
This fluid was grossly infected with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
After this, MRI of the hip will need to be done and possibly another needle aspiration to prove the infection has cleared.
You did require red blood cell transfusions for anemia and you may require additional blood transfusions in the future.
- If you have any increased redness, drainage, swelling, numbness, or if you have a temperature greater than 101.5, please call the office or come to the emergency department.
Oxycodone 5-10mg as needed for breakthrough pain.
Tamsulosin (Flomax) daily to prevent urinary retention.
