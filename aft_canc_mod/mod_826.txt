At home, noted sneezing, cough with blood tinged sputum and increasing sob.
Usually can walk several feet w/o acute worsening of SOB as per patient, but reports dyspnea and acute sob when walking 30 feet.
No pleuritic chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or myalgias.
Patient noted mild LE edema over several days right mildly greater than left.
Given symptoms to ED.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 19503**] with respiratory distress.
CT scan demonstrated new, diffuse ground-glass opacity with intralobular reticulation in the left lung and right upper lobe, less in the right lower lobe.
These findings were thought to be due to [**Date range (1) **], diffuse infection, or acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
Exam decreased breath sounds right lower lobe CXR unremarkable.
EKG sinus tach no ST changes.
1L fluid given.
CT chest for PE negative.
Past Medical History: RUL NSLC s/p cyberknife treatment [**9-26**] interstitial lung disease emphysema CKD, baseline Cr.
1.7-2 GOUT hypertension GERD esophageal stricture s/p dilatation   Social History: He lives with his wife in [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 19501**].
He has significant asbestos exposure due to his factory work with rubber.
Brother with leukemia  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam  Vital signs: T 96.4, HR 112, BP 135/70, RR 22, Sat 93% Face mask Gen: Average stature, elderly white male, NAD, Pleasant and cooperative.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, OP pink w/o ulcers injection or exudates, dry MM Neck: Supple.
No cervical LAP.
Crackles at bases bilaterally, ?rub at posterior lung fields bilaterally Cor: RRR, S1S2, No MRG.
Abd: S/ND/NT, no HSM.
No sensory deficits.
Skin: 3-5mm scattered hemorrhagic lesions on dorsal surface of fingers and forearms.
Emphysema with interval progression of interstitial lung disease with ground- glass opacity, reticulation and honeycombing, most prominent in the lower lobes.
Given the calcification in the pleura, patient has likely had prior asbentos exposure and diffuse lung disease may be due to asbestosis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
CXR [**10-8**] - here has been no interval change allowing for differences in technique.
Mid and lower lung opacities are again noted corresponding to ground glass and reticular opacities seen on CT.
There is no evidence of superimposed pneumonia.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Calcified pleural plaques are compatible with prior asbestos exposure.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yoM with NSCLCA s/p cyberknife, Radiation Pneumonitis presents with worsening hypoxia.
# SOB/Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Patient likely had exacerbation if ILD [**1-21**] steroid taper as outpatient.
Completed Bronscopsopy with BAL performed day of admission was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**] or other infection.
Per report, there were no endobronchial lesions and no purulent secretions seen.
CTA negative for PE, but demonstrates evidence of worsening ground glass opacities.
Patient triggered for hypoxia on [**10-10**] and was transferred to the ICU.
Antibiotics were intially broadened to Vanco/Cefepime given poor reserve function and worsening CT but pt did not exhibit s/s infection without fever and all cultures were no growth, including BAL so these were stopped.
Symptoms including SPB and tachypnea also improved.
Rheumatology and IP were following and recommended starting Cellcept for steroid responsive pulmonary disease, ?
# ARF: Pt Cr had been elevated to 2.2 in setting of lasix administration.
# tachycardia: patient experienced episodes of MAT vs. sinus tach with PACs.
No evidence of PE on exam, and CT negative.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient has had progressive hematocrit and platelet drop.
Heme/Onc consulted and felt anemia most likely related to chronic disease, plus chronic kidney disease and low level hemolysis given low haptoglobin, together with medication effect.
HIT antibody negative but platelts trended down after started on Heparin so are avoiding heparin products given possible HIT Type 1.
Disp:*4 inhalers* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 19504**] of [**Location (un) 1514**] - [**Location (un) 1514**], NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital for shortness of breath, new difficutly breathing, light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, arm or shoulder pain, fevers, chills, night sweats or any other concerning symptom.
