Note:  By morphology this would be best classified as AML with minimal maturation (FAB-AML subclass M2).
Background dysplasia is noted, and correlation with clinical and cytogenetic findings is recommended to assess for an antecedent myelodysplastic process.
Numerous (8 per 100 WBCs) nucleated red cells, including some with asymmetric nuclear budding are noted.
Polychromatophils and cells with coarse basophilic stippling are also seen.
Blasts have scant amount of cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, large round-to-oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli.
Occasional cells with cytoplasmic granules and occasional vacuoles are seen.
Aspirate Smear:  The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of abundant cellular spicules.
Erythroid precursors are decreased with dyspoietic maturation; forms with irregular nuclear contour and asymmetric nuclear budding are seen.
Occasional clusters of plasma cells are seen.
It is a 1.5 cm core biopsy consisting of trabecular bone and marrow material.
The immature cells occupy greater than 80% of marrow cellularity.
Erythroid precursors are markedly decreased and show atypical forms with irregular nuclear membrane and asymmetric nuclear budding.
A small non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate comprised of small lymphocytes is present and accounts for less than 5% of the marrow cellularity.
Sideroblasts are present many with increased siderotic granules.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow are in the CD45-dim, low side-scatter 'blast' region.
T cells comprise 65% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 102 (usual range in 0.7-30).
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by an acute myeloid leukemia.
No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
CT CHEST [**2199-5-24**]  There is airspace consolidation seen within the left lower lobe, is concerning for newly developed pneumonia.
No pleural effusions or evidence of pneumothorax.
No discrete pulmonary nodules.
Multiple scattered mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes without pathological enlargement.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
BONE WINDOWS: The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
IMPRESSION: Patchy left lower lobe airspace consolidation, consistent with pneumonia.
No evidence of right ankle hemarthrosis.
Moderately severe subcutaneous edema diffusely throughout the right ankle, extending proximally beyond the field of view, and into [**Last Name (un) 22044**] fat pad.
Slight edema at the central/medial talar dome is compatible with small area of osteochondral injury.
Minimal tibialis posterior tenosynovitis.
[**2199-5-24**]: Bone Marrow Biopsy:  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:  HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT MARROW FOR AGE WITH LEFT SHIFTED MYELOPOIESIS.
NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE LEUKEMIA SEEN.
CD68 highlights large collections of maturing neutrophils and monocytes.
CD3 and CD20 stains scattered small T and B lymphocytes, respectively.
Erythrocytes are decreased in number and are overall normocytic and normochromic with occasional elliptocytes present.
Megakaryocytes are present in decreased numbers; abnormal forms are not seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a 1.3 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone with a variable cellularity ranging from 5-20%, overall 10%.
There is bony remodelling with focal marrow fibrosis.
A small paratrabecular lymphoid infiltrates comprised of small lymphocytes is present and account for <5% of the marrow cellularity.
There is interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring in small clusters occupying <5% of marrow cellularity.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia presents for initiation of chemotherapy.
# AML: Patient with low grade fever, ecchymoses, petichiae, and a marked leukocytosis >160K on presentation.
Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with an acute myeloid leukemia with normal cytogenetics so she was treated initially with Hydroxyurea and then with [**Doctor First Name **]/Ara-C 7+3.
She tolerated the regimen well without evidence of tumor lysis.
She was initially placed on Allopurinol, but this was discontinued after her chemotherapy was complete as she had no evidence of high or rapidly changing urate levels.
# Bilateral LL PNA: On admission, the patient was febrile and a CXR demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia, so she was placed on Cefepime & Vancomycin.
Overnight, after beginning IVF's with chemotherapy, she developed an oxygen requirement that progressed to a NRB and she required a brief transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia.
Imaging at that time demonstrated evidence of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with pulmonary edema.
# Ankle pain: On admission, the patient noted some right ankle discomfort with difficulty with plantar and dorsiflexion.
The ankle continued to be tender so an  MRI was obtained that demonstrated no hemoarthrosis, only edema and some mild tenosynovitis.
Orthopaedic surgery was consulted and recommended only supportive care.
With elevation and multipodus boots, the ankle improved and the patient regained full range of motion and ability to ambulate.
# Rash: Patient developed acral erythema on day 8 of therapy with a few isolated blisters on her heels.
Her Vancomycin infusion rate was decreased, but on day 9, the erythema progressed and she also developed a new pink papular rash along her thighs, neck, chest, behind her ears, and along her hairline.
Dermatology was consulted and they felt her presentation was consistent with a chemotherapy induced acral erythema with id response.
Her rash resolved and her acral erythema faded and began to peel.
She also had a mildly elevated Alk Phos level, but other electrolytes and LFT's were normal.
A work-up  demonstrated a normal GGT, suggesting a bony source of Alkaline Phosphatase, but a serum Calcium was normal and the patient had a normal PTH level.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you developed fatigue and leg bruising and were found to have acute myelogenous leukemia.
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**] and ask to page BMT fellow on call or return to the hospital right away if you develop cough, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nightsweats, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms.
