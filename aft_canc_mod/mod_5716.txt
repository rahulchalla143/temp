She was in her USOH approximately 4 weeks ago when she developed dyspnea and was seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**7-31**] at which time chest X-ray at the clinic revealed a RML consolidation that was a suspected pneumonia.
The patient reports that she began to feel better initially but her dyspnea worsened again and she returned to her PCP Chest CT was scheduled [**2139-8-13**] and ws concerning for malignancy and post-obstructive pneumonia.
However, patient developed worsening dyspnea and presented to the ED.
In the ED, she received ceftriaxone 1 g IV x1 and had a CTA which revelaed worsening RLL/RMl consolidation, pleural effusion and nodules in the left lung and she was admitted to Medicine for further work-up.
She tolerated the procedure well and had BAL on right and endobronchial biopsy on the left with minimal bleeding but near the end of the procedure, patient dropped her sats to 89-93% on 3 L NC became tachypneic and was started on BiPAP.
On arrival to the ICU she was taken off BiPAp and put on 60 % face mask with continuous neb with O2 sats 95-97% and was wheezing and coughing but reported feeling more comfortable.
Past Medical History: GERD Atrial fibrillation, new diagnosis this admission Mild Aortic stenosis on echo from [**2139-8-7**] .
She quit smoking 10 years ago however she had smoked for 50 years [**1-19**] ppd, she does not drink alcohol, no drugs.
Family History: Denies any history of cancer, kidney problems, lung problems, diabetes, her son dies of a stroke  Physical Exam: T 97.0 (ax)HR 95 BP 128/46 HR 89 RR 24-26 02 sats 100% on 60 % cool neb mask General: Patient sitting up in bed breathing with neb mask with audible wheezes and coughing, able to speak in about 3 word sentences HEENT: MMM, no JVD appreciated, PERRL, no cervical LAD CV: irregularly irregular rate, could not appreciate murmur with tachycardia and wheezing Pulm: No accessory muscle use, breathing at a rate of 22-24, decreased BS 1/2 up right [**Doctor Last Name **], diffuse expiratory wheezes Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND, no rebound, no guarding, well healed sub umbilical incision Ext: no edema, no calf tendernes, 1+ DP pulses Neuro: CN II-XII intact, strength in upper and lower extremities [**5-22**] and equal b/l   Pertinent Results: CTA: 1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Significant worsening in consolidation of the right upper and middle lobes, which is likely post-obstructive pneumonitis given the bulky right hilar lymphadenopathy and right upper and middle lobe bronchial compression.
Bronchoscopy may be helpful for further assessment.
Multiple new left lung pulmonary nodules, possibly representing metastases.
Interval worsening in now moderate right pleural effusion.
Pathology: Lung, endobronchial biopsy: A.  In-situ squamous cell carcinoma of bronchial mucosa, no definitive invasion seen.
B.  Detached fragments of neoplastic squamous epithelium; cannot assess for invasion.
Clinical:  Likely bronchogenic carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU course - On initial presentation to the MICU, it was thought most likely that the patient was suffering reactive bronchospasm secondary to the bronchoscopy.
However, despite aggressive management of potential bronchospasm the patient continued to have significant respiratory distress and hypoxia.
During her time of management in the ICU, results from her bronch became available, unfortunately revealing non-small cell lung CA, with further evaluation demonstrating metastatic disease.
Given her tumor was bilateral, her prognosis was known to be poor.
As she continued to develop worsening respiratory function with increaisng hypoxia and work of breathing, a decision was made with family members that the focur of care should be altered to ensure comfort.
The patient developed increasing hypoxia and eventually went into respiratory failure followed by cardiac arrest on [**2139-8-31**].
