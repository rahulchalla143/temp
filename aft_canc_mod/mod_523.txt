He was transferred to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] floor on [**2153-7-11**] with most of his care focused around improving his nutritional status, hemodialysis and optimal titration of his immunosuppression.
In between intubations, while extubated (see respiratory section), he did demonstrate confusion and was not at his baseline mental status.
On the floor, he quickly returned to AAOx3 and used minimal narcotics, his pain regimen consisting of acetaminophen and oxycodone 2.5 mg Q4H PRN.
On [**7-2**], he experienced  an episode of chest pain and cardiac markers were positive (elev of Tn 0.5 and CK altho raised 10K but cardiac index 0.4).
Per cardiolgy, after review of data (EKG, CEs, hx) it appeared that he may have had a peri-operative myocardial infarction (anteroseptal MI vs subendocardial ischemia) around [**6-28**] during stressors (reintubation...) rather than single episode of chest pain.
He had no further chest pain.
Initially extubated on POD 1 and reintubated into POD 2 due to tachypnea and worsening oxygen saturations.
AntiA and antiB antibody titters were monitored daily.
JP drains ( in hilar area and posterior to liver) were removed as non bilious drainage diminished.
This demonstrated a 9cm heterogeneous fluid collection near the tail of the pancreas consistent with clot.
He remained afebrile despite elevated WBC.
He did experience frequent loose stool.
Dextrose 50% 12.5 gm IV PRN hypoglycemia protocol 6.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
