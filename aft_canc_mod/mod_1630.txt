Admission Date:  [**2171-10-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-11-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-12-2**]     Sex:  M   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A tense headache (times three to four days); increasing in severity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with The patient was most recently treated with Taxotere (finished last dose approximately two weeks prior to presentation).
He has a history of a headache for over the last month since starting Taxotere therapy; which was originally intermittent.
A CT scan was done as an outpatient which showed no evidence for an acute disease process.
His pain has been progressively worse.
The magnetic resonance angiography showed multiple enhancing fossae of the thalamus, cerebellum, and surface of the frontal lobes with enhancement of the meninges; consistent with carcinoma dysmeningitis.
Magnetic resonance imaging also noted enlarged third ventricle; consistent with communicating hydrocephalus.
The patient also noted neck pain associated with a headache with some nausea.
He has no focal weakness, sensory deficits, back pain or incontinence of bowel or bladder.
He has not noted any change in speech or difficulty swallowing.
He has had some constipation secondary to Percocet for which he was treated with lactulose.
Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He is a small business owner.
In general, the patient was in some noticeable pain but was awake and alert and nontoxic-appearing.
He had mild photophobia with anicteric sclerae.
His oropharynx was without thrush or ulcerations.
On neck examination, he had slight meningismus with no cervical lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
He had no reflexes in the biceps or patella bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: The patient is a 59-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer with metastases to liver and bone now with magnetic resonance imaging consistent with carcinomatous meningitis with metastases to left cerebellum, left thalamus, and frontal lobes.
NEUROSURGERY:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Oncology Service with a diagnosis of new brain metastases and carcinomatous meningitis.
The cytology revealed malignant cells.
On hospital day four, the patient was noted to have bradycardia with a heart rate in the 30s to 40s, as well as some hypertension, which raised concern for [**Location (un) **] triad and increasing intracranial pressure.
Fortunately, no respiratory depression was noted.
A head CT was repeated at that time which showed no change in ventricular dilatation.
For the remainder of the patient's hospitalization, the patient had no recurrence of headache or meningeal signs.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be delirious with persistent altered mental status for approximately 48 hours to 72 hours.
As he had some difficulty with opiates causing mental status changes prior to surgery, opiate pain medications were limited at this point.
His mental status began to clear approximately three days postoperatively, and it was felt that the etiology of his altered mental status was multifactorial; including Decadron, postsurgical anesthesia, brain metastases, and possible alcohol withdrawal.
At the time of discharge, the patient was alert and oriented times three for greater than 48 hours; and although he had some difficulty remembering events immediately prior to the surgery, the patient was felt to be back at baseline.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Due to Decadron use, he had an elevated white blood cell count which normalized by the time of discharge and was tapered from steroids.
One of two of his urine culture grew Streptococcus bovis; which, given its association with colon cancer, an outpatient colonoscopy may be necessary.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was hypoglycemic secondary to steroid use and was monitored on q.i.d.
Non-small-cell lung cancer with newly diagnosed brain metastases.
Increased intracranial pressure; status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
The patient was discharged to home after clearance by Physical Therapy and was to receive two sessions of [**First Name (Titles) 3429**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11807**] for ventriculoperitoneal shunt wound care.
