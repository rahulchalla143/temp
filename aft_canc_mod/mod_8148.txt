Naming intact, [**Location (un) 1131**] intact, mild dysarthria with slowed speech.
No paraphasic errors.
Visual fields are full to confrontation, although patient has difficulty with vision given erythromycin eye ointment in eyes bilaterally and more formal visual field testing was difficult, but also showed full visual fields to finger wiggling III, IV, VI: R sided incomplete ptosis, mild difficulty with abduction of R eye and is unable to bury the sclera on that side, but otherwise EOMI despite disconjugate gaze (bilateral exotropia) on primary gaze.
Pt with diplopia on primary gaze that disappears with covering of one eye or the other.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

Heterogenous enhancement following contrast administration suggesting a pituitary macroadenoma.
Hemorrhagic components cannot be completely excluded but are less obvious on the non-contrast CT than seen on the same day MRI.
[**2169-4-21**] ECG Sinus bradycardia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2169-4-23**] MRI brain with gad Again a large pituitary mass is identified extending to suprasellar region and compressing the optic chiasm.
The mass measures approximately 2 cm in size.
The current examination demonstrates no evidence of lateral extension in the region of the cavernous sinuses lateral to the cavernous carotids.
No abnormal brain enhancement is seen.
There is somewhat prominent frontal sinuses identified.
Foci of air and linear hyperdensities in the sella, likely expected postoperative changes.
Soft tissue density coursing along the nasal septum with partial opacification of the sphenoid sinuses, also likely post-operative.
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute large territorial infarction.

MRI showed a 2.2cm tumor in his pituitary.
His outside lab work showed resolving hyponatremia but severe hyperglycemia.
They felt that a pituitary macroadenoma seems most probable given the 2.1-cm pituitary mass found on imaging with supra-sellar extension.
On [**4-19**] he continued to complain of frontal headache and fullness so he was started on a course of amoxicillin for presumed sinusitis.
On [**4-20**] a conjunctival swab was performed due to drainage and it grew Group A strep.
There was no definite temporal visual field loss noted in either eye.
Cardiology found him to be at low cardiac risk for surgery.
He was monitored at the ICU level care for concern for SIADH and low urine outputs.
He was started postoperatively on Heparin SC TID on [**4-23**] for DVT prophylaxis.
On [**4-27**] he underwent screening LENIs that demonstrated a Right Peroneal DVT and the patient was started on a Heparin drip at 700 units/hour without bolus for treatment for a bridge to coumadin.
On [**2169-4-28**] when PTT was within therapeutic range a repeat non-contrast Head CT was performed which was stable without evidence of hemorrhage.
He was noted to have a mild nose bleed so his heparin gtt was discontinued and patient was safe to discharge home with PT.
