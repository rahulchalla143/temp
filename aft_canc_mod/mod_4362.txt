Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year old man who was admitted with newly diagnosed pancreatic mass, concerning for malignancy.
The patient had an extensive workup, and a series of attempts at obtaining pathology.
He was aware that his plan, including no planned followup, was not recommended by his [**Hospital 18**] medical team, and noted he was willing to accept the risk associated with his choice.
He was felt to have capacity to make his decisions, on several assessments, lacking signs or symptoms of delirium or encephalopathy.
#Pancreatic Mass / metastatic cancer: Newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer at OSH but not definitive with any biopsies just yet.
He presented to new PCP c/o 2 weeks worse jaundice and new LLE edema which was found to be new DVT.
Obstruction from pancreatic head mass is likely etiology of his jaundice with direct bilirubin in 18 -19 range now.
Metastatic lesions suspected on recent CT both throughout the liver and on RLL area.
He had ERCP x2 and during the second procedure there was significant bleeding following the procedure.
The patient bled 250-500cc during the procedure, and subsequently bled further and required an ICU stay for observation.
His total bilirubin improved daily, although it remained elevated at the time of discharge.
He had some post precudural pain, but was otherwise pt was hemodynamically stable and ready for call out back to the floor.
LLE DVT: Most likely secondary to hypercoaguable state with pancreatic cancer.
Anticoagulation was not restarted after discussion with GI, advanced endoscopy and hematology teams prior to discharge, due to his high bleeding risk.
Diabetes: Longstanding type II DM and he states he has been on Lantus for over 6 months.
Recent weight loss may have impacted his need for Lantus 40 Units which he had taken at home.
[**Month (only) 116**] have changes also due to insulin production impairment due to destruction at level of pancreas from primary malignancy.
Disp:*16 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pancreatic mass with probable metastases Gastrointestinal bleeding, resolved Jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia  Secondary: Left Leg blood Clot Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to [**Hospital1 18**] for referral regarding the management of your newly diagnosed pancreatic tumor with liver masses.
You had a procedure performed called an "Endoscopic Ultrasound" or "EUS" where biopsies of the tumor were taken for tissue identification.
Additionally, you had an "Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography" or "ERCP" performed.
Your biliary ducts were blocked by the mass, and that obstruction from the tumor caused your skin to be yellow, or "jaundiced".
Do not take Aspirin or other blood thinners.
We have given you 4 days of oxycodone, for pain at the drain site.
