Per nightfloat admission History and Physical, the patient states that he initially started experiencing symptoms of dry cough and fatigue at the end of [**Month (only) **].
The patient has been HIV positive since [**2099**], stable until 3 weeks ago when presented to S. [**Hospital **] hospital with fevers and pancytopenia.
He also endorses low grade fever at that time.
His bili, AST/ALT were also mildly elevated.
CT chest/abd was only notable for fatty infiltration of the liver, spenomegaly, and mild atelectasis.
While there, he received multiple transfusions, bone marrow bx preliminary dx was myelodysplasia and he was discharged to home approximately a week ago.
Currently, he states that he is fatigued but otherwise resting comfortably without complaints.

Ext: 1+ dp b/l, no c/c/e Skin: No rashes or other observed lesions.
There are mild degenerative changes seen in the mid thoracic spine.
No priors for comparision  Bone Marrow bx [**2110-8-5**]: hypercellular marrow showing erythro hyperplasia with left shift, myeloid left [**Hospital1 **] shift.
NO evidence of lymphoma.
CD117 focally positive.
GPH-A postive  TTE [**8-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

He had an inital bone marrow biospy at the OSH which was inconclusive.
Leading diagnoses included Ehrlichiosis (so he was started on doxycyline empirically while the test was pending) and parvovirus (for which he received two treatments of IVIG).
During workup for pancytopenia, DIC labs were sent and were negative, as were peripheral smear for schistocytes, as well as hemolysis labs which were consistent with a moderate amount of hemolysis.
Smear for babesia x 3 was negative.
On [**8-28**] the bone marrow biopsy results returned without evidence of parvovirus infection and with evidence of erythroleukemia so he was transferred to the oncology service for initiation of chemotherapy.
# Neutropenic fevers: The patient was intially started on cefepime for his fevers, however ID felt this was not needed and it was stopped.
# SOB/Hypoxia: Likely secondary to anemia versus pulmonary process.
A chest CT in the OSH has shown no airway disease.
He remained only mildly symptomatic on exertion.
On [**8-31**], pt became acutely dyspneic while maintaining his sats.
ABG performed at the time was relatively unchanged from prior, showing a respiratory alkalosis and possibly worsened A-a gradient (PO2 83.)
CXR showed no consolidation/pneumothorax.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he transitioned back to 4LNC, satting 96% with reassurance by his partner and nursing, suggesting a likely anxiety component to his acute SOB, as respiratory rate improved from 40s to high 20s.
Unfortunately, he again became increasingly hypoxic and chest x-ray on [**2110-9-2**] showed rather rapid progression of bilateral parenchymal densities and his respiratory state decompensated to the point of needing intubation and vent dependency.
He also became extremely confused and agitated likely secondary to extreme hypoxic state.
During this time he also had dramatic ARF indicated by rapidly rising BUN/Cr and LDH levels >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**] and markedly rising LFTs indicating rapid multi-system organ failure.
