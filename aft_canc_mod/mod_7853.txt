Admission Date:  [**2185-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-9-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-9-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6701**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath with exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 91176**] is a 58yo female with an unremarkable PMH who presents with one week of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
Pt noted about 1-2 weeks ago increased dyspnea while walking up hills, flights of stairs, and far distances.
Pt occasionally gets a bit dizzy/unbalanced after walking several blocks, having to stop and catch her breath more often.
Pt decided to see her PCP who did an EKG revealing sinus tachycardia at 103 so pt was sent to ER for further w/u.
Pt states she has lost about five pounds over the past several weeks, had decreased appetite, decreased energy, and increased fatigue having to take more frequent naps which pt attributes to the recent heat.
Pt denies any exertional chest pain, increased cough, pleuritic chest pain, syncope, recent confusion, back/joint pain, increased thirst, or change in urination.
Pt did experience some vague burning chest pain across the top of her chest while walking to her PCP's office today.
Labs notable for WBC 13.0 with 84% N and no bands.
The pt had a CXR which demonstrated left upper lobe collapse, and subsequent CT chest w/contrast showed an approximate 4.6cm LUL mass causing complete collapse of the LUL, and concerning for primary lung cancer.
Currently, patient without complaints.
Has been ambulating since arrival to floor, and overall feels dyspnea has been improving over the last few days.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath at rest, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, peripheral edema, occupational exposures, recent travel.
Never married, no children.
Physical Exam: On Admission: VS - Temp F 98.6, BP114/75 , HR67 , RR16 , O2-sat98 % RA GENERAL - pleasant thin woman in NAD, comfortable, appropriate, able to speak in full sentences HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - decreased BS over left apex, otherwise CTA bilat over the posterior lung fields, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - PMI non-displaced, RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs) LYMPH - no cervical or axillary LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-2**] throughout though with possibly 4/5 strength in the LUE on abduction .
IMAGING CXR: Left upper lobe collapse.
Recommend CT evaluation to assess for obstructing lesion.
Mass in the left upper lobe measuring up to 4.6 cm, causing complete collapse of the left upper lobe, most consistent with a primary lung malignancy.
It encases the left pulmonary artery and severely narrows it causing relative oligemia of the left lower lobe when compared to the right lung.
No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 6 mm x 3mm and right lower lobe nodule measuring 2 mm.
Nodularity of the left adrenal gland measuring up to 9 mm, incompletely assessed on this single phase study.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 58yoF, former smoker with no other significant PMH here with DOE for the past week and new mass on CXR/Chest CT concerning for primary lung cancer leading to left upper lobe collapse.
Infectious causes less likely given pt's negative history of exposures or recent travel.
Pt is asymptomatic aside from mild DOE, satting well on room air and while ambulating, however location and size of mass is concerning.
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted who initially felt that a CT-guided biopsy of the mass by Interventional Radiology was preferred so that was arranged for patient as an outpatient.
After discharge, IP decided that the mass could be biopsied via outpatient bronchoscopy, so patient will be notified of this change in plans on Monday.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: (Primary) New lung mass Left upper lobe lung collapse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 91176**],   You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were becoming increasingly short of breath while walking over the past few weeks.
Chest X-ray and CT scan of the Chest showed a mass that has caused collapse of part of your left lung.
Please contact [**Name (NI) 91177**], your nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 778**], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 67596**] if you develop severe shortness of breath or any other troubling symptoms.
