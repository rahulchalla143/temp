No pneumothorax.
There are low lung volumes with probable atelectatic changes at the right base medially.
Bilateral lung volumes remain low.
Right paracardiac opacity presumably from atelectasis is unchanged.
Increased left retrocardiac density representing a left lower lung atelectasis is similar to the prior studies.
Right perihilar opacity has minimally decreased since prior radiograph dated [**2180-9-19**] acquired 6 hours apart suggesting that it was atelectasis.
Left lower lung retrocardiac density suggesting lower lung volume loss is constant.
There are no new lung opacities of concern.
Brief Hospital Course: 77F with grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma, h/o CVA with L hemiplegia, dementia, HTN who underwent open TAH-BSO which was complicated by hypoventilatory respiratory failure and oliguria for which she required an ICU stay, hospital-acquired pneumonia s/p 8 days of levofloxacin, and acute on chronic renal failure.
# Respiratory: Failure to extubate after procedure felt to be [**1-26**] sedating medications given her inital minimal vent settings.
# ?Dysphagia There was a report that the patient required a soft diet at baseline.
# Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine increased from her baseline of 1.1-1.2 up to 1.6 on POD#8.
Nephrology was consulted and her acute on chronic renal failure was thought to be secondary to dehydration.
Her medications may be restarted at that time pending improvement of renal function.
# Stage 1 decubitus ulcer: On admission, she was found to have a stage 1 decubitus ulcer on the left buttock.
# Disposition: At the time of discharge on POD#9, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
She should have close follow up with her primary care doctor within one week of discharge for reevaluation of her renal function and possible resumption of her medications.
