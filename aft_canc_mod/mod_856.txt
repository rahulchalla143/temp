Admission Date:  [**2200-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-6-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain/NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with [**Last Name (un) 2435**] placement Swan ganz catheter placement  History of Present Illness: Patient is an 85 yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI and 3 vessel CABG in [**3-10**] (LIMA ->LAD, SVG -> LAD; D1, SVG -> RCA 40% stenosis per cath in [**2198**]), CKD, bladder cancer with recent transurethral resection of tumor on [**6-9**], complicated by SOB, chest pain, now found to have NSTEMI who presents to the CCU for further management of his ACS.
In brief, pt underwent successful transurethral resection of his bladder tumor on [**6-9**].
However, due to persistent bleeding he was put on CBI.
The patient subsequently suffered a vasovagal episode with SOB, increased 02 requirement, nausea/vomitting, and hypotension.
He was also transfused 2 units PRBCs given his urinary clotting.
However, prior to being transferred to the floor the patient developed SSCP, SOB, and bilateral arm pain.
EKG demonstrated RBBB, inferior STT changes.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient feels well and was chest pain free.
On further review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
In the past he had episode of CP on exertion with dyspnea.

Bladder cancer found [**5-15**] on cystoscopy, s/p transuretheral resection on [**6-9**] 4.
Depression  Social History: Retired [**University/College **] Professor Lives with wife Quit smoking in [**2182**] Former drinker .
Family History: Non-contributory, no history of early CAD .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No bruits appreciated CV: RRR, no m/r/g, nl S1 S2 Chest: Bibasilar crackles noted, no wheezing.
symmetric Abd: Soft, NT/ND + BS, no HSM.
No femoral bruits.
Ext warm and well perfused Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: [**2200-6-9**] Bladder, biopsy: A.  Papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade, with lamina propria invasion.
Muscularis propria is present and is free of tumor.
B.  Urothelial carcinoma in situ.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated a three vessel native CAD.
The LMCA had mild disease with moderate calcification.
The LCx was a non-dominant vessel with a moderate diffuse disease.
The RCA was a dominant vessle with a proximal 90% stenosis at the bifurcation with the AM.
There was mild disease just distal to the touch down site.
Arterial conduit angiography initially could not be performed due to a tight left subclavian occlusion that was likley thrombotic in nature.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 21 mmHg and a PAD pressure of 26 mm Hg.
There was a moderate systemic arterila hypertension with an SBP of 150 mmHg.
Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated creatinine.
There was a hazy 70% distal LAD lesion at the end of the case.
[**2200-6-12**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis, apical akinesis/dyskinesis and mid to distal anterior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal dyskinesis of the apex and  hypokinesis of the distal left ventricle.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No apical thrombus is visualized.
A small filamentous mobile lesion on the aortic valve is present (seen on prior study but not mentioned) which is consistent with probable Lambl's excrescence.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is an 85 yo M with CAD, s/p MI and 3 vessel CABG in [**2194**], CKD, bladder tumor s/p recent transurethral resection c/b [**Hospital 7792**] transferred to the CCU for further care.
Patient with known CAD and previous history of MI now with concerning EKG changes and positive cardiac enzymes.
Patient experienced vasovagal symptoms, n/v and chest pain/arm pain all indicative of ACS.
On the morning after he was transferred to the CCU, the patient complained of [**9-17**] substernal chest pain and chest pressure, with radiation of the pain to his arms bilaterally, in the setting of pain/dysuria at the distal penile urethra.
Also complained of dyspnea, confusion, no lightheadedness or dizziness.
He was treated with morphine, nitro drip, increased O2, and a nebulizer treatment and the pain subsided.
EKG showed new TWI in V2-V5.
He went urgently to the cath lab where he was found to have a large, L subclavian thrombosis resulting in decreased perfusion to the LIMA-LAD graft as well as distal stenosis/haziness of the LAD.
During the remainder of the admission the patient showed no further signs or symptoms of ischemia.
Heparin and coumadin for prevention or LV thrombus was held due to hematuria.
Repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed no sign of ventricular thrombus despite wall motion abnormalities, and given risk of rebleeding from bladder, anticoagulation was held on discharge.
Aspiration Pneumonia.
Patient originally admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with SOB thought to be related to vasovagal episode and possible aspiration event versus asthma exacerabation.
On [**6-10**] the patient was started on broad spectrum levo/flagyl/vanc plan for a total of 14 days due to concern of aspiration pneumonia given setting of fever and leukocytosis.
Anemia: Hct has trended down during admission in the setting of urethral clotting from mid 30s to high 20s from a baseline of 35-40.
Has required 3 units pRBCs with moderate response.
On [**6-14**], a CT of the abdomen and pelvis ruled out a retroperitoneal bleed.
However, CT showed the site of bleeding to be in the bladder - on [**6-14**] 500cc of clot was irrigated by urology.
Heparin and coumadin were held during this episode of active bleeding.
A bladder ultrasound later showed residual tumor in the bladder but no further blood clots.
Change in mental status.
Volume depletion.
He was found to have volume depletion, which resolved with administration of IVF.
The SGC was pulled on [**6-15**] without complication.
Repeat Bladder US showed residual tumor in bladder.
Coumadin and heparin were held in setting of hematuria.
Hyperglycemia: Resolved, No h/o DM, cover with RISS in acute setting.
Patient was discharged to rehabilitation facility with planned cardiac follow-up with his cardiologist at the [**Hospital3 **] and with urology for his bladder resection.
