This was felt to be due to known pleural and pericardial effusions with associated SVT.
At the time of admission, there was no evidence of tamponade or worsening pleural effusion on CXR.
The patient has a history of DVT/PE from earlier this year, but did not have evidence of right heart strain on [**Month/Day/Year 113**], was continued on her home anticoagulation and has an IVC filter in place.
She was treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for a possible CAP and nebs plus short steriod taper as she has a history of asthma.
The patient's shortness of breath responded well to supplemental O2 and low-dose morphine.
The patient is tachycardic at baseline around 115-120.
On the day of admission and again on [**2181-11-18**], the patient had an additionally elevated rate to the 160s.
The patient's tachycardia was thought to be related to her shortness of breath, pleural effusion and advanced disease state.
