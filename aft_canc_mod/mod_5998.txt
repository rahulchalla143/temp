Presented to clinic fatigued, with non-productive cough, but has been afebrile, without evidence of respiratory distress.
Past Medical History:  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: --Presented to ER in [**2114-1-1**] with shortness of breath and  fever secondary to pneumonia.
--Bone marrow biopsy on [**2114-4-26**] showed "hypercellular erythroid  dominant bone marrow with dyserythropoiesis and ringed sideroblast consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome best classified as RARS.
Cycle 2 administered [**Date range (1) 97986**]; delayed by one week  due to neutropenia.
Cycle 3 administered [**Date range (1) 97987**]; again delayed by one week due to neutropenia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: s/p pericarditis 4 years ago Bilateral [**Hospital1 15309**] neuroma h/o migraines that resolved 2 years ago s/p plantar fasciitis L foot s/p shingles s/p multiple skin cancers removed by either dermatologists, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22342**] s/p tonsillectomy.
Skin: very pale, warm, dry, without ecchymosis, erythema, petechiae or rash.
Oropharynx pale  pink, moist, without mucositis, erythema or thrush.
Lungs: breathing easily with occasional dry cough, able to talk  in full sentences; dullness to percussion at L base; diminished  coarse breath sounds at R base with inspiratory and expiratory crackles.
Cardiac: heart rate regular in rate and rhythm, without murmur,  rub or gallop.
Extremities: symmetrical, trace edema bilaterally from feet to mid-calf bilaterally.
No erythema or tenderness.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2114-12-19**]):       Negative for Influenza B.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Collapsed gallbladder with wall edema and small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
These findings could be due to a variery of chronic conditions including hypoalbuminemia, chf, or can be seen in hepatitis.
There is no evidence to suggest acute inflammation.
CXR: [**2114-12-18**] Very severe heterogeneous opacification has developed in the left upper lobe.
Left lower lobe was collapsed in [**Month (only) 1096**], now reexpanded and densely consolidated.
There may be left hilar adenopathy and small left pleural effusion.
Overall, findings are consistent with extensive pneumonia though under the appropriate clinical circumstances, this could be infiltrated malignancy.
Small region of ground-glass opacity in the right apex persists since the chest CT done on [**2114-1-13**].
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung shows some mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe pulmonary edema is playing any role.
-[**2114-12-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknessis is normal.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also comparable and not of sufficient size to suggest empyema.
New tiny right middle lobe lung nodule.
Small pleural and pericardial effusions could be sympathetic to infection, or residual from prior cardiogenic edema  -[**2114-12-27**] CT head No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute intracranial process  -[**2114-12-30**] MRI/MRA Multiple areas of restricted diffusion are seen in both cerebral hemispheres involving frontal, parietal and occipital lobes.
No focal acute infarcts are seen within the posterior fossa.
The distribution is in the watershed region in the left frontal lobe, but otherwise, it is in the cortical and subcortical region of both cerebral hemispheres.
There is no acute hemorrhage identified.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy is seen.
Multiple small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts including infarct in the left frontal watershed distribution as described above.
Mild diffuse decreased signal within the bony structures of the head could be due to marrow hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical correlation recommended.
MRA OF THE NECK: Neck MRA shows normal flow in carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head  -[**2115-1-1**] TTE Bubble Study: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers  -[**2115-1-1**] CSF: WBC: 2 (x2 tubes) TP 28 Gluc 51 LDH 31  -[**2115-1-2**] EEG: Pending at time of discharge  Labs on day of discharge: WBC 4.4 Hct 21.9 Plt 221  Na 138 K 4.3 Cl 109 HCO3 26 BUN 16 Creat 0.7 Gluc 73  ALT 37 AST 81 AP 158 TBil 0.2 Alb 2.0   Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo with myelodysplastic syndrome (RARS), presently D15C5 azacitidine presenting with fever, neutropenia, profound anemia, diarrhea and cough with fever, lung exam concerning for PNA.
Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with profound anemia likely secondary to her MDS.
She developed respitratory distress likely secondary to combined insult of her pneumonia and volume overload for which she triggered.
a CXR showed a Left lower lobe pneumonia.
In the interim, the patient was managed with meropenem, voriconazole, azithromycin, and vancomcyin in the setting of recurrent fevers and night sweats.
MDS/Anemia: She has a history of sideroblastic anemia for which she is on azacitidine.
There was a consideration, given the recurrent fevers and night sweats, that the patient had a hematologic etiology, perhaps transformation to AML.
Altered mental status/right hand-wrist weakness: The patient developed right hand/wrist weakness on [**12-26**].
The patient also developed attention/cognitive deficits.
An MR head was obtained which showed a likely watershed infarct in the left frontal cortex, with multiple focal lesions in both hemispheres.
LP was negative for meningitis.
TTE bubble study was negative for PFO or ASD.
She did have a positive [**Doctor First Name **] with titer pending.
Hepatic US showed Small amount of free perihepatic fluid, collapsed gallbladder with wall edema, and small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
Neutropenic Fever: Her neutropenia was likely secondary to her chemotherapy.
Her neutropenia resolved with periodic dosing of neupogen.
She had had no fevers for 1-2 days prior to discharge.
As her platelet count remained normal, and there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on imaging, SC heparin was given for DVT prophylaxis.

You were found to have a pneumonia treated with antibiotics.
Your breathing initially improved, however your lungs became overloaded with fluid and you went to the intensive care unit.
You coninued to have difficulty with your breathing and continued to have fevers so procedures were done to sample your lung fluid to culture and remove some of the fluid, which did not show obvious infection.
You also developed some mild confusion and right hand weakness, due to a stroke, which was seen on MRI.
