Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness, in brief: 41-year-old male with past medical history of patent foramen ovale s/p closure, PE on lovenox, diastolic CHF, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, on home O2 at 4L NC (although patient states he was on room air prior to admission) initially presented to [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital with 10/10 periumbilical pain associated with nausea, vomiting, worse in the right lower quadrant.
At that time he was found to have an incarcerated hernia on imaging and admitted for open repair of strangulated incisional hernia with mesh placement, with some strangulated bowel requiring resection (end to end connection).
After the procedure he was transfered to the ICU, where he was not able to be extubated for 2 days and apparently developed aspiration pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole).
He developed atrial flutter after which he required both face mask and nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations above 90% and required cardioversion.
Patient had difficulty being weaned of venti-face mask with FiO2 of 50% with 5L NC.
Pulmonary was consulted and thought that the patient had severe pulmonary hypertension and recommended transfer to tertiary care facility for further pulmonary care.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for severe pulmonary hypertension with continued elevated O2 requirements.
He had an A-line placed and a TTE with bubble study, which showed a septal occluder device in place without evidence of atrial septal defect of patent foramen ovale.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with systolic function of EF>75%.
Right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline depressed free wall motion.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A PICC line was placed and a CTA was performed which showed possible chronic pulmonary emboli and patchy ground glass opacities and enlarged lymph nodes.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, bilateral lower extremity swelling, flatus, BM, SOB  (-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

Pulmonary and mediastinal vessels are dilated but there is no pulmonary edema.
Small left pleural effusion may be present.
A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline depressed free wall motion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Tiny filling defects in the distal subsegmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally as detailed above with an eccentric distribution, the imaging findings of which are consistent with chronic pulmonary emboli; however, the chronicity of this finding cannot be definitively ascertained due to which an acute process is not entirely excluded.
Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, left greater than right, stable since [**2143-11-3**], could represent an inflammatory/infectious process.
Increased size of main pulmonary artery measuring 3.7 cm consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Small hiatal hernia.
Small amount of fluid in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen with nonvisualization of spleen, correlate for history of splenectomy.
Mild fatty infiltration of liver.
[**2144-1-19**] RUQ U/S: Anterior abdominal wall paramedian fluid collections at the superior aspect of the incisional scar measuring up to 7.6 cm on the right and 7.4 cm on the left.
Brief Hospital Course: 41M with pulmonary hypertension, history of recurrent PE, diastolic CHF, and s/p PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, with persistent hypoxia likely secondary to pulmonary hypertension.
The likely etiology was pneumonia, volume overload and pulmonary hypertension.
The pneumonia was treated with an 8 day course of vancomycin and zosyn.
Finally the patient was treated for pulmonary hypertension (as below).
The patient did well initially but then developed increased sputum and an increase oxygen requirement and was transferred to the MICU.
The patient continued to have a cough with mimimal sputum production.
He had chest PT, acapella valve and incentive spirometry.
Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension.
The likely etiology is from chronic thromboembolic disease which was worsened from volume overload.
Will need follow up with a pulmonologist as an outpatient and a pulmonary hypertension specialist.
Abdominal wound: Due to recent repair of encarcerated hernia and bowel resection.
The abdominal wound is open and draining serosangiunous fluid at the distal edge of the wound.
Surgery has evaluated the wound and states that it does not appear to be infected and to continue daily dressings with gauze.
Also worrisome for intraabdominal pathology around wound site.
The patient remained afebrile and clinically did not look infected.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
No evidence of infection on recent cultures.

Ventilator associated pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis:   Discharge Condition: .
Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital after an abdominal surgery.
At that time you were found to be hypoxic and requiring oxygen.
You will need to follow up with a pulmonologist as an outpatient as it appears you have pulmonary hypertension.
For further evaluation and management of your pulmonary hypertension it is very important for you to go to your appointments.
