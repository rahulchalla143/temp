With re-challenge, nausea returned and developed a diffuse maculopapular pruritic skin eruption with hives, flushing, intense itching.
Also developed diarrhea and tachycardia.
Nausea was still not well controlled with Emend, and patient has hx of adverse rxns to zofran and compazine.
Reaction was not considered to be anaphylactic in nature and patient had no respiratory symptoms or airway compromise.
Notes that she has some nausea (always has nausea these days), diarrhea, pain in both knees and back, and numbness in her toes only.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGY HISTORY: -- [**2098-7-7**] when she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon at the splenic flexure.
Pathology showed low-grade adenocarcinoma of the colon with 10 of 17 pericolic lymph nodes being positive in the left colon.
-- From [**6-/2098**]--[**1-/2099**] she received adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX which was complicated by severe neuropathy, minor PORT problems and nausea.
-- [**2099-7-28**] her CT torso showed no evidence of disease.
-- [**2100-3-16**] CT abdomen that showed 4 solid appearing lesions w/in the liver consistent w/metastatic disease.
This procedure was aborted d/t difficult sedation and another biopsy was not attempted.
-- [**2100-7-9**] Colonoscopy demonstrated submucosal prominence with overlying ulceration with some slight kinking of the edges, status post biopsy, very worrisome for malignancy at 20 cm.
Pathology showed multiple foci of adenocarcinoma consistent with the patient's known adenocarcinoma of the colon.
-- [**2100-7-27**] CT showed a 4cm hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the liver and a second hypodense lesion which measures 3.1cm in size.
There is an exophytic 2.5cm hypodense lesion along the inferior liver margin anteriorly which is new from previous study.
There is a probable new 1.8cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver.
There is a probable nodular 1cm lesion anteriorly in the left lobe of the liver.
-- [**2100-8-11**] she was seen in consultation with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and tentatively planned for colon resection, Right lobectomy, segmental liver resection, IOUS, and resection of prior ileosigmoid anastomosis on [**2100-8-27**].
A pre-operative CT torso was done [**2100-8-11**] and again showed unchanged liver lesions (when compared to [**7-28**] study), unchanged pelvic adenopathy and no new interval lesions.
-- [**2100-8-23**] whole body PET-CT on which demonstrated PET-Avid intrabdominal disease.
Additionally, the PET identified focal FDG uptake in the left humeral head has an SUV max of 5.47, without a definite anatomic correlate.
There is no cortical disruption at this site.
No other abnormal FDG avidity is present in the skeleton or soft tissues.
-- [**2100-8-29**] MRI shoulder: An 8-mm lesion in the left proximal humerus, concerning for metastasis.
-- [**2100-9-13**] PORT placed and C1D1 FOLFIRI, no avastin with cycle 1 due to recent PORT.
-- [**2100-10-13**] C2D1 FOLFIRI-Avastin -- [**2100-10-25**] C2D15 FOLFIRI-Avastin -- [**2100-11-8**] C3D1 FOLFIRI-Avastin -- [**2100-12-1**] CT Torso: No evidence of disease progression.

No intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation is noted.
Bilateral kidneys show no evidence of solid masses or hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: 1) Innumerable masses in the liver consistent with metastatic disease.
No evidence of biliary obstruction; patent portal vein.
There is no obvious break in the length of the catheter.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
There is no edema, infiltrate or other acute process identified.
IMPRESSION:  There is no obvious break in the port catheter that can be visualized on plain film.
In addition, prn lorazepam was given for anxiety as well as nausea.
During initiation, patient was noted to have a fever to 101.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent, which were ultimately negative, as was a CXR, which was negative for cardiopulmonary process.
There was low suspicion for infection, and was thought to be drug related.
Overnight during escalation of dosing challenge, patient became acutely tachycardic to the 150s although remained normotensive.
Thereafter, patient was found to have a 20 beat run of wide complex ventricular tachycardia while having a bowel movement, and was again tachycardic to the 130s, for which she received another liter of fluid bolus.
# Chronic back pain: In order to better monitor vital signs, patient's home vicodin was held in favor of oxycodone for pain control.
# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with a leukocytosis as noted on relevant laboratory studies.
This was attributed to chronic steroid use, as the patient denied constitutional symptoms.
# Mild transaminitis: Patient presented with mild transaminitis, likely secondary to chemotherapy.
RUQ U/S was performed which suggested that transaminitis was most likely secondary to known extensive metastatic disease and no acutely reversible cause of obstruction, inflamation, or infection.
# Chronic diarrhea: Patient complained of chronic diarrhea.
