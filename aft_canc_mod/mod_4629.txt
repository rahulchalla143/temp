Admission Date:  [**2161-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-7-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21193**] Chief Complaint: left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right frontal craniotomy for excision of mass  History of Present Illness: 85 year-old right-handed woman with a histor of renal cell CA s/p L nephrectomy in [**2149**] who presented on [**6-13**] to an OSH after a fall as well as with left sided weakness.
Over the last 8 months she has noted increasing difficulty with her balance and the continual worsening of left sided weakness.
On [**6-13**], she fell in her garage and was taken to an OSH by her neighbor where a [**Name (NI) 72787**] showed a right intracerebral bleed with edema.
She denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Past Medical History: PMHx: CAD, HLP, DM (diet controlled), HTN, osteoporosis, renal cell carcinoma s/p left nephrectomy on [**2149-9-9**], vertigo  Social History: smoked for two years in her 20s, no EtOH or illicit drugs.
2 sons  Family History: all 5 siblings died of some sort of cancer including "blood" cancer, breast and lung.
No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal bulk and tone on R with mildly decreased tone on L. No abnormal movements, tremors.
On Discharge: AOx3, following commands, speech intact Right upper and lower extremity weakness more pronounced: Right upper extremity [**2-21**] throughout Right lower extremity 3-4/5 throughout   Pertinent Results: [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   WBC-7.5 RBC-3.49* HGB-11.8* HCT-35.5* MCV-102* MCH-34.0* MCHC-33.4 RDW-16.8* [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   PLT COUNT-150 [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   PT-12.0 PTT-21.0* INR(PT)-1.0  MRI [**2161-6-14**]: Enhancement of dominant right posterior frontal lesion, with extensive surrounding white matter edema.
Taken together, these findings are of concern for a neoplastic process, either metastatic or primary in origin.
Other lesions relating to the right lateral ventricular choroid plexus and posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe are not as characteristic for neoplastic disease, though this etiology is not entirely excluded.
1.6 cm Left upper lobe mass within the perihilar area abutting the major fissure, concerning for malignancy.
Atelectasis within the posterior left  upper lobe distal to this likely represents post-obstructive atelectasis or infection.
Biopsy of the central nodule by bronchoscopy could be considered.
4 mm lateral right middle lobe nodule, which is indeterminate.
Left thyroid lobe hypodense nodule.
Left breast mass concerning for breast cancer or metastasis.
Status post left nephrectomy.
No mass within the surgical bed to suggest metastasis or recurrence.
Spongiform left lower lobe thyroid nodule, which could be followed in one year time to evaluate for stability.
Bone Scan [**2161-6-17**]: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Unchanged right frontal mass lesion with associated vasogenic edema.
The functional MRI, demonstrates areas of activation at more than 5 mm from the mass lesion during the movement of the left hand.
The dominance for the language apparently is located on the left cerebral hemisphere with activation areas in the left operculum.
Post op CT head [**2161-6-24**]: Interval resection of a right frontal lesion via a right craniotomy, with expected postoperative changes, and no evidence of new hemorrhage or large vascular territorial infarction.
Intrinsic T1 hyperintensity is present within the surgical cavity, likely representing postoperative blood products and proteinaceous material.
There is a thin rim of peripheral enhancement which is likely related to postoperative change and also corresponds with a thin rim of restricted diffusion, likely representing postoperative change(although residual tumor in this thin rim of enhancement cannot be excluded).
With the exception of local mass effect, there is no mass effect upon the lateral  ventricles or shift of midline structures.
The surrounding white matter edema is stable compared with the preoperative study.
Minimal volume of pneumocephalus overlying the right frontal lobe.
Stable changes of atrophy (NPH may have this appearance) and likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Neurology:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo F who was admitted to the neurology service on [**2161-6-14**] for progressive L sided weakness, found on MRI to have a R frontal mass on MRI most consistent with a metastasis, especially given the patient's history of RCC.
Over the next few days, she [**Date Range 1834**] various tests as part of a metastatic workup including a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone scan, and thyroid ultrasound.
She was found to have two lung nodules, a thyroid mass as well as a breast mass in addition to her brain lesion.
She was seen in consultation by radiation oncology and neuroncology who felt that a resection of the mass would give the best information as to the source of the metastasis.
For this she was planned to undergo resection of the mass on [**2161-6-21**], however, during the preparation for the OR, the brainlab guidance system malfunctioned and the operation was aborted.
After surgery, the previous weakness in her left upper extremity was acutely worsened and was plegic with persistent weakness in her left lower extremity.
Given the proximity of her lesion to the motor areas of the brain and her preoperative weakness, this was not an unexpected short term complication and function of the left leg and arm should improve over time.
She was able to eat and her pain was well controlled on oral medications.
She will also follow-up next week to get a biopsy of her breast mass, though it is not lkely to be related to the renal cell cancer.
Oncology:  As noted above, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a resenction of her mass on [**6-21**].
Preliminary pathology reveals that this is most likely representative of metastasis from her renal cell carcinoma.
A CT torso revealed masses in her LUL and RML of her lungs, a nodule in her thyroid and a small mass in her breast.
A biopsy of her LUL nodule was considered, but after consultation with both interventional [**Month (only) **] and interventional pulmonology, it was deemed too risky to go after as it was near the hilum.
The thyroid mass was felt to be most likely consistent with a colloid cyst and thought to be benign after an ultrasound was obtained and reviewed with [**Month (only) **].
In discussion with the oncology service, it was felt that the breast mass was likely unrelated and that her PCP could [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u it up in the future.
As this appeared to be consistent with a macrocytic anemia (MCV ~100), she was tested for methylmalonic acid, B12 and folate which were all normal.
However, because of the drop, hematology was consulted and felt that this anemia was most likely related to anemia of chronic disease, though myelodysplastic syndrome could not be ruled out.
Concerned about the formation of HIT antibodies, her heparin was stopped and she was switched to fondaparinaux for DVT prophylaxis.
ID:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has remained afebrile during her admission.
She is currently on a course of keflex for her scalp incision and will complete treatment on [**7-6**].
She is being dosed every eight hours for renal-based dosing.
FEN/GI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a history of renal insufficiency.
Around [**6-26**], her potassium levels began to slowly increase to a peak of 5.4  Renal was curbsided who felt this was likely due to the heparin flush as that is a known effect of heparin.
Her BUN has been elevated, which is thought to be secondary to steroids.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had an acute onset of left sided weakness.
After a thorough evaluation, it appears that this weakness was due to a mass in the right frontal lobe of your brain.
This mass appears to be consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
You also have masses in your lungs that are likely to be related.
You also appear to have a mass in your thyroid and breast that are not likely to be related to the renal cell carcinoma.
We will set up an appointment for you to have the breast mass biopsied.
Your thyroid mass is likely a benign mass called a colloid cyst.
It is important that you continue to drink plenty of fluids as your kidney function appears to be consistent with mild dehydration.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
You will need to have a biopsy of the mass in your breast.
