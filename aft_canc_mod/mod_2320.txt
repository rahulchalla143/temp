Admission Date:  [**2106-2-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-2-19**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of advanced prostate cancer who presented with obstructive jaundice from external lymph node compression.
The patient has had frequent nausea and vomiting and was sent for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 69**], status post duodenal stenting today at the proximal common bile duct, and internal and external biliary drain placement.
The patient was transferred to the floor after the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for observation.
He reports that he felt fine without nausea or vomiting, with no appetite and mild abdominal pain.
He complained of bilateral lower extremity swelling that was known to be chronic, but was otherwise free of complaints.
Prostate cancer with diffuse metastatic disease; duodenal and biliary stents in place.
Recently complicated by obstructive jaundice.
Lower extremity edema secondary to lymphadenopathy.
Gastric gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of transient ischemic attack.
History of inferior vena cava stent placement in [**2105-12-12**] due to compressive lymphadenopathy.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed he had scleral icterus.
He had no lymphadenopathy, and no bruits, and no elevation in jugular venous pressure.
There was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best in the axilla.
The abdomen was mildly distended and mildly tender diffusely.
Extremities revealed 3+ pitting edema and stasis dermatitis (right greater than left).
He had no clear cranial nerve deficits.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient had emesis on the early morning of [**2106-2-13**] with frequent blood clots.
Throughout this event, the patient denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations.
Before the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, he had an upper gastrointestinal study which revealed an obstructed duodenal stent.
A Gastroenterology consultation felt that the upper gastrointestinal bleeding was likely due to the instrumentation and an ulceration in the region of the duodenal stent which was stable and did not require any treatment.
His nausea persisted, and the patient continued to have emesis with scant blood and stable hematocrits.
The patient became increasingly fatigued, and further interventions were discussed with the interventional radiologists and gastrointestinal consultants to evaluate the best treatment for the duodenal obstruction.
The patient's primary oncologist was called to discuss indications for further treatment who reported that the patient's ketoconazole and hydrocortisone were used as palliative measures and that the patient understood from previous conversations that there was no further treatment available.
The patient had repeated hypotension to the 70s, mentating well, which improved to the 90s to 100 with a 1-liter intravenous fluid bolus.
Repeat lower extremity Doppler studies revealed that the right-sided deep venous thrombosis was still present, and there was great concern over how to manage this best given the patient's need for anticoagulation, concern for pulmonary embolism given the presence of the deep venous thrombosis, unlikely benefit of an inferior vena cava filter, and the persistent inability for the patient take oral intake well and get adequate nutrition in the context of severe worsening metastatic disease.
The patient discussed plans of care and determined that he wanted to go home to focus his care on comfort rather than painful treatment with unknown benefit or increased duration of life span.
Obstructive jaundice.
Morphine 20 mg/mL solution as needed (for pain or shortness of breath).
