Patient presented electively on [**12-14**] for stereotactic brain biopsy of his right frontal lesion.
On the evening on [**12-15**] he grew increasingly confused and agitated, and was likely sundowning.
He became increasingly difficult to arouse on [**12-16**] in the evening, and a head CT was obtained which demosntrated no acute change.
Over the weekend on [**12-17**] and [**12-18**], his mental status remained confused and agitated.
A chest XRay was repeated, and given his WBC count to 19, coarse lung sounds, and fever, it was thought that the patient likely had a pneumonia.
In the afternoon he developed increasing respiratory distress and tachnypnea.
Overnight he developed hypotension therefore he was tranferred to the MICU.

Redemonstration of right frontal and left parietal enhancing lesions with resultant surrounding edema, most likely representing metastatic disease however also could represent lymphoma.
No evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Mild pneumocephalus in the region around the biopsy of the right frontal lobe mass.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
CXR [**12-16**]: No acute process  CXR [**12-17**]: Lungs are clear.
LENIS: No evidence of DVT.
CXR [**12-29**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase in extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion.
As a consequence, the left retrocardiac atelectasis, resulting in lung parenchymal consolidation, has also slightly increased.
Otherwise, there is no relevant parenchymal change.
Brief Hospital Course: Neurosurgical Course as above in HPI ==================================== MICU Course [**Date range (1) 88219**] # Hypotension: Patient was thought to be hypovolemic from pneumonia as well as diuresis in the step down unit.
# Brain Lesions: Pathology result of brain biopsy revealed B cell lymphoma.
They also recommended consulting neuro-oncology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] for further treatment options which will likely include MTX and XRT.
Patient was initially deferred for MTX because of pleural effusion noted on CXR.
# PNA: given leukocytosis, fever, and increased work of breathing with LLL infiltrate on CXR consistent with PNA.
Possibly aspiration given poor MS on other services.
Leukocytosis trended down and tachypnea resolved.
This was thought [**1-18**] infection, hypotension, and underlying brain lesions.
His MS improved with IVF and resolution of his hypotension although he still remained somewhat disoriented, worsening at night.
======================================= OMED Course: 85 yo M with hx of Emphysema, A Fib presenting with confusion, found to have diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the brain.
Hospital stay complicated by delirium, LLL PNA, hypotension and respiratory distress requiring transfer to MICU.
# DLBC CNS Lymphoma: Patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of right frontal lesion on [**12-14**] showing DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.
CSF flow cytometry showed non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile.
He was transferred to Medicine-Oncology service for initiation of methotrexate therapy, which he received [**2168-12-27**] and tolerated well except for mild mucositis.
# L Pleural Effusion: Likely transudative in setting of receiving IV hydration with MTX protocol.
Patient remained afebrile, without leukocytosis.
# Anemia: Normocytic.
No signs of bleeding.
Likely a component of hemodilution secondary to IVFs.
Also likely marrow suppression from recent illness as retic count was 1.0.
# Transaminitis: Likely secondary to methotrexate therapy.
Patient had no right upper quadrant pain.
There was no new medications coinciding with the transaminase elevation.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Resolved.
Coumadin was discontinued secondary to bleeding risk after brain biopsy.
# LLL PNA: Received 9 days of Vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration/healthcare-associated pneumonia.
# Diarrhea: Resolved.
Occurred likely secondary to antibiotics, and improved once they were discontinued.

Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted for evaluation of increasing confusion, underwent a brain biopsy that showed lymphoma (a type of cancer), and received methotrexate chemotherapy.
During your admission you were treated for a pneumonia, as well as a kidney injury.
