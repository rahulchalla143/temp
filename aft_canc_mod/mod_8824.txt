Since her recent discharge, patient reports worsening BLE edema, weight gain of 2lbs, and worsening DOE, orthopnea (now sleeping on couch because her breathing is better) and cough.
On day of admission, patient was seen by her PCP with above complaints as well as reports of single episode blood streaked sputum, and single episode of non-positional non-exertional L shoulder pain that resolved with tramadol at home.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was afebrile with normal and stable vital signs.
Exam was significant for crackles throughout lungs.
CXR demonstrated enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Bedside echo performed by ED staff demonstrated pericardial effusion and cardiology consult was obtained.
On evaluation by consult, bedside TTE demonstrated large circumferential pericardial effusion without ventricular diastolic collapse.
Given hemodynamic stability, patient was scheduled for AM pericardiocentesis and admitted to CCU for further monitoring  Past Medical History: # Dyslipidemia # Hypertension # Nonischemia Cardiomyopathy # Systolic CHF -- LVEF 15-20% by TTE [**2127-1-17**] # Mitral regurgitation -- Mild to moderate [[**12-8**]+] (TTE [**2127-1-17**])  # Tricuspid regurgitation -- Severe [4+] (TTE [**2127-1-17**]) # Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (TTE [**2127-1-17**]) # Cardiac catheterization ([**2108**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]) -- reportedly with clean coronaries # Complete heart block -- AICD, PPM, anticoagulated with Coumadin -- PPM placed originally in [**2112**], then repaired in [**2114**] and [**2115**]  # Osteoporosis # GERD  Social History: # Home: Lives with her son on the [**Location (un) 448**] of an apartment building.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen: START Allopurinol 100mg every day (for elevated uric acid levels in your blood) STOP Simvastatin (because your liver tests are elevated) STOP Hydralazine (because your blood pressure is low) STOP Isosorbide dinitrate (because your blood pressure is low) STOP Spironalactone (because your kidney function is not normal) Decrease Amiodarone to 100mg daily (take [**12-8**] your 200mg pill)  You should resume your Coumadin tonight ([**2127-10-29**]).
