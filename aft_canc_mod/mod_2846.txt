Admission Date:  [**2164-7-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-7-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with history of CAD with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25%, CHF, recurrent VT s/p ICD placement, who presented to OSH with worsening shortness of breath and SVT with ventricular rates in the 110s.
The patient has a pacemaker, the settings of which have been changed from DDI to DDD after he was noted to have complete heart block.
Over the past two weeks, he was noted to have worsening orthopnea, shortness of breath at rest and exertion, and lower extremity edema.
He presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-4**] with these complaints after his VNA noticed increased dyspnea on exertion at home; at [**Hospital1 **] he got a repeat echo which showed worsened valve area to 0.7 and EF worsened to 25%.
He was noted to have episodes of paroxysmal SVT with ventricular rates ~110s.
Review of systems: He does not have any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, no abdominal pain.
The patient does have a significant cardiac history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and known ejection fraction of 2%, and also mitral regurgitation and aortic incompetence and aortic stenosis.
Past Medical History: (1) CAD status post MI (2) CHF  w/ AR, MR, echo today showing EF 25% (worsened compared to [**12-11**]) (3) ischemic cardiomyopathy, right bundle branch block with fascicular block, question of complete heart block, recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
(4) prostate cancer (5) arthritis   Social History:  nonsmoker.
Family History: Unremarkable   Physical Exam: VS: BP 84/50, HR 98, temp 98.9, O2 sat 94% 2L Gen: Pleasant, elderly male, hard of hearing, in no apparent distress Neck: JVP not significantly elevated, supple Cardiac: difficult to appreciate heart sounds, S1/S2 noted, no murmur evident Resp: mild rales at lung bases Abd: obese, nontender, tympanic abdomen Ext: 1+ ankle edema bilaterally Neuro: A+O X 3, moving all extremities   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2164-7-4**] 06:41PM BLOOD WBC-9.1 RBC-3.86* Hgb-11.5* Hct-35.7* MCV-93 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.3 RDW-15.7* Plt Ct-190 [**2164-7-4**] 06:41PM BLOOD PT-16.1* PTT-41.4* INR(PT)-1.4* [**2164-7-4**] 06:41PM BLOOD Glucose-145* UreaN-22* Creat-1.2 Na-141 K-4.0 Cl-110* HCO3-21* AnGap-14 [**2164-7-4**] 06:41PM BLOOD ALT-78* AST-66* AlkPhos-133* TotBili-0.4 [**2164-7-4**] 06:41PM BLOOD Calcium-7.4* Phos-2.7 Mg-1.8 .
[**2164-7-5**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**11-16**] %).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate aortic stenosis.
There is interval development of pulmonary edema, moderate accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The previously demonstrated tortuous descending aorta is less seen on the current study most likely due to oblique position of the patient.

# Acute on Chronic Systolic congestive Heart Failure EF: 10%: Trigger is likely secondary to SVT with 1:1 ventricular tracking worsening underlying systolic dysfunction leading to pulmonary edema.
Echo was done and AS classified as moderate with valve area 1.0-1.2.
Symptoms improved prior to discharge, not pt has no peripheral edema or crackles on exam.
# Hypotension - Has low BPs are baseline apparently.
Would have high tolerance for BP's in 80's-90's as long as patient is not symptomatic.
EKG does not show any evidence of active ischemia.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy - EF of [**11-16**]%.
Has ICD in place secondary to recurrent VT in setting of low EF.
# Arthritis - continue prednisone and salsalate, treated by outpatient PCP.
#  Depression - continue fluoxetine and perphenazine .
#  Prostate cancer - Gets monthly leupron injections.
