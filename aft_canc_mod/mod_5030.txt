2)Cxray ([**6-21**]): New bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusion.
The lung volumes are slightly increased.
There is no pneumothorax identified.
Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis.
Superimposed infectious consolidation is likely.
Interval development of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung, concerning for an infectious process.
The differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral, fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections.
Drug toxicity would be a consideration, although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings.
New jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding, most likely reflecting an infectious etiology.
Overall stability in metastatic burden.
4)ECHO ([**6-25**]):Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function.
Mild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation.
5)L femur xray ([**6-25**]): Predominantly sclerotic lesion with interval periosteal new bone formation involving the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions.
No displaced fracture is demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 68174**] 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on  Sutent since [**12/2198**], admitted with fever, hypoxemia, and bibasilar pneumonia.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities, suggestive of an underlying infectious process.
2) Metastatic RCC: Sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection.
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden.
Patient was also found to have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement therapy.
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck.
He underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture.
Likely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): Take as necessary for constipation.
4)During your hospital stay you were also found to have low thyroid hormone levels.
6)If you experience any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or any other concerning symptoms please return to the emergency department.
