Admission Date: [**2132-2-27**]        Discharge Date: [**2132-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-3-30**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old man who is undergoing a preoperative evaluation for a laryngeal tumor biopsy.
During a routine evaluation he had electrocardiogram changes that lead him to a stress test which was positive and then lead to cardiac catheterization that showed two vessel disease with a 70 percent left anterior descending coronary artery lesion, a 90 percent diagonal lesion and 100 percent circumflex coronary artery lesion and an ejection fraction of 50 percent.
The patient had his laryngeal biopsy followed by six weeks of radiation therapy and returned as a postoperative admit for coronary artery bypass grafting.
He underwent an echocardiogram in [**2131-7-12**] that showed near 55 percent with mild mitral regurgitation and mild inferior wall hypokinesis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular accident in [**2131-5-12**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, second degree heart block, coronary artery disease, laryngeal cancer status post radiation therapy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant for appendectomy and laryngeal biopsy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for a father who had an myocardial infarction in his 80s.
General, in no acute distress.
Skin is without lesions.
Neck is supple with a soft mass on the front of his neck, no lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Heart, S1 and S2 with an S4, no murmur, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema or varicosities.
Additionally, the patient had a resection of an aortic valve lesion which turned out to be consistent with Lambl's excrescence.
On postoperative day Number 2, the patient had atrial fibrillation which he was successfully cardioverted out of.
Additionally, the patient was begun on heparin for his atrial fibrillation.
He was noted to have intermittent periods of atrial fibrillation.
The decision was made at that time to keep the patient in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit as it was anticipated that the patient would need a pacemaker prior to discharge given his slow ventricular response after cardioversion.
Once on the floor, the patient was progressing slowly from his coronary artery bypass grafting as well as pacemaker placement, when on postoperative day Number 6 from coronary artery bypass graft and day Number 1 from pacemaker placement, he was noted to have bloody stool.
The colonoscopy showed two benign appearing polyps that were nonbleeding as well as internal hemorrhoids and multiple nonbleeding diverticula in the sigmoid colon.
The patient did not undergo polypectomy at that time as he was somewhat anticoagulated due to his atrial fibrillation.
He remained hemodynamically stable and on postoperative day Number 10, it was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing care.
Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm, sternum is stable, incision with staples, without erythema or drainage.
Abdomen is soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm with no edema.
Left leg incision from endoscopic harvest site with Steri-Strips clean and dry.
Left shoulder incision from pacemaker implantation with Steri-Strips, clean and dry with dry sterile dressing.
Second degree heart block status post permanent pacemaker, Medtronics Sigma STR303.
Status post gastrointestinal bleed and colonoscopy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Laryngeal carcinoma status post radiation therapy.
Transient ischemic attack.
