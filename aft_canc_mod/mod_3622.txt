He awoke at midnight with generalized left chest pain and diaphoresis.
He denied visual symptoms, loss of sensation, limb weakness, and loss of balance.
He denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, [**Last Name (LF) 75966**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] new neurological symptoms, and any new muskuloskeletal symptoms.
T3N2 squamous cell carcinoma of the left main stem bronchus diagnosed [**11-21**].
The initial tumor was a large, necrotic, friable mass that completely occluded the left mainstem bronchus; it was associated with left lung collapse and bilateral hilar and right paratracheal adenopathy.
Post-obstructive pneumonia [**11-21**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Pneumonia [**11-21**].

In the pneumonectomy bed, there is heterogeneous fluid which nearly fills the cavity as well as a small amount of residual air.
Within this hemorrhage there are several blood-fluid levels both in the intrapleural and extrapleural spaces in the left hemithorax, generally seen in the setting of anticoagulation.
The hemorrhagic fluid extends into the left lateral chest wall, as well.
The post- contrast images demonstrate no area of active extravasation, specifically, related to either the bronchial arteries, or along the chest wall and the projected course of the intercostal vessels.
There is a small non-hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Suture material is seen in the left hemithorax, where there has been resection of the left pulmonary artery.
The main and right pulmonary arteries and their major segmental branches are clear without evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is no area of consolidation.
There is no right pleural effusion.
Heterogeneous, predominantly high-density fluid within the left pneumonectomy resection cavity, consistent with a prominent component of acute hemorrhage.
This in conjunction with the reversal of the previously seen leftward mediastinal shift suggests that the volume of fluid has increased substantially since one day ago, due to acute bleeding.
No acute bleeding source identified at the pneumonectomy margins.
However, the presence of blood/fluid levels at time of presentation is suggestive of underlying anticoagulation (or coagulopathy).
No right-sided or central PE.
Non-aggressive appearing lesion in the left humeral head, incompletely imaged, which may represent an enchondroma.
ECHO [**2151-3-26**] IMPRESSION: Small loculated pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 75909**] was admitted on [**2151-3-26**] for a syncopal episode at home.
A Chest CT was done and revealed heterogeneous, predominantly high-density fluid within the left pneumonectomy resection cavity, consistent with a prominent component of acute hemorrhage.
He was transferred to the SCIU for monitoring and remained stable.
He was seen by endocrinology and cardiology and neurology for his syncopal episode.
No definite cause for his syncopal episode was found.
He had no further episodes while hospitalized.
