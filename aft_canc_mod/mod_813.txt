Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Patient's physical exam on admission is as follows:  Vitals: T=97.8, BP=159/59, P=97, R=16, SpO2=98%RA Gen: NAD, AAOx3 HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no LAD CVS: RRR, no MRG Pulm: CTA bilaterally, no CRW Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS Ext: no CCE, warm/dry with good cap refill Neuro: no focal deficits, CN 2-12 grossly intact  Pertinent Results: [**2158-10-16**] 04:47PM   WBC-22.4*# RBC-3.82* HGB-10.4* HCT-31.2* MCV-82# MCH-27.3# MCHC-33.4 RDW-16.9* [**2158-10-16**] 04:47PM   GLUCOSE-140* UREA N-22* CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-5.0 CHLORIDE-109* TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-12 [**2158-10-16**] 04:47PM   PT-17.3* PTT-34.2 INR(PT)-1.9 [**2158-10-16**] 04:47PM   PLT COUNT-238 [**2158-10-16**] 04:47PM BLOOD Glucose-140* UreaN-22* Creat-1.3* Na-141 K-5.0 Cl-109* HCO3-25 AnGap-12  Pathology Examination #[**-4/3312**] [**2158-10-16**] DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Mediastinal pleura (AA): Lung parenchyma with chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
No malignancy identified.
"Part of thymus and anterior mediastinum" (A-E): Adipose tissue with focal collection of macrophages, many ladened with carbon pigment.
Endobronchial tumor (F): Non-small cell carcinoma (see synopsis).
4R, node (G-H): One lymph node, no malignancy identified.
Uninvolved lung shows collapse with hemorrhage and chronic inflammation.
Evidence of viscus perforation with free air seen in the right lower quadrant.
Fat stranding and a small amount of free fluid are also seen in the right lower quadrant.
There is possible pneumatosis of the cecum.
Findings are consistent with a perforated cecum likely due to ischemia.
Scattered diverticula seen throughout the remainder of the colon without frank diverticulitis.
There is also distention of the ascending and transverse colons.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is a small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2158-9-15**], there has been no significant change.
Slight increase in the size of the left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
His course in the MICU was significant for afib/flutter which was controlled with verapamil and quinidine.
However, on POD#7, patient was noted to have A-fib and was started on quinidine 324mg (1.5 tabs PO Q8hrs), a heparin drip and coumadin for anticoagulation.
Furthermore, on POD#7, patient began having changes in mental status, complaining of abdominal pain and distention and had need of increased fluids.
Despite having a completely benign exam and a white blood cell count within normal, he did have an elevated creatinine and lowered systolic blood pressure.
An abdominal CT showed free air within the right upper quadrant with significant inflammation/stranding about the cecum/appendix and questionable distention of the right colon.
His abdominal exam also worsened at that point and general surgery was concerned about possible a perforated appendix, colonic ischemia secondary to the A-fib, or a perforation secondary to [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome; an exploratory laparotomy was suggested and discussed with the family who agreed and wished to proceed.
On [**2158-10-25**] patient underwent the exploratory laparotomy but was found to have no gross evidence of perforation.
It is believed that the patient suffered a microperforation resulting in free air but which had subsequently healed.
On [**2158-10-28**], patient was assessed for nutritional requirements and found to need TPN which was started that day.
Radiology for concerns of aspiration while attending to the patient's nutritional requirements; TPN was discontinued on [**2158-10-31**] and patient was moved to the floor.
This was discussed with EPS who recommended that the patient be switched to amiodarone 400mg PO QD and be seen at his Rehab facility this week by Cardiology for possible AICD interrogation and further management.
