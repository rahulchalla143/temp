Admission Date:  [**2121-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-11-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Tetracyclines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**] Chief Complaint: Resection of left upper lobe cancer.
History of Present Illness: 65M h/o CAD s/p CABG, Dil Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (EF<20%), DM, HTN, PAF, s/p [**Hospital1 **]-v ICD explantation/reimplantation due to MSSA admitted for LUL SCLC wedge resection.
Past Medical History: Dil Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (EF<20%), CAD s/p CABG, s/p [**Hospital1 **]-v ICD explantation/reimplantation due to MSSA, DM with Triopathy, Anemia, NSCLC, PVD, CRI, HTN, Insomnia/Depression, Hypothyroid, PAF/Flutter s/p Ablation, H/O Endocarditis, COPD, Gout, Cirrhosis/Ascites (CT in [**7-18**]).
CXR ([**2121-9-22**]): Increased left lower lobe opacities with left costophrenic angle blunting, suggesting pneumonia vs. atelectasis with adjacent pleural effusion.
Mild pHTN.
pMIBI ([**2121-7-22**]): Moderate, fixed defect in the inferior myocardial wall.
Dilated ventricles.
Abd - diffuse distension.
The patient also got 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a moderately low hematocrit.
The patient had a poor appetite on post op day four and consequently had low blood sugar recording.
He had a chest x-ray that morning which was equivocal for effusion versus pneumonia.
He was also cultured for urine and blood both of which were negative for infection.
Although he did have a significant amount of bacteria in his urine.
By the afternoon of postop day five the patient was afebrile and had no complaints.
A congestive heart failure consult was called inorder to optimize the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues.
Given the patient's heart failure he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for CHF management re: recent weight gain and incr LE Edema.
Likely severe right-sided CHF (in this pt w/o resp symptoms), but ascites, cirrhosis (by previous CT), and LE Edema.
He rec'd Nesiritide bolus upon [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] transfer and then on GTT (0.01-0.015 mcg/kg/min IV) - which was adjusted on occasion because of int low SBPs.
Pt had 4.5L of ascitic fluid removed (deemed likely cardiac ascites/cirrhosis) and had relief of baseline SOB.
Pt had somewhat longstanding low HCT, but likely recent blood loss contributing (occ hemoptysis), but unclear etiology.
Of note, the pt had a mild transf rxns upon the first transfusion, but blood bank transfusion fellow did not suggest premedication and urged to continue transfusions when indicated.
Our w/u of anemia included: LDH, TBili, Haptoglobin, LDH, iron studies, folate, B12 and heme check stool; all of which were WNL except for elevated ferritin (recent surgery), low iron (likely iron deficiency), low TIBC (likely secondary to elevated ferritin) and increased T.Bili (likely from liver disease, not hemolysis).
However, a repeat CXR after a second fever (100.4) revealed a new L Lung infiltrate.
Reported ascites for >3yrs and recent abdCT showing nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
Tapped 4.5 L for diagnosis and therapeutic relief.
There were some reactive mesothelial cells not consistent with cancer.
Pt was neg for HBV/HCV previous or current infection.
Had a gouty flair in right foot (XR neg for fracture, but likely chronic dislocation and DJD).
