No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Transient mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation which improved to pre-CPB levels 3.
Bioprosthetic valve in aortic position.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

She developed atrial fibrillation and diltiazem was started.
She continued to have bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation and amiodarone replaced her diltiazem, but was stopped due to pause.
A psychiatry consult was obtained for postoperative delirium and agitation.
She experienced urinary retention with hematuria and urology was consulted.
She had an acute drop in hematocrit and urology brought her to the OR for cystoscopy.
Large bladder tumors were found and evacuated.
Her foley was removed [**3-13**] and she has had no difficulty voiding.
Urine is positive for enterobacter sensitive to bactrim which she was placed on at discharge due to cipro interaction with seroquel.
She was restarted on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and was ready for discharge to rehab at [**Location (un) 38076**] House on [**2113-3-15**].
