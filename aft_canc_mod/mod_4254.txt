Right great toe has had ulceration of nail bed since accident, with periodic worsening and improvement.
Approximately one month ago, patient noted increased swelling of the right foot and the lower half of the leg, much more severe pain, "deepening of infection," as well as fevers to 102.8.

Despite IV antibiotics, the toe is progressively worsening, with increasing pain and swelling.
A culture in [**Hospital3 **] [**2152-7-1**] grew out staph aureus sensitive to vancomycin as well as prevotella species.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 44 year-old male with DMI, smoker, s/p crush injury to both feet [**2151-3-10**] who presented with nonhealing osteomyelitis of right great toe despite 12 days of treatment with IV Vancomycin.
The patient was admitted [**Date range (3) 87176**] for surgical and medical management of his osteomyelitis, the course of which was complicated by an anaphylactic reaction to cefepime on [**2152-7-14**].
Foot x-rays were notable for osteomyelitis.
No vascular insufficiency was found.
Initial tissue cultures grew gram negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs.
The patient was started on cefepime, flagyl, and aztreonam to broaden coverage for gram negative organisms and pseudomonas.
Upon receiving cefepime, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction, as described below.
He was managed with antibiotics and daily dressing changes by podiatry and returned to the OR [**2152-7-17**] for further debridement.
The wound was once again left open, and repeat foot x-rays showed no osteomyelitis.
During his course, the patient had a high narcotics requirement due to severe pain.
His pain was managed with a morphine PCA.
Anaphylaxis: the night of admission, the patient developed throat swelling, tongue swelling, and rash to cefepime.
This was attributed to both his infection and steroids.
He was recommended to have LFTs rechecked as outpatient to ensure continued resolution of transaminitis.
Diabetes mellitus, type I:  The patient was persistently hyperglycemic, likely related to infection and steroid use.
Hypertension:  Due to persistently elevated blood pressure, lisinopril was increased from 10mg daily to 20mg daily.
Thrush:  Likely related to underlying diabetes and recent infection.
He was recommended to follow-up for formal anemia workup with his primary care provider.
