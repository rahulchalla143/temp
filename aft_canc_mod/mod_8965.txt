IMAGING: CT NECK [**12-23**]: FINDINGS: There is phlegmonous change throughout the retropharyngeal space extending from the C2 vertebral body level to the level of the T2 vertebral body at the level of the great vessel origins off the aortic arch.
An area of central hypodensity at the C4-C5 vertebral body level might represent a developing abscess within this phlegmonous collection (2;47).
The carotid arteries are closely associated with this collection, but remain patent and normal appearing.
There is a 1.6 x 1.0 cm lymph node at the superior margin of the left parotid.
The thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with multiple nodules, a hypodense nodule in the region of the isthmus measures 12 mm.
Intracranially, there is a 4.3 x 5.1 cm meningioma within the left posterior fossa, which is not significantly changed when compared with MR examination of [**2177-8-1**].
Retropharyngeal soft-tissue changes extending from the C2 vertebral body level to the T2 vertebral body level at the level of the aortic arch.
No distinct focal fluid collection.
[**12-24**] MRI NECK: FINDINGS: Again seen is extensive retropharyngeal swelling with evidence of edema extending into the parapharyngeal spaces and the carotid spaces bilaterally.
This causes slight anterior displacement of the pharynx.
On the neck CT, there was a suggestion of hypodensity within the retropharyngeal swelling that raised a possibility of a fluid collection.
The MR shows no evidence of such a collection.
There is an apparent enlarged lymph node posterior to the left lobe of the thyroid, extending into the superior mediastinum.
Although the location adjacent to the thyroid gland would be compatible with a parathyroid mass, the extensive descent into the mediastinum makes this more likely collection of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
There is a left pleural effusion, incompletely evaluated on this examination.
There is a suggestion of a small right pleural effusion.
Again noted are multiple inhomogeneous nodules in the thyroid gland, with the right lobe larger than the left.
Again demonstrated is a left posterior fossa enhancing mass apparently arising from the tentorium.
CONCLUSION: Continued extensive retropharyngeal induration with anterior displacement of the airway.
Left pleural effusion and possible right pleural effusion, incompletely evaluated.
No drainable fluid collection detected.
Incidentally noted are thyroid nodules and upper thoracic spine disc protrusions.
Probable lymphadenopathy adjacent to the left lobe of the thyroid gland, vs parathyroid mass.
CT neck [**12-29**] FINDINGS: There has been marked reduction in retropharyngeal soft tissue edema which was previously causing marked airway narrowing.
Again noted is a large calcified meningioma in the posterior fossa.
Marked reduction of retropharyngeal soft tissue edema.
Indeterminate enhancing structure adjacent to the esophagus and deep to the thyroid gland, which, given its anatomic location and access into the retropharyngeal tissue planes, may represent the source of the acute inflammatory reaction previously seen.
This structure may represent a Zenker's diverticulum of the esophagus which underwent microperforation causing retropharyngeal hemorrhage and inflammation.
The other possibility is a spontaneously ruptured parathyroid adenoma causing retropharyngeal hemorrhage and inflammatory response, which has been described in the literature in a few cases.
DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 71587**] [**Name (STitle) **] DR. [**First Name (STitle) 3905**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3906**] Approved: SAT [**2180-12-30**] 9:19 AM  CT head [**12-30**] FINDINGS:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, large vascular territory infarct or shift of midline structures is present.
A right frontal convexity meningioma measures 12 x 16 mm (previously measuring 17 mm).
A left posterior fossa meningioma measures 36 x 41 mm (previously measuring 38 x 50 mm).
No new mass lesions are noted.
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration except for the fourth ventricle which is mildly effaced by the meningioma, unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged left posterior fossa and right frontal convexity meningioma.
There is no evidence for a diverticulum.
Within the laryngopharynx, there is a filling defect which narrows the esophageal lumen.
It is difficult to determine whether this is intra- or extra-luminal, but correlation with previous studies suggests that this is secondary to retropharyngeal swelling.
No other esophageal mucosal abnormalities were seen.
IMPRESSION: Filling defect at the level of the larynx which could represent retropharyngeal swelling.
No definite diverticulum seen.
There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
Also decreased is the extent of a pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis and a likely left pleural effusion.

On repeat imaging, the phlegmon was thought to possibly be related to an esophageal diveritculum with micro-performation (which was ruled out with barium esophogram) versus a parathyroid adenoma rupture due to a lesion seen on previous parathyroid uptake scan.
Patient had parathyroid ultrasound which showed on preliminary read to have an enlarged right parathyroid nodule up to 2.5cm, thyroid nodules and a new left parathyroid nodule.
The ultrasound was unable to visualized the site of increased parathyroid uptake posterior to the trachea seen in [**2179**].
Radiology suggested repeat parathyroid uptake scan as an outpatient in approximately two weeks, after further decrease in edema, at which point they felt that it could still be determined if the etiology of this phlegmon was rupture of the parathyroid adenoma posterior to the trachea.
They also suggested parathyroid nodule and thryoid nodule biopsy which can be considered as an outpatient.
# Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubuated for laryngeal edema and airway protection.
The patient was not intubated for underlying airway disease and she was doing very well on pressure support, and was easily extubated.
# afib:  The patient went into afib while in the unit; unclear if this is new onset as the patient describes feeling heart palpitations in the past.
Possibly related to underlying infection/inflammation versus new onset ischemia.
Found to have new RBBB on EKG; however older EKGs with evidence of interventricular conduction delay.
Possible that increased vagal tone [**2-9**] phlegmon could have triggered afib.
She was monitored on tele with no recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
As an outpatient she should have AF express monitor to track for recurrence of atrial fibrillation over a 2 week period.
Son declined this monitor at time of discharge, however she had been on telemetry for several days without episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Non-active issues: # Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her home Simvastatin.
- Pt has a enlarged thyroid and parathyroid adenomas which should be followed as an outpatient.
If she has recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, she may require anticoagulation.

It is unclear what the cause of the swelling is, but it could have been an infection or from your parathyroid gland.
