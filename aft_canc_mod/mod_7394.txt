Admission Date:  [**2110-2-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2033-7-20**]        Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old with severe pulmonary hypertension with congestive obstructive pulmonary disease on 4 liters of home oxygen here with altered mental status.
Was seen by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**1-24**] for worsening and put on seven days of levofloxacin and a steroid taper, as well as having her oxygen increased.
The patient reports feeling confused without remembering much of what was happening in the past few days, unsure if she was taking the right number of pills, and not eating.
On baseline, she self disimpacts her rectum and last did this a few days ago noting some fecal incontinence.
She also reports worsening shortness of breath.
She had a cough that has been dry.
Narcan 0.3 mg was given with immediate awakening, and then confusion, dry mouth, and dysarthria which resolved.
A total of 0.5 mg of Narcan was given, and the initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions.
She was started on a stress dose of steroids, right lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray.
Severe pulmonary hypertension by catheterization in [**2108**].
Systemic hypotension, two vasodilators presumed secondary to congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease with a FVC of 2.2, FEV1 of 0.81, this was 52% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%.
Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction in [**2106**], to have normal coronary arteries on catheterization followed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Diverticular disease.
Cauda equina syndrome status post laminectomy in [**2105**] continued.
Urinary retention resolved after pessary placement, baseline decrease in lower extremity sensation left greater than right.
Perianal sensation, abnormal bowel movements requiring disimpaction.
Her father with a myocardial infarction at an unknown age.
In general, she is fatigued appearing, thin-elderly woman in no apparent distress.
There was jugular venous distention sitting at 60 degrees.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2 prominent, P2 [**12-26**] blowing systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Decreased breath sounds throughout, no wheezes.
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds with diffusely mildly tender and distended.
Extremity examination showed 3+ left and 3+ right lower extremity pitting edema up to the thighs.
Pulmonary:  Patient's initial hypercarbic respiratory failure was likely due to Narcan overdose of narcotics.
There was a question of infiltrate on her initial chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia, and in addition her history of congestive obstructive pulmonary disease along with new abdominal distention and oxygen retention from her increased O2 likely cause of altered mental status and worsened pulmonary status.
Cardiology:  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Renal:  Acute renal failure improved rapidly during her stay, etiology unknown.
Gastrointestinal:  Abdominal CT scan was obtained given the history and increased LFTs.
CT scan of the abdomen showed a significant ascites, multiple hepatic lesions consistent with metastatic cancer, a right adrenal mass thought to be an adenoma, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient is thought to have metastatic disease from an unknown primary, however, her uterine cancer was the most likely source.
FEN:  The patient had hyponatremia likely secondary to ascites and heart failure.
Her pain was controlled with Morphine as needed by a drip and then converted to IV boluses of Morphine and a Duragesic patch.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic cancer of unknown primary source.
