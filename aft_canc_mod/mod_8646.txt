Fever, Hypotension, L hip cellulitis - resolved with fluids.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed possible early diverticulitis.
In the ICU, patient was placed on vancomycin (history of MRSA wound infection in past) and zosyn and stress dose steroids.
On the floor he had shaking chills and fever initially and reported that he had received a lupron shot 1 week PTA and now had new erythema on his Left hip that was tender.
An ID consult was called and they recommended rapid tapering of his steroids to his home dose, imaging of the L hip, a repeat CT abd/pelvis, a TTE to assess his murmur, and an ultrasound of a fluid pocket on the lateral side of his right knee.
The U/S of the L hip was negative for abscess, a CT on day of discharge on preliminary read showed no evidence of osteomyelitis or effusion.
Oncology followed the patient in-house, and felt that it was unlikely that the patient's left hip erythema was secondary to the lupron shot.
A repeat CT of the abd/pelvis showed no evidence of diverticulitis.
The ultrasound of the fluid pocket on the lateral side of his right knee revealed a fluid pocket that could be part of a knee effusion.
Rheum was consulted and they performed an arthrocentesis which was positive for gout, but negative for septic arthritis.
- consider TTE as outpatient - follow-up final read of Left hip CT .
Prostate CA - metastatic Oncology followed the patient in-house, and felt that it was unlikely that the patient's left hip erythema was secondary to the lupron shot.
Knee pain - secondary to gout.
His uric acid was found to be elevated at 12.0.
He was given 1 dose of colchicine for acute gout, but this was d/c'ed the following day by the renal team.
Rheumatology was called on day of discharge, and they felt that allopurinol should not be started in the setting of an acute flare, and that the steroids were an appropriate treatment.
- Tylenol for pain while on linezolid - Continue Vicodin prn for knee pain after finishing linezolid course - consider allopurinol as outpatient   Medications on Admission: 1.
Linezolid 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours) for 2 days: do not take your vicodin for pain while on linezolid, take tylenol instead.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 7 days: take tylenol instead of vicodin for pain while on linezolid.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left hip cellulitis Gout Hypotension   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Please seek medical attention if you develop fevers, chills, new rashes, shortness of breath, chest pain, worsened hip or knee pain or have any other concerning symptoms.
