Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer with known metastases to the liver and lung, s/p recent ERCP with biliary stent placement who presented with fever and hypotension requiring initial ICU admission, found to be bacteremic on admission.
He later became hypotensive to 90s without compensatory tachycardia (of note, patient is on a beta-blocker at home).
His beta blocker was later added back on for hypertension, but was switched from atenolol to metoprolol in the setting of renal failure.
# Febrile Neutropenia: The etiology of his fever was not clear upon presentation.
He endorsed a cough with clear sputum as well as sick contacts.
He recently had stent placed, increasing his risk for a GI infection source.
These antibiotics were continued on the OMED service until admission blood cultures grew out E. coli, pansensitive except to cipro.
He was switched to CTX and clindamycin (CTX for e. coli, clinda for concerns about oral infection because he was complaining of tooth pain).
He was afebrile on admission to OMED but began spiking fevers again after switching to CTX.
At this time his ANC had also begun to drop and he became neutropenic, which was expected to occur due to chemo regimen.
He remained febrile and began complaining of sore throat, so ID was consulted.
Repeat CXR was neg for pneumonia.
RUQ u/s was neg for biliary pathology (originally a concern due to stent).
# tooth pain: pt complained of tooth pain on admission.
His pain was severe enough to interfere with eating do a dental consult was called and he was empirically placed on clindamycin.
Oral surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel there was infection or abscess present, and that the tooth could be extracted at the patient's convenience, per onc recs on timing.
# H. pylori: pt was c/o epigastric pain with acidic or spicy foods.
Had duodenal ulcers on ERCP 1 month prior to admission with no further work up.
Checked H. pylori Ag which was positive.
It was normocytic and patient denied any blood loss.
He was given 1 unit PRBCs as above and it was felt that his anemia was most likely secondary to his recent chemotherapy.
Hemolysis labs did not reveal evidence of hemolysis.
His BP stabilized in the ICU and he became hypertensive again on the OMED floor, so he was restarted on his beta blocker, though started metoprolol instead of atenolol in the setting of renal failure.
