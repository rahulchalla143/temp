History of Present Illness: The patient is a 26-year-old gentleman who presented with a huge osteosarcoma of his femur.
It had an extensive soft tissue mass and was extremely painful at diagnosis.
He also had metastatic disease.
We talked to him extensively with an interpreter about a recommendation for an amputation but he strongly preferred an attempt at limb salvage and given the fact that his prognosis was poor with his metastatic disease, it was elected to proceed with that.

He underwent the above procedure without complication.
The anesthesia pain service assisted with his post-operative pain control while he had an epidural in place.
