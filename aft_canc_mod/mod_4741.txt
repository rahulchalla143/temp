When she last received chemotherapy on [**2183-9-2**], a third of the way through the infusion of carboplatin, she developed an intense feeling of heat and generalized body tingling, tingling and numbness of the lips, and chest tightness.
Her vital signs remained stable, but she later had vomiting and headache.
Patient appeared slightly anxious, but was in no respiraotry distress.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - CT abd/pelvis on [**2182-2-28**] revealed a large mass centered in the sigmoid colon with pelvic lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- A colonoscopy revealed a fungating, ulcerated mass within the sigmoid colon causing a partial obstruction.
The biopsy of this mass revealed adenocarcinoma with papillary formation, suggestive of an ovarian primary.
This was a suboptimal tumor debulking.
Extensive firm retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was appreciated.
There was no evidence of carcinomatosis.
Pathology examination revealed serous carcinoma involving full thickness of the rectal wall.
Seven of eight lymph nodes were positive for malignancy.
Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were negative for malignancy.
