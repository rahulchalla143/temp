The patient presented to the ER with chest pain.
She stated that the pain started when she was on the bus and then had recurrance of pain when she was in plastic surgery clinic.
She was transferred to ed where there were ecg changes suggestive of ischemia and pt was taken for urgent coronary catheterization.
Chronic left upper extremity brachiocephalic DVT 3. asthma, intermediate-type 4. eczema 5. migraine headaches 6. history of oral HSV  Social History: married, lives with husband, two children; no longer working, +tob, -EtOH comsumption.
Family History: non-contributory   Physical Exam: PE:  afebrile  BP 110/84, HR 110-120 RR 20 O2sat 99%2L.
Gen:  Alert, oriented female in no distress.
CV:  RRR, nl s1, s2, no r/mg.
Lungs: CTAB, no crackles.
Groin: R groin cath site without oozing, or hematoma.
2+ dp/pt pulses.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated two (2) vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a subtotal mid vessel thrombotic occlusion that involved the origin of a large diagonal.
The LCX had a 60% subtotal acute thrombosis in the proximal portion of the vessel.
Successful predilating using a 2.5 X 15 mm Voyager balloon, stenting using 3.0 X 33 Cypher stent and post dilating using 3.3 X 20 mm Quantum Maverick balloon of the proximal LAD sub total occlusion with lesion reduction from 99% to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow in all the vessels with no dissection or embolisation.
Echo: GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal septal hypokinesis, mid to distal inferior hypokinesis and apical hypokinesis.
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and  no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion .

Successful stenting with no residual disease.
Likely occlusion of arteries from clot due to hypercoaguable state secondary to burden of malignancy, in absence of primary coronary disease, given her age.
CV:  Ischemia - Pt with multivessel disease on cath with 2 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] placed at cath.
Initially BB held given her history of asthma however she was tachycardiac and was started on BB.
Sinus tachycardia is likely physiologic.
However she has had tachycardia as outpt previously.
Given betablockers and CCB with little effect.
She was noted to be orthostatic and was given IVF bolus however this did not affect the heart rate very much.
Pump - Echo, EF:40% mid to distal septal hypokinesis, mid to distal inferior hypokinesis, and apical hypokinesis.
