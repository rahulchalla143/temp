Pt states that after getting his blood drawn, he became lightheaded, felt weak and shaky.
He has also had some cold sweats and shaking chills, but has not taken his temperature.
Patient admits to a chronic, non-productive cough, but reports no recent increase in its severity.
No abdominal pain or diarrhea.
Denies dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.
Denies any sore throat, rash, myalgias, or arthralgias.
Past Medical History: 1) Aplastic anemia dx [**4-19**] by bone marrow biopsy.
This prompted an investigation for TB, with subsequent sputum and bone marrow negative for acid fast bacilli.
Chest CT showed evidence of granulomatous disease in the past, but no active disease.
3) kyphoscoliosis 4) L inguinal hernia.
It is reducable and has been present for a long time.
[**Name2 (NI) **] tobacco, quit 40 years ago Rare alcohol when he goes out   Family History: There is no history of blood disorders.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: ED: Tmax: 100.7 HR: 111 BP: 126/83 RR: 20 O2: 99% RA T: 98.5 HR: 95 BP: 127/71 RR: 16 O2: 99% RA GENERAL: elderly male, comfortable lying in bed, No acute distress.
Oropharynx is moist and clear, without petechiae.
HEART: RRR nl s1, s2, no gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
Groin: reducible large L inguinal hernia.
CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2192-8-2**] 6:12 PM CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST INDICATION: Gram-negative rod sepsis, febrile neutropenic, on steroids, evaluate for perforation colitis or abscess.
No evidence of intraabdominal abscess or bowel perforation.
Multiple punctate calcifications in the liver and spleen consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
Bilateral bowel-containing inguinal hernias without evidence of bowel obstruction.
Slight decrease in prominence of the numerous mesenteric lymph nodes.
The largest is an 11 x 14 mm right middle lobe nodule.
Given the rapid appearance of these nodules, an infectious etiology is most likely.
Additional considerations include fungal organisms, Nocardia, and bacterial pathogens.
worsening pulmonary nodules, starting empiric voraconazole Comparison was done to the CT chest of [**2192-8-6**].
IMPRESSION: Decrease in size of the right middle lobe nodule with appearance of a new nodule in the lingula.
Mild bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis with focal bronchiectasis in the lingula.
A fungal infection is less likely given the decrease in size of the nodules within a period of one week.
Tuberculous infection and Nocardia still remains in the differential diagnosis.
MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2192-8-17**] 12:08 PM Reason: ?infectious lesion or bleed COMPARISONS: None.
IMPRESSION: [**Month/Day/Year **] MRI of the brain without evidence of an infectious process, intracranial hemorrhage, or an enhancing mass lesion.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2192-8-18**] 2:09 PM REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PLEASE INCLUDE PELVIS CT 1) interval change of pulmonary nodules bilaterally 2) pelvic abscess?
given scrotal ulcer and large hemorrhoids COMPARISON: [**2192-8-2**] CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest CT dated [**2192-8-13**].
Bilateral pulmonary nodules are stable to decreased in size.
Probable stability of centrilobular nodular opacities within the left upper lobe.
Large extraluminal gas collection extending from right lateral aspect of the rectum to base of the penis and scrotum.
Findings are consistent with perirectal abscess or other gas producing infectious process.
Multiple punctate calcifications in the liver and spleen consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
Stable hypodense lesions in the right kidney and within the left lobe of the liver and caudate lobe of the liver, too small to accurately characterize.
Bilateral bowel-containing inguinal hernias without evidence of bowel obstruction.
Procedure date [**2192-8-18**]; Tissue received [**2192-8-21**] PERIANAL TISSUE Skin and subcutaneous tissue with acute inflammation and necrosis.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2192-8-19**] 12:01 AM Reason: s/p CVL placement IMPRESSION: Support lines and tubes in satisfactory position, possible lower lobe pneumonia.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2192-9-3**] 12:20 PM Reason: r/o pneumothorax History of left subclavian Port-A-Cath placement.
No pneumothorax.
Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum could be due to the tortuous aorta previously noted and accentuated on the semi-upright AP film, but reevaluate on followup studies.
There is a small area of opacity consistent with atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

MODERATE GROWTH STRAIN 2.
man with a history of aplastic anemia, who presented with febrile neutropenia.
Hemorrhoidal bleeding stopped and improved with [**Last Name (un) **] baths and topical hydrocortisone.
# Febrile neutropenia - Patient initially presented with febrile neutropenia and was started on cefepime.
No vancomycin was administered given no history of permanent lines.
Blood cultures initially grew out pansensitive pseudomonas.
Patient initially stayed afebrile for several days, however then began having low grade fevers.
Further work-up of fevers was undertaken.
A BAL was performed and TB-PCR sent to the state lab given concern for reactivation of his childhood TB in face of decreased immune function.
On [**8-13**] liposomal amphotericin was started as empiric coverage for fungal infection and vancomycin was added for broader bacterial coverage.
A CT-guided biopsy of the pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT was planned, however patient's platelet count decreased to 6000 and the biopsy was deferred.
The right pulmonary nodule had decreased in size on repat chest CT.  On [**8-15**], patient had an episode of loss of consciousness with witnessed shaking, no loss of urine or tongue biting.
His EKG showed ST segment elevation in leads VI-V3 new from prior and the patient was subsequently taken for emergent ECHO which was unchanged from prior.
EEG showed encephalopathy but no epileptiform waveforms.
Psychiatry was consulted secondary to patient depressed affect and change in mental status.
Per psychiatry, change in behavior was due to encephalopathy from infection and recommended head MR, haldol IV at night and treating his infection.
Patient did not have any subsequent episodes and his vitals continued to be stable.
Patient continued to spike low graded fevers and cultures were sent with no growth.
Patient was noted to have some diarrhea but no formed bowel movements on [**8-15**].
Nurse noted scrotal edema on [**8-17**] and wound care was consulted regarding skin breakdown in the region of the perineum.
On [**8-18**], Mr. [**Known lastname 22093**] had a torso CT which showed findings consistent with a perirectal abscess.
Surgery was consulted and found a rectal fistula tracking into the perineaum.
The patient was taken emergently to the OR for debridement and a diverting tranverse colostomy.
Pathology of skin sample submitted showed acute inflammation and necrosis but no fungus on gram stain.
Swab of perineum at time of surgery grew VRE, pseudamonas and corynebacterium.
Mr. [**Known lastname 22093**] remained afebrile and no further growth was noted on suubsequent cultures.
# Rectal abscess/tranverse colostomy - CT abd, pelvis showed perirectal abscess, found to have a rectal fistula into perineal and scrotal region, s/p OR drainage of the abscess and a diverting transverse colostomy; ostomy care and surgery following - rod removed from ostomy [**9-1**] - TID dressing changes of peri-rectal abscess .
# Hypertension - on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] - consider increasing metoprolol if still hypertensive - disctoniued captopril as it  can cause neutropenia .
# Anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis - pt had gradual worsening of his anemia, requiring several blood transfusions over the course of his admission.
He was noted to have some bright red blood originating from an intenal hemorrhoid.
Following platelet transfusion, his hemorrhoidal bleeding stopped.
Patient continued to require interval transfusions secondary to his aplastic anemia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 22093**] was tapered off prednisone in order to promote healing of his rectal wound and started G-CSF, neutropenic, ANC stable.
