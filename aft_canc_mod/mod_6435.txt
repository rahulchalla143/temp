Admission Date:  [**2146-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-4-16**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Confusion, slurred speech  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI:  Mr [**Known lastname 86212**] is an 87 year old right handed man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (on insulin), prostate ca with spinal mets, Afib as per his [**Known lastname 802**], not on anticoagulation, who presented to the OSH with slurred speech, confusion and agitation at the OSH.
By the morning, he had become confused and agitated.
It was not until he got to [**Hospital3 68**], that the staff pointed out a left facial droop to her.
Past Medical History: PMHx obtained from his [**Hospital3 802**]: - Insulin dependent type 2 DM for over 20 years - HTN - prostate cancer with mets to spine (treated by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 86213**] [**Name (STitle) 86214**] at [**Company 2860**] - history of Afib (not on anticoag), he had a fall, and was found to have a HR in the 30s, thus a PPM was placed (sounds like [**Last Name (un) **]-brady syndrome) *** as per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] known history of Afib, pacemaker placed [**2-23**] for complete heart block   Social History: His wife had [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease and died 2 weeks ago.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   Family History: Mother died of peritonitis in her 40s.
His father died of colorectal ca in his 60s.
Physical Exam: T-98.3 HR-108 BP-161/91 RR-18 SpO2-98 Gen: Lying in bed, pulling at lines, looking very confused HEENT: NC/AT, dry oral mucosa Neck: No meningismus, no carotid or vertebral bruit CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Somnolent.
His speech is slightly dysarthric.
Tone is increased in the left leg more so than the arm.
Left pronator drift He is antigravity in his arms and legs, but raises his left arm and leg for less time.
Sensation: moves all 4 limbs away from noxious stimulus  Reflexes: 2 and symmetric throughout apart from absent Achilles jerks.
Large right MCA territory infarction with multiple patchy areas of hemorrhagic transformation.
CTA demonstrates a moderate, partially calcified, partially noncalcified plaque at the distal cervical internal carotid artery bilaterally without significant flow impairment.
The basal cisterns are normal without evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CT head [**2146-4-12**]; Unchanged right MCA infarction with unchanged partial hemorrhagic transformation.
No new infarct or hemorrhage compared to prior.
No significant mass effect.
CXR [**2146-4-11**]; No acute intrathoracic process.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive severe apical hypokinesis with focal apical dyskinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No intracardiac shunt.
Extensive apical left ventricular contractile dysfunction consistent with myocardial infarct  Carotid ultrasound [**2146-4-12**]; Less than 40 percent on both sides (prelim read), final read is pending  CT head [**2146-4-15**] (prelim)- no change in size of bleed.
final read is pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 86212**] is an 87 yo with multiple vascular risk factors, poorly controlled diabetes recently due to poor food intake.
Imaging showed embolic appearing stroke in right inf MCA with hemorrhagic transofrmation.
He was admitted to the neurological ICU for monitoring due to his labile diabetic state.
Neurology; The patient was found to have a R MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.
A repeat CT head the following morning showed a stable infarct with hemorrhagic transformation.
Antiplatelet agents were initially witheld upon admission, but started on evening of HD#1 due to a troponin leak as discussed below.
A TTE showed no evidence of  and carotid ultrasound showed less than 40 percent stenosis on both sides (official read pending) The patient was started on aspirin and a statin.
His agitation and inattention have been improving, and his examination is notable for mild left nasolabial fold flattening and possible left field cut.
He however had agitation behaviour again and expressed ideas about harmimg himself.
On [**4-15**] am, he was given seroquel for agitation and was drowsy and not waking up.
The most likely cause of drowsiness was thought to be medication induced.
It was thought this may have been related to demand ischemia vs. stroke vs. subacute MI.
A TTE showed no evidence of clot or PFO.
Endocrine; The patient was noted to have labile fingersticks over the past several days prior to admission.
No active source of bleeding was identified.
Oncology; The patient has a history of prostate cancer, metastatic to spine.
Psychiatry; The patient continued to have episodes of agitation and disorientation.
On HD#2 he received both haldol (5mg) and seroquel (25mg) in the afternoon and became transiently hypotensive which responded to fluid boluses and was somnolent for several hours.
Prior to transfer to the floor, the ICU team was also concerned the patient was exhibiting signs of depression (in the setting of his wife passing away two weeks ago).
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
You had cardiac ultrasound which did not show evidence of clot but did show apical hypokinesia.
You had ultrasound of carotids which did not show evidence of significant stenosis on prelim read (Final read is pending).
