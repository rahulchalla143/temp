None   History of Present Illness: Oncology History: Patient was originally diagnosed with Breast cancer in [**2113**].
The patient's Tamoxifen was discontinued upon diagnosis of second primary malignancy.
In late [**2117-11-24**], the patient presented with abdominal pain.
A CT at that time revealed a mass in the pancreas w/extension to the Left adrenal and kidney with biopsy revealing mucinous adenocarcinoma.
She began treatment with XRT/xeloda and was then discovered to have metastatic disease for which gemcitabine/cisplatin were initiated.
She was to complete her cycle Wednesday night but was told to hold further doses given her symptoms for which she presented.
The patient continued to have diarrhea and called her Oncologist on Tuesday for her ongoing symptoms.
She was arousable but reported to be sleepy and unable to verbalize response.
On the way to the hospital, she reports one episode of non-bloody, non-bilous vomiting.
She denied on admission any ongoing fevers/chills, rashes, headaches, visual changes, chest pain, sob, cough, or abdominal pain.
Patient was noted to have altered MS, was confused and somnolent.
Interval History: Since admission to the MICU, the patient was noted to have episode of hypotension with SBP's in the 60's to 70's for which she received 2 500cc NS boluses.
Patient continued to be hypotensive overnight and was additionally bolused another 500CC NS as well as 500CC LR.
Patient was noted to have ongoing diarrhea and one episode of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting overnight as well with dinner.
She reports her mental clarity to be much improved since admission.
Allergies: Sulfas - patient reports adverse reaction to sulfa containing eye drops previously  Past Medical History: PMHx: - Breast Ca, T1N0M0, ER+, PR-, her-2/NEU-, s/p lumpectomy and XRT, on Tamoxifen since [**12-25**], which was stopped with initiation of chemotherapy - Pancreatic Ca, as above - HTN - DVT - [**7-29**] - diagnosed asymptomatically by abd CT - Migraines  Social History: Patient is currently retired.
Patient with male partner of 25 years, previously married with 2 children from previous marriage.
OP: MMM, no lesions Neck: No LAD, No JVD.
Supple Chest: Mildy decreased BS at left base, otherwise CTA A+P Cor: mildly tachycardic, no M/R/G Abd: firm but not rigid, mild/mod tenderness diffusely but greater in LLQ without rebound or guarding.
+NABS with occasional borborygymi Extrem: No C/C/E Access: left chest port, + Foley, + rectal tube  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2118-9-29**]: .
Microbiology: [**2118-9-29**] Blood cx - No growth [**2118-10-1**] Blood cx - No growth [**2118-10-2**] Blood cx - No growth [**2118-10-3**] Blood cx - No growth .
[**2118-9-29**] Stool cx - No salmonella, shigella, or campylobacter found.
NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
C. Diff negative [**2118-9-30**] Stool cx - MODERATE POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
[**2118-9-29**]: Urine cx - No growth [**2118-10-3**]: urine cx - No growth .
There are no pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2118-9-29**]: CT Head: FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION:  No mass effect or hemorrhage.
Flow study through the port was suggestive of either a fibrin sheath, or less likely, a small catheter leak.
In the left upper quadrant posteriorly, there is ill-defined area of soft tissue density located just posterior to the surgical clips to the left and slightly inferior to the celiac artery axis origin.
This could represent postoperative thickening but correlation with any prior imaging is advised to exclude the possibility of local recurrence.
The remaining portion of the proximal pancreatic body, neck and head appear normal.
No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Multiple sub cm ovoid hypoattenuating areas mainly in the left lobe ,these may represent small cysts but are too small to characterise on CT and should be correlated with prior imaging or interval follow up as small hypovascular metastases cannot be excluded.
No intra-abdominal ascites.
In the lateral mid abdominal mesentry, there is a 9 mm area of nodularity just anterior to and separate from the descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**] (series 3 image 48) and a 5 mm area of nodularity more superiorly (series 3, image 43).
There is no abnormal large or small bowel loop dilatation.
Pelvis: A small 2 cm fluid attenuating locule in the posterior inferior pelvis.
No pelvic mass lesions or lymphadenopathy.
No concerning bone lesions demonstrated on bone window setting.
CONCLUSION: 1)Fluid filled non-thickened non-distended [**Month/Day/Year 499**] .This may be related to current episode of enteritis depending on current clinical correlation.
2) No definite evidence of metastatic disease.
There are a number of findings which require correlation with prior postoperative imaging if available or otherwise interval follow.These include an ill- defined area of thickening of the posterior operative site in the left upper quadrant, two sub cm areas of nodularity in the left abdominal mesentery and sub cm hypodensities mainly in the left lobe of the liver.

Hypotension/Diarrhea - On presentation, the patient's presentation was assessed to meet criteria for SIRS with a septic like picture on presentation.
The patient was febrile, hypotensive with altered mental status in the setting of an ANC of 590.
Upon transfer to the MICU, the patient was maintained on therapy with cefepime and vancomycin  for treatment of febrile neutropenia.
The patient had received 3L NS hydration initially and was given FFP with intention to reverse the patient's elevated INR (patient on coumadin for DVT) for possible LP.
It was the impression of the treating attending oncologist that the patient's presentation and diarrhea was consistent with chemotherapy induced diarrhea rather than an infectious diarrhea.
However, these agents had little effect initially as the patient continued to have high volume diarrhea.
The patient continues to have a significant non-gap acidosis secondary to diarrhea with serum bicarbonate levels of 11 to 14 over the last three days prior to discharge.
As the patient has had a normal serum pH she has not been receiving oral or IV bicarbonate but continues to receive hydration and volume repletion with NS at 125 to 175 cc/hr.
As the patient continues to have significant GI output, she will require ongoing hydration and additionally should receive electrolyte panels with repletion q12hrs until no longer needed.
The patient has now been afebrile > 48 hours, and is currently receiving still cefepime 2gm IV q8hr, now Day 8 (started [**2118-9-29**]) and Flagyl which was initiated in place of Vancomycin (now Day 4, initiated [**2118-10-3**]).
As the patient has been afebrile for > 48 hours consideration may be made towards discontinuing these medications but will be left to the discretion of the receiving hospital.
The patient has had multiple stool and blood cultures sent during this admission (see pertinent results) which have demonstrated mild to moderate Leukocytes in the stool but cultures, O+P and C. Diff have been negative multiple times.
As the patient reported some mild LLQ tenderness a CT of the abdomen was obtained to detect any occult abscess or other infectious process.
CT results demonstrated soft tissue density a the site of the patient's known prior pancreatic mass but revealed no abnormal large or small bowel loop dilatation.
In the pelvis CT additionally revealed a small 2 cm fluid attenuating locule in the posterior inferior pelvis.
The patient is now being transferred to receiving hospital for ongoing management of patient's diarrhea and electroylte abnormalities.
However, as above, given reversal of somnolence with volume rescucitation alone, an LP was not performed.
The patient's coumadin was held throughout her stay as she continued to have a supratherapeutic INR without coumadin, thought likely to be secondary to her poor PO intake as well as extinguishing gut flora with antibiotics.
As the patient's INR was greater than 5, but without any evidence of any ongoing bleeding, the patient's coumadin continues to be held and an addiitional 2.5mg PO Vitamin K was administered.
Of additional note, the patient has been noted previously and again this am to have occasional schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
A flow study was performed which demonstrated fluid flow proximal to the catheter tip suggestive likely of a fibrin sheath vs. a possible catheter leak.
The port was used once on the floor prior to the results of the flow study being revealed and the patient reported some burning at the port entry site with the infusion of some fluids with potassium.
Plans were to be made to have the port removed now that the patient has been afebrile > 48hours and hemodynamically stable.
Pancreatic Ca: As discussed in H+P, the patient is currently s/p distal pancreatectomy, left adrenal/nephrectomy, ometectomy treated additionally with XRT and Xeloda, follwed by gemcitabine/cisplatin, and most recently treated with xeloda/irinotecan s/p two 3-week cycles.
The patient was travelling to [**Location (un) 86**] for second opinion regarding treatment options when she developed severe diarrhea and hypotension.
The patient is being discharged to receiving hospital currently with plans towards continuing management of diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities as outlined above and will continue treatment planning with regards to her pancreatic Ca with her oncologist.
HTN - Given patient's admission for hypotension, her outpatient regimen of propranolol was held during her hospital course.
Upon resolution of large GI output and decreased need for IV volume sresuscitation, consideration could be made towards reinitiating patient's antihypertesnive regimen.
Patient's PO intake was not optimal during hospital course, but continues to improve with resolution of her symptoms.
; He is very supportive and intimately involved in the patient's care.
Bismuth Subsalicylate 262 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: SIRS Hypotension Chemotherapy related diarrhea Pancreatic Cancer .
Secondary: Breast Cancer Hypertension DVT - [**7-/2118**] Migraines   Discharge Condition: 1.
Patient is being transferred to receiving hospital in [**State 4565**] for ongoing management.
Upon discharge from receiving hosptial, please return to hospital for any signs or symptoms of increasing diarrhea, dizziness, fever, intractable nausea/vomiting, bleeding or any other concerning symptoms.
