CHEST X-RAY PA and lateral [**2151-5-21**]: Similar to the prior exam, lung volumes are diminished with marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again noted and stable.
There is improved aeration with no focal consolidation or superimposed edema noted.
Mild aortic tortuosity is again noted with calcified plaque at the arch.
The cardiac silhouette size is stable and likely top normal accounting for patient and technical factors.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.

His initial presentation was consistent with acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
The patient was diruesed with IV Lasix, but subsequently became dehydrated and developed hypotension and acute on chronic renal failure.
Despite diuresis and appearing near-euvolemic on exam, he remained dyspneic.
ABGs demonstrated hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, likely due to his obstructive airway disease.
Patient improved by using BIPAP from 10pm-7am, and treating for COPD exacerbation with azithromycin and prednisone taper.
#) Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient developed acute on chronic renal failure in the setting of overdiuresis.
This responded quickly, with a fluid bolus, with systolic blood pressure subsequently 110.
#) Chest pain: The patient had chest pain prior to admission, which recurred on [**2151-5-25**], in the setting of hypotension to 82.
Subsequently, the patient became supratherapeutic and warfarin was held.
