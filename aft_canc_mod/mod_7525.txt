Omentum (A-D): Unremarkable adipose tissue; no malignancy identified.
Gallbladder (E-I): Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.
One unremarkable lymph node, no malignancy identified.
Whipple specimen (J-AD): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma arising in association with an intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm; see synoptic report.
Pancreas (Exocrine): Resection Synopsis Staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- 7th Edition, [**2148**]  MACROSCOPICL: Specimen Type:  Pancreaticoduodenectomy, partial pancreatectomy.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Chronic pancreatitis, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor with high-grade dysplasia involving main and side branch pancreatic ducts.
[**2151-5-24**] AP CHEST: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-23**] and [**5-24**] at 4:37 a.m.:  Small region of heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base has been present for several days.
Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis is indeterminate.
Pulmonary vasculature is minimally engorged, and there is no pulmonary edema.
There is no obvious explanation for new hypoxia.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and had an epidural catheter in place in the immediate post-op period; and was transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#[**4-30**].
RESPIRATORY: he patient was extubated in the immediate post-op period successfully, but given some hypercarbia and carbon dioxide retention attributed to underlying smoking history and likely a COPD component, the patient was 93% on non-rebreather in the PACU and required re-intubation before transfer to the surgical ICU for futher monitoring.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms following this, but continued to require supplemental oxygen.
The patient experienced no nausea or vomiting.
A mild transaminitis was noted following her procedure, which was attributed to clamping of the bile duct during the procedure.
The patient had no evidence of bleeding from their incision.
ID: The patient showed no signs of infection and remained afebrile in the post-op period.
Their white count was stable post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
The patient also had sequential compression boot devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.

6. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location 15289**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pancreatic head mass Post-op respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
