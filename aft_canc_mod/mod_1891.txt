FINDINGS: Again, note is made of small amount of subarachnoid blood within the right ambient cistern, slightly decreased in size compared to the prior study.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right ambient cistern, decreased in size compared to the prior study.
Decreased right frontal scalp hematoma.
TECHNIQUE: A trauma torso protocol was used.
Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases through the symphysis pubis after the administration of 150 cc of non-ionic Optiray contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is dependent, bibasilar atelectasis.
There is a right- sided breast prosthesis in place.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is no significant thoracic lymphadenopathy.
There are two, tiny hypoattenuating areas within the tail of the pancreas and one within the body, which may represent pseudocysts, although not definitively characterized in this study.
Within the left lobe of the liver, there is a 1.4 x 1.4 cm hypoattenuating lesion not completely characterized.
There is no free air, fluid, or significant lymphadenopathy within the abdomen.
There is no free air, fluid, or significant lymphadenopathy within the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: There is no evidence of fracture within the thoracic or lumbar spines.
There is an S-shaped scoliosis to the thoracolumbar spine with a mild amount of degenerative change.
No evidence of traumatic injury within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Right-sided breast prosthesis with multiple right-sided pulmonary nodules.
This is suggestive of metastatic breast cancer.
Hypoattenuating lesions within the right lobe of the liver and the pancreas which are not definitively characterized on this study.
Of note Chest CT scan performed on [**2139-7-13**] revealed multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules in right lung; largest in right lower lobe measuring 1.5 x 0.9 mm.
