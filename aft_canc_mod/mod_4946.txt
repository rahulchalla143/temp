She was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 **] from [**11-13**] - [**11-18**] for fevers, chills, and abdominal pain, and was found to have one blood culture positive for Strep viridans.
She was admittted for SIRS and given broad ABX with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She was thought to be fluid overloaded and was given lasix 40mg IV as well as 2 units of PRBCs for an Hct of 25.
She also had altered mental status.
MRI was obtained in part for her mental status changes which showed extensive metastatic disease but no acute pathology.
Per D/C summary, blood cultures from [**11-30**] had 2/4 bottles positive for Strep viridans and Zosyn was discontinued.
On [**12-1**] she had a PICC placed in anticipation of having her port pulled.
on [**12-2**] and [**12-3**] she continued to have temperatures to 102.
The patient received one dose of Imipenam before transfer on [**12-4**] since Blood culture on [**12-1**] had one out of four positive for Klebsiella which was sensitive to Imipenam.
Of note patient had TEE which was negative for vegitation on [**12-4**].
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she states that she generally feels well aside from her chronic mild abdominal pain.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI  She also states that she felt fast heart rate and shortness of breath at home 2 episodes but no chest pressure, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or associated diaphoresis.
(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 87852**] is a 64-year-old woman who first presented with low back pain and left hip pain in 11/[**2195**].
Workup in [**10/2196**] revealed breast cancer metastatic to the lymph nodes and bone (invasive carcinoma with lobular and tubular features), grade 1 ER and PR positive, HER-2/neu negative on FISH.
Liver biopsy performed on [**2197-1-3**] was consistent with moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreaticobiliary tumor and not her breast cancer.
On [**2197-2-3**], she was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was found to have unresectable gallbladder cancer with tumor encasing the porta hepatis and adherent to the duodenum.
Bulky [**Doctor Last Name **]-hard portal adenopathy posteriorly seen intraoperatively raised concern for lymph node involvement.
Imaging in [**4-/2197**] demonstrated excellent response of her breast cancer, particularly her bony metastasis; however, her liver mass was essentially stable.
In the setting of pain, she was referred for CyberKnife therapy which was completed on [**2197-7-4**] after initial course was complicated by intercurrent biliary obstruction requiring hospitalization and stenting.
She continued to have pain and was referred for a pain block which occurred on [**2197-8-18**].
[**9-20**] started Gemzar/Xeloda with [**Hospital3 **] oncology group  Other Past Medical History: -HTN -h/o minor MVA - rotator cuff injury s/p PT -hx nephrolithiasis -hx choledocolithiasis -C-section [**2169**]  ALLERGIES: 1.

**FINAL REPORT [**2197-12-24**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2197-12-20**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
BLOOD/AFB CULTURE (Final [**2197-12-20**]):       DUE TO OVERGROWTH OF BACTERIA AND YEAST, UNABLE TO CONTINUE       MONITORING FOR AFB.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Low lung volumes.
Bilateral basal areas of atelectasis.
The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Gallbladder carcinoma with invasion into the hepatic parenchyma with associated extensive biliary dilatation as previously seen on outside hospital CT from [**2197-10-26**].
There are, however, four lesions which appear well delineated and are of fluid consistency seen within segments V and VI of the liver.
Due to lack of IV gadolinium, these cannot be fully assessed, however, they are concerning in the appropriate clinical setting for hepatic abscesses vs. focal regions of tumor necrosis.
Either repeat attempt imaging with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] gadolinium or further evaluation with ultrasound plus or minus aspiration is recommended.
Heterogeneous bone marow signal intensity in keeping with known osseous metastatic disease.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of free air or obstruction.
No safe window available for aspiration of hepatic hypoechoic lesions, in particular there is risk of bile peritonitis due to dilated intrahepatic ducts.
Multiple liver lesion are most concerning for metastases .
ERCP [**2197-12-11**]: There was severe erythema and edema at duodenal sweep.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
Large amount of sludge, debris and pus were extracted successfully using a 12 mm balloon.
There was diffuse and mild dilation of intrahepatic duct.
No additional filling defect was seen.
Multiple small locules of fluid along the superior margin of the large infiltrative tumor in the right lobe.
The size of these fluid collections has decreased compared to the prior study, however, there was an interval aspiration.
Extensive tumor surrounding the gallbladder, invading the liver and tracking along the common bile duct, the CBD stent remains patent with mild central intrahepatic duct dilatation.
Mild interval increase in the degree of pancreatic duct dilatation secondary to the tumor or mass extending along the common bile duct.
Very abnormal appearance of both kidneys suggestive of nephropathy/nephritis.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
LUE u/s IMPRESSION: Thrombosis extending from the distal left subclavian vein through the left axillary vein and into the basilic vein.
Improved left lower lung atelectasis and stable presumed small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 87852**] is a 64-year-old female with history of HTN, metastatic breast cancer and active biliary cancer on chemotherapy who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital with fever and bacteremia.
#Bacteremia with Klebsiella and Strep Viridans: At [**Hospital3 635**] hosptial, blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella and Strep Viridans.
24 hours into the hospital course she spiked a temp to 102, was rigoring, was in AVNRT vs. NSVT to 170s alternating with sinus tach.
Her leukocytosis reduced dramatically and she remained afebrile for the duration of her ICU stay.
She also received a MRI abdomen / MCRP which demonstrated gallbladder carcinoma with invasion into the hepatic parenchyma with associated extensive biliary dilatation as previously seen, and four lesions which appear well delineated and are of fluid consistency seen within segments V and VI of the liver.
These images were therefore unable to be fully characterized but suggested hepatic abscesses vs. focal regions of tumor necrosis.
This was discussed with the infectious disease service, who felt at that time, aspirating the lesions would not change treatment given her proven bacteremia.
Since [**12-9**], LFTs were uptrending as was Tbili, suggesting an obstructive picture.
On [**12-11**], she had an ERCP which showed debris and narrowing of the lumen of the ampulla.
Patient also has lesions in the liver which look like abscess vs. tumor necrosis as above.
In radiology, abdomen US showed that bile ducts were very dilated and there was no safe pathway to access the liver lesions without high risk of puncturing a bile duct.
Other options would be percutaneous biliary drain for decompression vs. ERCP to extend the stent.
Despite premedication, after the procedure, when extubated, patient was experiencing respiratory distress and stridor.
Thus, she was re-extubated and transfered to the ICU for monitoring overnight.
MICU COURSE: Patient re-intubated post-procedure after developed stridor/respiratory distress.
Patient had episodes of severe hypertension and tachycardia felt secondary to pain/anxiety/and likely underlying hypertension.
Due to these episodes, patient developed flash pulmonary edema and made her extubation difficulty initially.
Also grew Enterobactor cloacae in her bile and patient was continued on meropenem.
Also upper extremity non-invasive showed a large occlusive DVT near her PICC.
Given that patient has poor prognosis with her malignancy after discussion with her oncologist, a MRCP showing further infection in her liver with a marked white blood count despite antibiotics, and after discussion with her husband, it was felt to make the patient comfort measures.
Since the DVT was not causing her pain and it was preventing her from being stuck for labs, the PICC was decided to stay in prior to transfer to the floor.
Pain has been an ongoing issue, but the patient is now on morphine PCA and PO methadone which has been sufficient.
An EKG showed questionable a fib vs a flutter and we started to use IV lopressor to bring down her blood pressure which she tolerated well.
She will be discharged with a foley in place, as her mental status comes and goes, and the foley is not currently bothering her.
She was receiving IV meropenem for blood and abscess cultures growing enterobacter, but will leave on PO levaquin.
She was also started on a nystatin cream for a rash on her RLQ and R upper thigh.
