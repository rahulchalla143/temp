Admission Date: [**2146-2-14**]        Discharge Date: [**2146-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-9-14**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old man with a history of severe emphysema and coronary artery disease that was a longtime smoker who developed recent hemoptysis 2 to 3 months ago that was found to have an endobronchial lesion in the apical segment of the right upper lobe that was confirmed by a biopsy to be a non-small-cell carcinoma.
His pulmonary function was noted to be limited, however; but the patient was functionally quite well and was able to walk flights of stairs without significant difficulty.
He did receive preoperative chest x-rays that were within normal limits, except for a right apical haziness that represented the likely tumor and significant emphysema.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was noted to be afebrile with all vital signs within normal limits.
His neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or masses or thyromegaly.
There were no bruits noted.
He had no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
His lungs were somewhat coarse in the right apical field, and he did display an occasional expiratory wheeze.
He was in a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen was nondistended with normal active bowel sounds and was nontender throughout.
There were no notable scars or hernias noted.
There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
He had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
The operation proceeded without complication and without any hemodynamic instability.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's pain was well controlled with an epidural catheter that was managed by the acute pain service.
He, again, displayed no hemodynamic instability.
There was minimal small right pleural effusions noted at this time on serial chest x-rays, and these chest tubes were without air leak with the posterior tube removed on postoperative day #3 and the anterior tube removed on postoperative day #4 with no significant untoward event.
There was a very, very small residual right apical pneumothorax following the removal of the second chest tube; but it was deemed clinically insignificant, and the patient was functionally very well at this time.
His pain was well controlled with p.r.n.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right upper lobe mode; status post bronchoscopy, cervical mediastinoscopy and right upper lobectomy; coronary artery disease; status post catheterization in [**2145-12-10**]; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; gout; benign prostatic hyperplasia; abdominal aortic aneurysm; status post bilateral inguinal hernia repairs in the distant past; tonsillectomy.
