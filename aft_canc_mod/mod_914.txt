He initially presented with an acute MI and rescue PTCA/stenting of his LAD back in [**11/2090**] and stenting of his OM1 in [**2093-3-11**].
On [**2094-2-26**] he was re-cathed d/t progressive dyspnea and complaints of chest pain.
Angiography revealed a 30% stenosis proximal to the LAD stents and partially in the first stent, LCx with no significant disease, OM1 stent widely patent, small OM2 with a 80% stenosis, RCA with a 90% lesion in the proximal portion, mid RCA 80%.
Echo on this day showed moderate aortic stenosis.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical,mid-distal anterior, and mid-distal septal akinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The left ventricle continues to display apical and mid to distal anterior and septal akinesis but basilar and mid segments of all the other wall segments show improved function.
There is a well seated prosthetic valve in the aortic position with no evidence of perivalvular or valvular regurgitation.
There is some improvement in the left lower lobe atelectasis with one area of linear atelectasis remaining.
A right pleural effusion is again seen.
CONCLUSION:  Improved left lower lobe opacification with some remaining linear atelectasis.
Right pleural effusion is again seen.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
POD# 2 he went had intermittent bursts of atrial fibrillation.
It resolved with increased Beta-blocker and electrolyte repletion.
He complained of constipation and abdominal discomfort and was found to have dilated loops of bowel.
He moved his bowels, tolerated a regular diet, and his abdominal symptoms resolved.
