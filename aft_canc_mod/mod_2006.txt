She recently developed obstructive jaundice which was followed by placement of an endoprosthesis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography.
At that time, she also had a peri-ampullar cancer identified by a fine needle aspirate biopsy and CT angiography here at the [**Hospital1 69**].
Now that her obstructive jaundice has resolved, she has presented for the Whipple procedure on [**2133-3-19**].
Right knee arthroplasty.
There were no complications.
Her pain was controlled with epidural anesthesia.
Given her smoking history, also, she was having some aggravation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent diuresis for her mild congestive heart failure and she also received aggressive chest physical therapy and was encouraged to do incentive spirometry.
She had a low urine output and low blood pressure both of which responded to boluses of intravenous fluid and on postoperative day three, the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Floor in stable condition.
Her anesthesia was changed to Dilaudid PCA and her respiratory status was still in need of aggressive chest Physical Therapy and incentive spirometry.
On postoperative day six, the patient was started on Lopressor for high blood pressure and tachycardia.
She also was noticed to have bilious drainage from her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
At this point, the patient although was tolerating sips, was started on TPN for nutritional support.
The patient underwent a CT scan on postoperative day seven which revealed no undrained collection, but the incision was noted to be draining copious amounts of bilious fluid from the lateral edges.
Her abdomen remained soft and nontender, nondistended.
When the patient was noted to have bilious drainage from her wound, she was started once again on antibiotics; this time, she was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Her wound continued to drain bilious fluid and both her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] were draining bilious drainage.
On postoperative day nine, the patient was noted on physical examination to have possible fascial dehiscence of her wound at the right lateral edge.
Upon exploration of the wound by the chief medical resident, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9779**], it was felt that the patient did have a fascial dehiscence of her wound and at that point, it was felt that the patient should be taken back to the Operating Room for a wound exploration and closure.
She tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
She had a decrease in her urine output postoperatively from her wound closure which responded to an intravenous fluid bolus.
Her pain was controlled with morphine p.r.n.
Her wound was noted to have retention sutures in place but she continued to have bilious drainage from all portions of her wound, mostly from the right lateral edge of the wound which was in a dependent position.
Her abdomen was nontender and nondistended, soft to palpation.
She only had areas of tenderness surrounding her wound.
At this point, the patient was also started on Somatostatin in hopes of decreasing the wound drainage.
On postoperative day 13 from her Whipple and postoperative day four from her wound exploration, the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which only revealed a small fluid collection over the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver.
She also had small bilateral pleural effusions.
On postoperative day 17 status post Whipple and postoperative day eight status post wound exploration and closure, the patient was noted to have marked decrease of her wound drainage.
Eventually, by postoperative day 25 status post Whipple and postoperative day 16 status post her wound closure, at this point her antibiotics had been discontinued.
At this point, it was noted that her wound dressing was no longer saturated with bilious material.
At this point, the patient also was noted to have loose diarrheal stools which were sent off for Clostridium difficile and noted to be negative.
The patient's pathology from her Whipple procedure revealed an adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of the duodenum, poorly differentiated, and mucin producing.
She had trans-renal invasion, duodenal wall, with direct extension into the pancreas.
There was focal vascular invasion.
Five lymph nodes were identified without malignancy.
Her dressing change involves removing the old dressing and cleaning the skin adjacent to the wound with normal saline moist gauze, followed by a foam cleanser to the distal end of the wound and patted dry.
Then, following this, Miconazole Powder is applied to the reddened areas and the excess dusted away.
She should receive TPN for nutritional support.
Periampullar cancer status post Whipple procedure.
