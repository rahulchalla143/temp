Admission Date:  [**2187-7-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16983**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: paracentesis   History of Present Illness: HPI: .
The patient is a 61 year old male with a history of a recently diagnosed by CT scan of the chest on [**2187-5-15**] RCC measuring 15 x 4 x 13.8 cm with extensive metastatic disease including extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, multiple pulmonary nodules, bone mets, ascites, and soft tissue attenuation within the region of the greater omentum suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis on Sutent chemotherapy who presented to the ER on [**2187-7-14**] with the chief complaint of lightheadedness, dizziness and increased shortness of breath.
The patient has had a chronic cough since [**11-27**] but over the past 5 weeks has noted increased shortness of breath which he dismissed as he felt better on Sutent (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) for his RCC.
However, he noted the day prior to admission, while walking to his attorney's office, that he could not walk 350 feet approximately without having to stop twice for shortness of breath.
No diaphoresis.
He denies any weight gain or lower extremity edema.
No calf pain.
However, he does report increased orthopnea within the past few weeks.
He does admit to having blood-tinged sputum.
Also, the patient reports a 3 week history of yellow colored "diarrhea" with poor PO intake and fatigue.
His definition of diarrhea is [**1-23**] small bowel movements ranging from loose to watery in nature that began when he started antibiotics in [**Month (only) 547**] for a presumed pneumonia.
The day prior to presentation, he had non-bilious emesis x 3 which he felt was secondary to the chemotherapy.
He also reports lightheadedness, dizziness, no syncope or presyncope.
In the ER, the patient's lactate was found to be 3.8 and 3.9 in the setting of known malignancy which oncology felt was not necessarily indicative of infection.
The patient had 2 18 gauge peripheral IVs placed and was given a total of 3 liters of IVF with a systolic blood pressure in the low 100s.
The patient was also found to have acute renal failure with a Cr of 3.9 (baseline Cr 1.6-1.9) and BUN of 59.
His Hct was 40 (baseline 36-43) and on rectal had gross blood around the rectum with a history of internal/external hemorrhoids.
In addition to IVF, the patient was given vanc/levo/flagyl empirically for ?sepsis with no clear source on CXR although there was a suspicion for ?RLL infiltrate on CXR by the ED.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED for a stat echo to assess for RV strain with concern for PE in the setting of dyspnea but it was unclear at the time if it was necessary.
Low voltage.
No baseline for comparison.
Given his acute renal failure, the patient was unable to obtain a CT-A and given his metastatic disease, a VQ scan was felt to be unhelpful as well.
Oncology requested that if his BP resolved with IVF, that heparin not be initiated unless clearly indicated.
However, the patient did have bilateral lower extremity dopplers which showed: .
Acute thrombus within the left common femoral vein which is nonocclusive.
No evidence of DVT within the right lower extremity.
He was sat'ing 97% on 3 liters NC with no apparent respiratory distress.
16 pound weight loss over past year with increased abdominal girth.
No headaches but change in vision over past few weeks.
Bright red blood per rectum only with wiping.
No history of bloody stools.
HTN internal/external hemorrhoids Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed in [**4-28**] on chest CT for workup of chronic cough, ?
pneumonia Prior right medial cerebellar infarct (asymptomatic, seen on brain MRI) H/o ETOH abuse requiring hospitalization 28 years ago, no history of DTs .
Significant for maternal grandfather with rectal cancer.
Gen - NAD, no accessory respiratory muscles, speaks full sentences HEENT - 8 cm external JVD, PERLA, pale lips Heart - RRR, grade II/VI holosystolic murmur at LLSB Lungs - Diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally, no crackles Abdomen - Distended, active bowel sounds, + fluid [**Hospital1 **], NT Ext - No C/C/E, no calf tenderness bilaterally Back - No CVAT Skin - Spiculated, melanotic appearing nevi on back -> need outpatient follow up Neuro - CN II-XII intact, negative Babinski's bilaterally Rectal (in ER) - gross blood around rectum .
Low voltage.
No baseline for comparison.
CXR [**2187-7-14**]: Probable diffuse metastatic disease including mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, as well as pulmonary edema.
No significant pleural effusions.
Acute thrombus within the left common femoral vein which is nonocclusive.
No evidence of DVT within the right lower extremity.
No intracranial abnormality is detected.
Mucosal sinus thickening and aerosolized secretions within the right maxillary sinus which may be consistent with acute sinusitis.
Stable interstitial edema and nodular pulmonary opacities.
Stable small left pleural effusion.
Unchanged rectangular right perihilar opacity which again could represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or fissural fluid.
No right-sided hydronephrosis.
Large left renal mass partially imaged.
Moderate ascites.
Right pleural effusion partially imaged.
Dilated right ventricle with moderate RV systolic dysfunction.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: MR. [**Known lastname 3748**] is a 61 yo male with recently diagnosed metastatic RCC on Sutent who was admitted for presumed PE s/p IVC filter because unable to be anticoagulated because of active hemoptysis.
Patient has dypnea because of a presumed PE in addition to extensive metastases to the lung.
A DVT was confirmed on LE doppler and echo showed RV systolic dysfunction.
Patient developed pre-renal ARF during hospitalization, which improved over hospital stay.
Urinary retention.
Patient failed a voiding trail after removal of foley, so started on lasix and aldosterone to improve UOP and to treat abdominal ascites.
has significant ascites likely from the cancer.
Was sent home on aldactone and lasix to improve abdominal ascites and UOP.
Metastatic RCC.
