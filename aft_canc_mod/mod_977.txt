Admission Date:  [**2180-5-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2180-5-6**]   Service:  MICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male recently discharged from [**Hospital6 1129**] with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma of the blastic variant diagnosed on [**2180-4-5**] by bone marrow biopsy.
He was found to have an echocardiogram there which showed severe aortic stenosis, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and severe mitral regurgitation with a ruptured chordae.
He was seen in our Transfusion Unit today and received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was noted to be wheezing and hypotensive.
He also had several hours of chest pain and was coughing brown sputum.
He was given 80 mg of Lasix and was transferred to the Emergency Room where he had run of eight beats of ventricular tachycardia.
He was noted to have an elevated troponin and was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin because of his cough with sputum.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Intensive Care Unit for management of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, an elevated troponin, and congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure with severe aortic stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diverticulosis and diverticulitis; most recently in [**2179-7-24**].
Remote pulmonary embolus complicated by ventricular tachycardia 40 years ago.
Total knee repair and bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Chronic renal failure (with a baseline creatinine of 2).
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Mantle cell lymphoma (see History of Present Illness).
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include ZANTAC, ZOLOFT, EFFEXOR, AMBIEN, PENICILLIN, and CEPHALOSPORINS (which may cause rash).
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history significant for cirrhosis and multiple sclerosis.
He was tachypneic in mild-to-moderate distress with jugular venous distention to his ear.
A 2/6 systolic murmur, loudest at the base with a holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Crackles two-thirds of the way in both lung fields with wheezing and decreased air movement.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed mild congestive heart failure and a question of lingular infiltrate.
He was seen by Cardiology who felt that he had no interventional options for ballooning of his aortic stenosis and no change of surviving surgery for his other valve lesions.
He was seen by Hematology/Oncology who confirmed the impression of [**Hospital6 1129**] that he had mantle cell lymphoma based on bone marrow biopsy review and gave a grim prognosis to the patient and his family.
