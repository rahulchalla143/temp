Admission Date:  [**2199-7-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-7-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Imdur  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right lung thoracentesis, exudative, 2.2 liters removed Femoral line placement External jugular line placement CT scan of torso   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 34631**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of DM, osteoporosis, CAD s/p PTCA of LAD, and R pleural effusion seen on US done [**7-1**] who was brought to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab due to progressive dyspnea.
Over the past 7 days the patient had been complaining of dyspnea on exertion.
She has increasing edema in her LE bilaterally over the same period of time.
Her nurse also noted poor PO intake.
She was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation which is new for her and was started on coumadin on [**7-2**].
Reportedly a CXR was done at rehab which showed unilateral pleural effusion, abdominal US done showed pericardial effusion.
However, echocardiogram done on [**7-2**] did not show pericardial effusion but showed 4+ TR, LVEF 35-40%, 1+ MR, 1+ AR.
CXR showed moderate opacification of the entire right hemithorax likely related to both a moderate-to-large sized right-sided pleural effusion and reactive atelectasis.
She denies any night sweats or recent weight loss.
She has a mild nonproductive cough.
Her daughter notes that she has not had LE edema in the past.
Hodgkin's lymphoma 2.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2186**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of her left anterior descending with an ejection fraction of 77%.
Mild dementia.
Glaucoma in right eye.
Chronic osteoporosis of lower limbs.
Vision/Hearing:  blind left eye, no hearing aides.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Well nourished, Thin, Elderly  Eyes / Conjunctiva: EOMI, dry MM  Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, +JVD  Cardiovascular: (PMI Normal, No(t) Hyperdynamic), (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), (Murmur: Systolic), irregular  Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Diminished), (Left DP pulse: Diminished)  Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: No(t) Symmetric, Paradoxical), (Percussion: Dullness : Right), (Breath Sounds: Clear : Left, No(t) Wheezes : , Absent : Right)  Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, No(t) Distended  Extremities: Right: 3+, Left: 3+, No(t) Cyanosis, No(t) Clubbing, to above knees bilaterally  Skin:  Warm, No(t) Jaundice, cool feet b/l  Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Oriented (to): person, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed   Pertinent Results: [**7-2**] Echo: IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**7-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate opacification of the entire right hemithorax likely related to both a moderate-to-large sized right-sided pleural effusion and reactive atelectasis.
Right pleural effusion has markedly decreased in size.
Small residual pleural effusion following thoracentesis.
No definite pneumothorax is identified, but the most peripheral aspect of the minor fissure is not well visualized.
The possibility of a very small lateral pneumothorax is thus not excluded.
Left hemidiaphragm appears poorly defined, possibly due to motion artifact, but a small pleural effusion is also possible.
LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND HISTORY: Bilateral lower extremity edema.
There also was minimal flow seen through the segment of the left distal superficial femoral vein.
There is normal compressibility and flow of the left popliteal vein, proximal and mid superficial femoral vein and the left common femoral vein.
IMPRESSION: Likely chronic non-occlusive small thrombus localized to the distal portion of the left superficial femoral vein.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are no pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes.
Scattered calcifications associated with hypoattenuation foci in the thyroid do not appear significantly changed.
The heart is normal in size, and there is no significant pericardial effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries and the thoracic aorta is observed.
There has been significant increase in size of a now large right pleural effusion and development of a new small left pleural effusion.
The nodular soft tissue density along the periphery of the right lower lobe fissure seen in [**2192**] is less conspicuous today.
No new lung nodules are identified today.
The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains multiple gallstones within.
The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally and there is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
A 15-mm interpolar left renal cyst is unchanged.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable and there is no free air, free fluid or pathologically enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.
Scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to right hip prosthesis.
The rectum and bladder appear unremarkable.
The sigmoid colon contains diverticula without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes or free fluid is identified.
Scattered subcutaneous pockets of air likely related to injections.
Bone windows reveal osteopenia and severe multilevel thoracolumbar degenerative changes with fusion of the L3, L4 and L5 vertebral bodies.
No evidence of new malignancy or recurrent lymphoma.
Large right and small left pleural effusion.
Cholelithiasis and diverticulosis  [**7-5**] Cytology: Pleural fluid: x2 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, blood and roteinaceous debris.
CYTOLOGY NEGATIIVE FOR MALLIGNANCY X 2.
Had CT torso to eval for malignancy and no source found, but pleural effusion on right has reaccumulated and is also slightly on left.
She did not complain of sob, feeling her breathing was better, but did have an O2 requirement of 2L to keep sat over 90%.
She was given 10mg po lasix on day of discharge as her Na and Cl were dropping consistent with hypervolemia.
Overall picture does point to malignancy given multiple thrombi (see below), but would also focus on HF management as possible second etiology and for symptom management.
She continued to be tachycardic 90-110s, but as high as 140, had one episode of bradycardia to 40s while sleeping.
Her tachycardia is most likely contributing to her HF and if rate is controlled her HF may improve.
# Acute on chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure EF 35-40%: This is a new diagnosis for her per daughter (but records indicated [**2190**]).
Does not have edema at baseline.
Most likely secondary to rapid afib and rate control will help manage.
Became orthostatic with 10mg IV lasix, but tolerated 10mg po lasix.
# Acute Renal Failure: Cr increased to 1.0 on admission from baseline of 0.6, was stable at discharge.
# Diabetes mellitus: is usually diet controlled.
NA dropped to 130 on [**7-9**], most likely dilutional from volume overload.
# Leukocytosis: Initially slightly elevated WBC (10.9), trended down.
UA negative, no pneumonia on cxr.
# CAD s/p PTCA of LAD: aspirin dose was decreased to 81mg.
Imdur discontinued since no h/o anginal symptoms per patient and daughter.
# Hypertension   Increase BB.
ATC tylenol for pain control.
