Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions.
[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2140-5-2**] 2:49 PM  FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral lower extremity veins.
There is no deep venous reflux bilaterally.
There is no reflux in the left greater saphenous vein.
There is no reflux.
Cannot rule out nonocclusive thrombus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of proximal deep vein thrombosis in bilateral lower extremities.
Cannot rule out nonocclusive tibial vein thrombosis.
Grayscale imaging demonstrates mild plaque within the right and left ICAs.
No left carotid artery dissection is seen.
IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with less than 40% stenosis bilaterally.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ON [**2140-5-14**]  CLINICAL INDICATION: Elevated creatinine.
Neither kidney shows evidence of hydronephrosis, stone disease or concerning masses.
There is a small subcentimeter lower pole cyst in the right kidney and a 1.2 x 1.5 cm parapelvic cyst in the left kidney with a single thin septation.
The bladder is not well evaluated due to limited amount of urine within, but there is evidence of ascites in the pelvis and right flank.
CONCLUSION: Normal-sized kidneys without evidence of obstruction and without significant change since [**4-5**].
There is new ascites however.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is diastolic septal flattening c/w right ventricular volume overload.
Apical hypertrophy is not appreciated, but there is an apically displaced papillary muscle and the apex is now well delineated.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a very small pericardial effusion, primarily around the apical portion of the right atrium.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-3-28**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is somewhat incresaed.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old gentleman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recent PPM placement, now presenting with edema, weight gain, and shortness of breath consistent with CHF exacerbation.
Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure - Patient has hypertrophic (apical predominent) cardiomyopathy with small LV cavity, diastolic LV failure, causing pulmonary hypertension; also with long standing severe TR and right sided overload and underfilling of left ventricle.
He noted a one pound increase in weight since the week prior to admission, though nearly 14 lbs above his baseline.
He presented with significant fluid overload and pitting edema in sacrum, back, dependent areas, and decreased breath sounds in lung bases.
CXR from last week clinic visit showed small pulmonary effusions.
Patient had successful CVVH and was near euvolemic upon discharge back to the floor where torsemide and metolazone was tried for diuresis.
After transfer back to CCU, the pt was again diuresed, however in the setting of poor forward flow, the pt's kidney function began to deteriorate (see below).
Unfortunately, the patient was unable to sustain blood pressures high enough for CVVH, and so was maintained on a levophed drip much of the time to assist with CVVH.
Throughout the last two weeks, the pt remained volume overloaded.
A thorough workup of potential causes of hypotension was undertaken, but no obvious reversible cause could be determined.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Patient with acutely elevated creatinine to 2.6 on presentation from ~1.9-2.1 the week prior, likely in setting of poor forward flow.
He presented with a mild gap acidosis, likely in the setting of new renal failure.
During diuresis, creatinine improved to 2.2, then peaked at 2.8 despite still being very fluid overloaded, likely still due to poor forward flow.
Urine sediment was notable for granular/hyaline casts and renal US w/o evidence of obstruction.
Subsequent ARF likely secondary to hypotensive episodes and ATN secondary to sepsis (see below).
Patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring levophed pressor support.
Hyponatremia - Hypervolemic hyponatremia fluctuated in the setting of diuresis with a nadir of 125.
Atrial Fibrillation - Patient was in atrial fibrillation on presentation and was intermittently paced throughout hospitalization.
The primary team attempted to restart the patient's warfarin, however in the setting of uremia and anticoagulation, the pt began to bleed from puncture sites and instrumentation sites after a tunneled line was placed.
Leukocytosis - The pt developed a leukocytosis of uncertain etiology.
The patient remained afebrile for his last two weeks, and a systematic approach was taken to identify the source, however this was unsuccessful.
Right Shoulder pain Patient has chronic shoulder pain; he had shoulder surgery about three years ago, notes that pain persists constantly.
His symptoms were controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.
Anemia - Hematocrit remained stable.
Anemia likely secondary to CLL.
Was started on tamsulosin the week prior to admission at cardiology clinic appointment but did not notice subjective improvement, likely in setting of acute renal failure and decreased urine output overall.
# Left leg Varicosity Patient had left leg varicosity with uncontrollable bleeding during last hospitalization with stitch placed in his wound by Vascular Surgery with successful hemostasis.
Venous duplex ultrasound was done to look for reflux, showing no evidence of proximal DVT in lower extremities, though nonocclusive tibial vein thrombosis could not be ruled out.
Gout - Allopurinol was held on admission in setting of acute renal failure.
