She was taken to [**Hospital3 417**] and head MRI showed multiple metastatic lesions.
A MRI brain was ordered 2 weeks ago at [**Hospital3 71979**] which showed multiple enhancing parenchymal lesions consistent with metastatic CA with notably inc size of right cerebellar lesions and frontoparietal lesions.
In addition, there is note of right cerebellar lesion compressing inf aspect of 4th ventricle resulting in moderate obstructive ventricular dilation.
2. h/o sinusitis   Social History: Lives with husband and daughter.

Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.
Evidence of subtle right-sided pronator drift.

There is extensive edema in the left frontal lobe relating to the metastatic disease.
There is a tiny lesion possibly in a leptomeningeal location in the right frontal lobe in a parasagittal location.
Smaller lesions are seen in the left temporal lobe and the right thalamus.
There is a large lesion in the right cerebellum measuring 1.9 x 2.2 cm, with mass effect on the fourth ventricle and mild inferior tonsillar herniation.
There is extensive edema extending to the middle cerebellar peduncle and mild ascending supratentorial herniation.
There is prominence of ventricles and sulci suggesting mild volume loss for age.
There is a small focus of hyperintensity in the right frontal subcortical white matter, without definite enhancing focus in this locale.
No acute diffusion abnormality is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Diffuse intracranial metastatic disease with the cerebellar mass causing significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
MRI +/- head [**2119-3-29**] (pre-op) Multiple enhancing lesions, specifically in the left frontal and the right cerebellar hemispheres are demonstrated for the surgical planning.
No significant change in size and appearance is noted since [**2119-3-24**].
IMPRESSION:  Multiple enhancing lesions consistent with metastatic disease are redemonstrated for surgical planning, with no significant change, compared to [**2119-3-24**], on the post-contrast images.
CT head [**2119-3-29**] (post-op) The patient is status post right suboccipital craniotomy, with bony defect in the right occipital bone, with post-surgical changes in the soft tissues along with small amount of air in the soft tissues as well as in the extra-axial location in the right side of the posterior fossa.
Hypodense area is noted in the right cerebellar hemisphere, partly extending across the midline, likely related to edema following the surgical resection of the lesion.
Hypodensity noted in the left frontal white matter, series 2, image 17, is unchanged, comparing to the FLAIR sequence on [**2119-3-24**].
There is no evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage, new mass effect, or large area of acute infarction or significant change in the size of the ventricles.
No large intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, large acute infarct or significant change in the size of the ventricles, compared to the prior MRI studies.
Since the previous MRI examination the patient has undergone resection of right-sided cerebellar lesion.
Comparison of pre- and post-gadolinium images demonstrate no definite signs of residual enhancement.
Again identified are several enhancing brain lesions including one in the left posterior frontal lobe, smaller lesion in the right posterior frontal lobe and the lesions in right and left medial temporal lobes.
Edema is seen surrounding the left posterior frontal lesion.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
No evidence of slow diffusion seen.
IMPRESSION:  Status post resection of right cerebellar metastatic lesion with no definite evidence of residual enhancement.
Previously noted several other enhancing lesions including the largest in the left posterior frontal lobe with surrounding edema are again noted.
CXR [**2119-3-23**]:  There is thickening of the right paratracheal stripe and hilum, which is indicative of underlying lymphadenopathy.
An ill- defined opacity projects over the right lower lobe, which could represent focal atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was initially admitted to the inpatient Neurology service for concern of seizures and was started on keppra to control her seizures.
An MRI of the head on [**3-24**] showed cerebellar mass causing significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
After discussion of her case in the brain tumor conference, it was decided to pursue a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of the cerebellar mass to decompress the 4th ventricle.
Official pathology on the specimen was pending at the time of discharge, although initial pathology was presumed to represent metastatic disease.
