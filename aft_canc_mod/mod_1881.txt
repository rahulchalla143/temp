male patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a h/o CLL/AML diagnosed in [**8-19**] and treated w/palliative allopurinol and hydroxyurea w/ transfusion dependent pancytopenia (wbcc 3.4, 0 neutrophils on differential) who presents with a fever to 100.5.
Yesterday evening the pt noted that he had a temperature to 100.5 at which point he contact[**Name (NI) **] the on call oncologist who told him to go to the ED.
No new rashes.
States he has had dry non-productive cough.
A CXR revealed a new RUL infiltrate, and he was treated with vancomycin and cefipime, and blood and urine cultures were done.
Currently he is without complaints of pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, urinary problems, cough, mouth sores, or other problems.
Past Medical History: CML/ALL dx [**2172**], palliative care, last peripheral flow [**2174-7-12**] showed AML mixed with some CLL, consistent with BM biopsy on [**2174-5-31**].
hypertension basal cell carcinoma hand cellulitis [**11-18**] hx GBS and citerobacter bacteremia - recently finished 2 week course of levofloxacin for citerobacter   Social History: Lives w/ supportive wife; previously worked as a mechanical engineer Denies ETOH, tobacco use.
Resp: decreased breath sounds at right base, otherwise clear Abd: +bs.
Ext: multiple red petechial lesions on legs; trace edema.

The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2173-11-22**], tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
CXR [**2174-11-2**]: IMPRESSION: Resolution of left lower lobe consolidation.
Partial resolution of right lower lobe consolidation.
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
Possible focal ill-defined density in the right apical region.
Compared to the prior study, the region of consolidation in the right mid-lung zone, which appears to cross both the major and minor fissures, appears more confluent.
There are also bibasilar regions of consolidation, particularly on the left, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent multilobar pneumonic consolidations, with a more confluent and intense appearance in the right mid-lung zone.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Pneumonia - The patient was hypotensive and febrile at admission and therefore admitted to the ICU and put on the MUST protocol but was never placed on pressors.
Although no initial response.
He had no evidence of end organ hypoperfusion with a normal creatinine, cv02, and normal cvp.
He had a RML infiltrate and basal infiltrates consistent with bacterial pneumonia.
Blood cultures were positive once for lactobacillus and sputum gram stain showed 4+ gram negative rods, but no clear pathogen was identified.
He was put on vancomycin and cefepime, then agents were added and subtracted over time to a maximal coverage of vancomycin, cepepime, voriconazole for empiric fungal coverage and flagyl for empiric anaerobe coverage.
His coverage was gradually reduced to levofloxacin alone and he was afebrile during the remainder of the hospital course.
A CXR showed interval resolution in the pneumonia on [**2174-11-1**].
2) CLL/AML/Heme - The patient's peripheral blood had a mixed appearance consistent with approximately half CLL and half AML blasts.
He was neutropenic during admission.
He was known to be transfusion dependent and required approximately 6 blood transfusions during admission and was maintained on epogen.
3) Petechial rash/LE edema - The patient had very low platelet counts and was maintained above platalet count of 10.
However, he developed a petechial rash over his lower extermities, on the anterior aspects of his tibias.
This was thought to be due to thrombocytopenia in the setting of severe edema.
The edema was thought secondary to low albumin of 2.1 as his echo was normal.
He was given aquaphor ointment for his legs to prevent dryness and bleeding.
This did not respond to fluids and the patient was euvolemic with a decreased uric acid level, so he likely has SIADH of unclear etiology.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed: for pain from line site.
