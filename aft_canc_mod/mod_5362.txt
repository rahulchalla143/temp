She presented today to clinic for counts/transfusion, and was noted to have a fever to 100.7, so was referred for admission.
Of note, she had complained of left tooth pain 1 week ago, which was evaluated by her outpatient Dentist.
She was recommended to have a root canal, but due to her low counts, this could not be done.
Her tooth pain is no longer present.
She also c/o R shoulder/neck pain which resolved with tylenol and she attributed to a muscle strain.
Finally, she complains of R pleuritic chest pain, present with deep breaths, walking, or lying on the side.
ROS: Positive for productive cough x 2 days, right pleuritic chest pain, and urgency (cannot make it to bathroom in time, which she attributes to increased fatigue.
Has night sweats but they have been present x 2 years.
Past Medical History: - Adult onset ADHD - Hypercholesterolemia - Obesity - AML (as per onc history below) - Lumbar spine disk herniation (L2-L4, no surgical intervention)  .
Her consolidation treatment was complicated by 2  admissions for febrile neutropenia.
No positive cultures grew over that time.
During that admission, the patient presented with thrombocytopenia and circulating blasts consistent with relapse AML.
The day 14 bone marrow revealed a hypocellular biopsy but with residual blast froms.

Rapid evolution not typical for granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma).
Similar appearance of right adrenal lesion, which can be further characterized with dedicated MRI.
Unchanged appearance of small pericardial effusion.
Chest radiograph appearance accounted for by atelectasis at both lung bases.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2114-5-28**] compared to [**2114-5-22**]: There has been interval decrease in size of hypodensity in segment VIII of the liver, which currently measures roughly 19 x 16 mm, decreased from previous exam when it measured 40 x 36 mm.
No other focal liver lesions are identified.
There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
There is trace ascites around the liver.
Small 15 mm right adrenal nodule, unchanged from [**2114-5-23**] study.
Interval decrease in size of liver abscess in segment VIII.
Small right pleural effusion and adjacent relaxation atelectasis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-12-20**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher and tricuspid regurgitation is now much more prominent.

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2114-5-24**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
Brief Hospital Course: 63yo female with relapsed AML being treated with decitabine, presented with neutropenia and fever.
The following issues were addressed during this admission:  1)Liver Abscess:  The patient presented with fever, neutropenia, and R pleuritic CP.
U/A was negative, CT chest was negative for pneumonia.
No fungus was cultured, but pathology stains were positive for fungus.
The biopsy was complicated by a small R apical pneumothroax, which resolved spontaneously.
She became febrile and hypotensive after the biopsy, requiring short ICU admission (2 days), and pressors for approx 12 hours.
She had significant pleuritic abdominal pain, primarily in the RUQ, which persisted for days.
She was treated with a Fentanyl PCA, and over time her pain improved.
She was maintained on Zosyn/Voriconazole until she became afebrile.
She was transitioned to Levofloxacin/Voricaonzole and was discharged home on Levaquin/Fluconazole to be continued until reevaluation of her liver abscess.
Her Penicillin VK was stopped as she is on levaquin and her tooth pain has resolved.
She was told there was no acute infection but she needed a root canal.
Panorex was done, and evaluated by dental, who did not feel there was any acute dental infection.
Dental did not evaluate the patient b/c she was septic and in severe pain, and it was felt an explanation for her fever had been found (see above).
WBC was rising, and pt has high % of blasts (>80) on peripheral smear.
She received platelets and PRBCs for low counts.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of Greater [**Hospital1 189**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Liver Abscess  Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 65011**] you were admitted for neutropenic fever.
We discovered you had an abscess in your liver for which you are now receiving antibiotics.
We repeated imaging on you which showed the abscess is resolving.
You are still neutropenic and you are receiving hydroxyurea to help control your acute myelogenous leukemia.
If you experience any fevers >100.4, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain please contact your oncologist or your PCP.
