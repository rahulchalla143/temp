Admission Date:  [**2123-1-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2123-1-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-7-30**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old man with a history of bronchoalveolar carcinoma since [**2109**], status post right lower lobe lobectomy times two in [**2111**] and [**2117**], who noted the acute onset of dyspnea on awakening on [**1-4**] and dyspnea on exertion upon walking 15 feet.
Denied chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fever, chills, change in sputum production (chronic), lower extremity swelling or pain.
In the emergency room he was afebrile with normal white blood cells.
Computer tomography scan of the chest noted multiple small pulmonary emboli.
Patient was felt to be safe for anticoagulation as CT of the head was negative and there was no history of bright red blood per rectum or melena.
In [**2121**] started experimental phase two trials of Iressa until [**2122-6-6**] when this trial was stopped due to increased dyspnea on exertion and cough.
Started VEGF inhibitor at this time until [**2122-12-6**] when it was discontinued secondary to disease progression.
No history of chemotherapy.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of liver cancer in her 60s.
Father died of a myocardial infarction.
Head normocephalic, atraumatic.
Neck supple, no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Breathing was mildly labored, but with no accessory muscle use.
Decreased breath sounds at the right base and focal wheezes.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities without cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ distal pulses, no swelling or erythema, negative Homans sign.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no Q waves, no ST segment or T wave changes as compared with [**2122-12-21**].
Chest x-ray showed worsening bilateral opacities compared with [**2121-3-6**] with increased tumor burden.
Cannot rule out infectious process.
Computer tomography angiogram protocol of the chest showed five to six small pulmonary emboli in third order branches of the left lung.
Right lung difficult to assess due to extensive tumor burden.
Computer tomography of the head showed no mass lesions.
This was discussed further in multiple meetings with patient's oncologist.
In summary, he wished to have resuscitation measures taken if reversal of his condition was likely, but did not wish to be intubated if his decline was likely to continue.
Mask ventilation did result in improvement in hypoxia while patient remained on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
However, he continued to be profoundly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 80s on nonrebreather oxygen face mask whenever off noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
That is to say that no further improvement in severe hypoxia was expected without further therapy.
Over the course of [**1-10**] patient experienced gradual worsening of hypoxia and increased work of breathing.
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation eventually became quite uncomfortable for him and patient's family agreed to retreat to nonrebreather face mask therapy for patient's comfort.
Patient had no spontaneous cardiac or respiratory sounds.
