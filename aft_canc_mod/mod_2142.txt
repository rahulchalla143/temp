When you were on the floor, you had respiratory distress and stopped breathing on your own.
During that time, you had a CAT scan of your chest which showed pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs) and a widespread pneumonia in your lungs.
You were started on antibiotics intravenously (Vancomycin and Cefepime) for the pneumonia and Lasix (a fluid pill) to remove the water from your lungs.
In regards to the bleeding from your rectum, it was most likely from a hemorrhoid and did not recur during your admission.
Your liver enzymes were slightly elevated today so please do not take your Simvastatin and come back at 8:00am on [**7-7**] to have your blood draw so that we can re-check your liver enzymes.
