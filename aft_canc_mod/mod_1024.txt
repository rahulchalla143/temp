Admission Date: [**2184-12-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2185-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-5-16**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer as above status post laparoscopy, Port-A-Cath placement, J tube placement, status post chemoradiation.
Morphine short and long-acting.
The procedure was uncomplicated and his postoperative course was summarized as follows:  Neurologic:  His pain initially was controlled with an epidural and then with a PCA with transition to oral medications.
He continues to have significant pain issues including right leg pain, which has been chronic and is being worked up in  the past.
He is now back on all his preoperative pain medications at the slightly higher doses, and in addition, is on a clonidine patch.
Cardiovascular:  He did present with an episode of atrial fibrillation postoperatively, which was controlled and converted to sinus with beta-blockers.
Respiratory:  Initially, he had presented with mild hypoxia and dyspnea.
His last sputum culture grew gram-negative rods and there was a question of possible infiltrate on a CT scan and therefore is being treated with levofloxacin.
Prior to discharge, his sats have remained stable and good on room air, and he has not had any complaints of shortness of breath.
GI:  On postoperative day seven, the patient underwent a swallow study, which showed slow emptying of the stomach, but leak at the anastomosis.
Throughout his hospitalization, he required only 1 unit of blood on postoperative day two for a low hematocrit and tachycardia.
At that time, he had central lines in place.
Both blood cultures and the line tip grew MRSA, and therefore, it was concluded that the patient had line sepsis with bacteremia.
He has remained afebrile since and our hope is to complete a two week course of antibiotics through the port, which hopefully can be saved and shows no signs of infection at this time.
Musculoskeletal:  As noted, the patient is persistently complaining of pain, which has been a chronic problem since preoperative, but at the same time has been able to ambulate independently and with some work with physical therapy.
Continue current pain control with followup with the Chronic Pain Service in order to manage his pain issues and consult these treatments.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Esophageal cancer status post chemoradiation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic pain.
