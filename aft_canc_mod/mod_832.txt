Admission Date:  [**2167-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-12-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-3-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Hydrochlorothiazide / Biaxin / Ciprofloxacin / Thiazides / Darvocet-N 100 / Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 74 y/o female with a h/o MMP who was recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung CA who was scheduled for cycle 2 of carboplatin/taxol (cycle 1 on [**12-4**]) when she presented on [**2167-12-27**] with worsening SOB X 2 weeks.
Per patient, has had increased DOE since late [**Month (only) 1096**].
Usually walks one hour, but now can only walk 40 min and feels more SOB than normal.
+ orthopnea, no PND, no LE edema.
She was seen in clinic for a scheduled visit to start second cycle of chemo on [**12-28**] and was found to have O2 sats of 78% with aggressive ambulation.
She felt more SOB during this episode than usual, but not as badly as prior CHF exacerbations.
The next day she presented to ED with worsening SOB that was now occurring at rest but denied CP, fevers, chills, change in cough, or sputum production.
CXR demonstrated RLL PNA and she was treated for a pneumonia and presumed CHF.
She was also started on BiPAP for presumed CHF exacerbation which helped.
She was transferred to the MICU where she improved daily and the team felt that the largest contributor to acute SOB was PNA.
An ECHO was obtained in setting of CABG and AVR which was unchanged from [**2-26**] except from increasing pulm HTN (possibly likely combination of lung CA, diphragmatic paralysis, h/o XRT when tx'd for thyroid CA).
No URI sxs.
She has had an 8 lb weight loss in 2 months d/t decreased appetite.
Also had myalgias as well as numbness/tinging in toes, feet, hands, knees, calves during neulasta treatment, all currently resolved.

CXR [**2167-12-27**] Interval development of poorly defined opacities in the lungs bilaterally, most consistent with pneumonia.
Acute chemotherapy reaction could have a similar appearance.
CXR [**2167-12-28**] Bilateral basilar infiltrates, suggesting pneumonia.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o female with a h/o MMP who was recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung CA who was scheduled for cycle 2 of carboplatin/taxol (cycle 1 on [**12-4**]) when she presented on [**2167-12-27**] with worsening SOB X 2 weeks.
SOB Pt was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory monitoring given her hypoxia and worsening SOB.
ICU course: Initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure.
Etiology appeared to be multifactorial including possible RLL PNA, LUL mass (malignancy) and an elevated L hemidiaphragm suggestive of phrenic nerve involvement.
Her hypertension was controlled with home atenolol and cozaar.
Her anemia was deemed [**12-25**] chronic disease and iron deficiency and she was started on iron supplementation.
OMED Floor Course Pt was transferred to OMED when stable from a respiratory standpoint.
She was continued on Unasyn for presumed aspiration PNA and switched to liquid Augmentin to complete her ABx course.
Pulmonary was consulted given her initial worsening of SOB and increased pulmonary HTN on TTE.
The most likely etiology for the pt's presentation was an acute on chronic pulmonary process.
She had described SOB since [**7-28**] which progressively became worse.
She had a documented aspiration event which was the etiology of her acute presentation, most likely aspiration pneumonitis but was treated for aspiration PNA.
The pulmonary HTN was most likely the result of her known valvular heart disease which progressed in the setting of her carcinoma.
HTN Pt was maintained during most of her hospital admission on her home dose of atenolol and cozaar.
After discussion with her outpatient cardiologist, he recommended metoprolol TID, no diuretic therapy (pt with h/o hypotensive episodes while on diuretic therapy) and continuing Cozaar.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] or seek medical attention in the ED if you experience any chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, inability to tolerate liquids, or any other concerning symptom.
You were started on an antibiotic to treat an aspiration pneumonia called Augmentin.
