She had no evidence of continued bleeding while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
GI was consulted and upon preparation for EGD/colonoscopy there was no evidence of bright blood/active bleed, rather just old blood.
Although poorly prepped, colonoscopy was normal and her EGD showed atrophic gastritis in the antrum.
She had no abdominal pain during her stay.
Chromogranin A was found to be elevated while 5HIAA was normal.
#) CAD: No signs of ischemia on EKG but paced rhythm.
Her ACEI was held on admission in the setting of her GI bleed and was restarted as her blood pressure tolerated.
Metoprolol was added back for persistent tachycardia (h/o tachy-brady).
On HD 6, she was transferred to the surgical service for planned surgical intervention of her known mesenteric mass; she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 34, ambulating with a walker, tolerating Ensure supplementation, and had moderate right upper quadrant pain controlled with Vicodin.
On HD 7 and 8, she underwent an Octreotide scan, which demonstrated no abnormal focus of tracer uptake to indicate somatostatin receptor avid tumor.
On HD 10 she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection, and cholecystectomy; intra-operatively she was found to have large bulky disease, consistent with carcinoid with nodules which had a tremendous sclerotic reaction which basically enveloped substantial portions of the small intestine, she had no complications.
On POD 4, she had +flatus and a bowel movement, her diet was advanced, her pain was well controlled with Vicodin, her oral medications were resumed, she remained afebrile, and was voiding without difficulty.
