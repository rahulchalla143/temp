HEENT: NC/AT, anicteric sclera NECK: supple CHEST: CTA bilaterally CV: tachycardic, RR without murmur ABD: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no HSM EXTREM: no edema, radial and DP pulses 2+  NEURO: MENTAL STATUS: not opening eyes (even to sternal rub), nonverbal, not following axial or midline commands.
CRANIAL NERVES: Pupil exam: 1 mm bilaterally and minimally reactive to light EOM exam: - vestibuloocular reflex Corneal reflex: absent bilaterally Facial symmetry: right lower face droop Gag reflex: absent MOTOR: normal bulk, no spontaneous movements, flaccid tone (R>L) SENSORY: no response to pain REFLEXES: brisk throughout, toes upgoing bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: LABS: WBC-14.1* RBC-4.35* Hgb-14.3 Hct-40.2 MCV-93 MCH-32.9* MCHC-35.5* RDW-12.1 Plt Ct-200 PT-12.4 PTT-24.8 INR(PT)-1.0 Glucose-163* UreaN-14 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-3.7 Cl-99 HCO3-27 AnGap-15  NCHCT (OSH): large left high convexity hyperdensity in fronto-parietal lobe intraparenchymal approximately 5x6 cm x 13 slices, minimal shift, no interventricular extension, no hydrocephalus.
EKG: NSR at 75, no ischemic changes  CT head ([**Hospital1 18**]): There is a large left frontal and parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema.
There is also subarachnoid hemorrhage seen superiorly in the left frontal lobe.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is also seen medially within the right parietal lobe along the falx.
There is hemorrhage layering bilaterally within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
The extensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage is larger than on the earlier outside study in both cerebral hemispheres.
There is no significant shift of midline structures or hydrocephalus.
However, there appears to be mild uncal herniation on the left with effacement of the Ambien cistern.
IMPRESSION: Large left cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage and right parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated left frontal lobe subarachnoid hemorrhage and bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage.
There is also mild uncal herniation on the left.
