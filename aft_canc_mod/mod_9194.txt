Name:  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1340**]                  Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 10590**]  Admission Date:  [**2100-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-8-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1472**] Addendum: HPI: 71 y/o man with prior history of CLL s/p 1 month of cytoxin and five cycles of fludaribine (year [**2096**]) on chronic oral steroids for CLL and COPD developed progressive SOB beginning 2 months prior to admission.
At that time it was felt he had a COPD flair and was admitted to the hospital for observation and management.
CT showed new infiltrates in the right lower lobe largest measuring 4x2.5cm with an "infectious appearance".
Prior to his discharge he developed a fever, but left for home AMA as opposed to a rehab hospital.
OVer the next few days he worsened and was readmitted to another hospital where repeat CT showed cavitations of the right lower lobe nodules.
Biospy of the lesion deomonstrated atypical cells with intranuclear inclusions classic for HSV.
No biopsy of the right lower lobe infiltrate was obtained as it was too distal.
He was started on empiric therapy: VAncomycin for MRSA cavitary pneumonia, acyclovir ?
HSV pneumonia, and bactrim for PCP coverage given his immunosuppression from CLL and chronic steroids.
On admission he was afebrile with a normal WBC, and dyspneic after walking 10'.
He does not complain of SOB at rest.
He has a significant travel history and has been across the U.S., South East [**Female First Name (un) **], Europe, [**Country **], [**Country 10591**] as he is a Federal Express worker.
Denies chest pain or chest tightness.
He is followed by a pulmonologist who has treated him with Tio, albuterol nebs/MDI, salmeterol, fluticasone, and chronic steroids.
At baseline he is able to walk several blocks without becoming dyspneic.
In regards to his CLL, he was diagnosed in [**2093**] and with an elevated WBC.
He completed 5 cylces of fludaribine which was stopped secondary to granulocytopenia.
He then underwent 1 month of cytoxin which was discontinued secondary to hemolytic anemia.
He has a known reaction to IVIG (known after discussion with his nurse following his reaction to IVIG in the MICU hereat [**Hospital1 8**]) and gets premedicated with benadryl and decadron.
He has not had any history of blastic transformation.
All antibiotics except for bactrim (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2515**]) were discontinued given the lack of support for any particular organism and his stable respiratory function.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted who felt that the cavitary lesion was too distal to biopsy on bronchoscopy.
However, given the size of his pleural blebs, his tenuous respiratory function, and their history of obtaining poor yields on micro studies from bx, they were reluctant to biopsy him pending.
He remained afebrile and began to improve from a pulmonary standpoint able to ambulate down the halls without desaturating or stopping to catch his breath.
It was then felt that rather than have an infectious process, the cavitary lesions may have represented pulmonary infarcts that were the typical wedge shaped pleural based lesions.
However after several days, he decompensated with worsening DOE with fevers up to 102.7.
Repeat CT chest showed new opacities in the right lower and middle lobes, resolving PE and stable right lower lobe cavitations.
Repeat bronch by pulmonology grew out aspergillus, sparse pseudomonas and GPR consistent with oral microbes.
Over the next few days, he continued to spike fevers with persistently negative blood cultures and unchanged sputums.
Another CT chest showed worsening effusion and right lung infiltrates.
He was started on voriconazole and cipro for treatment of invasive aspergillus and nosocomial pseudomonas pneumonia.
