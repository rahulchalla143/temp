Pain controlled with epidural, had some confusion.
POD 5 pt became more confused and somnolent and had an increasing O2 requirement, had post-op atelectasis and was transferred to the SICU.
CXR [**3-28**]: There are low lung volumes and the image taken is supine lordotic.
There is no evidence of vascular congestion.
There is interval development of left basilar atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion is also seen.
Given fluids for post-op hypovolemia Echo [**3-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you experience: -Fever (> 101.4) -Inability to eat/drink or persistant vomiting -Increased pain -Redness or discharge from your wound -Other symptoms concerning to you   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.
