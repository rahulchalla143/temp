No accessory muscle use or intercostal retractions noted.
EXT: No edema bilat.
Knee flexors/extendors [**2-9**] bilat, worse on R.   Pertinent Results: C-spine CT ([**2155-10-15**]): No fracture or subluxation.
Within the upper cervical vertebral  levels (C2-C4), there is no apparent indentation on the contour of the thecal sac; however, there is very limited evaluation below that level.
There is mild spinal canal stenosis at those levels.
T-spine CT ([**2155-10-15**]): Interval marked progression of compression fracture deformity involving the T4/5 vertebral bodies, with interval increase in marked focal kyphotic angulation, retropulsion of osseous fragments, and marked narrowing of the spinal canal at that level.
These findings are concerning for interval cord compression, especially in the setting of patient's new symptomatology.
L-spine CT ([**2155-10-15**]): No new fracture or subluxation is identified.
Degenerative changes and compression deformities involving L1-L2 are similar in comparison to the prior MRI exam of [**2155-9-17**].

A CT scan of the spine was performed (since he has been historically unable to tolerate an MRI without sedation and intubation) which showed worsening of his T4/T5 compression fracture, expulsion of bony fragments into the spinal canal, and new compression of the cord at this level.
Per the neurosurgery consult, the patient was not a surgical candidate since he already had baseline bowel/bladder incontinence and left leg weakness from his prior cord compression, and surgery would be very unlikely to improve this baseline.
Upon arrival to the floor, there was concern that he had worsened hypoxia, and a CT angiogram was performed which showed no PE; it did however show bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration (though he has never been febrile).
A pain consult was obtained to assist with his chronic pain control and they recommended starting a Dilaudid PCA on top of his chronic pain medications.
Although initially obtaining good control of his pain, he became increasingly oversedated and had an episode of decreased respiratory rate and obtundation which required transfer to ICU for 2d, dsepite discontinuation of PCA.
He did well in ICU and was transferred back to the oncologic service with decreased methadone (30 tid)dosing and PRN dilaudid, on which he has been stable.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has an underlying anxiety disorder which prevented him from placing TLSO brace at times as well as increased his level of pain.
We started him on venlafaxine and dc'd his citalopram with hopes of addressing his baseline anxiety and he will be discharged with dose of 75mg with plans to increase to 150mg 2d after his discharge  A wound care consult was obtained for his prior neurosurgical wound and his decubitus ulcers.
They recommended wet-to-dry dressing to his surgical wound and local wound care with micoazole for his pressure ulcers.
A neurology consult was obtained to evaluate if his aspiration could be due to his cord compression causing diaphragmatic hemiparesis or some other neurolgic defect.

Progression of thoracic vertebral compression fractures with retropulsion of fragments concerning for cord compression.
A/P: 55 yo man with MM and recent cord compression with residual weakness admitted with new cord compression causing paresis of right leg/foot now getting XRT.
# Cord compression- Neurosurg eval appreciated, unlikely to be a surgical candidate given low likely of regaining function.
- TLSO brace when OOB - Rad/Onc following; continue XRT, dexamethasone 4q6h - pain service following.
- anxiolysis may also aid with pain control .
# Multiple Myeloma: holding systemic tx.
# COPD: CT angio neg for PE and ?basilar consolidation.
Per reports has emphysema and 2L O2 baseline requirement - Cont supplemental O2 at his baseline 2L - aspiration precautions - albuterol/ipratropium per outpatient regimen .
# Anxiety/Dx: increasing anxiolytics as pt.
# Ppx - teds and SC heparin.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Neurosurgery: Watch incision for redness, drainage, bleeding, swelling any discharge, fever greater than 101.5 call Dr [**Name (NI) 14232**] office.
