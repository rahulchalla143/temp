History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83 year old woman with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p fludarabine/rituximab X 4 cycles started [**2103-12-18**], complicated by subsequent development of aplastic anemia in [**5-25**], who presented to clinic today with a 4 day duration of malaise, weakness, dysuria, and decreased appetite/PO consumption.
Denies hematuria but urine is dark brown-[**Location (un) 2452**] in color.
Has been moving her bowels daily with no abdominal pain or change in her stool.
Also reports 1 month history of dry cough, only occasionally productive of clear mucous.
She is currently transfusion dependent in terms of her aplastic  anemia and is managed on cyclosporine at this point in time.
In clinic today, patient was given 1 unit platelts, 1 unit PRBCs, was found to have a positive u/a, blood and urine culture collected.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Diagnosed with colon cancer in [**2099**], s/p diverting colostomy, reversed in [**2100**].
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma diagnosed in [**10/2103**], s/p fludarabine/rituximab X 4 cycles started [**2103-12-18**] at [**Location (un) **], complicated by aplastic anemia in [**5-25**].
This then worsened again and the patient was most recently treated with Rituxan with a hope that there is an element of consumption for her platelets and red cells that this would improve her counts.
She has also had a history of a bowel obstruction surgery, without clear etiology of the obstruction.
Although there were no masses appreciated, this was thought to be due to adhesions and it was felt not to be safe to proceed to do an extensive exploration.
Mother heart and renal failure.
No history of cancer.
NECK: Supple, with no thyromegaly.
There is no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
The abdomen is soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES: No pedal edema present.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Minimal linear opacity is seen at the left base, it is most likely consistent with atelectasis.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
Hypoenhancing area within the mid polar right kidney, concerning for pyelonephritis given the patient's recent history of Gram-negative bacteremia.
Other considerations include infarct vs. less likely, infiltrative tumor in setting of known lymphoma.
New small left-sided pleural effusion.
Uncomplicated gastric herniation through the colostomy site.
8-mm pancreatic cyst, unchanged over multiple prior studies.
Findings consistent with hemosiderosis involving the liver and spleen.
Splenomegaly and splenic varices.
Small amount of ascites and small left pleural effusion.
Differential diagnosis includes side branch IPMN versus pseudocyst.
Dense focus along the left tentorium, new since [**Month (only) **] [**2103**], likely represents subdural hemorrhage rather than a mass like meningioma.
CT head ([**2105-12-14**]): IMPRESSION: Slight decrease in left frontal subdural hematoma.
No change in left tentorial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old woman with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and subsequent aplastic anemia following treatment with fludarabine and cyclosporine, who presented with malaise, weakness, dysuria and chronic cough.
Klebsiella UTI and bacteremia: Culture data revealed klebsiella urinary tract infection and bacteremia.
Patient completed course of IV cefepime for 19 days with significant clinical improvement with no further fevers or dysuria.
Transaminitis: Liver enzymes found to be trending upwards over the last several months after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia and transfusion requirement increased.
RUQ ultrasound was performed prior to hospitalization and showed cholelithiasis but no obstruction.
Iron levels were high and hepatology was consulted to investigate secondary iron overload as a potential cause for transaminitis.
MRI was performed which confirmed significant iron deposition within the liver and spleen.
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/aplastic anemia: Had been on chronic cyclosporine without evidence of improvement in counts as an outpatient.
Plan was made to begin ATG for treatment of aplastic anemia following successful treatment of klebsiella UTI/bacteremia.
On the evening of her ATG administration, patient found to develop labored breathing, tachypnea, tachycardia and hyperglycemia.
ABG was consistent with mild respiratory alkalosis.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
ECG was without abnormality.
Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness.
CT scan showed 5mm left frontal subdural hematoma.
Head CT was repeated 12 hours later with no acute changes.
Hip films without fracture.
Repeat head CT showed a smaller subdural hematoma.
CT without any acute process.
Acute renal failure, likely pre-renal: 1.9 on admission, likely due to decreased PO intake secondary to malaise associated with UTI and bacteremia.
# Sinus arrhythmia: The patient was noted to have an irregular rhythm.
EKG showed sinus rhythm with ectopic atrial beats.
Followup cyclosporine levels  Medications on Admission: -acyclovir 400mg PO BID -atenolol 25mg PO qHs -cyclosporine 125mg PO BID -folic acid 1mg PO daily -HCTZ 25mg PO daily -MVI -neupogen - no regular schedule.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Diversified VNA and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Urinary tract infection Klebsiella bacteremia Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma .
Secondary: Aplastic anemia Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
You were admitted to the hospital with malaise and dysuria and found to have a bacterial urinary tract infection.
After a full course of antibiotics, you were given ATG in an effort to treat your aplastic anemia, but you tolerated this medication poorly.
You were briefly transferred to the ICU to monitor your wheezing and shortness of breath.
You were noted to have high blood pressure, so amlodipine, a blood pressure medication, was started.
Should you develop worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, fever, chills, pain with urination, lightheadedness, dizziness, please call the on-call oncology fellow or visit the emergency room.
