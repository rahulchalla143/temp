Admission Date: [**2149-4-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2149-5-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-16**]        Sex:  M  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39 year old male with a past medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia, status post unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplant that has been complicated by chronic graft-versus- host disease (hypopigmentation, mild ulceration, and thrombocytopenia).
The patient states that he began feeling unwell approximately nine days prior to admission but worsened significantly over the weekend prior to admission, specifically complaining of fever to 101, complicated by myalgias, fatigue and an unproductive cough as well as shortness of breath.
Of note the patient was  noted to have a flare of his graft- versus- host disease flare ([**2149-1-6**]).
He was seen by pulmonary who felt he had a component of Bronchlitis obliterans  and was treated with Prednisone 40 mg which was tapered slowly back down to 5 mg last month.
The symptoms appeared to develop approximately one week after having tapered down to 5 mg, in particular the muscle aches, pain, fatigue and low-grade fever.
This progressed to a dry cough and worsened fever as above.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is notable for chronic myelogenous leukemia.
It has been complicated by graft-versus-host disease as mentioned above as well as cytomegalovirus colitis, bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and mouth ulcers as well as thrombocytopenia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for the absence of cancer or lung disease.
Chest film does not reveal any evidence of infiltrate or effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pneumonia - A high resolution chest computerized tomography scan did not reveal any acute changes, though the nasal swabs were positive for respiratory syncytial virus.
Again, noted were bronchial wall thickening and scarring of the right lower lobe that was unchanged from the prior study with no significant air trapping and no adenopathy.
Overall there was no computerized tomography scan evidence for acute infectious process or inflammatory process.
However, given the patient's immunocompromised status and out of concern for possible superimposed bronchitis or pneumonia, the patient was treated with a seven day course of Levofloxacin in addition to the treatment for his Ribavirin.
Thrombocytopenia - The patient has thrombocytopenia which is thought to be secondary to chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Graft-versus-host disease - The patient has a history of bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.
There was concern that his hypoxia in addition to being caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection may also have had an component of graft-versus-host disease as well, in particular given the drop in his platelet count on admission.
Anemia - The patient's hematocrit is stable over the course of hospitalization.
Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient had an elevated creatinine on admission of 1.6.
Etiology was unclear for his elevated creatinine on admission.
Extensive chronic GVHD.
Status post allogeneic bone marrow transplant with extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease.
