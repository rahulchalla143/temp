Admission Date:  [**2181-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-10-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Leg pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Parathyroidectomy FNA Thyroid   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG ([**2175**]), hyperparathyrodism with parathyroid adenoma (dx'd [**2175**]), type 2 DM, CHF (EF 20%), "fast heart rate" and CKD who presents with leg pain.
He subsequently he had difficulty moving the leg and was concerned that it broke.
He also reported two similar episodes: first last [**Month (only) **] he felt a painful click in his right forearm which developed into a soft mound and second on New Year's Eve he heard a snap in his right UE, followed by pain and ecchymosis which lasted for weeks.
In ED, plain film of his pelvis showed a possible chronic superior/inferior pubic rami fracture with lucencies/lytic lesions in long bones.
Calcium on admission was 12.7 - per OMR this is chronic hypercalcemia [**3-16**] hyperparathyroidism.
Review of systems was negative for fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss - in fact patient had 70lb wt gain over 2 years - chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations.
He had no dysuria, hematuria.
Only complaint is pain in left leg.
Past Medical History: # CAD s/p CABG, [**2175-7-6**] - 3V CABG with a saphenous vein graft to the CMI, saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending artery  (with a proximal anastomosis from the diagonal), and a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
# hyperparathyroidism (adenoma)- chronic hypercalcemia, ?bone pains, renal insuff, but has not undergone surgery.
# CHF- EF 20% pre-CABG, no recent ECHO on file # chronic knee pain # CKD- Cr 2.4; suspected secondary to hypercalcemia, DM # PAF   Social History: The patient has a 15 pack year history.
Worked as bookmaker for sports gambling.
No alcohol, no drugs.
Family History: The patient's father died at age 86 of coronary artery disease and also had hypertension.
Father had paget's disease.
No history of DM or thyroid disease.
Physical Exam: vitals- T 96.4, BP 130/68, HR 96, RR 20, 99% RA gen- disheveled appearing, no acute distress heent- EOMI.

Fractures of the left superior and inferior pubic ramus of uncertain chronicity.
Curvilinear lucency in the left femoral head is suspicious for fracture.
Lytic lesion in the left femoral mid shaft may represent a brown tumor given the patient's history of aggressive hyperparathyroidism, however aggresive tumor such as metastasis or myeloma cannot be excluded.
CXR: neg for PNA/PTX .
[**5-10**] Echo: Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior wall and at least moderate hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffusely abnormal study with multifocal lytic expansile soft tissue density masses throughout the visualized pelvis.
However, given the nonspecific as well as heterogeneous appearance, metastatic malignancy musct also be considered.
Acute pathologic fracture involving the left femoral neck 3.
Chronic appearing pathologic fractures involving the left superior and inferior pubic rami, also secondary to expansile soft tissue masses.
Lesion in diaphysis of left femur, with endosteal scalloping which creates risk for pathologic fx at this second site.
Multiple lesions with interrupted cortex, as described including lesion of the right anterior acetbulum/ramus, which represent, by definition, pathologic fractures.
Soft tissue density mass within the mid femoral diaphysis causing significant endosteal scalloping, which may be at risk for pathologic fracture.
Redemonstration of pathologic fracture of the left femoral neck, as discussed on the CT of the pelvis.
These lesions again may reflect aggressive form of brown tumors, though other metastatic lesion should be considered in the differential.
[**2181-5-13**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the kidneys secondary to patient's increased body habitus and inability to comply with necessary maneuvers.
No evidence of nephrocalcinosis or hydronephrosis identified.
A small simple cyst is identified within the upper pole of the left kidney.
Mass lesions on the right kidney cannot be completely ruled out on this study.
3.9 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm nodule posterior and lateral to the inferior pole of the left thyroid lobe likely represents a parathyroid nodule.
Interval enlargement of the right thyroid lobe and isthmus nodules.
1.4 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm hypoechogenic nodule adjacent to the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe cannot cannot distinct lymph node from another parathyroid adenoma.
Expansile osseous lesion of the distal right ulnar diaphysis with ill-defined margins, associated cortical destruction, and numerous bony trabeculations running through the center of the mass.
Given the patient's history, the possibility of a brown tumor in this location must be considered.
The appearance is nonspecific, however, an other considerations would include aneurysmal bone cyst or metastasis.
Indistinct areas of lucency more proximally within the ulna and in the radial diaphysis are nonspecific; attention to these areas on followup imaging is advised, particularly since they may represent additional lesions.
Parathyroid mass [**2181-7-5**]: Left parathyroid and left thyroid lobe and isthmus (A-T): a.  Parathyroid carcinoma, 3.4 cm, with capsular invasion and vascular invasion (slide Q).
Thyroid FNA [**2181-7-23**]: Indeterminate for malignancy - follicular lesion with   some features suggestive of, but not diagnostic for,   papillary carcinoma with cystic degeneration.
Hypocellular specimen with follicular cells in a few   groups, some with crowding.
Some of the follicular cells show powdery chromatin,   nuclear enlargement, nuclear grooves, small prominent   nucleoli and irregular nuclear membranes.
No intraluminal filling defects are seen.
IMPRESSION:  No DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: # Primary hyperparathyroidism/hypercalcemia:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially diagnosed with a 3 cm parathyoird adenoma in [**2175**].
He denied any symptoms of hypercalcemia - had never had renal stones.
Endocrinology and endocrine surgery were called for help with management.
A repeat thyroid US showed increased size of the adenoma: 3.9x3.8x3.2cm nodule post/lat to inferior pole L thyroid lobe and 1.4x0.8x0.9cm nodule adjacent to lower pole of L thyroid lobe.
Radiologic studies showed lytic lesions which are consistent with Brown's tumors.
Psychiatry was consulted and deemed the patient to have capacity and understand the risks and benefits of his decisions.
The pathology report revealed papillary carcinoma thyroid.
The pt underwent FNA of the R thyroid mass which was intermediate for papillary Ca thyroid.
The patient was found to have elevated PTH and low calcium due to hungry bone syndrome, and the patient received calcitriol and vitamin D. In addition, during his stay, the PTH continued to rise with a normal calcium which was found to be a result of his hungry bone syndrome and not recurrance of parathyroid cancer at this time since the PTH supressed well with IV calcium supression test.
# Hypthyroidism: The patient was found to have hypothyroidism during his hospital stay with TSH 6.6,Free T4 1.1.
# Pathologic pelvic fx/leg fracture: Once admitted to the floor and the patient's pain was appropriately managed, a CT pelvis was obtained which revealed left femoral neck fracture and soft tissue density mass within the mid femoral diaphysis.
Skeletal survey showed multiple lytic lesions in femurs, pelvis, and humeri and pathologic subacute humerus fracture.
Differential included brown's tumor vs. metastasis vs. myeloma vs. lymphoma.
Brown's tumor felt to be most likely given clinical history.
# CAD s/p CABG: During this admission, patient had an episode of epigastric pain, not his anginal equivalent.
He says that his anginal equivalent prior to CABG was shortness of breath with exertion and right shoulder pain.
EKG was done with epigastric pain and was unchanged.
No further chest pain.
The first portion showed severe inferior perfusion wall defect presumed to be fixed on these rest images and dilated LV and global hypokinesis.
He refused the second portion as he says that he had a bad reaction to dipyridamole in the past.
# Afib with RVR:  On admission, the patient reported a history of a fast HR.
This admission he has had multiple episodes of RVR with ventricular rate in 140s.
During the initial episodes of rapid ventricular response he remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic with good response to IV diltizem; however due to uptitration of BB and CCB he had an episode of bradycardia and hypotension requiring transfer to the CCU for pressors briefly and then monitoring.
He was not taking anything for DM as an outpatient.
# Systolic CHF, decompensated: Initial physical exam revealed 4+ pitting edema in legs bilaterally.
ACEi was held due to hypotension and renal failure.
He continued to have good O2 satts and no trouble breathing.
However, on [**8-2**], increasing swelling on bilat LE was noted, and pt was started on lasix 40mg PO qdaily.
The patient diuresed well with 1-1.5 L neg each day, a 20lb weight decrease and a significant reducion in lower extremety edema over two weeks.
# CKD, stage III/IV: The patient's renal function remains at baseline.
Kidney disease is likely due to hypercalcemia and diabetes.
A renal US was done which showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis.
He was continued on a low dose ace inhibitor initially, but with high potassium and borderline BP, the ACE was held.
# Anemia: Microcytic.
Low iron & TIBC, eleveated ferritin.
Guaiac positive intermittently.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Pathological Left Pubic Ramus Fracture.
Pathologic subacute right proximal humerus fracture.
Multiple lytic lesions throughout.
3.9 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm left inferior parathyroid adenoma.
