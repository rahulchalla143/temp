Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Resection of R cerebellar mass with placement of right intraventricular, occipital drain.
History of Present Illness: 85 yo male with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD, CHF, COPD and a hx of prostate ca who initially presented to [**Hospital3 29818**] on [**2177-11-16**] with mild confusion, increasing SOB over several days, unresponsive to his COPD medications and N, with vomiting.
His EKG was notable for a RBBB but did not show any changes to prior.
His CXR was notable for RLL patchy infiltrate and LLL consolidation.
He was thought to have a CAP with superimposed CHF and possible exacerbation of his COPD.
On [**11-17**] he was was found to be increasingly confused and noted to be exhibiting bizarre behavior.
A head CT was done and showed 5X2cm R cerebellar hemorrhage with mild mass effect.
2u FFP, vi K, dilantin load and lasix and nitropaste for edema associated with FFP transfusion.
Past Medical History: 1 Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin 2 CAD s/p CABG in [**2168**], s/p MI 3 CHF (Last Echo in '[**74**] showed right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (63mm gradient) consistent with cor pulmonale), mild mitral regurgitation.

There were no stigamata of recent bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course: Here, on the [**11-17**], the pt had a right cerebellar craniotomy that revealed a cerebellar hemorrhage as well as a mass in the R cerebellum.
He had removal of mass and a placement of a right intraventricular, occipital drain in OR.
The pathology revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with small cell carcinoma, concerning for small ca of lung/ neuroendocrine ca or less likely melanoma or lymphoma.
That revealed multiple mass lesions within the liver, mediastinum, lung, pelvis, and left inguinal region, concerning for diffuse metastatic disease.
One large lesion within the pelvis is contigous with the prostate, possible exophytic prostate lesion or a metastatic focus invading into the prostate.
Also, bilateral pleural effusions were seen.
The occipital intraventricular drain was removed on the and a right anterior ventricular drain placed on the [**11-18**], b/o a new component of cerebellar hemorrhage involving the vermis.
He continued to improve in his mental status although to remained with severe dysarthria and dystaxia due to his cerebellar lesion and involvement of other cranial nerves such as the hypoglossus.
Further management of the underlying cancer was discussed with the pt and he refused radiation of chemotherapy and requested comfort care.
