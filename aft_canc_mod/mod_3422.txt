She reports nausea pretty well controlled.
Pt denies evidence of blood in stool or with BMs.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic melanoma with known lung metastases Hypopituitarism secondary to ipilimumab tx Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Hypertension Atrial fibrillation s/p ablation [**2149-2-5**] h/o DVT &PE s/p IVC filter [**2144**] h/o catheter-associated IJ thrombus [**2150-2-11**] s/p Cholecystectomy s/p tonsillectomy s/p C-section Thyroid nodule Osteoporosis Vitamin D deficiency  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2140**]: diagnosed with right shoulder melanoma - [**2145-3-21**]: presented with hemoptysis, bilateral DVT, PE, lung mass biopsy revealed metastatic melanomam.
IVC filter placement.
- [**2145-9-20**]:  enrolled in MDX-010/ipilimumab study - [**2146-5-22**]:  CT evidence of disease progression with enlarging right paratracheal and retrocaval nodes - [**2146-6-21**]: restarted MDX-010, completing 3 cycles of therapy.
Follow-up CTs showed minimal interval progression - [**2147-9-21**]: began ipilimumab on compassionate access trial, found to have autoimmune hypophysitis [**1-22**] ipilimumab and protocol was subsequently discontinued.
She was found not to have the specific BRAF mutation.
- [**2148-3-21**]:  started phase 1 RAF265 clinical trial with dose reduction x2 for nausea, vomiting and neuropathy.
- [**2149-2-5**]:  therapy held due to atrial flutter unrelated to study drug, requiring cardiac ablation on [**2149-2-11**].
- [**2149-12-1**]:  CT showed disease progression with peritracheal pleural-based and retroperitoneal metastatic foci with several new right pleural and diaphragmatic foci.
She received [**8-4**] doses on week 1, complicated by tachycardia and pulmonary edema.
Family History: Mother had breast cancer and died of PE at age 62.
Father died of an MI at 61.

Overall, worsening disease burden with increase in right lower lung pleural lesion with multiple new mesenteric nodules as well as metastatic lesions within the ascending colon and small bowel.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Right paraaortic lesion is stable.
Soft tissue nodules in the anterior abdominal wall appear smaller.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 54F with metastatic melanoma s/p treatment with ipilimumab with complicating hypophysitis presenting with fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain.
Initially thought due likely secondary to combination of anemia and dehydration from poor PO intake.
Pt recieved IVF and 1unit PRBC, but to minimal relief of symptoms of nausea and fatigue.
Patient also had intermittent low grade fevers around 100.5 during admission initially thought to be from atelectasis.
Patient's prednisone was increased from 5mg to 10mg to improvement of fatigue and nausea.
During admission patient was noted to have LLE DVT and started on subQ Lovenox.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # FATIGUE/NAUSEA: Initially thought to be from combination of dehydration and anemia.
Patient has hypophysitis [**1-22**] previous treatment with ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma.
Patient's prednisone was increased from 5mg to 10mg to improvement of fatigue and nausea.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Likely combination of progression of disease and adrenal insufficiency.
CT Abd/Pelv demonstrated multiple new mesenteric nodules as well as metastatic lesions within the ascending colon and small bowel with no evidence of bowel obstruction.
At discharge, patient's pain was controlled on morphine.
# LOW GRADE FEVERS: Initially thought to be be related to atelectasis; Had been unlikely that pt had PNA in setting of no leukocytosis and no coughing.
Pt was at high risk for PE, but recent scans had been negative.
No source of infection had ever been found.
However, BS were noted to be persistently low likely due to decreased PO intake so Lantus was titrated downwards.
After resolution of nausea and lethargy, patient began to take POs again and Lantus was again titrated.
# SINUS TACH: Chronic baseline in 100-110s, with bursts to 140s with minimal exertion during admission.
Pt with h/o aflutter s/p ablation seen by cardiology with persistent sinus tach on diltiazem.
Unclear origin but chronic tachy in 100-110s documented >6months.
No evidence of DVT and holding off on CTA to r/o PE as pt had CTA a little over a week ago negative for PE.
# HYPOTENSION: One episode of SBPs down to 80s on [**8-13**], improved to SBPs 90s-120s with better HR control and s/p small IVF boluses.
# R PLEURAL EFFUSION: on CXR, likely in some part related to known melanoma mets to the R lung.
Seems most likely to have atelectasis as well and seems less likely underlying infiltrate.
Pt was intermittently with small O2 requirements (up to 2L NC), but easily weaned to RA with sats in mid to high 90s.
# CONSTIPATION: Despite bowel regimen of docusate, senna, and miralax, patient was intermittently constipated throughout admission.
# ANEMIA: Pt with new anemia since 6/[**2149**].
Prior Hb 10-12 range without any evidence of anemia prior to 1/[**2149**].
Pt with guiac positive stool per OSH report.
Pt without hematochezia or melena.
Recent iron studies [**2150-7-28**] more c/w anemia of chronic disease: iron mildly low with normal ferritin and low TIBC.
Unclear that this normocytic normochromic anemia would be from blood loss via GI tract.
Hemolysis labs unremarkable.
Retic count not elevated and seems more c/w anemia of inflammation.
Spoke with GI regarding scope for workup of possible melanomatous mets to bowel as cause of guiac + stool and they said that in setting of hemodynamic stability and stable H/H, will set up with OP f/u with GI first in clinic and then to get scope.
INACTIVE ISSUES: # Metastatic melanoma: no current treatment.
# Neuropathy: chronic likely [**1-22**] chemotherapy, continued neurontin # GERD: continued ranitidine  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # [**Month/Day (2) 269**] to visit patient for Lovenox teaching # f/u with GI for clinic evaluation in order to set up scope to evaluate of intestinal mets from melanoma as cause of guiac + stool ([**2150-8-26**]).
# f/u with OP oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**2150-8-26**]) # f/u with endocrine re: hypophysitis with adrenal insufficiency ([**2150-8-25**]) # f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] re: insulin dosage.
# Pt's iron supplementation discontinued on discharge as it was contributing to significant constipation and pt's anemia workup seems most c/w anemia of chronic disease so iron supplementation unlikely to help.

You had issues with a fast heart rate during your hospital stay, although this seems to be a chronic issue.
Despite these treatments, you continued to feel vague symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain and fatigue.
When we increased your prednisone (which acts in a similar way to cortisol), your symptoms seemed to dramatically improve.
With improvement of your fatigue, abdominal pain and nausea, we discharged you on day 12 of your hospital stay.
