History of Present Illness: HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] presents with her daughter with 3 month history of worsening nausea, weight loss and decreased appetite.
On arrival, she was also found to have nausea and abdominal pain at which time a pelvic mass was discovered on exam.
She underwent CT evaluation and received IVF and pain meds.
Her abdominal and back pain improved with vicodin and darvocet.
Following her discharge on [**9-13**], she was informed by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] that this was likely an ovarian malignancy but that she should undergo colonoscopic evaluation.
Continues to experience abdominal pain, confirmed to have a large pelvic mass, 16cm, and small lesions in liver (cannot characterize) and uncinate process.
Per Med consult, she has a history of angina (but has not had to use NTG for the past few months).
She is able to do all ADLs and walk around a mall without CP or SOB.
Denied any recent RVR episodes or CHF hospitalizations (maintained on 40mg [**Hospital1 **] of lasix).
Family History: No hx of colon, breast, ovarian CA Mother had hodgkin's disease Father had oral cancer with mets.
HEENT: no thrush, no [**Doctor First Name **] Breasts: no [**Doctor First Name **], no masses, no nipple discharge or inversion LUNGS: CTAB CVS: RRR, no murmurs Back: tenderness elicited at the level of lumber spine along bony processes.
No bruising seen.
Firm, non-mobile mass in lower quadrants tender to palpation but no rebound or guarding.
RECTAL: deferred (guaiac neg per ED resident) BIMANUAL: deferred (pt uncomfortable at the time) LE: 1+ pitting edema up to mid-calf in LLE.
No palpable cord or tenderness.
Ecchymosis along medial aspect of right knee and shin mildly tender to palpation.
No limited ROM of kness bilaterally.
No effusion or swelling of knees bilaterally.
Lymph node, left external iliac (F-H): No malignancy identified (0/2) nodes.
Segment of bladder dome (I and Z): Malignant mesothelioma involving bladder wall and undermining the mucosa.
The tumor does not appear to arise from bladder mucosa and no in-situ carcinoma is seen.
Peritoneal tumor (J): Malignant mesothelioma in adipose tissue.
V.  Bladder, vagina, and pelvic mass (K-R, X-Y): Malignant mesothelioma extending into vagina and bladder walls.
The tumor does not appear to arise from the vaginal or bladder mucosa and no precursor lesion is seen.
Segment of small bowel (S-T): Malignant mesothelioma involving serosa of small intestine of bowel.
The tumor does not arise from the bowel mucosa and no precursor lesion is seen.
[**10-11**] CXR: REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
There is no CHF.
There is minimal vascular engorgement which is stable.
Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle with adjacent lung opacity is unchanged, due to small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
[**10-10**]: LENIs FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed bilaterally.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**10-8**] LENIs RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
There is no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
New small bilateral pleural effusion with associated atelectasis (left greater than right).
Small amount of ascites which has slightly increased in size since the prior study.
Pelvic loculated fluid collection that may represent an organizing postoperative fluid collection/ hematoma.
No evidence of colitis, free air, pneumatosis or bowel obstruction.
Large heterogeneous, lobulated pelvic mass seen, most likely of gynecological origin.
Less likely considerations include lymphoma (although very unlikely given no lymphadenopathy identified elsewhere), or bladder origin.
Marked extrinsic compression of sigmoid colon, without evidence of obstruction.
Right sided hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter.
Small hypoattenuating lesions seen within the liver.
Poorly defined low attenuation lesion in uncinate process of pancreas, incompletely evaluated on this study.
Mild dilation of colon proximal to mass.
On [**9-24**], a CT guided biopsy was performed which showed features suggestive of an unusual ovarian adenocarcinoma.
The staining pattern suggests clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, or possibly metastatic endometrial carcinoma.
The patient was admitted to the ICU postoperatively given 2 minutes of hypotension during surgery.
Pan-sensitive pseudomonas returned in urine, wound and JP drainage.
A CT scan was performed which demonstrated a post operative fluid collection vs hemotoma vs. organizing infection.
A repeat urine culture pending at time of discharge; but no bacteria present on urinalysis.
The patient experienced acute dyspnea on postoperative day 9 during a blood transfusion.
It was unclear the cause of the hematocrit drop: slow bleeding from operative site vs hematoma.
The patient was transfused [**12-25**] unit of blood before hemolytic reaction occurred (see below).
Her postoperative HCT remained stable daily after the hemolytic reaction (bewlow) at 29-30.
-Hemolytic Reaction:  The patient experienced an acute hemolytic reaction manifested by acute onset of dyspnea on postoperative day 9.
Due to the patient's acute pulmonary distress and elevated respiratory rate to 40, a code Blue was called to facilitate any need for possible intubation.
No intubation or cardiac resuscitation was needed.
#Cardiac: The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation prior to surgery.
A medicine consult was called preoperatively for assessment of her cardiac function.
# Pain: Patient had high level of post-operative pain treated with morphine PCA which was transitioned to PO due to patient somnolence.
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated following surgery to 1.6 attributed to multiple transfusions intraoperatively.
# Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine continued .
# Code: Full, confirmed w/ HCP  #Dispo: Patient discharged on [**10-16**] with VNA services, ostomy care, and follow up with Urology, INR checks to be followed by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 39209**] and Thoracic oncology.
