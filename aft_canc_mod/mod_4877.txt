NA/QRS 110.  e/o LVH by voltage criteria.
no ST or TW changes noted, poor baseline.
[**6-20**] Echo: Biatrial enlargement.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
Critical aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation in the setting of moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Likely extravasation of IV contrast material into the sigmoid colon from a colonic diverticulum, accounting for the patient's bright red blood per rectum.
Concentric wall thickening within the distal descending colon could relate to the stated history of a colonic mass.
Slight wall thickening with intraluminal fluid involving the rectum and distal sigmoid colon is most consistent with proctocolitis.
Bibasilar septal thickening could be secondary to mild pulmonary edema or mild fibrosis.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Small splenic hypodensities, too small to characterize.
Similarly, multiple small bilateral renal lesions are too small to characterize, although these lesions are likely simple cysts.
Marked atherosclerosis with moderate stenosis of the SMA origin.

Macroscopic Tumor Perforation:  Not identified.
Histologic Grade:  Low-grade (well or moderately differentiated).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Margins     Proximal margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  210 mm.
Distal margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  320 mm.
Circumferential (radial) margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  65 mm.
Treatment Effect:         No prior treatment.
Lymphatic Small Vessel Invasion:  Absent.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "left colon, 2 stitches = splenic flexure, one stitch = rectosigmoid, one long stitch = inferior mesenteric pedicle".
It consists of a segment of colon that measures 52 cm in length and up to 5.5 cm in diameter.
The surgeon has designated two stitches as the splenic flexure, one stitch as the rectosigmoid, and a long stitch designating the inferior mesenteric pedicle.
A palpable mass is present within the bowel.
The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal a fungating ulcerated mass within the lumen that measures 4 x 3 cm.
Serial slices show that the tumor does appear to invade the muscularis propria and mesentery and is 1.5 cm deep.
No perforation is present.
The specimen is represented as follows:  A = the polyp which has been shaved from the mucosal surface, B-E = representative sections of tumor (full thickness), with B and D containing the deepest point of invasion, F = diverticula located 15 cm from the splenic flexure surgical margin, G = two additional representative diverticula, H = unremarkable bowel wall, I = possible lymph nodes at the inferior mesenteric pedicle, J = surgical margin at the splenic flexure, K = surgical margin at the rectosigmoid, L-T = lymph nodes.
Free air is seen in a reasonable amount five days after surgery.
Free peritoneal fluid is observed.
While the largest pocket is located in proximity to the anastomotic site; the absence of air in this fluid and the fact that the fluid is low in density make a leak less likely, although this cannot be entirely excluded.
No findings to suggest anastomotic leak.
Stable size of bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
Diffuse anasarca.

# Lower GI Bleed - Hemorrhagic mass seen at OSH on colonoscopy, not actively bleeding that appeared consistent with adenocarcinoma (biopsies pending....).
While in the MICU, me was transfused as needed to maintain a hematocrit goal of 25 (given concerns for heart stress related to his aortic stenosis).
Surgery and cardiology were consulted, and the patient was sent for valvuloplasty in order to prepare him for colon resection .
# AS - presumed new diagnosis, critical.
He was asymptomatic while in the MICU under careful observation.
# Atrial Fibrillation - currently in atrial fibrillation on EKG.
# H/o CHF - patient exhibited no signs of volume overload while admitted to the MICU.
# Hypocalcemia - ionized Ca 0.66 on admission, likely due to multiple transfusions at the outside hospital.
He received calcium gluconate 4g with subsequent improvement.
# Arthritis - Tylenol prn pain, remained stable throughout admission.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ Mr. [**Known lastname 88840**] care was transferred to the Acute Care team on [**2148-6-21**] when he was taken urgently to the OR for left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis; biopsies were obtained of the mass in his sigmoid.
He was also noted with tachycardia and was given extra metoprolol.
On [**6-26**] he was noted with episode of unresponsiveness and hypotension; there was concern for anastomosis leak.
He subsequently was noted with several more trigger events over the course of 3 days with hypotension, tachycardia and desaturation.
Following the 3rd trigger event there was concern again for anastomosis leak and he underwent CT imaging of his abdomen which did not show any leaking; it did however show a possible stricture at the anastomosis.
A KUB with contrast was ordered to determine if the contrast went all the way through this area results revealed some passage of contrast and dilated loops of bowel representative of an ileus.
He was noted with hematuria on [**7-6**] requiring that a Foley be replaced for irrigation and monitoring purposes - this did resolve; his hematocrit remained stable with 30 being the last value on [**7-8**].
He was however noted with significant scrotal edema and his LE edema had increased.
Cardiology was re-consulted and recommended Lasix 40 mg every other day; they further noted that his albumin was likely contributing to his edema as well.
Heme/Onc was consulted for follow up as an outpatient to discuss with patient if treatment options indicated.
Bleeding sigmoid adenocarcinoma 2.
Rapid atrial fibrillation 6.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia 7.
Acute on chronic heart failure (left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed LVEF= 45-50 %)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admited to the hospital because of bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract requiring an operation.
It was also noted during your operation that there was a mass concerning for cancer in your colon.
The biopsy results did revela that it was a cancerous tumor which was discussed with you by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during your hospital stay.
You are being discharged on medications to treat the pain from your operation.
These medications will make you drowsy and impair your ability to drive a motor vehicle or operate machinery safely.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have any of the following:    * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or  tightness.
* New or worsening cough or wheezing.
* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your  medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting,  diarrhea or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry  mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a  bowel movement.
* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 101.5 (F)  degrees or 38(C) degrees.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that  concern you.
You may resume moderate exercise at your discretion, no abdominal exercises.
If there is clear drainage from your incisions, cover with clean, dry gauze.
Please call the doctor if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision sites.
