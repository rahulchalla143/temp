[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Colectomy, sigmoid colon (S-Z, AA): -Diverticular disease with focal diverticulitis and peridiverticulitis with scarring, acute and chronic inflammation, stricture formation and clinical history of bladder fistula.
CYSTOGRAM ([**Numeric Identifier 34386**], [**Numeric Identifier 34387**])  [**2154-7-2**] No evidence of contrast extravasation or fistula  CTA CHEST/ABD/PELVIS W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2154-7-3**] 11:48 AM 1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Small bowel obstruction with a transition zone in the region of the mid ileum.
Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2154-7-5**] 9:16 AM No evidence of obstruction.
No evidence of perforation   Brief Hospital Course: Patient underwent right colectomy on [**6-27**], At the time of operation, the patient was noted to have advanced sigmoid diverticulitis with a phlegmon and clinical [**Last Name (un) **]-vesical fistula.
He was being prepared for discharge but on the evening of POD#6, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation, hypotension and the need for transfer to ICU.
CTA chest was negative and the CT w/ IV (no oral) contrast showed no collection/leak in the abdomen.
He did have evidence of postoperative ileus so a nasogastric tube was inserted with copious output.
It was felt that some of his hemodynamic issues related to dehydration from poor absorbtion of his liquid diet.
A course by systems follows:  NEURO: Pt was A/O throughout hospital stay, pain was controlled with PCA pump and pt.
BiPap held intially secondary to ileus and gastric/intestinal distention from the BiPap.
At noght, w/o BiPap developed mild respiratory acidosis 2nd to CO2 retention, but again this resolved.
CXR showed atelectasis expected 2nd post op, but no other acute cardiopulmonary issues throughout hospital stay.
Pt had [**Doctor First Name **] for LGIB and obstruction w/ T3N2 adenocarcinoma of cecum.
CT on [**7-3**] was remarkable only for transition point of ileus, no leak or other abnl.
KUB prior to d/c showed no evidence of obstruction or perf.
Heme/Id: Pt remained afebrile and only had minor bump in WBC to 11.2 during ileus, never required Abx therapy.
GU/FEN: Mild bump in BUN/Cr during episode of ileus, likely secondary to hypotn and hypovol, responded well to fluid and has returned to baseline of Cr 0.9 upon D/C.
