Right-sided high frontal craniotomy (redo for     lobectomy/resection).
Microscopic dissection.
Osteoplastic trepanation.
History of Present Illness: The pt is a 64 year-old right-handed male with history of oligodendroma, found in 07 , s/p resection, stable at least since [**12-9**], first presented in SE (long ICU stay c/b PEs and VAPs), seizure disorder, HTN, hypothyroidism, DM2 and hyperlipidemia who presents with multiple brief episodes of "freezing up" and difficulty producing speech for ~3-5 days, with increasing frequency over the last 2 days.
He first noted brief episodes of difficulty producing speech.
These episodes were only a couple of times a day on Wednesday, but continued to increase in frequency and by the weekend he was having many (he couldn't quantify but said more than 20 a day).
He did not experience any [**Year (2 digits) **] laceration or bladder/bowel incontinence.
He returned to his baseline immediately after these events and did not believe he had any confusion or lethargy.
His muscles are tensed but they are reposition-able and will intermittently follow commands, but stated "it takes a lot of concentration"  There is no eye deviation.
He does breath rapidly during these episodes, but no vital changes were noted on telemetry.
He has had various problems with this taper, particularly he be lives his appetite is worse the less Ativan he takes.
He did have an admission last year for seizures with a more atypical semiology which involved a feeling of difficulty moving, associated with garbled speech, a feeling of doom, and abdominal sensations.
There was no loss of consciousness during these episodes, which never lasted more than 30 seconds.
The EEG monitoring during admission showed correlation of these episodes with "electrographic seizures... of right frontal origin."
On neuro ROS, the pt [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.

Able to walk in tandem without difficulty.
Post-surgical changes within the right frontal lobe, with an area of encephalomalacia and hypodensity within the right frontal lobe.
Assessment for residual mass cannot be determined on this unenhanced study.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
[**3-18**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2198-12-29**], there is little interval change.
Hyperexpansion of the lungs is again consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
[**3-24**] MRI brain IMPRESSION: Unchanged or slightly decreased enhancement in the right frontal lobe at the site of previous surgery.
Unchanged FLAIR abnormalities compared to the previous MRI examination of [**2199-12-30**].
No mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.
[**3-26**] MRI brain IMPRESSION: Increased perfusion associated with the right frontal lobe resection bed.
Once again, recurrent tumor cannot be excluded.
EEG [**3-19**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to multiple electrographic seizures as described above in detail.
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations but did contain electrographic seizures in the seizure detection programs and additionally seen on review of continuous EEG.
The interictal background is notable for intermittent sharp waves phase reversing the bifrontal regions.
[**3-20**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to multiple electrographic seizures as described above in detail.
There were more than 50 additional electrographic seizures that were detected by seizure detection programs and also seen upon review of continuous EEG.
The interictal background is notable for intermittent sharp waves phase reversing independently in the bifrontal regions.
[**3-21**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to multiple electrographic seizures with either left or right parasagittal onset lasting approximately 20-30 seconds duration without obvious clinical correlate as described in detail above.
The interictal EEG is notable for sharp waves phase reversing independently in the biparasagittal regions.
This telemetry captured 11 pushbutton activations and contained multiple electrographic seizures.
[**3-22**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to multiple electrographic seizures, as detailed above.
Compared to the prior 24 hours, this EEG is mildly improved due to fewer electrographic seizures.
[**3-23**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to multiple electrographic seizures with onset in the right or left frontal region and duration up to 15-20 seconds.
[**3-24**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to frequent electrographic seizures, as described above.
These seizures appeared to begin at the frontal vertex, with spread to either right or left frontal regions.
There are interictal independent and synchronous bifrontal spike waves.
During the motor paradigm, no significant areas of activation are visualized adjacent to the right frontal mass lesion.
The language paradigm demonstrates activation areas at the right frontal lobe, adjacent to the mass lesion, possibly related with supplementary areas.
During the movement of the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] activation area is identified medially and adjacent to the mass lesion at approximately 4 mm of distance as described above.
Changes in the right frontal lobe and adjacent extra-axial soft tissues and bone at the surgical resection site, as described above.
The appearance can result from post-surgical changes with or without superimposed residual tumor.
followup evaluation, to assess for any residual tumor.
CXR: [**2200-4-3**] Right middle lobe pneumonia.
His EEG recording showed multiple electrographic seizures , most of them localized to right frontal area (prelim read).
Despite extensive medication titrations, he continued to have extremely frequent complex partial seizures, occurring at times more than 60-100 times per day.
There was therefore concern that his intractable epilepsy was due to potential regrowth of his tumor (as had been considered in the fall).
MR imaging was therefore repeated with arterial spin labeling and he was noted to have tumor progression.
A craniotomy was done and per the operative report "image-guided resection of the superior frontal lobe according to BrainLAB criteria.
The posterior medial margin of the tumor was left behind since a functional MRI scan had shown [**Last Name (STitle) **] and speech activation in the infiltrated the area."
Post-operatively, he was extubated without difficulty.
On post-op day # 3, he was noted to have a fever and was diagnosed with R sided pneumonia for which he is undergoing a 7 day course of Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV Q24H to be completed on [**4-9**].
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Seizure disorder 2) Brain Tumor s/p surgical resection 3) R sided PNA   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:intermittently encephalopathic Level of Consciousness: interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of seizures.
You underwent EEG monitoring which showed multiple subclinical seizures mostly arising from the location of original tumor in your brain.
You had transient drop of platelets and hence lyrica was stopped.
