Pertinent Results: [**2181-6-26**] 05:15PM BLOOD WBC-8.3 RBC-4.42 Hgb-12.7 Hct-40.6 MCV-92 MCH-28.7 MCHC-31.2 RDW-16.6* Plt Ct-267  CT [**2181-6-26**]: FINDINGS:  There is a left mixed-density frontal subdural hematoma visualized resulting in shift of midline to the right measuring 8 mm.
There is mild effacement of the adjacent sulci visualized.
The ventricles appear normal with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
No evidence of tonsillar or uncal herniation.
No osseous abnormalities visualized.
There are  bilateral carotid calcifications.
The visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses appear normal.
IMPRESSION:  Left acute on chronic subdural hematoma resulting in subfalcine herniation as described above.
No evidence of uncal or tonsillar herniation.
There is a bifrontal subdural hematoma and left parietal subdural hematoma resulting in effacement of the adjacent left frontoparietal sulci, mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and shift of midline to the right, measuring 1 cm to the right.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses appear normal.
There is abnormal pachymeningeal enhancement visualized without evidence of the leptomeningeal enhancement.
Bifrontal subdural and left parietal subdural hematoma resulting in mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and subfalcine herniation to the right as described above.
No evidence of tonsillar or uncal herniation.
Pachymeningeal enhancement.
Brief Hospital Course: Noncontrast head CT in the ED showed a 1 cm left acute on chronic subdural hematoma resulting in subfalcine herniation without evidence of uncal or tonsillar herniation.
A brain MRI was also completed to assess for interval changes of her previously diagnosed and treated meningioma, which showed no significant changes.
Thoracic surgery attending agreed to discontinue her lovenox at that time as she had been treated for a prior PE for atleast 6 months.
On HOD#2 she was transferred to the neurosurgical floor after a repeat head CT on [**6-27**] showed no significant interval changes.
Thoracic surgery was consulted to determine her need for anticoagulation or placement of an IVC filter given her prior h/o saddle embolus s/p lobectomy.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and negative LENIs bilaterally on HOD#2, it was decided that anticoagulation or placement of an IVC filter is not strongly indicated at this time.
