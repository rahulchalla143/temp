Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent EUA, ELAP, drainage of ascites, small bowel resection with ileal ascending colon anastomosis, transverse loop colostomy, tumor debulking, and bilateral ureteral catheterization on [**2184-3-1**].
1) CV: The patient went to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic monitoring secondary to hypotension during the procedure and extensive fluid shifts.
She also received albumin 25% 25g IV x 2 doses to maintain oncotic pressure, as well as multiple NS boluses.
An EKG was obtained and was notable for possible anterior Q waves as well as poor R wave progression.
An Echocardiogram was notable for mild left atrial dilation.
A V/Q scan demonstrated intermediate probability of PE.
A renal ultrasound was obtained and revealed no hydronephrosis.
It improved to 1.3 with Vitamin K but her PT remained elevated in the 14-15 range.
She then tested positive for lupus anticoagulant.
Hematology was consulted and she was started on Lovenox 30 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **] for prophylaxis.
Her LIJ catheter was removed on POD 4 secondary to purulent drainage and erythema.
6) Pain: The pt's pain was initially well-controlled on a fentanyl PCA.
7) Endocrine: The pt's TSH was checked as part of her tachycardia workup and was elevated at 7.7.
Endocrine was curbsided and felt that the labs were consistent with "post-ICU" hypothyroidism and recommended outpatient follow-up in [**2-25**] weeks with her PCP.
On the day of discharge, the pt was ambulating and tolerating PO's with pain well-controlled on PO medications and stable vital signs.
