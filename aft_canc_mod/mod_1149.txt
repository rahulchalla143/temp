Patient was originally admitted to [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital on [**2165-1-16**] with chest pain and a suggestion of subtle ECG changes.
Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.04-0.05.
She had reportedly been having intermittent chest pain for several days prior to admission as well as some mild disorientation.
While at OSH, she was put on IV heparin and nitroglycerin with resolution of her chest discomfort.
She also had transient dyspnea which was relieved with albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and BiPAP.
She was taken for cardiac catheterization yesterday morning at OSH which reportedly showed stability of her known coronary artery disease; specifically, there was a 90% stenosis at the ostium of D1, 10-20% in-stent restenosis in the LAD, and a proximal 40% RCA stenosis which had negative pressure wire testing.
Following the catheterization at OSH, she reportedly had some change in her mental status.
A head CT showed a 7 mm left-sided subdural hematoma along the cerebral convexity with 5 mm of midline shift at the septum pellucidum.
left subdural hematoma along the cerebral convexity.
She received IV morphine for complaints of a headache and became transiently hypotensive (SBPs in the 80s) with some worsening delirium; another head CT was unchanged compared to the one on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
She received insulin, dextrose, and kayexelate for mild hyperkalemia.
She received one bag of a platelet transfusion due to her recent antiplatelet therapy.
She was mildly somnolent but awakened easily and responded appropriately to questioning, though she was somewhat tangential and distractible.
Her repeat head CT showed no significant change in SDH, and her neuro exam had no focal deficits, so she was transferred to medicine floor for continued monitoring.
She said she has been having chronic intermittent headaches (she attributes it to her known meningioma), but currently she has no headache.
She has no other complaints.
No shortness of breath or chest pain.
No vision changes.
She had no sz, no loss of bowel and urinary control, no post-ictal confusion.

There is only minimal bowing of the septum pellucidum to the contralateral side.
Ventricles and sulci are slightly enlarged consistent with parenchymal volume loss.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity reflects chronic microvascular infarction.
Small calcifications are present in the basal ganglia bilaterally.
Hyperdense material seen within the intracranial vasculature suggests previous contrast-enhanced imaging study, presumably done at an outside institution.
There is a hyperdense extra-axial lesion seen within the left cerebello-pontine angle, measuring 11 x 16 mm, most consistent with a meningioma (provided history indicates that there was a previous diagnosis of intracranial meningioma).
There is no fracture.
Visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable except for minimal right sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening.
Head CT ([**2165-1-18**]- 20:26): No significant change.
Head CT ([**2165-1-19**]): No significant change.
Interval bleed in posterior fossa has resorbed and redistributed.
Extra-axial lesion at CP angle cistern c/w meningioma appears decreased in size and attenuation likely secondary to resorption and redistribution of posterior fossa blood.
ECG: ECG ([**2165-1-18**]- 16:17): Sinus rhythm at 69 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, T-wave inversions in I/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in II/III/aVF and V4-V6, J-point elevations in V1-V2 .
Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old woman was transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] after being found to have a left frontal subdural hematoma following diagnostic cardiac catheterization at OSH.
However, on day 5 off aspirin and plavix, patient developed substernal chest pain, and after extensive discussion with neurosurgery, we restarted aspirin at 162mg daily, and continued to hold plavix.
She was also started on phenyton 100mg Q8h for seizure prevention.
Patient had no headache either.
# Coronary artery disease: Patient has h/o coronary artery disease with PCI to LAD in [**3-/2159**] with drug-eluting stent.
Patient presented to OSH on [**2165-1-16**] with chest pain, and her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], at [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, and she had a cardiac catheterization on [**1-18**] which showed stable coronary artery disease (90% stenosis at ostium of D1, 10-20% instent restenosis in LAD DES, and 40% stenosis in RCA).
No intervention was performed.
Patient was then developed AMS while on a heparin gtt and found to have a subdural hematoma.
She was intially chest pain free during the intial part of her hospital stay here, but then developed substernal chest pain on [**1-22**].
EKG showed some dynamic changes, and trop-T increased from baseline 0.06 to 0.14 which then plateaued.
She then developed 2 more episodes of chest pain, each time responsive to sublingual NTG and morphine.
Patient was seen by cardiology who recommended to continue the current medical management, and give NTG prn for chest pain.
# Wheezing on exam:  Patient was found to have diffuse wheezing on lung exam.
She states she has had wheezing for many years.
She denies h/o asthma or COPD, but given patient's h/o smoking, question whether pt has a component of COPD.
# Chronic systolic CHF: OSH TTE from [**2163**] showed ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 35-40%) with severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral egurgitation.
Patient had no failure symptoms here in the hospital, and she was not on lasix.
# ESRD on HD:  Patient on hemodialysis Mon, Wed, Fri, which was continued during this hospital stay.
# Chronic anemia:  Baseline hct 34.
Likely multifactorial from ESRD and anemia of chronic disease.
# Diabetic ulcers on both feet:  Patient was noted to have an ulcer at left 1st toe, and another ulcer between the right 3rd and 4th toe.
Wound care was consulted who recommended further workup to rule out osteomyelitis.
We obtained a foot x-ray was concerning for osteomyelitis, but in a different location than her diabetic ulcers.
We also contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's podiatrist, who commented that patient was noted have purulent material draining from foot ulcer in the beginning of [**2165-1-8**].
She wore pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day: hold if diarrhea .
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q 8H (Every 8 Hours) as needed for headache.

Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Subdural hematoma Coronary artery disease .
Secondary diagnoses: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (M, W, F) Hypothyroidism Chronic systolic CHF DM2 hypertension hyperlipidemia prior TIA and stroke MRSA foot ulcers; recently started vancomycin at hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, no focal neurological deficits, stable subdural hematoma on head CT, alert and oriented.
