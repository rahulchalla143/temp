Patient was in his usual state of health until two days ago when he awoke at 4am with left arm weakness, clumsy left hand, and pain/paresthesias on his medial left arm.
His son, who is with him for exam, notes that he has also had new slurred speech, confusion, is talking slower than usual, and has some word finding difficulties.
This morning he called his PCP (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 86**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital) who was concerned he was having a stroke and told him to go to the ED.
At OSH ED, non-contrast head CT showed right frontal mass.
Patient is AAOx3, talking slowly but appropriately but with word-finding difficulty.
For cancer screening history, he states his most recent colonoscopy was 2 years ago, and was normal.
Denies h/o cigarettes.
Past Medical History: -CAD s/p angioplasty -HTN -Hyperlipidemia -H/O GI bleed (due to aspirin overuse) -Insomnia   Social History: lives at home.
Has never smoked cigarettes or used illicits.
Sister died of ovarian cancer (61 yo).
Language: Speech slow but fluent with good comprehension and repetition.
No dysarthria, occasional paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: +past-pointing on finger nose finger bilaterally (L>R), +ataxia with rapid alternating movements and heel to shin bilaterally (L>R)  Gait not tested.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2155-9-6**]: FINDINGS:  There is a focal lesion with heterogeneous enhancement, solid enhancing and non-enhancing components, in the right frontal lobe superiorly (series 14, image 21), which may represent either a single lesion or two adjacent lesions with mild surrounding edema and FLAIR hyperintense signal.
In the right temporal lobe, there is a larger lesion with heterogeneous enhancement and a few non-enhancing foci within, the lesion measuring 1.9 x 3.8 x 1.2 cm with mild surrounding edema.
A few smaller enhancing lesions are noted adjacent to this lesion.
The lesions demonstrate increased DWI signal intensity with some degree of low signal on the ADC sequence.
No large foci of negative susceptibility are noted within except for a tiny focus in the right temporal lesion.
No cerebellar lesions are noted.
There are multiple small periventricular FLAIR hyperintense foci noted adjacent to the frontal and the atria of the lateral ventricles, likely nonspecific in appearance.
The major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid air cells on both sides and in the left mastoid air cells.Small retention cysts/polyps are noted in the maxillary sinuses on both sides,incompletely imaged.
Multiple enhancing lesions as described above in the right frontal and the right temporal lobes with heterogeneous enhancement.
Possibilities include metastatic lesions, primary multifocal neoplasm such as lymphoma/glioma.
Though there is some degree of slow diffusion within these lesions and cortical involvement, the enhancement pattern does not resemble the usual subacute infarcts.
Right upper lobe, 4 mm peripheral nodule.
No prior studies are available for comparison.
Pleural plaques, consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
There is no evidence of mediastinal, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Small left adrenal nodule, measuring 1.2 x 0.9 cm, indeterminate in nature.
If further investigation is desired, MRI without contrast or a CT with washout protocol may be obtained.
No other masses or evidence of malignancy seen within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
[**2155-9-6**] Femur/Pelvic xray: Bones are mildly osteopenic.
There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine as well as involving both hip joints and symphysis pubis.
Several calcifications in the pelvis are consistent with phleboliths.
No displaced fracture or dislocation of the left hip is seen.
There is possibly a tiny left suprapatellar joint effusion and mild patellofemoral degenerative change.
No displaced fracture is or dislocation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 77M who presented to the ER with new neurological findings, a head CT showed a right frontal brain mass.
Overnight he had a witnessed tonic clonic seizure and received a Dilantin load.
He had Tod's paralysis post-ictal.
He also had a period of hypertension to 190/100 and received Hydralazine with good effect.
The MRI showed right frontal and temporal lesions that were concerning for metastatic lesions vs lymphoma.
A CT torso was also performed which showed a small lung and adrenal nodules.
On exam, it was noted there was some bruising and the patient c/o groin pain, a pelvic and femur xray were done and showed no significant abnormality.
He tolerated the procedure well with no complication.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5-10 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain RX *oxycodone 5 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth every four (4) hours Disp #*90 Tablet Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal and temporal masses Cerebral edema Seizure Lung mass Adrenal mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

**Your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
**You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
