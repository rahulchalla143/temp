She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.
no dysmetria or drift noted.
There is new and more pronounced edema in the left parietal lobe towards the vertex where there is some effacement of the adjacent sulci.
A right frontal burr hole is again seen.
There is no shift of midline structures, loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction differentiation and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable with mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses being clear.
Expected postoperative changes at right the occipital craniectomy site.
Apparently new edema with mild effacement of sulci towards the vertex raises the possibility of a new metastatic lesion.
MRI Head [**3-12**]: FINDINGS: Again postoperative changes are seen in the right posterior fossa with small amount of blood products at the surgical bed and a small craniectomy defect.
Small area of edema is seen in this region.
Small air bubble is identified secondary to recent surgery and mild surrounding slow diffusion is seen which could be related to surgery.
There is no definite residual enhancement identified in this region.
Again, a linear enhancement in the left cerebellum and multiple enhancing brain metastatic lesions are identified involving both frontal lobes, left parietal lobe.
These findingsare not significantly changed and surrounding edema has also not changed.
Mild diffuse hyperintensity in the white matter indicate post-radiation change.
Underlying edema and minimal superficial blood products are noted, but there is no evidence for new hemorrhage or increased mass effect.
There is edema seen within the left frontal and parietal lobes, which has not changed compared to study performed one day prior.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is a prior right frontal burr hole.
Expected postoperative changes at the site of right occipital craniectomy,with decreased mass effect upon the 4th ventricle.
Unchanged edema in the left parietal and frontal lobes.
Post operatively, the patient was monitored in the ICU for 48 hours due to lethargy and slight right sided arm weakness.
MRI did not show any increase ventricular size and subtotal resection of cerebellar mass.
On Post OP day 2 she was more awake, orientated X3 with slight right arm weakness.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-15**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
