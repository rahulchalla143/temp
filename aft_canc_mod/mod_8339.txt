Past Medical History: Mitral Regurgitation, s/p Mitral Valve Replacement PMH: Metastatic Breast Cancer on Fulvestrant and study drug Degenerative Disk Disease Mitral valve prolapse and severe mitral regurgitation Depression Hyperlipidemia Neck pain Osteoprosis Past Surgical History: right total mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and immediate reconstruction with [**Last Name (un) 5884**] flap removal of right ovarian cyst Umbilical hernia repair Right axillary lymph node dissection   Social History: No smoking, social alcohol use, lives alone in [**Location (un) 4628**].
Family History: Breast Cancer: Mother [**Name (NI) 3495**] Disease/MVP: Mother   Physical Exam: VITALS: 98.9, 84-99/53-57, 104-114, 20, 97% RA weight 60.6 kg GENERAL: NAD, comfortable while lying on bed HEENT: MMM, EOMI NECK: JVP at 12 cm LUNGS: CTABL, no crackles HEART: [**4-10**] holosystolic murmur heard best at apex with radiation across the precordium, RRR ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, NABS, no organomegaly EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e NEUROLOGIC: A+OX3  Pertinent Results: TTE [**2196-7-5**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe primarily posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of at least moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-5-26**], the posterior mitral leaflet is now flail, and the mitral regurgitation is markedly increased (at least moderate-to-severe, and likely frankly severe).
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Stable left hilar lymphadenopathy with central necrosis.
Mild congestive heart failure with new small to moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
New 10 x 12 mm nodule within the right upper lobe concerning for metastasis.
Worsening hepatic metastatic disease.
No angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
Systemic arterial normotension.
PFTs [**7-6**]: no pulmonary function abnormalities  Intra-op TEE [**2196-7-8**] Conclusions Prebypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe P2 leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
There is partial P2 mitral leaflet flail.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mitral valve.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is systolic flow reversal in left upper pulmonary vein.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] distance is 2.9cm and the A:P ratio is 1.03 as predictors for systolic anterior motion.
There is mild Tricuspid valve regurgitation with normal appearing valves, the tricuspid annulus is 3cm.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Trace valvular mitral regurgitation is noted.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

# SOB: Echo shows new mitral leaflet flail, with markedly increased mitral regurg.
The etiology of her SOB was [**1-7**] worsening mitral regurg with resultant volume overload/heart failure.
Pulmonary embolism was ruled out with CTA.
# Breast Ca: CTA showed increasing size of metastasis in the liver.
Oncology followed the patient while in house, and requested a biopsy of a metastatic lesion during open heart surgery given her radiographic disease progression.
The patient developed atrial fibrillation which converted to Sinus Rhythm with increase in beta blocker and Amiodarone.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
