Past Medical History: - Stage IIIC poorly differentiated primary peritoneal serous carcinoma - Thalassemia - Hypertension (per patient never treated with home medication, only when in hospital or seeing doctors) - Gastritis/Reflux  Oncologic history - CT abd/pelvis on [**2182-2-28**] revealed a large mass centered in the sigmoid colon with pelvic lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- A colonoscopy revealed a fungating, ulcerated mass within the sigmoid colon causing a partial obstruction.
The biopsy of this mass revealed adenocarcinoma with papillary formation, suggestive of an ovarian primary.
This was a suboptimal tumor debulking.
Extensive firm retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was appreciated.
There was no evidence of carcinomatosis.
Pathology examination revealed serous carcinoma involving full thickness of the rectal wall.
Seven of eight lymph nodes were positive for malignancy.
Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were negative for malignancy.
