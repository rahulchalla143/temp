Admission Date:  [**2151-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Examine under anesthesia with anoscopy Colonoscopy EGD   History of Present Illness: This is a 77-year-old Spanish-speaking Jehovah's witness with multiple medical comorbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's and dementia) who underwent hemorrhoidal surgery on [**6-4**], developed BRBPR 2 days later and was found to have Hct of 24 and INR on 10 (not on coumadin), stabilized in MICU and now transferred to the floor for further w/u of anemia.
The patient had outpatient hemorrhoidectomy without complications on [**6-4**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109605**] [**Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**] for chronic symptomatic hemorrhoids.
Per OP note, there were large partially prolapsing hemorrhoids with a significant external component in the right posterior and left lateral position which were removed with a electrocautery and LigaSure and a small right anterior hemorrhoid which was electrocoagulated because it was internal.
Three days afer the surgery, she began to develop BRBPR and rectal pain and presented to the ED for this on [**6-9**].
Her INR was found to be 9.9 although the patient reports to never having been on coumadin and was not taking any herbal medications or rat poison.
Heme-onc felt that her presentation and labs were consistent with ingestion of vitamin-K antagonist (found that factors 2,7,10 were low, 5,8,9, normal).
GI felt that her BRBPR was likely [**1-7**] lower GI but recommended endoscopy and colonoscopy to look for origin.
Endoscopy was unremarkable other than a polyp in the stomach and colonoscopy was remarkable for diverticulosis of the whole colon, several small (2-5 mm) polyps and ulceration in the rectum, the latter of which was thought to be the source of the patient's recent bleeding.
Her Hct on transfer from the MICU was 21.9 and the patient remained asymptomatic throughout.

Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
No gallstones and no biliary dilatation.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
[**6-15**] Colonoscopy: Findings:  Mucosa: Localized ulceration including 1 large ulcer was noted in the rectum in the area of recent hemorrhoidectomy.
Protruding Lesions Several 2-5mm small polyps were noted throughout the colon,  Excavated Lesions Multiple small diverticula were seen throughout the colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Impression: Ulceration in the rectum, which is likely the source of the patient's recent bleeding.
Small 2-5mm polyps in the colon Diverticulosis of the whole colon No fresh or old blood seen in the colon.
Impression: Polyp in the stomach Otherwise normal colonoscopy to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 77-year-old Spanish-speaking Jehovah's witness with multiple medical comorbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's and dementia) who underwent hemorrhoidal surgery on [**6-4**], developed BRBPR 2 days later and was found to have Hct of 24 and INR on 10 (not on coumadin), stabilized in MICU then transferred to the floor for further w/u of anemia and management of rectal and abdominal pain.
In the ED, she had a further episode of bleeding leading to Hct drop to 25 prompting transfer to the MICU.
[**Month/Year (2) **] with anoscopy showed "absolutely no evidence of bleeding at any of the [hemorrhoid] sites."
EGD was unremarkable with the exception of a polyp in the stomach.
However, colonoscopy was remarkable for diverticulosis of the whole colon, several small (2-5 mm) polyps and ulceration in the rectum, the latter thought to be the most likely cause of the patient's bleeding, although it is unclear why [**Name (NI) **] did not mention the rectal ulcers.
Patient is a Jehovah's witness thus wishes to not receive any blood products.
She never developed any symptoms of hemodynamic instability (HR 80s, SBPs 120s-130s) although did feel quite fatigued.
She will follow-up with GI as an outpatient regarding further management of her rectal ulcers.
We explained to her the importance of eating fiber and staying hydrated to prevent constipation leading to the development of more hemorrhoids or of anal fissures.
# Rectal pain: the patient developed severe rectal pain after her colonoscopy and anoscopy such that she had difficulty sitting and going to the bathroom.
We also started her on lidocaine and hydrocortisone cream, with minimal effect.
# Coagulopathy: on admission, the patient's INR was 9.9.
Factor deficiencies (2, 7, 10 low) and correction of INR with vitamin K were consistent with ingestion of vitamin-K antagonist.
Of note, she appears to have a baseline anemia with low/normal RBCs (mid-low 30s over past 10 years).
We thought her anemia was likely multifactorial in cause, include BRBPR and coagulopathy as described previously.
Her MCV was 94 but RDW was elevated, suggesting a combination of iron-deficiency from bleeding (though transferrin and were TIBC low, perhaps because there was not enough time to equilibrate) with macrocytic anemia.
We explored several causes of normocytic hypoproliferative anemia including endocrine disorders (hypo/ hyperthyroidism, panhypopituitarism, hyperPTH all associated with mild proliferative anemia.
The patient never had elevated calcium and we checked her TSH which was normal.
Heme-onc thought the most likely cause was nutrition deficiency thus she was started on folate and B12 supplementation.
We gave her 2 doses of PO iron after which she developed nausea and vomiting thus we switched this to IV iron, which the patient tolerated well.
# Abdominal pain: the patient had abdominal pain and abdominal exam was remarkable for diffuse tenderness without any peritoneal signs.
Had KUB x 2 since admission which showed no evidence of obstruction.
Labs were notable for slightly elevated AST, ALT, Alk-phos, GGT which did not provide a clear picture of the etiology bilirubin was normal).
Of note, she had an abdominal CT in [**2148**] which was normal (but did not have elevated LFTs then).
On this admission, she underwent a RUQ u/s which showed no stones in the gallbladder but was remarkable for fatty infiltration of the liver.
On discharge, abdominal pain was improved and LFTs were normal with the exception of slightly elevated alk phos at 118.
# Genital herpes: on the last day of your admission, you pointed out several small erythematous papules near your vagina, which appeared to be genital herpes.
These lesions were causing you minimal pain but were quite itchy and bothersome.
You told us that you had these lesions in the past inside of your vagina but had never been treated for them.

Several hours after arriving to the emergency room, you passed more blood from your rectum and your hematocrit dropped to a very low level, prompting your transfer to the medical intensive care unit.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was unremarkable, however a colonoscopy showed that you had a rectal ulcer, which we thought was the source of your bleeding.
You were transferred to the general medical floor about 1 week into your hospitalization where we continued to manage your anemia and also tried to help you with your rectal and abdominal pain.
We did a right upper quadrant ultrasound for your abdominal pain, which showed some changes in your liver (fatty infiltration) that we recommend you follow-up as an outpatient.
Upon discharge, you were having less pain in your rectum and abdomen.
Medication Changes 1) Please start taking 300 mg gabapentin daily for your rectal pain 2) Please use lidocaine and hydrocortisone cream as needed for your rectal pain 3) Please continue to get monthly IV infusions of iron for your anemia.
