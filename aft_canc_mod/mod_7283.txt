No organomegaly.
No suprapubic tenderness.
No focal CN deficits.
Approximately 12 cm segment of distal small bowel with circumferential wall thickening and mild associated mesenteric edema.
Findings are concerning for ischemic, infectious or inflammatory causes of small bowel enteritis.
Given the dense vascular calcifications, ischemic etiologies are favored.
However, the aortic branch vessels appear patent without focal thrombus.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4 cm in transverse diameter.
Duodenal diverticulum.
[**2162-8-9**] KUB: There is a non-specific bowel gas pattern with air seen in some loops of non-dilated small bowel as well as within the colon.
There are splenic artery calcifications.
There is no evidence of free air or degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Non-specific bowel gas pattern with no definite obstruction.
Again noted is a 15-cm segment of mid-distal ileum with wall thickening with edema and mild mucosal hyperenhancement.
3.8 x 3.7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Hepatic cysts as described above.
Duodenal diverticulum.
[**2162-8-12**] KUB (prelim report): There are mildly dilated gas-filled small bowel loops as well as decompressed colon with residual oral contrast.
There is no definite evidence of obstruction or free air.
Degenerative changes are noted in the spine.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated gas-filled small bowel loops.
No definite obstruction or free air.
[**2162-8-13**] CXR: The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, with the exception of a slight deviation of the tube at the level of the lower esophageal third, suggesting the potential presence of a hiatal hernia.
There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
Mild retrocardiac areas of atelectasis.
[**2162-8-14**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral lower extremities.
[**2162-8-14**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload (?
acute pulmonary embolism vs. acute on chronic pulmonary hypertension).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No evidence of obstruction or free air.
[**2162-8-18**]: KUB IMPRESSION:  Findings worrisome for worsening ileus vs partial or early full obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old woman with history of CAD s/p CABG, previous diagnosis of UC, PMR on low dose prednisone, and atrial tachycardia who was initially admitted to the Medicine service with abdominal pain, found to have SBO with concern for Crohn's, hospital course complicated by Afib with RVR with hypotension.
Her hospital course as follows by problems:  Partial SBO: Presented with obstructive symptoms and evidence of narrowing of a 12-15 cm segment of the ileum on CT and MRE.
Initial concerns for infectious vs. inflammatory vs. ischemic etiology; did not improve despite completely a course of Cipro/Flagyl.
Her symptoms did not improve the final read of MRE came back inconsistent with Crohn's so her IV steroids were tapered down.
She was kept NPO except meds with decompression with an NGT until her NGT output ceased; she continued to experience episodes of significant pain despite remaining NPO.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2162-8-20**] for exploratory laparoscopy with lap assisted small bowel resection.
There were no complications.
Afib with RVR: She has a h/o atrial tachycardia but no known AF and was noted with unstable episode on the medical floor with SBP 70 without any anginal symptoms to suggest acute coronary syndrome.
She was again was noted with intermittent episodes of hypotension as low as 68 systolic and was orthostatic while working with PT.
Her beta blocker does was decreased initially until an episode on HD#20 she was noted with Afib with RVR and was transferred to the ICU for a short period of time.
Hypoxia: Known right sided heart failure on nocturnal O2 that was exacerbated by volume resuscitation .During her hospital stay she required continuous oxygen therapy to maintain her saturations >93%  Anemia: She was followed by Hematology during her stay who recommended  B12 and iron supplementation once taking po's.
Given her low hematocrit she was transfused with 1 unit packed red cells.
