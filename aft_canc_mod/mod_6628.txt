Mechanical debridement of right mainstem bronchial tumor.
Therapeutic aspiration of secretions in the right middle and lower lobes.
History of Present Illness: 52 year-old female with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to hip and lung admitted with hemoptysis.
She underwent debulking of right mainstem endobronchial tumor on [**2126-2-20**] by rigid bronchoscopy; at that time, argon plasma injection with plan for repeat debulking in the future.
Post-procedure, she had cough productive wtih green/yellow sputum but otherwise felt well.
On day prior to admission, she had injection with photosensitive chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (Photofrin) with plan for debulking on Friday, [**2126-3-15**].
She had three episodes of hemoptysis.
SBP dropped to 60s during one episode of hemoptysis, and improved to low 100s after 3L IVF NS.
CXR 2V with numerous pulmonary nodules not changed from prior CT; no new consolidation or effusion; right chest portacath.
CTA chest was considered given risk for pulmonary embolism, but was not completed due to contrast allergy.
V/Q was also considered, but could not be performed due to scheduling.
She was seen by interventional pulmonology, who recommended intra-operative evaluation for active bleeding.
She was sent directly from ED to OR to have rigid bronch performed.
In the OR, noted to have extrinsic compression of right mainstem bronchus, polypoid mass in RLL, and several large blood clots in RLL.
Had one episode of hemoptysis productive of pink sputum.
She had minimal pain and received morphine 2 mg IV x 2. .
On arrival to MICU, patient reports intermittent cough with associated dyspnea.
Past Medical History: - Renal cell carcinoma s/p right nephrectomy with mets to lung and hip.
- left hip arthroplasty - history of a heart murmur - borderline hyperglycemia - TAH-BSO - motor vehicle accident in [**2103**] complicated by traumatic pneumothorax requiring chest tube and traumatic splenectomy.

There is no new parenchymal consolidation.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Grossly stable appearance of numerous pulmonary metastases, without new consolidation.
[**3-19**]: FINDINGS: Compared to most recent prior, there has been interval development of right upper lobe opacification and volume loss, concerning for collapse.
Right hilar mass is seen, which may be obstructing the right upper lobe bronchus.
IMPRESSION: Right hilar mass with complete opacification of the right upper lobe, concerning for postobstructive collapse.
[**3-23**]: COMPARISON: Prior study obtained the same day earlier at 12:10 p.m.:  No pneumothorax is demonstrated on the current study, and the findings are most likely related to a combination of healed fractures and pleural thickening.
Multiple masses are redemonstrated as well as right upper lobe collapse.

RUL mass - Large endobronchial tumor obstructing the right upper lobe takeoff and protruding into the right bronchus intermedius found during rigid bronchoscopy on [**3-12**].
- IP visualized clot and extracted it, and also performed a partial resection and coagulation of the obstructive lesion with subsequent improvement in RLL aeration - The patient was observed in the MICU for 6 days without incident, was taken back for bronchoscopy on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] for debridement and photodynamic therapy, see operative reports for details - During the last two procedures the [**Hospital1 **] was found to be patent, but the area behind the obstructing lesion was noted to be full of purulent secretions - These secretions were aspirated by the IP team, with concern for post obstructive pneumonia - Her oxygenation improved, and she was then transferred to the floor on [**3-18**] - She will be seen by the IP team in 2 weeks for follow up bronchoscopy, no further debridement took place during her admission  # Post obstructive pneumonia - She was started on a course of IV vanc/cefepime in the MICU, no culture data available from bronchoscopy - Completed an 8 day course of therapy on [**3-23**] - Consistency and frequency of purulent secretions improved over the course of her stay on the floor with no signs of recurrent or persistent pneumonia - Supportive therapies included albuterol and ipatropium nebs, guaifensin, chest PT, and frequent ambulation - On day of discharge, the patient was sat'ing in the high 90's on 2LNC at rest, with a desaturation to the high 80's off of oxygen while ambulating - Serial CXR's showed interval improvement in the aeration of the RLL, with persistent opacification of the RUL  #.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of your shortness of breath and coughing up blood.
A CT scan showed that you had multiple tumors in your lung, with one of them obstructing a main airway in your right lung.
The Interventional Pulmonologists were able to remove some of this tumor and help your breathing, but during one of the procedures they found that you had a pneumonia.
You were transferred to the Oncology floor where we treated your pneumonia with antibiotics.
