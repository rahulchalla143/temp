ICU Admission: Mr. [**Known lastname 81646**] is a 41yo M with history of renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain and lung, and AVR who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-2**] after femur fracture.
After surgery, he had hypoxia requiring NRB which was eventually weaned to nasal cannula.
Patient had a CTA of his chest on [**11-5**] which showed ground glass opacity in his right upper and middle lobes with consolidation of the left lower lobe and possible right upper lobe segmental artery embolus.
He was in the middle of 24 hour continuous EEG but had some difficult to control seizure activity with increased hypoxia requiring 10L via facemask and sinus tachycardia to the 140s.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient is able to answer some questions but has baseline expressive aphasia and periods of somnolence which limit his ability to respond.
He denies being in any pain and reports that his breathing feels ok. .

(3) Second craniotomy surgery to evacuate a subdural hematoma (4) Third craniectomy for Staphylococcus aureus infection.

Other Significant History: (1) Ascending aortic aneurysm repair in [**2107-3-17**] (2) Mechanical aortic valve replacement in [**2091-12-14**] on chronic anticoagulation with Coumadin ([**Hospital3 **], goal INR 2 - 2.5 at present) (3) Status post ischemic bowel resection in [**2091**] secondary to a clot after his aortic valve replacement while not adequately anticoagulated (4) Appendectomy at age 8.
Social History: He taught at the [**Location (un) **] of [**Location (un) 3844**], formerly a history professor, but now not working, given metastatic renal cell.
Family History: There was questionable lung cancer in his maternal great-grandmother.

IMAGING: # Head CT w/o contrast [**11-2**]: (prelim) No acute hemorrhage.
Areas of hypodensity, encephalomalacia in bilateral parietal lobes, chronic in appearance.
Ex vacuo dilation left lateral ventricle.
# C-spine CT w/o contrast [**11-2**]: (prelim) No acute fracture or malalignment.
# L hip, femur, knee Xray [**11-2**]: (prelim) acute fx involving mid-femur, displaced  Brief Hospital Course: 41-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, mechanical aortic valve on warfarin, presented with left femur fracture after a fall.
No neurological or vascular compromise on exam.
# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: with brain mets, complicated by seizures and aphasia.
Pt on complicated seizure regimine which was continued as below.
Neuro-onc met with family and recommended palliative care consult in context of poor prognosis and family variance in opinion about how situation should be managed.
# H/o seizures: had multiple seizures during last admission.
Initially given these meds with ativan for seizure control.
Negative for seizure activity.
Since patient was not taking POs due to aspiration risk and lethargy, his antiepileptic regimen was readjusted to entail IV medications.
He was not observed to have any seizures on this regimen.
# Mechanical aortic valve/supratherapeutic INR: for aortic stenosis.
# Sinus tachycardia: He has had intermittent sinus tachycardia since admission, sustained in the 120s at time of ICU transfer.
# Hypoxia: Increased oxygen requirement on day ICU transfer.
This is concerning for possible repeat aspiration pneumonia or may be related to questionable PE seen on CTA.
However, the new acuity of his desaturation would argue for possible new worsening PE versus the segmental area seen on [**11-5**].
Pulmonary edema is also a possibility but his lungs are currently clear and CXR is not consistent with this.
Pneumonia, s/p possible aspiration event: CTA [**11-5**] showed RUL/RML ground-glass opacities and LLL consolidation.
Thought that PNA contributing to acute hypoxia.

You were admitted to the intensive care unit where you were not given anything to eat by mouth due to concern for aspiration.
You were treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.
Of note, you also were found to have an infection called C. Difficile and are being treated with antibiotics.
