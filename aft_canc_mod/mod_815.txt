Admission Date:  [**2153-3-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-3-8**]   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, recently discharged from the hospital earlier this month, who was brought to the Emergency Room from rehabilitation with abdominal pain, fevers and hypoxia.
After the PEG tube was placed, there was note of abdominal discomfort.
The abdominal discomfort occurred for more than 48 hours after the PEG tube was placed.
She also noted some diarrhea as well.
The patient had previously been at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], treated for pneumonia amongst multiple medical issues.
Upon arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was found to have free air under the diaphragm on an x-ray, but this was thought to be secondary to the PEG tube placement, no surgical process was noted on CT scan.
The patient was noted to be hypoxic with a 90% oxygen saturation on a nonrebreather, and was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and treated for a multi-focal pneumonia.
She was also treated with Solu-Medrol for a pulmonary process.
It was thought either to be infectious pneumonia versus chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltrate versus congestive heart failure.
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased and she was transferred to the medical floor.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a baseline greater than 200,000.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
Congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 65% with some left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus.
History of lower extremity cellulitis.
Pulmonary hypertension.

CT of abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral consolidations, lymphadenopathy, cystic kidney, no fluid, unobstructed.
Pulmonary:  The patient was treated for multi-focal pneumonia with levofloxacin, Flagyl and vancomycin.
Solu-Medrol was added for possible chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltrate.
Oxygen was continued as needed for comfort.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a multi-focal pneumonia, initially treated with levofloxacin, Flagyl and vancomycin, which were then discontinued when she was made comfort measures only.
