Brief Hospital Course: 64yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, CHF EF of 40-45% on [**2-/2183**], DM presenting who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with palpitations and lightheadedness on [**1-18**] initially treated for possible PE with anticoagulation who was then found to have an gastric ulcer with down-trending hematocrit, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Upper GI Bleed:  Patient initally presented with lightheadedness and palpitations to an outside hospital.
She underwent a VQ scan which showed an indeterminate result and was started on anticoagulation.
She underwent an EGD and was found to have a gastric ulcer, 1.5cm in body of the stomach with overlying clot that was washed as clear as possible, no distinct vessel noted, injected with epinephrine and completely cauterized.
There were 3 chains of small varices at the GE junction, nonbleeding and she was started on Epo, IV iron, PPI gtt and octreotide gtts.
She was aware of the risks of end organ ischemia and possibly death if her blood counts become critically low.
She remained hemodynamically stable and denied abdominal pain.
She was advanced to clears and transferred to the medicine floor, however was noted to have a 6 point HCT drop and 2 black stools.
She then returned to the ICU for repeat EGD which showed the gastric ulcer with scant oozing.
She was also started on IV ceftriaxone for SBP in the setting of upper GI bleed in cirrhosis.
# R. knee effusion - Patient reported right knee pain on evening prior to transfer to the medicine floor and spiked a fever.
She was found to have small effusion on exam and xray.
LENI showed small Bakers cyst but no evidence of clot.
Patient reported history of gout and that current pain felt similar to prior flares.
There was low suspicion for septic process given polyarticular (also had right toe pain).
Knee effusion and discomfort thought to be due to gout flare vs inflammatory process vs volume overload contributing to discomfort.
However, given fever and warm knee, she was treated for presumed gout with low dose colchichine.
Pain improved prior to discharge.
Cardiomyopathy/CHF: Patient has history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with lowest EF 17-20% in [**2181**], last TTE in [**2-22**] showed EF 45-50%, likely improved function after stopping alcohol use.
Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Patient with history of alcoholic cirrhosis.
EGD on admission showed grade I nonbleeding varices.
Per patient she has no known history of encephalopathy (although does take lactulose) or ascities.
She was treated with antibiotics for SBP in the setting of upper GI bleed in cirrhosis.
