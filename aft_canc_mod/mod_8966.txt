In [**2124-11-16**], he experienced blood in his urine and was evaluated by his primary care physician and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] urologist.
The workup was negative and the hematuria has since resolved.

The movement of the tongue demonstrates areas of activation adjacent to the mass lesion at approximately 5 mm.
The language paradigm demonstrates the majority of the activation on the left cerebral hemisphere, likely related with dominance.
Unchanged mass lesion identified on the inferior aspect of the right frontal lobe, the DTI tractography shows deviation of the major fibers adjacent to this lesion.
Millimetric pulmonary parenchymal densities in the left lung as described.
Thickening of the descending colon and sigmoid and also the terminal ileum are suggestive of a colitis and terminal ileitis of uncertain etiology.
Multiple nonenlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are suggestive of a chronic inflammatory process involving the bowel.
Correlation with patient's symptoms and prior medical history is warranted in addition to direct visualisation at colonoscopy.
No evidence of a primary tumor.
[**4-5**] BRAIN MRI (WAND) - There is no short interval change with regard to the previously reported large centrally cystic, peripherally enhancing 4 x 4 cm mass involving the right frontal or insular lobe.
A relatively moderate perilesional vasogenic edema is likewise unchanged  [**4-5**] CT Head - s/p right craniotomy, post op changes, cerebral edema  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2125-4-6**] Status post right frontal lobe mass resection, expected post-surgical changes are seen with small amount of blood along the frontotemporoparietal region with persistent and unchanged vasogenic edema.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 49 year old male who was at work on [**3-31**] when he experienced left facial, arm and leg flushing sensation, followed by left facial twitching and loss of consciousness.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital via EMS and a Head CT revealed a right sided brain mass.
A MRI of the Brain was performed overnight which was consistent with right parietal brain mass.
Surgery for resection and biopsy of the new right sided lesion was discussed with the patient.
He had a seizure with left facial numbness and thick speech.
Neurology was consulted for help with managment of his seizure medications.
He tolerated the procedure well without complications.
A head Ct post op demonstrated post-operative changes and mild cerebral edema.
He was noted to have a left facial droop at nasolabial fold and pronator drift.
He also required dilaudid PCA for pain management.
5. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: right parietal brain mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
