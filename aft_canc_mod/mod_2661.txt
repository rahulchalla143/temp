Admission Date: [**2169-9-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2169-9-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-12-21**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old gentleman who was transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2169-9-6**] after a computerized axial tomography scan revealed a large left frontal cystic enhancing mass.
He had the computerized axial tomography scan due to right lower extremity tremors and difficulty with speech for seven weeks prior to admission, mild R side weakness and flat affect of about 3 months.
Mr. [**Known lastname 58058**] reported several episodes of word-finding difficulties which was becoming more progressive, and his wife - who is a psychologist - reported a flat affect.
On the day of admission, the patient developed right lower extremity periodic tremors.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for an ileostomy secondary to inflammatory bowel disease in [**2143**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
His father died of a coronary artery disease.
He was noted to have a slow thinking process.
He had some naming difficulties with things such as "coat."
There was no left-to-right confusion.
No problems with finger-to-nose.
RADIOLOGY:  A computer tomography showed a large left frontal cystic mass with minimal edema.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service where he underwent an magnetic resonance imaging - with and without gadolinium - which showed a large enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with moderate mass effect and subfalcine herniation; consistent with a  tumor, with also considering the possibility of an abscess.
A slight right facial droop was noted.
He had mild right drift.
It was discussed to do an open needle biopsy versus a craniotomy.
He was in no acute distress.
He was unable to verbalize immediately postoperatively and had a right facial droop which was unchanged.
He was able to move the left side spontaneously to command, but he was noted to have a right- sided hemiparesis at that time.
On his first postoperative day, he was able to move his left side spontaneously, and it was reported that he was able to move his right upper extremity and right lower extremity to comman very weakly.
Neurology/Oncology was consulted on [**9-10**], and his case was to be discussed in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic for the need to use chemotherapy versus radiation or both.
Glioblastoma multiforme; status post craniotomy for    debulking of tumor.
