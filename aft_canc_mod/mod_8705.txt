Admission Date:  [**2162-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**] Chief Complaint: lung nodules  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2162-12-1**] Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, left upper lobe wedge resection (lingular wedge resection), and mediastinal lymph node dissection  [**2162-12-2**] Right chest tube thorocostomy for hemothorax   History of Present Illness: 67 year old female with two right apical lesions and one left lingular lesion that have grown substantially in size over the past year and were shown to be FDG avid on PET scan.
Due to the inconsistent growth rate of left lingula versus right apical lesions, they are believed to be separate processes.
She is s/p mediastinoscopy complicated with mediastinal hematoma s/p evacuation and electrocautery control of a bleeding lymph node vessels as well as a right sided hemothorax s/p pig tail placement and removal with pathology of all lymph nodes negative for carcinoma.
Her right sided pleural effusion is small and stable on chest radiograph from [**2162-11-29**] following removal of the pig tail catheter.
She has baseline SOB and wheezing consistent with her known emphysema.
She continues to complain of shortness of breath unchanged.
Mild cough in the morning.
Denies erythema around mediastinoscopy site.
No chest pain.
No other complaints.
Brother - pulmonary fibrosis (unknown).

Lymph node, level 5, excision (F): No malignancy identified.
[**2162-12-1**] CXR: New moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, mediastinal widening,  large right pleural effusion, haziness of the hilar contours and vessels is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe opacities are consistent with atelectasis.
There is a left apical chest tube.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: very suboptimal image quality.
Compared to tracing #1, except for the decrease in rate, probably no other diagnostic interval change.
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
Large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has increased.
Left pneumothorax is very small.
Mild vascular congestion has worsened.
Left chest wall subcutaneous catheter is new.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate, nonhemorrhagic posteriorly layered right pleural effusion with associated right lung atelectasis.
Dominant right lower lobe nodule is stable whereas a 11-mm spiculated right upper lung nodule has been slowly increasing in size and is concerning for neoplasia.
[**2162-12-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate left and mild right pleural effusion with adjacent lung atelectasis is stable.
No pneumothorax.
[**2162-12-3**] CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again increased opacification in the left mid and lower zones consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Left chest tube is in place and there is no definite pneumothorax.
Right chest tube is also seen and there is no definite pneumothorax.
Right basilar and left apical chest tubes remain unchanged in position.
Bibasilar opacities are seen, with probable associated layering effusions and therefore likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.
Overall, the pulmonary vascularity appears slightly more well defined, suggesting resolving interstitial edema, although there is likely residual perihilar edema on the current examination.
Cardiac size is difficult to assess due to the airspace process at the left lung base, but likely is stable.
Left apical chest tube remains unchanged.
The right apical pneumothorax is either unchanged or even slightly smaller than on the previous study.
Persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may reflect changes related to recent removal of the chest tube versus a small effusion.
Patchy opacity at the left base likely reflects some atelectasis.
There is mild perihilar vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.
[**2162-12-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval removal of left apical chest tube with stable small left basilar pneumothorax.
[**2162-12-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval development of layering right pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
14 mm nodular opacity overlapping posterior end of right seventh rib is better evaluated on the prior chest CT.  An irregular nodule in the right upper lobe seen on chest CT is beyond the resolution of the radiograph.
Small right pleural effusion and minimal right lung base atelectasis are unchanged since [**2162-12-5**].
Left mid and lower lung opacity obscuring the left cardiac margins is due to a combination of atelectasis, effusion and post operative changes following resection of the lingular nodule is stable.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
[**2162-12-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No significant change from [**2162-12-8**] with continued expected postoperative change status post lingular wedge resection.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 102527**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where she underwent  Left VATS with a linular wedge resection.
She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was well controlled.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she remained stable until the early morning of post op day #1 when she suddenly became tachycardic and desaturated to the mid 80's.
Her chest xray showed a large left pleural effusion and atelectesis and subsequent CTA of the chest ruled out PE and confirmed a large right effusion.
Her chest tubes were removed without difficulty and she was much more comfortable.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.

* Check your incisions daily and report any increased redness or drainage.
If it starts to drain, cover it with a clean dry dressing and change it  as needed to keep site clean and dry.
Wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse, pat dry * No tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed * No lotions or creams to incision site * Walk 4-5 times a day and gradually increase your activity as you can tolerate.
