HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure.
The patient went to his primary care physician complaining of slight dyspnea on [**6-23**].
Chest x-ray revealed a right lung white out.
The patient continued to feel progressively more dyspneic at home with increasing oxygen settings.
He had increasing shortness of breath and cough with green sputum.
No fevers, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain at home.
The patient went to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath where he desaturated to 88% on 100% nonrebreather.
The patient was electively intubated for what was felt to be impending respiratory failure.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed which reportedly showed no pericardial effusion.
The patient went to computed tomography angiogram which showed severe bilateral pneumonia versus heart failure versus worsening cancer and was brought up to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
Metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2190-7-26**]; status post multiple chemotherapy regimens and pleurodesis.
Coronary artery disease.
Ventricular tachycardia.
Chronic right lower extremity scarring.
Intrathecal morphine pump.
The patient was electively intubated for worsening shortness of breath.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a muffled first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Pulmonary examination revealed loud rales and bronchial breath sounds bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities; right greater than left.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 117 beats per minute.
No other ST-T wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed a large right consolidation; unchanged from prior study.
A preliminary read of computed tomography angiogram revealed endotracheal tube in good position, artifacts, severe bilateral pneumonia versus cardiac failure, large pulmonary masses were present.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 60-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer with hypoxemia and respiratory failure, status post elective intubation.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's respiratory failure was felt to be due to his non-small-cell lung cancer complicated by a postobstructive bilateral pneumonia leading to increasing oxygen requirements and inability to oxygenate effectively.
Non-small-cell lung cancer.
