No pulmonary embolus.
Bilateral pleural effusions with centrilobular emphysema and ground glass opacities, the appearance may be due to fluid overload.
Focal punctate areas of consolidation are noted in the right upper lobe only.
Multivessel coronary artery calcifications and progression of extensive ulcerating plaques in the aortic arch.
EKG [**7-10**]: HR 96, PR 104, QTc 390, nl axis, a in III, flat T in III  Shoulder Films: Three views of the right humerus show a comminuted fracture of the neck of the proximal humerus with displaced associated fractures of the tuberosities of the humeral head.
No dislocation and the visualized right lung is grossly normal.
Little position change from previous exam [**2113-7-1**].
No liver pathology and no biliary dilatation seen.
Cholelithiasis with no sign of cholecystitis.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Small non-obstructing stone in the right kidney and small simple right renal cyst.
Echo [**7-12**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  CXR [**7-13**] FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-11**], there is some continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with little change in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Continued opacification of the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis at the left base.
Again supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F with history of neurofibromatosis, PVD, [**Date Range **], recent admission for humeral fracture in setting of mechanical fall treated conservatively (discharged 5 days prior to this admission) who presented with acute SOB.
# Shortness of breath: Pt met 2 SIRS criteria on presentation: leukocytosis (WBC 17), tachypnea, possible sources include pulmonary (?LLL opacity) or GI (diarrhea).
Given 750cc IVF in the ED and started on zosyn and levofloxacin empirically for possible infectious process.
Differential for SOB also includes: PE (considered in pt with recent humeral fracture) and recent immobility and right calf tenderness.
ACS (trop 0.02, but no chest pain or EKG changes), acute heart failure (BNP 17,500 (no prior), pulmonary edema on CXR).
She remained afebrile and abx were stopped.
A repeat CXR showed persistent pleural effusions and the patient was diuresed with moderate improvement She was started on 20mg PO lasix daily.
Additionally, she received chest PT and was started on inhaled steroids in setting of emphysema and persistent cough with sputum production.
She remained afebrile following transfer to floor.
Pt has history of BP in 200s on prior admissions in setting of med non compliance.
Patient without evidence of end organ dysfunction, no chest pain.
A beta-blocker was held in the setting of possible bacterial etiology to SOB and elevated lactate.
# Metabolic Acidosis/Lactate: AG 22, Lactate 7.0-->2.1 after 750cc IVF.
Most likely [**1-19**] to hypertensive emergency  # Tachycardia:  Patient had a run of supraventricular tachycardia that self-resolves and did not return after restarting beta-blockers.
# Right humeral fracture s/p fall: s/p comminuted fracture in setting of mechanical fall.Ortho saw patient and noted fracture healing well.
# Osteoporosis.
# Neurofibromatosis type II.
Stable no acute issues .
# Lichen sclerosis.
# Carotid stenosis s/p CEA of left ICA in [**2106**].
Right ICA with 80% stenosis as of [**2110**].
No acute issues.
Not on any medications, no acute issues.
# Cataracts.
Simvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 9475**] Care Center - [**Location (un) 3146**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypertensive Emergency with Secondary Pulmonary Edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came in due to shortness of breath and were found to have high blood pressure.
We believe your high blood pressure caused your shortness of breath.
