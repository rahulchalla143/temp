At the time she received general anesthesia, receiving perioperative clindamycin, and postoperative dilaudid for pain control.
On Monday she noticed progressive worsening of the rash, with temperatures at home max 101.3.
On [**2200-3-4**], she presented to NEBH where they found her to have a "diffuse maculopapular rash from head to toe which is confluent on the face, the neck, the torso, the back, and the lower legs.

VS 100.9 93 106/56 18, though SBP dropped to the 90s, but came up with 2L NS.
Derm was consulted and felt this was likely consistent with drug rash but could not rule out infection.
She endorsed some persistent itching/pain from diffuse morbiliform rash sparing her palms, soles and mucosal membranes, generalized discomfort but no localized pain.

Past Medical History: CLL s/p chemo (Dx [**2187**] - chemo [**2195**]) STEMI s/p DES x2 in [**2197**] Asthma Osteopenia Anxiety GERD HL HTN DM L knee arthroplasty L elbow repari L ankle fusion hysterectomy  SUMMARY OF CLL/SLL HISTORY: (1) In 10/00, she had removal of a left inguinal lymph node showing CLL/SLL.
This showed small lymphocytic lymphoma; there was no evidence of transformation.
Biopsies were obtained showing "palisading granulomatous dermatitis" c/w "granuloma annulare or annular elastocytic granuloma."
However, additional asymptomatic disc-shaped erythematous  lesions have appeared in crops on both thighs.
Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101337**] for febrile neutropenia.
No fever source found.
Found to have bilateral pleural effusions, R>L.
On [**2195-12-29**], underwent R thoracentesis with removal of 1.4 liters fluid that was consistent with exudative process.
On [**2196-1-4**], underwent a R thoracoscopy with drainage of pleural effusion and biopsy of 3 pleural nodules.
On [**2196-1-18**], readmitted after developing fever to 103.6F with shortness of breath.
Large L pleural effusion tapped on [**2196-1-19**] with improvement.

Brief Hospital Course: 64F with hx of CLL s/p chemo, multiple drug allergies, recent left TKR p/w fever, rash, found to have leukocytosis, transaminitis, elevated lactate.
#Fever, Rash: Pt presents with new onset diffuse, confluent morbiliform rash with a few bullae a week post-operative TKA.
Infectious primary process seems less likely given no other focal symptoms.
The pt has a history of dermatologic problems (palisading granulomatous dermatitis), raising concern that this could be related to her underlying latent malignancy, though the significance of the temporal relationship to recent surgery is unclear.
With such diffuse rash and presence of bullae, there was concern for a SJS picture, however the pt currently lacks mucosal involvement.
A skin biopsy was sent (from her abdomen) and appears consistent with a drug reaction per dermatology.
Vanc/aztreonam was started on arrival to the ICU [**3-6**] given her fever and leukocytosis.
As her symptoms seemed most consistent with a drug reaction, her antbx were discontinued on [**3-7**] and she was observed until [**3-8**].
Her WBC continued to downtrend and her rash improved.
Her skin will likely exfoliate for some time but she had no open wounds and remained hemodynamically stable.
She remained normotensive off antihypertensives so they were not restarted at discharge.
#Transaminitis: She had a transaminitis that was likely due to her drug reaction which downtrended.
The patient did have some LE edema which improved with elevation.
No RUQ tenderness.
No risk factors for acute hepatitis.
LDH elevated, but hapto elevated and bili nl, not suggestive of hemolysis.
# CLL: Per hem/onc notes in the last year, pt remains stable without evidence of progression of disease.
# Anxiety: Patient describes her mood as anxious and that she felt a little frustrated with being in a teaching hospital.
3. diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: [**11-18**] Capsules PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.

7. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for insomnia or anxiety.
Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated for fever and a rash.
It was felt to be secondary to an antibiotic you received when you had your surgery.
The biopsy was suggestive of a drug reaction.
Your cholesterol medication (Lipitor) was also held due to elevated liver function tests.
