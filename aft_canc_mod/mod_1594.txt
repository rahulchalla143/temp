Upon review of CTA w/ radiologist there was concern for large LLL node that is abutting pulm vasculature as source of bleeding.
He underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe which initially required intubation; he then underwent IR embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor with stabilization of the bleeding.
He was transfered to the regular floor and his Hct continued to remain stable without hemoptysis.
Flu swab negative, U/A negative, Urine Legionella negative and all blood cultures to date with no growth.
CXR and CT with concern for pneumonia vs atelectasis.
As all cultures were negative, these were discontinued after 12 days without any positive cultures.
He did develop cellulitis over his left heel on [**1-28**] for which he was given 1 dose of Vanc/Cef and then Unasyn.
He continued to have fevers up to 102 and a PA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] showed a possible early pna.
# AIHA: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to hemolysis.
Patient was pretreated, but developed tachypnea, tachycardia, chest pain.
He continued to have chest pain and was given nitro, morphine, ativan with some relief.
A CXR showed increased congestion and patient received iv lasix.
#CAD-Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed.
ECG with anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior leads.
Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related coronary thrombosis, however troponins did increase during this admission, suggesting NSTEMI.
# CLL: Chemo was deferred given complicated issues as above.
LE weakness thought to be due to deconditioning and chronic illness.
Patient's labs should be drawn twice weekly starting [**2-3**] and he should be transfused for platelets <30, Hct<25 unless he has symptoms of dyspnea/chest pain (in that case, <30).
Once more medically stable, he will have to be assessed to determine if this mass is RCC vs CLL and the best modality of treatment.
