Admission Date:  [**2109-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-5-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: pollen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: seizure and right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left frontal Craniotomy with resection of meningioma   History of Present Illness: This is a 66 year old woman who had developed right lower and then right upper extremity weakness over the past few years.
She had a spine work up with imaging of her cervical and lumbar spine.
She had episodes of contractions of the right lower extremity, which were lasting for 10-15 minutes.
In [**Month (only) 956**] of this year, she had what seemed to be a right-sided seizure and since then, she was placed on appropriate seizure medications and she had no symptoms from that.
The MRI revealed a left parietal brain tumor.
She has no left sided deficit.
Her wound is clean and dry.
Redemonstration of a large lobulated enhancing extra-axial mass lesion measuring 4.4 cm with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and the left side of the corpus callosum for surgical planning.
A smaller enhancing focus along the lateral aspect of the left frontal lobe (series 2, image 65) measuring approximately 5 mm, may represent an additional small dural-based mass lesion such as meningioma.
CT head [**2109-4-29**]: Expected post-surgical changes s/p left extraaxial mass resection, including a small amount of hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
There is no definite residual tumor.
Mild thickening and enhancement of the falx adjacent to the tumor may be post-operative though a continued followup would be helpful to more definitively exclude a small amount of residual tumor.
Lungs are essentially clear except for right basal opacity, laterally which might represent atelectasis or infectious process.
Note is made that there are multiple external devices overlying the chest that preclude precise evaluation and subtle lesions may be overlooked  CT head [**5-2**] 1.
Post-operative changes with small residual pneumocephalus and apparent organizing hematoma in the left frontovertex surgical bed.
No hemorrhage elsewhere and no specific evidence of acute vascular territorial infarction   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital for an elective resection of Left frontal meningioma.
Her surgery was complicated by bleeding from the saggital sinus and she required transfusion of 4 units intraop and 2 units post-op for this.
She had significant post-op weakness on the right side and was on Decadron 4mg Q6hr for 48 hrs for cerebral edema.
On [**4-30**], she was noticed to have hypertension to 180s and diminished speech with aggitation.
On [**5-1**], patient experienced another episode of aggitation and diminished speech with hypertension.
Given her leukocytosis 14.2, they recommended infection work-up.
But given that she was afebrile, currently post op, and on dexamethasone, we deferred further w/u unless she was febrile.
MRI read showed gross total resection of tumor with residual hyperdensity within the falx.
A repeat head CT was ordered for increase RLE weakness on examination which demonstrated post operative changes with mild edema but no evidence of infarct or new hemorrhages.
Overnight, she was complicated by labile HTN and required intermittent doses of labetolol  On [**5-2**], clonidine was started and she was transitioned to prn lopressor.
She continued to show improvement in her RUE motor strength as well as her RLE proximal muscles.
She continued to have a baseline Right foot drop.
She had mild dysphasia and this slowly continued to progress.
She is tolerating a good oral diet and pain is well controlled.
She is set for d/c to rehab in stable condition and will f/u accordingly.
10. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left parietal Meningioma cerebral edema Seizure Disorder Dysphasia Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
