The patient's right leg was noted to be more swollen and ecchymotic today so she was sent in for evaluation.
Per patient, her leg pain has been worsening for weeks.
Denies numbness or tingling.
She is able to move her foot, but states that this is very painful.
Vascular surgery drained hematoma in ED.
Past Medical History: - h/o cardiac arrest: asystolic ([**2128-3-20**]) - Respiratory failure, chronically ventilated after failure to wean following surgery at [**Hospital1 2177**] - Small subsegmental PE: tx'd w/ lovenox bridged to coumadin (held [**3-29**]) - h/o Pneumothorax: s/p chest tube [**Date range (1) 65044**] - h/o perforated sigmoid colon s/p resection and colostomy - h/o bacteremia [**3-19**] line infection and diverticulitis - h/o probable VAP ([**3-24**]): Sputum cx w/ acinetobacter [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to Gentamicin and MSSA; but since patient MRSA+ she was treated w/ vancomycin and gent - COPD (steroid dependent) - B12 deficiency - fractured right ankle [**2126**] - MRSA in nares - anxiety - depression - HTN - atrial fibrillation .
Of note, recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2177**], she presented with fall and weakness, found to be in a fib with AVR, converted to sinus rhythm.
Apparently intubated for respiratory failure in setting EtOH withdrawal and DT's.
While intubated, had fever to 103.8, elevated WBC and + blood cultures.
abd CT with free air and to OR for ex-lap with sigmoid colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] procedure.
Poor air movement.
ABD: +midline scar mostly healed w/ area of opening packed w/ xeroform; colostomy LLQ; NABS; soft, ND, NT, no masses EXT: +ace wrap around RLE; 2+ pedal edema on right; right foot slightly warmer than left.
CXR: no CHF or infiltrate, trach tube appears in good position .
R TIB/FIB PLAIN FILMS: neg for fx .
R KNEE PLAIN FILMS: neg for fx .
12 cm collection in the posteromedial right calf, likely a hematoma .
No DVT in the left lower extremity.
Evolution of right calf hematoma, which is now slightly smaller in size .
PERIPHERAL SMEAR/FLOW CYTOMETRY: immature cell forms; Flow cytometry on peripheral blood showed half lymphocytes are abnormal/lymphoma cells; final heme/path report pending.
This was thought likely to be related to anticoagulation received for PE which was started on recent hospital admission.
No evidence of compartment syndrome per surgery.
On review of prior labs here, her WBC count seemed to be chronically elevated in past.
She also had a low grade temp early in her admission.
She was continued on Gentamicin and vancomycin started on her last admission for her known VAP of acinetobacter and MSSA (although has h/o MRSA).
In addition, the hematopathologist reported that her peripheral blood smear showed immature forms and performed flow cytometry on her blood.
Heme/path commented that this appeared to be consistent with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder; however, further subclassification is pending at this time.
#) HISTORY OF PE: PE was diagnosed on [**2128-3-20**].
Her CTA showed an incomplete right lower lobe subsegmental PE.
She is now off anticoagulation as above due to active bleeding.
This was relayed to the family, and they agreed that she should be able to make that decision for herself.
