At presentation on [**1-31**], there was no clear evidence of infection given that her WBC was normal and she was afebrile.
Her nephrostomy pigtail was replaced and antegrade pyelogram indicated functional nephrostomy tube and persistent distal ureteral obstruction.
She was admitted for pain control.
She was started on the dilaudid PCA, but had several episodes of hypotension while on increased narcotics for her pain requiring transfer to the ICU for monitoring.
Psychiatry was consulted for management of depression and affective instability and recommendations regarding her multiple medications including clonazepam, lorazepam, mirtazapine and narcotics.
During her stay, she was showing signs of mild delirium with decreased attention and concentration.
They also suggested using seroquel for anxiety and insomnia.
In the setting of increased pain medication, specifically narcotics, she became hypotensive to 70s systolic.
She was mildly lightheaded at this time.
Her hypotension was thought more likely [**2-8**] to her pain medication regimen and poor PO rather than hypotension [**2-8**] to sepsis.
