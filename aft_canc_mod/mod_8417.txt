Small-bowel obstruction with small bowel measuring up to 3.5 cm in diameter.
Multiple transition points representing multiple strictures in the mid lower abdomen are noted, please note that closed loop obstruction cannot be excluded.
Multiple cystic structures within the pelvis.
Given history of prior mucinous cystic tumor of the ovary, this is most consistent with recurrence.
[**2171-4-23**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No acute pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic pathology detected.
Cluster of tiny 2-mm pulmonary nodules in both lung bases, a few of which are calcified, likely represent prior granulomatous disease.
No evidence of metastatic disease in the chest.
Brief Hospital Course: *) Small Bowel Obstruction She was taken to the operating room for surgical exploration.
Intra-operative findings were significant for recurrent pseudomyxoma peritonei, extensive adhesions of the bowel to the anterior abdominal wall and to other portions of bowel, and small bowel obstruction.
She underwent a small bowel resection with re-anastamosis and resection of pelvic tumor.
On post-operative day #5, NGT output had decreased, and after clamping the tube with minimal residual output, it was removed.
However, the following day she developed nausea and vomiting, and the tube was replaced.
Her NGT output gradually decreased and her bowel function slowly returned; the NGT was clamped on post-operative days #14-15, with a low residual output, and was removed on post-operative day #16.
*) Hypotension/Shock Intra-operatively she developed hypotension and was placed on pressors; she was admitted to the ICU post-operatively.
She was also given 2 units of FFP to reverse coagulopathy and transfused with PRBC due to intra-operative blood loss and a hematocrit that drifted down in the post-operative period.
*) ID In the immediate post-operative period she had a low white blood cell count with a bandemia to 19.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were initiated for broad-spectrum coverage of enteric pathogens, due to her extensive bowel surgery.
For the first 3 days post-operatively she continued to intermittently become febrile, with gradual resolution of her fevers.
The antibiotics were discontinued once she had been afebrile for 48 hours.
On post-operative day #7 she had a low-grade fever to 100.8, which spontaneously resolved, and remained afebrile after this.
All cultures (urine, blood) negative, and chest imaging was negative for pneumonia.
During the last 3-4 days of her hospitalization she developed diarrhea, but no fevers or other associated symptoms.
Stool was sent for C. difficile, which was negative, and her symptoms were overall stable on discharge with 3-4 loose stools per day.
She was started on clotrimazole lozenges and oral Nystatin for thrush on post-operative day #19 and received one dose of IV fluconazole and two doses of oral fluconazole, with subsequent improvement of her thrush.
The ECG was unremarkable and unchanged from prior, and CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
*) Pulmonary She was electively intubated for surgery and remained intubated in the setting of hypotension and possible sepsis/shock post-operatively.
On CTA chest performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, 2mm tiny pulmonary nodules consistent with prior granulomatous disease were noted incidentally.
*) Epilepsy Ms. [**Known lastname 1661**] has a longstanding history of seizures and has undergone a temporal lobectomy in the past.
Due to her small bowel obstruction, she was made NPO.
She continued to have intermittent seizure activity, but these were consistent with episodes in the past in which she became symptomatic but had no epileptiform activity on EEG, suggesting that there may be a component of stress/anxiety.
*) Depression/Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Due to being NPO for a prolonged period of time, she was unable to receive her usual anti-depressant medication.
Endocrinology was informally consulted and thought this to be consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome after surgery/illness.
Her vital signs were normal, and a CT of the head was negative for acute injury.
