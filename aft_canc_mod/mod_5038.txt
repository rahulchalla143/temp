The CTA showed a large pulmonary embolism as noted above in diagnostic studies section.
MGA's records were obtained, and the patient was recommended to have the MRI which showed a T9-T10 anterior longitudinal ligament injury, and TLSO was recommended.

Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2179-10-29**]; and the patient was suctioned with copious amounts of thick yellow suctioned.
The patient was tried to be weaned off the vent but was unable to secondary to desaturations.
On [**2179-10-30**] Levaquin was restarted after a sputum culture sent when the patient spiked a temperature to 101.
The patient did note fluid around urethral meatus which was sent gonococcal and Chlamydia studies.
Over the course of the next 10 days the patient's respiratory status waxed and waned with pulmonary edema and rounds of Lasix IV were used to control this; and eventually Lasix 20 mg p.o.
The orthopaedic surgery team commented on the patient's pubic rami fractures, and the decision was made to treat these fractures nonoperatively.
The patient had a left inferior pubic rami fracture a right anterior pubic rami fracture; also an L5 transverse process fracture, and sacroiliac joint widening and T10 anterior endplate chip fracture.
The patient was noted to be partial weightbearing on the right lower extremity and full weightbearing on his left lower extremity.
No signs of aspiration were noted on the speech and swallow study.
