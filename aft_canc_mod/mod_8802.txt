She was admitted [**3-31**] with rectal pain and there was concern for laxative abuse.
She had profuse diarrhea and a severe rectal ulcer and patient refused diverting ileostomy.
She refused to give up laxative use as she was "afraid of vomiting up stool."
She then went to [**Hospital1 3278**] [**2191-4-3**] and was treated for UTI (Ecoli resistent to cipro, otherwise sensitive).
She then represented [**4-4**] with severe perianal rash and had abdominal CT with focal enteritis without obstruction, bilateral renal calculi with partial obstruction and ?pyelo.
She also complains of abdominal pain that she thinks is due to the potassium she received in the ED.
Past Medical History: - Crohn's disease (s/p colon resection [**2150**] and rectal stricture dilitation) - Rectovaginal and intersphincteric fistula ([**10-7**]) - Diabetes Mellitus type 2 - Fibromyalgia - h/o nephrolithiasis - h/o rectal abscess - Personality Disorder   Social History: (per OMR and patient) Patient lives alone with 24 hour private care.
Dad died of pancreatic cancer.
Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
mild guarding, neg HSM.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Back: no CVA tenderness ABDOMEN: soft NT/ND, no HSM EXTREMITIES: WWP, Patient has edematous hands and feet bilaterally that are non-pitting, 2+ peripheral pulses.

There is no evidence of bowel loop obstruction or free air.
CXR [**2191-5-1**]: Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is new.
Lung volumes are lower, compared to [**4-6**], but there is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is new.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any.
Similar large right staghorn calculus, resulting in mild right hydronephrosis.
Multiple tiny non-obstructive left renal calculi.
No left hydroureteronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76 year old female with h/o laxative abuse and dehydration, personality disorder, nephrolithiasis with multiple UTI, Crohn's disease c/b rectovaginal fistula who presents with 3 days of weakness and poor po intake found to be in acute renal failure and hypokalemic .
# Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient developed fever and hypotension and was transferred to the MICU.
She was started empirically on Vanco/Cefepime given her history of recurrent UTIs, including enterococcus and enterobacter and E. Coli.
She had a positive U/A and it was suspected that her known staghorn calculus was a nidus of infection.
Eventually, her urine grew out E. coli that was resistent to ciprofloxacin and renal U/S was performed which revealed mild right hydropephrosis, right staghorn calculus as well as small non-obstructing stones in the left kidney.
Diarrhea: Initially thought to be most likely related to heavy use of laxatives and many stools at home, however, it persisted after cessation of laxatives and concern for crohn's flare.
Dehydration from this problem and K loss in stool likely causes of acute renal failure and hypokalemia.
Pt found to have multiple bottles of laxatives in her belongings at bedside.
No real abdominal pain to suggest flaring of her IBD.
Pt started on IVF to replace fluid loss and lytes were repleted.
She was on mesalamine during her hospital stay, but there was concern for crohn's flare.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke with the patient about different treatment options, but patient refused any additional work-up give her history of Crohn's disease.
# Psych: History of possible personality disorder.
She was started on zyprexa 2.5mg with PRN for increasing episodes of agitation.
Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion in the setting of profound diarrhea.
However, also had concerning history of pyelo in the past with inadequate treatment courses due to leaving hospital AMA.
On admission had no CVA pain although reported dysuria.
Urine culture showed E. Coli resistent to cipro.
Urine lytes showed indeterminate etiology.
Kept on IVF and Cr trended down re-inforcing diagnosis of pre-renal etiology.
Hypokalemia: Most likely related to ongoing diarrhea.
H/o possible Pylonephritis: Has chronic staghorn calculi on recent CT and recent treated with course of cefpodoxime.
Urine sent for culture and fever curve monitored.
She had minimal hydronephrosis and was not interested in a perc nephrostomy tube even if she qualified for one.
Non-anion gap acidosis: Patient with persistent non-anion gap acidosis.
Likely secondary to ongoing diarrhea (as above).

Secondary Diagnosis: Crohn's disease (s/p colon resection [**2150**] and rectal stricture dilitation) Rectovaginal and intersphincteric fistula ([**10-7**]) Diabetes Mellitus type 2 H/o nephrolithiasis Personality Disorder   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted for weakness, poor food intake and diarrhea.
We think it is because of a crohn's flare.
We think that you should see a gastroenterologist for management of your diarrhea and crohns as they may have some recommendations for further treatment.
we also found that you have a urinary tract infection and are treating you for 8 days.
