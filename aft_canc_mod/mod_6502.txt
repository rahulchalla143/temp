[**Name (NI) **] wife reports a steady decline over the last week, culminating on the day admission with inability to walk or verbalize.
This LP showed no evidence of infection.
Of note, he was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 8767**] with confusion that was attributed to cerebral edema from his head metastases.
He carries a diagnosis of melanoma metastatic to the head, lung, and liver.
He was receiving treatment from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 3278**], including gamma-knife in [**2163-3-10**], and had multiple similar admissions in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 205**] for confusion that improved with pulse dexamethasone.
4-5 days prior to admission he noted progressive weakness and decreased strength of voice prompting ED presentation.
CT head was done and per prelim report shwoed multiple hyperattenuating supratentorial lesions with surrounding edema compatible with metastatic disease, unchanged since [**2163-8-1**] CT exam.
CXR did not show acute process.
Denies shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea or wheezing.
Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  from OMR notes In [**8-/2159**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] biopsy of a right cheek skin lesion revealing lentigo maligna.
He [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a wide local excision with a focal positive margin with no further resection at that time.
In [**2161-9-9**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] abdominal US to evaluate abdominal pain which revealed small gallstones.
There were liver nodules noted consistent with hemangiomas.
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a liver MRI on [**2162-3-11**], revealing a dominant liver nodule concerning for possible metastatic disease.
He was subsequently referred to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a gamma knife evaluation.
F/U brain MRI in early [**Month (only) 216**] showed several new small brain lesions without associated edema.
He had evidence of regression in SQ nodules at this time so he was observed.
F/U brain MRI revealed resolution of the largest CNS lesion with growth in some smaller lesions felt to be ipilimumab effect.
He was admitted in [**2163-6-10**] twice at [**Hospital1 3278**] for mental status changes responsive to steroids, presumably due to edema surrounding known metastatic disease.
Status post traumatic neck injury in [**2160**] after falling off a ladder, status post C-spine fusion; 2. history of chronic dysphagia from nutcracker esophagus syndrome; 3. history of a frozen shoulder status post physical therapy with improvement in mobility 4. history of lentigo maligna of the right cheek.

For example, an 8 x 10 mm left temporal lobe hyperattenuating lesion with surrounding edema is unchanged (2A:16).
Left frontal 14 x 8 mm lesion is also stable (2A:21).
Bilobed focus of hyperattenuation in the left frontoparietal vertex is unchanged (2:23).
Surrounding edema is also noted.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
No new lesions detected on the CT exam.
No vascular territorial infarction.
Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:  In comparison to [**2163-8-1**] CT exam, there is no significant change in multiple hyperdenselesions, compatible with metastatic disease, as described above.
NOTE: A focus of increased density in the left frontal lobe anteriorly at the vertex ( se 2a, im 25)- ?
Progression of disease with significant increase in size of lung metastases since [**2163-7-10**].
The largest lung metastasis is a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe.
Edema within the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle bellies at their scapular origin - this is possibly secondary to myositis.
Metallic hardware artifact along the right side of the lower cervical spine (C6-7) consistent with prior fixation.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Known subcentimeter pulmonary nodules not well visualized.
Triangular opacity in peripheral left midlung likely artifact.
CXR ([**2163-8-16**]) Small to moderate right pleural effusion is new, accompanying a large region of interstitial infiltration in the right lower lung, and growing heterogeneous opacification of the left suprahilar lung.
Although there could be a component of pulmonary edema, it is likely that there is bilateral pneumonia.
A triangular opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe, new on [**8-14**] and still present is either infection or infarction.
Fullness in both hila and the paratracheal regions of the mediastinum could be due to vascular engorgement or lymph node enlargement.
Calcification of granulomatous lymph nodes is documented on the [**2163-7-12**] torso CT. Heart size is normal.
Motor NCSs of the right ulnar nerve demonstrated normal distal latency, moderately reduced response amplitudes, normal conduction velocity, and slightly prolonged F-minimum latency.
Sensory NCS of the left lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve demonstrated decreased response amplitude and normal conduction velocity.
Repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 Hz demonstrated no abnormal decrement.
Stimulation of the right ulnar nerve, recording ADM, pre- and post-10 seconds of maximal voluntary contraction demonstrated no post-exercise facilitation.
Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of selected right upper extremity muscles revealed short duration, polyphasic motor units, many of which were low-amplitude but some of which were normal amplitude, with early recruitment in deltoid, biceps, infraspinatus and first dorsal interosseous.
EMG of deltoid also revealed increased insertional activity in the form of occasional positive sharp waves.
Concentric needle EMG of right tibialis anterior and vastus lateralis revealed short duration, mostly low-amplitude (some normal amplitude), polyphasic motor units with early recruitment.
There is electrophysiological evidence for a generalized myopathy without associated denervating ("inflammatory") features.
The absence of denervating features does not rule out an inflammatory myopathy (myositis), particularly in the setting of concomitant glucorticoid use.
The remainder of the thyroid gland demonstrates homogeneous echogenicity and normal vascularity.
The left thyroid lobe measures 1.5 x 1.4 x 4.2 cm and demonstrates homogeneous echogenicity and normal vascularity without thyroid nodules.
No lymphadenopathy is identified in the neck.
IMPRESSION:  Small right thyroid lobe nodule most likely represents a colloid cyst.
No lymphadenopathy in the neck  CXR [**2163-8-19**] IMPRESSION:  Improving right pleural effusion.
Worsening interstitial edema.
Increase in perihilar opacity likely due to vascular engorgement or lymph node enlargement.
Diffuse ground glass and solid nodular opacities with more confluent opacity at the right lung base are new from [**2163-7-12**].
The findings are concerning for infection, including fungal, and septic emboli.
While these may represent markedly increased melanoma metastases, reassessment after treatment for infection is recommended.
Interlobular septal thickening at the right lung base is unchanged from [**2162-3-12**].
Small, nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions.
Possible that infection played a role in increasing insulin resistance.
On the floor, blood sugars remained labile, and patient had several AM episodes of hypoglycemia.
LP was done, which did not show any results c/w infection.
Could be [**2-10**] progressing metastatic disease (as shown on MRI [**2163-8-3**]) vs. metabolic due to uncontrolled diabetes.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] saw the patient in the ICU- he had suspicion that his recurrent AMS was secondary to possible leptomeningeal spread and CNS infiltration of the melanoma.
No malignant cells were seen on LP [**8-5**] and MRI C spine revealed no malignant leptomeningeal disease.
A finding of right arm weakness prompted MRI of the brachial plexi which were neurologically unremarkable, but reflected a worsening burden of pulmonary metastases.
EMG was done, which showed diffuse myopathy with no definitive inflammatory features.
Steroid taper was begun while patient on the floor, with no confusion or change in mental status.
# Pan-hypopituitarism:  TSH/T4/[**Last Name (un) **]/Prolactin/Testosterone were all found to be decreased during admission.
Ddx includes autoimmune endocrinopathy from ipilimumab or post-radiation pituitary damage.
# Dyspnea: Patient developed shortness of breath the evening of [**8-13**] with desaturations.
His CXR at that time reflected a possible multilobar pneumonia which was broadly covered as HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime.
His dyspnea improved, and by day of discharge he was satting well on room air and had been afebrile for multiple days.
Chest CT on [**8-20**] showed diffuse ground glass and solid nodular opacities with more confluent opacity at the right lung base, with 2 lesions with central cavitation.
These were felt to most likely represent metastases, but infectious causes (including fungal or mycobacterial infectious) were also a significant concern given patient's high dose steroid use.
Blood cultures were repeatedly negative, so septic emboli felt to be less likely.
Additional workup, including serial AFB sputum cultures to rule out TB were recommended.
# METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH HEAD METASTASES: Patient with metastatic melanoma currently being treated with off label ipilimumab.
MRI of brachial plexus and CT of chest showed probable progression of metastatic burden in lungs.
Transition issues: - recheck TFTs [**2163-8-25**] and adjust dose of thyroid hormone - Beta glucan, galactomannan, cryptococcal antigen, legionella antigen - sputum culture (including AFB) not done as inpatient; mycobacterial infection cannot be decisively ruled out  Medications on Admission: 1.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check TSH, free thyroxine, T3 on [**2163-8-25**] and fax results to Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3402**]; Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 84154**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis Metastatic melanoma Healthcare Associated Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for progressive weakness and were found to have very elevated blood sugar and a diabetic ketoacidosis.
During your hospitalization, you were found to have a pneumonia and treated with antibiotics.
A chest CT [**2163-8-19**] showed new lung lesions.
They may be related to your melanoma, but we cannot rule out infection as a cause including fungal or less likely myobacterial infection.
We discussed that work-up of these lesions was not yet complete, and that further workup would include sputum testing to rule out tuberculosis.
Changes to your medications include: - inject 30 units of insulin glargine (Lantus) subcutaneously in the morning and 20 units of insulin glargine (Lantus) subcutaneously at bedtime - inject Humalog subcutaneously with meals per sliding scale - take dexamethasone 4mg every 12 hours - apply one 4mg Androderm patch to your skin each day (and remove old patch) - start levofloxacin 750mg daily for 5 more days - start levothyroxine 88mcg daily - oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain - start docusate and senna as needed for constipation (because oxycodone can cause constipation)  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization and we wish you all the best going forward.
