Admission Date:  [**2146-11-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-11-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-7-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 57-year-old African-American woman with hypertension who presents to the Emergency Room with severe abdominal pain.
Pain has worsened since that time, and now involves the entire abdomen without radiation, increased pain with movement.
No nausea, vomiting.
She has had a fever to 102, now extremely uncomfortable, passing flatus with normal bowel movements yesterday, and today has diarrhea on the day of admission.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, no murmurs.
Abdomen is diffusely tender, positive guarding, nondistended with no bowel sounds heard.
Chest x-ray showed right effusion, no free air under the diaphragm.
CT scan of the abdomen showed complex pelvic mass with free fluid and small effusion.
At that time the patient was admitted to the Trauma Surgery service after sustaining a blunt injury to her lower abdomen now with peritonitis and complex pelvic mass on CT scan.
At that point, differential diagnosis was hematoma, bowel rupture, and ovarian cancer.
In the operating room, the patient was found to have ovarian cancer from gross inspection that was adhesed to the small bowel.
There are also plaque-like lesions over the right lobe of the liver.
Estimated blood loss 1.5 liters.
There were no complications.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient required ongoing volume resuscitation with a base deficit of 5 secondary to third spacing.
Ventilatory support was continued until metabolic acidosis cleared, and the patient was weaned off the vent, put on CPAP, and extubated on postoperative day #1.
Gyn/Onc was asked to see and evaluate patient for future therapy.
Pulmonology was consulted concerning the right pleural effusion in the context of this complex ovarian mass, their recommendations were for a P.A.
Her abdominal cultures had grown out gram-positive rods.
The patient was also seen by Medical Oncology, who favored not tapping the pleural effusion because it would not change the current management, and they would await the final pathology and complete staging after the surgery, and discuss this with her as an outpatient.
On postoperative day #4, the patient finished her five day course of Zosyn, still did not have any bowel movements or flatus at that point, and was continued on sips.
