History of Present Illness: This is a  59 year-old female with a history of advanced pancreatic cancer who presents with hematemesis.
She has chronic RUQ and epigastric abd pain which has worsened over the last week.
Pt noted to be guiac positive with brown stool.
Upon arrival to the floor she remained hemodynamic stable.
She had a 1 L BM of BRBPR with clots.
Of note [**2171-1-31**] she had a similar episode of hematemesis with HCT drop to 22 for which she was admitted to the OSH ICU.
Endoscopy showed bleeding ucleration at the site of the tumor growth over the duodenel stent.
However 1 week after being d/ced on protonix she developed a whole body rash.
Her cancer was discovered after a CT obtained at the time of an appendectomy showed diffuse hepatobiliary dilatation in [**3-21**].
IN [**Month (only) **] she had an EUS which showed a 2-cm mass in the pancreas involving the portal vein.
FNA was positive for malignant cells.
GIven encasement of the gastric duodenal artery she was felt not to be a surgical candidate.
She underwent 3 cycles of gemcitabine but had ongoing enlargement of the pancreatic mass.
She had 1st cycle of XELOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) on [**2-22**] for progressive disease with tumor overgrowth of teh doudenal stent.
No diarrhea, constipation, chest pain, shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, , focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: anemia duodenal ulcer at tumor site (present with hematemesis [**1-18**]) hyperlipidemia HTN DM2, currently not on treatment obesity appendectomy pancreatic cancer  Social History: The patient works in tech support for State Stree Bank.
Mother died at 70 from liver disease; she also had DM and HTN.
Physical Exam: GEN: Alert, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera icteric, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, mild RUQ tenderness without rebound or gaurding, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: mild jaundice.
No cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
INDICATION: 59-year-old female with pancreatic cancer, new abdominal pain and upper GI bleeding.
FINDINGS: Mild atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.
There are no pleural effusions.
Note is made of a small sliding hiatal hernia.
ABDOMEN: A hypo-enhancing mass in the head of the pancreas has increased in size to 3.2 cm TV x 2.4 cm AP x 2 cm SI, previously 3 cm TV x 2.2 cm TV x 1.7 cm SI.
There is extensive local infiltration, with heterogeneous soft tissue density extending inferolaterally and obscuring fat planes along the C-sweep of the duodenum.
However, there is no evidence of thrombosis; the main, left, and right portal and hepatic veins, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric vein all remain patent.
The distal pancreas is atrophic, without significant ductal dilation to suggest obstruction.
There is new massive intrahepatic and common biliary ductal dilation, measuring up to 17 mm.
The liver enhances homogeneously, without focal lesions identified on this single phase examination.
A 4-mm calcified stone is noted in a partially distended gallbladder, which demonstrates minimal wall edema and trace pericholecystic fluid.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically, without masses or hydronephrosis.
Bilateral renal cysts and hypodensities are present, measuring up to 2.5 cm in the left interpole.
A metal stent is noted in the second portion of the duodenum, with persistent irregular soft tissue ingrowth within the stent walls.
However, enteric contrast traverses this region, and there is no evidence of transition point to suggest obstruction.
Enteric contrast has progressed to the level of mid ileal loops in the pelvis.
A 4 x 2 cm ovoid filling defect in a pelvic ileal loop (3:52 and 300B:38), was not visualized on prior examination, and likely represents ingested contents.
There are no extraluminal contrast, fluid, or air collections to suggest perforation.
No focal fat stranding or abnormal enhancement to indicate acute inflammation.
There is no pneumatosis or mesenteric/portal venous gas to reflect ischemia.
A moderate amount of retained fecal material is noted throughout the colon and rectum.
Mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged.
CXR [**3-9**] Lung volumes are low, no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Heart mildly enlarged.
No appreciable pleural effusion.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracolumbar spine.
Interval increase in size of pancreatic head mass, with new massive intrahepatic and common biliary ductal dilation indicating obstruction.
Significant vascular encasement, without evidence of venous thrombosis.
Duodenal stent, with evidence of soft tissue ingrowth, but no bowel obstruction or perforation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 year-old female with a history of pancreatic cancer who presents with hematemesis and hematochezia secondary ulcerated tumor at the duodenal stent found to have common bile duct obstruction and gallbladder distension from progression of pancreatic cancer.
# GI bleed: Likely source: ulcerated tumor at the duodenal stent site.
# Common bile duct obstruction, gallbladder distension.
Imaging consistent with intrahepatic, CBD and GB distension likely secondary to extrahepatic conpression from the pancreatic mass.
Though no fevers to suggest active cholangitis patient covered with empiric unasyn to prevent cholangitis which was transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin and flagyl at time of discharge .
# Pancreatic cancer.
Likely causative factor of both bleed and obstruction.
# Hypertension.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 4. morphine concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-20 mg PO q1hour as needed for pain: Please call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] if pain becomes severe.
Disp:*1 30cc vial* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Old [**Hospital **] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Duodenal ulcer, Biliary tract obstruction Secondary Diagnosis: Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Regarding your episodes of bleeding, it is thought that you have persistent bleeding from an ulcer in your duodenum.
In addition, your biliary tract was found to be obstructed, likely secondary to worsening pancreatic cancer.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy was offered but you opted to forego further intervention and instead use antibiotics to treat any potentional infection.
Please take one tablet twice daily To treat shortness of breath/anxiety Start taking Ativan 0.5mg PO at night time.
To treat pain; Start taking Morphine concentrate as needed every hour: 5-20mg Q1hr sublingual or by mouth for pain control - this medicine can be swallowed or dropped under the tongue for pain control.
- If you are having severe pain plase contact [**Name (NI) 2270**] [**Name (NI) 1764**] guarding increasing dosage.
