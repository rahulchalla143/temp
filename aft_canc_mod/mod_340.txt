History of Present Illness: 73yo male who underwent a restaging TUR bladder tumor on [**2128-6-11**].
The final result indicated carcinoma in situ with invasion into [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9911**] nests but no muscle invasive disease.
There was a question of a lamina propria invasion.
All of these factors point to a losing battle with intravesical immuno and chemotherapy, which we have been doing for over four years.

For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
[**Hospital 8351**] hospital course has been quite prolonged with multiple complications.
He had a post-op SBO and is s/p ex-lap with clot evaluation, lysis of adhesions on [**2128-9-7**].
On [**2128-9-28**], he developed afib with RVR, hypotension requiring pressors, respiratory distress requiring intubation.
He was found to have e.coli and enterococcus bacteremia and was started on vancomycin/zosyn, ultimately narrowed to zosyn only.
On [**2128-10-4**], he developed fever and dyspnea and was transferred back to the ICU.
There was also some concern for potential PE, but pt was unable to undergo CTA [**1-22**] elevated Cr.
LE ultrasound was performed, which showed occlusive thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein.
He has had no further positive blood cultures.
Vancomycin and meropenem were completed [**2128-10-14**] (which will complete a 2-week course for bacteremia and 10 days for presumed hospital-acquired PNA).
Likely sources for bacteremia included PICC and urine.
Other antibiotics given during hospitalization: - Cefepime ([**9-28**] - [**9-30**]) - Zosyn ([**9-30**] - [**10-4**]) - Vancomycin ([**9-28**] - [**10-1**]; [**10-4**] - 25) - Meropenem ([**10-5**] - [**10-14**])  (2) DVT: Pt with LENI showing occlusive thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein.
Heme/onc evaluated patient and recommended anticoagulation with lovenox, given that this clot occurred while on coumadin.
(4) Bladder Cancer s/p Radical Cysoprostatectomy: Ileal conduit has been funtioning well and training for routine ostomy care has been carried out by Ostomy nurse specialist.
(6) Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: Getting wound care.
(8) [**Last Name (un) **]/ARF likely secondary to sepsis vs. volume overload vs. contrast.
(9) Anemia: Felt to be multifactorial, including AOCD and multiple surgeries and poor nutrition due to lack of diet/po intake.
Wife [**Doctor First Name 8368**] [**0-0-**] (11) Ambulatory status:  Ambulates with walker assistance.
He has deconditioned and lost muscle mass and tone given his [**Hospital 9914**] hospital course.
At discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 9908**] was not taking any pain medications, he was tolerating tube feeds at goal and having bowel movements, ambulating with walker AND with assistance.
He is discharged to [**Hospital1 **] ([**Location (un) 701**]) with instructions to follow up with cardiology, urology, hematology/oncology, gerontology and his other providers/specialists as directed.

-You may shower, but do not immerse incision, no tub baths/swimming  - Your abdominal incision has been healing nicely.
-  Wound to the gluteal area should be dressed per wound care nurse recommendations and protected from further breakdown.
