Repeat bronch by IP [**9-1**] showed edematous airways.
After extubation, she began to experience respiratory difficulty and required support.
She was noted to have an increasing anion gap acidosis, perhaps due to starvation ketosis.
Received fluid boluses but did not respond with increased urine output.
On [**9-2**] oliguria improved, questionably due to position of Foley catheter.
6)ID - Low grade temp on [**2103-9-3**].
