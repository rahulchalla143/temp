Brief Hospital Course: GI bleed: This GI bleed was thought to be secondary to diverticulosis.
The patient was admitted to the floor initially but then had a large bloody bowel movement and was orthostatically hypotensive and was therefore transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He underwent a tagged RBC scan which was negative though there was a question of bleeding in the rectum.
He underwent colonoscopy which showed a sessile polyp that was not biopsied and diverticulosis, no blood.
His EGD showed erythema in the stomach.
He had no further GI bleeding and his hematocrit remained stable at 30.
Plan is for f/u c-scope in [**3-20**] weeks to biopsy the sessile polyp.
Plts were initially 113 but then dropped to the 70s after his bleeding episodes, and this was likely related to the bleeding itself.
