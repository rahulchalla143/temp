Coronary artery disease, status post MI, status post PTCA in [**2175**].
Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 60 percent.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma status post chemotherapy in [**2185**].
HEENT:  No abnormalities.
ABDOMEN:  No masses, tenderness, hernias or ascites.
EXTREMITIES: Peripheral pulses 2+, no edema.
There were no regional lymph node metastases out of 14 examined.
The patient was noted to have a postop fever to 101.2 degrees, which was likely secondary to atelectasis since it was within a day of the operation.
The patient also had up to 4-second pauses of his heart immediately postop.
Because the patient remained asymptomatic, and because the amount of Lopressor given was slightly higher than his home dose of atenolol, it was felt there was no indication for a pacer at that time.
However, it was still felt by the end of the patient's stay that because his pauses had been asymptomatic and had decreased when the beta-blocker was discontinued that there was no indication for a pacer on this admission.
He was therefore advised on discharge to return if he should have any dizziness or lightheadedness and to follow up with his cardiologist.
An episode of bradycardia occurred on the night of postop day 1 in the setting of nausea when the patient got up and walked around.
The electrophysiology fellow was consulted and felt that this decreased heart rate was probably secondary to vagal stimulation due to abdominal distention and an inability to pass flatus.
However, he woke in the middle of the night with some nausea and a repeat bradycardia down to 38.
The patient was therefore returned to a sips diet, and he was continued on telemetry with no further intervention.
On postop day 5, as the patient's INR had remained elevated at 1.9 despite stopping the Coumadin, the patient was reversed with 4 units of FFP and the epidural was pulled.
The patient, however, had bright red blood per rectum around that same time.
On postop day 8, the patient continued to complain of some nausea and his abdomen was mildly tympanic.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  In addition to the admitting diagnoses, the patient is status post a left colectomy for adenomatous polyp.
