Also has been recently evaluated for back pain with orthopedics.
Patient had optho evaluation in the ER on [**2203-9-17**] for eye pain and was found to have neovascular glaucoma angle closure of her right eye, for which she was started on acetazolimide 250mg po qid for 7 days, timolol 0.5 % Drops [**1-12**] Ophthalmic twice a day for 7 days, and Alphagan P 0.15 % drops one twice a day for 7 days.
Hypertension 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Hypothyroidism 8.
Obstructive sleep apnea 9.
Chronic bronchitis  Social History: Patient is a retired nurse, resident of a nursing home, ambulates with a cane, but also uses a wheelchair as needed.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.1 HR 68 BP 120/50 RR 13 Sat 100% 2L NC General: Chronically ill-appearing, answers some questions appropriately, withdraws to noxious stimuli HEENT: Right pupil surgical and non-reactive, left pupil 4mm->3mm, OP clear but mm dry Neck: no lymphadenopathy, difficult to assess JVP given habitus but not elevated Heart: irregularly irregular, no obvious murmurs/rubs/gallops; 1+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally Lungs: CTAB no wheezes, crackles, rhochi but poor respiratory movement Abd: +BS, tender to palpation in the RUQ>LUQ, soft Ext: No edema, extremities cool.
No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis to explain the patient's pain.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2203-9-19**] 8:53 AM IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Please note, MRI is more sensitive in the detection of intracranial mass lesion.
EEG Study Date of [**2203-9-20**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate background slowing and disorganization maximal posteriorly with bitemporal at times theta slowing without clear laterality.
No definitive spikes or other discharging features were seen.
L-SPINE (AP & LAT) Study Date of [**2203-9-21**] 2:03 PM FINDINGS: There is a large bridging osteophyte about the left aspect of the L2-3 level which obscures the disc space on the lateral view.
There is no definite acute compression fracture.
Question of a spondylytic defect at the L5 level posteriorly is unchanged from prior.
There are mild degenerative changes of the hips bilaterally.
Mild irregularity of the right SI joint, likely from degenerative changes.
LABS ON DISCHARGE: [**2203-9-22**] 05:43AM BLOOD WBC-3.0* RBC-3.82* Hgb-12.4 Hct-37.3 MCV-98 MCH-32.4* MCHC-33.2 RDW-13.3 Plt Ct-320 [**2203-9-22**] 05:43AM BLOOD Glucose-104 UreaN-14 Creat-0.7 Na-142 K-3.9 Cl-113* HCO3-24 AnGap-9 [**2203-9-22**] 05:43AM BLOOD Mg-2.2  Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 71 year-old woman with h/o CNS lymphoma, atrial fibrillation, HTN, presenting with altered mental status, low-grade fever, hypotension, acute renal failure.
Most likely this was secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO intake.
Septic shock was considered and patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics on arrival to MICU.
These were discontinued on [**9-21**] given negative cultures and no other evidence of infection.
Pulmonary embolus was considered unlikely less likely given stable vital signs, minimal hypoxia, early response, no axis change in ECG.
Cardiogenic shock with ischemia was considered unlikely given stable cardiac enzymes.
# Change in mental status: Patient had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status but was minimally alert on arrival, only able to answer ??????no??????
Etiology was thought to be toxic/metabolic in the setting of multiple psychoactive drugs, acute renal failure, and baseline poor mental status.
CT head was negative for acute process.
The patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**], saw the patient, and advised that given recent MRI that was stable, recurrence of CNS lymphoma was highly unlikely to be contributing.
On hospital day 3, the patient was transferred to the floor given near complete resolution of altered mental status with patient alert and oriented x 3.
On the floor, the patient was observed to have emotional lability, which is her baseline, but normal mentation and orientation.
# Acute renal failure: The patient originally presented with a creatinine of 2.3.
No peripheral eosinophilia.
Foley catheter had excellent UOP (no evidence for obstruction), and was removed on transfer to the floor.
# Seizure disorder: The patient has not had seizure activity recently per primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**].
EEG showed no discharge activity consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
During hospitalization, TSH was suppressed but has been suppressed in the past, consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism.
# Hypercalcemia: The patient has a long history of hyperparathyroidism, and was noted to have calcium of 11.0 on admission; elevated PTH was confirmed on hospital day 3.
The hypercalcemia resolved with IVFs.
# Atrial fibrillation: She is rate controlled without any nodal blocking agents as an outpatient.
She is not on coumadin given her history of intracranial bleeding.
# Emotional lability: On multiple occasions, the patient was noted to have a labile affect and mood.
This has been noted in previous notes, and is thought to be secondary to the patient's past history of CNS lymphoma.
The patient's lamotrigine was originally held in the MICU secondary to mental status changes, and was restarted on hospital day 3 with good effect.
# Back pain: The patient complains of chronic back pain at baseline.
Plain films of the lumbar spine revealed spondylosis and degenerative joint disease, but no evidence of compression fractures.
# Neovascular glaucoma angle closure: The patient has a right central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal artery occlusion with accompanying neovascular glaucoma, seen by Drs.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - Altered mental status, resolved - Acute renal failure, resolved - Hypotension, resolved .
S/p 6 cycles of high dose methotrexate, changed to Rituxan and Temodar in [**9-17**] - Stroke ([**1-15**], posterior circulation) - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Subarachnoid hemmorhage (while on coumadin for stroke) - Diastolic dysfunction, last ejection fraction =55% - Hypothyroidism - Obstructive sleep apnea - Gastroesophogeal reflux disease - Status post cholecystectomy for gallstones - Atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin - Chronic bronchitis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] after you were found to be confused and disoriented at your outpatient opthalmology appointment.
In the emergency room, you were found to have low blood pressure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.
CT scans of your chest and belly did not show a source of infection, and we did not find an infection in your blood.
In addition, an EEG showed that you were not having seizure activity.
Overall, we think that your confusion was probably due to low blood flow from taking in too little fluid by mouth, combined with side effects from some of your medications.
In addition, you were found to have elevated calcium, with an increased level of another hormone, PTH.
Please call your doctor or go to an emergency room if you have confusion, severe headache, changes in your vision, loss of consciousness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, uncontrollable pain in your eye, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
- We did not give you lisinopril or amlodipine while you were in the hospital because of concern about low blood pressure.
