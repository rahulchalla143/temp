No acute issues.
No fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting.
Family brought him to ER for concern of mental status changes.
At [**Last Name (un) 1724**] a Ct and an MRI reportedly showed a mass in the Left frontal mass with mild mass effect on the falx, concern for GBM.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG in [**2097**], prostatic hypertrophy, recent SB ischemia requiring ex lap and excision of distal ileum.
Recall: no objects at three minutes due to expressive aphasia Language: expressive aphasia.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
He has very subtle word finding difficulty but was otherwise neurologically intact.
Prominent voltage consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Small Q waves and T wave inversions in the inferior leads.
Cannot exclude  old inferior myocardial infarction.
Q waves in the anteroseptal leads associated with ST segment elevation in lead V1, probably secondary to left ventricular hypertropy.
Cannot exclude anteroseptal myocardial infaraction.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 86 162 104 378/423 74 48 -158  Chest X-ray: No evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Slowed diffusion and thick peripheral enhancement along the margin of the surgical cavity which appears similar to the pre-operative examination is worrisome for residual tumor; however, post-operative changes cannot be excluded considering that the studying was performed 2 days post-op.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Neurosurgery service for a new left frontal mass approximately 7.8 by 5.5 x 5.8 cm.
The patient has significant cardiac history (post CABG and HOCM s/p) myomectomy (both in [**2097**]) He had an echo [**2105-5-20**] with evidence of asymmetric septal hypertrophy and had increase troponin on admission so a cardiology consult was obtained they recommended trending his tropon ins & beta blocker use.
On [**1-3**] he went to the OR for a left sided craniotomy for mass decompression.
Non-contrast head CT was repeated, and showed a fair amount of continued vasogenic edema.
He had expressive dusphasia which considerable improved over time.
MRI was obtained on the morning of [**1-5**], which showed expected post op changes, with some residual mass.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
