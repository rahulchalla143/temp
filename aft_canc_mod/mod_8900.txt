Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.

[**2142-9-9**] CXR PA/Lat: IMPRESSION: No acute change.
Mild atelectatic changes are noted but no definite acute focal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypercalcemia / Hypophosphatemia.
Initial presentation was for hypercalcemia; etiology was thought to be multifactorial, including vitamin D supplements, hyperparathyroidism, and PTHrP in the setting of squamous cell cancer.
# Cardiac Arrest / Anoxic brain injury / Renal failure: While on the floor, the patient was found in hypoxic PEA arrest, presumed to be down for an estimated 15 minutes before resuscitation started.
The PEA algorithm was followed, with the patient receiving 1 dose of Epi and Vasopressin; the patient was difficult to intubate; after intubation was successful, the patient was found to have converted into sinus rhythm.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where he was found to be non-responsive from a neurologic perspective while off sedation.
He underwent cooling over the ensuing day per protocol without significant complications followed by rewarming, during which he was felt to be relatively hypothermic, prompting a septic work-up with cultures; cultures were found to be negative.
EEG performed after warming showed diffuse slowing, suggestive of a poor prognosis.
Urine output was < 50cc daily; renal consultation noted a poor prognosis for returned kidney function.
Radiation oncology consulted and noted a poor prognosis; medical oncology also noted a poor prognosis.
Examination after rewarming and off sedation showed absent corneal reflex, abnormal oculocephalic reflex, little to no pupillary reflex vs. hippus, and low tidal volumes when temporarily taken off of the vent.
# UTI: Was found to have WBCs and klebsiella/e.coli growing in his urine.
