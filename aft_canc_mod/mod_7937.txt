[**2181-6-22**] - minimally invasive esophagectomy   History of Present Illness:     Mr. [**Known lastname 19862**] is a 61-year-old man with progressive dysphagia.
He has had an abnormal barium swallow,was found to have adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction, which is biopsy-proven positive.
He had a CT scan,which shows no evidence of nodal disease.
There was a 3 to 4 cm segment of wall thickening at the gastroesophageal junction.
He had a PET-CT, which showed no evidence of metastatic disease and an endoscopic ultrasound, which showed a very long segment of at least 3 cm in length, which was at least a T2, the possibility of a T3 lesion could not be completely excluded.
There were no obvious nodes on endoscopic ultrasound.
His recent PET scan showed decreased amounts of avidity of the eprimary mass and no evidence of metastatic disease.
[**2181-7-6**] 8:49AM New right middle lobe opacity on the lateral view which is likely atelectasis but should be watched on subsequent studies to exclude developing pneumonia.Stable moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2181-6-27**] Pathology Specimen: Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated, signet ring cell type, with invasion into the subserosal soft tissue (ypT3); see synoptic report.Seven of seventeen regional lymph nodes with involvement by carcinoma ([**7-24**]-ypN3).Resection margins free of carcinoma.Lymph nodes, station 7, excision (AF-AG):Six lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/6).
On [**2181-6-22**], the patient underwent a minimally invasive esophagectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Additionally the patient developed atrial fibrillation in the ICU that was controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol.
His course on the floor was as follows:  Neuro: The patient received oxycodone with good effect and adequate pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.He arrived to the floor with a JP drain and a chest tube to water suction.
One chest tube had an air leak and required pleurodesis.
In the following days the chest tube no longer had an air leak and both chest tubes were removed.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating his diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.

You underwent pleurodiesis for a persistent air leak from your chest tube.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
