He initially presented in [**2177-9-1**] wo an OSH with fevers, leukocytosis, and anemia with a CT scan showing a large psoas lesion extending into the left kidney.
The lesion was resected one year ago with acute blood loss anemia as the major complication post op.
It had become evident that the sarcoma recurred, thus he went to the OR earlier today for resection.
Pt was transferred to the floor on [**10-11**] and underwent paracentesis on [**10-20**] that returned 4+ PMNs, no microorganisms identified.
JP drain remained in place until discharge with small amount of chylous fluid collected.
Past Medical History: asthma diabetes left retroperitoneal sarcoma PSH Thoracoabdominal resection of left retroperitoneal sarcoma.

No definite vascular congestion.
Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
CXR [**2178-10-10**]: No previous images.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits without definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
No evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.
There is evidence of coronary artery calcification as well as previous CABG procedure with intact midline sternal wires.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..    FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2178-10-21**]): NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  Brief Hospital Course: 41 yo M with history of highly undifferentiated retroperitoneal sarcoma s/p resection in [**2177**], now with recurrence of tumor s/p resection and left nephrectomy, complicated by an EBL of roughly 5 Liters who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and stabilized and sent to the surgical floor.
While on the floor, pt developed abdominal distension and approximately 3L fluid was drained through paracentesis.
# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had significant EBL during his surgery.
He was monitored in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and when he was no longer bleeding was transferred to the floor.
# RP Sarcoma: Now s/p resection and left nephrectomy.
Patient on ancef for post op prohylacis x 3 doses.
# Pain and epidural catheter: Epidural catheter in, pain following and recommended adjusting the rate rather than adding on a pca.
Pain managed with IV pain meds on floor and transitioned to PO pain meds at time of discharge  # Respiratory failure: Intubated for procedure and remained intubated overnight on HD!1, he was extubated without problem and with increased IS and getting OOB his ABG improved and his respiratory acidosis improved.
You underwent a re-excision of a left retroperitoneal mass.
You have been recovering well, have adequate pain control and may return home for your recovery.
3.We recommended that you take an over-the-counter stool softener such as Colace and a laxative such as Senna to prevent constipation while on narcotic pain medication.
Monitor your abdominal incision for signs of infection, including redness that is spreading or increased drainge from wounds.
