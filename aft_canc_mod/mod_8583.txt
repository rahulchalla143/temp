The morphologic and immunophenotypic features are consistent with a lung primary.
Large left lower lobe FDG avid mass with multiple osseous and  hepatic metastases as well as large metastatic lymph nodes in the aortocaval and portocaval regions.
Asymmetric FDG avidity in the left vocal chord which may be due to tumor involvement of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve.
MRI HEAD [**2166-4-9**]: 3-mm lesion within the left cerebellar hemisphere with enhancement seen on only axial post-gadolinium images are not clearly visualized on the post-gadolinium MP-RAGE images as described above.
The presence of the lesion on the FLAIR and T2 images is suggestive of metastatic lesion.
No acute intracranial process.
Known left cerebellar lesion is not apparent on unenhanced CT. 2.
Aerosolized secretions and mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The gallbladder is decompressed, likely accounting for wall thickening, with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Limited images demonstrating no focal liver lesion, though correlation with recent PET-CT (reportedly showing focal liver lesions concerning for metastases) is advised.
CXR [**2166-4-12**]: There is again seen an area of consolidation projecting over the left base compatible with known infiltrate in the left lower lobe abutting the major fissure.
There is no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 year-old male with h/o newly diagnosed metastatic cancer with lung, liver, brain, and bone lesions via PET imaging, presented with altered mental status, liver failure, and hypercalcemia.
Patient was treated for hypercalcemia and hepatic encephalopathy in the ICU; IV fluids, calcitonin, and pamidronate for hypercalcemia and lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
CXR revealed PNA for which the patient was treated initially with levofloxacin and metronidazole and later broadened to cefepime and metronidazole.
Liver biopsy pathology revealed findings consistent with lung cancer.
The patient's liver failure progressively worsened with MELD score reaching 34 when labs stopped being drawn.
Because of the extremely grave prognosis of widely metastatic lung cancer (mets to the brain, liver nad bones) and hepatic failure, the patient opted to transition to hospice care.
His chief request was that he be made comfortable and that any pain related to cancer will be treated promptly and adequately.
On [**2166-4-23**], he was noted to have worsening in his mental status and to be more labored in his breathing.
He was reassessed and was noted to have unreactive pupils and no evidence of cardiopulmonary activity.
