Of note, he was most recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2141-1-15**] for hypoxia attributed to CHF flare that improved with HD.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient complained of shortness of breath for [**3-22**] days.
No chest pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Lungs with diffuse rhonchi and wheezes, mild LLQ pain to deep palpation but no rebound or guarding, and no pedal edema.
Sent to ED for evaluation, and recommended palliative care evaluation given multiple recent hospitalizations and difficulties at home.
Thought to be volume overloaded / CHF based on CXR and given 40IV lasix with some urine output, nitro, started on BiPAP with improvement O2sat to 96%.
Moderate respiratory distress on exam, guaiac negative.

Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo man with a history of ESRD on HD, emphysema and interstitial lung disease on home 2LNC, untreated CLL, RCC s/p nephrectomy, prostate cancer, bladder cancer who was sent to the ED from PCP's office for hypoxia and admitted to the ICU.
# Hypoxia: Patient with fluid overload in physical exam and on CXR upon presentation in a very labile patient with COPD, ILD with posibly increased blood viscosity in the setting of leukocytosis.
Patient was ruled out for MI with serial ECGs and negative cardiac enzymes.
Of note, patient had normal echocardiogram 4 months ago without evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
There were no focal signs or symptoms to suggest infection and CXR did not show consolidation, but showed pulmonary edema without any cardiomegaly.
# Dark stools: h/o diverticulosis but guaiac neg in ED and Hct at baseline.
# Anemia: Guaiac negative stools and CBC compatible with renal failure.
# ESRD on HD: HD T,Th,Sat [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].
# CLL: Diagnosed [**2131**].
WBC slightly above most recent baseline on admission.
