Admission Date:  [**2177-4-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-7-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**] Chief Complaint: lower extremity weakness, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 62 y/o F newly diagnosed rectal mass who presents with lower extremity weakness, numbness and acute urinary retention.
Prior to her aortofemoral bypass ([**2177-3-6**]) she had progressively worsening weakness of the bilateral lower extremities and ascending numbness (L > R) which somewhat improved following bypass but did not completely resolve.
1-2 weeks ago patient began to experience worsening weakness and numbness and today she had difficulty walking which prompted her to present to [**Hospital3 **].
Neurology, Neurosurgery and Radiology felt most likely her neurological symptoms were due to lumbosacral plexus invasion of tumor.
Based on exam and imaging available (MRI unable to be completed) they did not feel she was suffering from cauda equina or cord compression.
No saddle anesthesia on exam.
Patient later denied above urinary retention and described difficulty urinating due to preference of foley instead of bed pan.
They did not recommend steroids or surgical involvement.
Vascular service saw patient and found no acute vascular issues (palpable femoral and DP pulses B/L, normal CT aortic graft, no acute vascular issues).
Patient mentated and with good urine output with low BPs.
She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and concern she would trigger on the floor.

Large locally invasive rectal mass with increased pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Patent aortobifemoral graft with a right groin collection most likely seroma, although an abscess cannot be excluded.
Nodular adrenal glands with adjacent prominent lymph nodes.
Given known history of a rectal mass, this may represent distal nodal and adrenal metastases.
No evidence of spinal canal narrowing is demonstrated involving the thoracic or lumbar spine.
There is a wedge compression deformity of the superior endplate of L2.
Chronicity of this is inconclusive given no prior exams for comparison and no STIR sequence (the patient refused completion of the study) to evaluate for acute edema.
With the above limitations in mind, remainder of the study does not show acute abnormality to explain the patient's symptoms.
[**2177-4-27**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process .
Mixed hyper- and hypoechoic lesion at the borders of segment VII and VIII, corresponding to the approximately 2 cm lesion noted on CT, which displays more CT features of a hemangioma.
The other presumed probable flash-filling cavernous hemangioma within segment VI could not be identified son[**Name (NI) 5326**] despite extensive scanning through this region in multiple positions and is likely isoechoic to the surrounding parenchyma.
Again, CT features are most suggestive of hemangiomas and lesion would be highly atypical for rectal metastases.
Enlarged right adrenal gland may reflect underlying hyperplasia and is stable from prior CTs dating back to [**2177-3-5**].
Brief Hospital Course: 62yo F w/ newly diagnosed rectal adenocarcinoma with lower extremity weakness and intitial concern for cord compression which was ruled out and determined to be related to lumbosacral compression from tumor burden.
# Hypotension: On arrival to the hospital, patient was normotensive, in the emergency department, she was given valium and fentanly for sedation prior to MRI and became hypotensive to 60/40, she was bolused 4 L NS in the ED and admitted to the MICU.
Hypotension is of unclear etiology  likely hypovolemia versus medication side effect (occured following valium and fentanyl).
No evidence of infection to suggest septic shock.
No evidence of decompensated heart failure on exam or by history.
No increased O2 requirement to suggest massive PE or chest pain to suggest ACS.
Pt denied being on BP meds.
Her pressures remained within the 90's to 120's during the first few days and then the day prior to admission, the patient was hypertensive with SBP in the 130-150 range.
# Lower extremity weakness and numbness: On admission there was concern that this could represent cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
Originally reported urinary retention but on further history actually did not want to use a bed pan and preferred a foley.
MRI of the T- and L-spine were done and was not complete due to patient's anxiety but were reviewed by radiology and neurology and neurosurgery and felt to be sufficient to rule out cord compression.
Patient also examined by Neurology and Neurosourgery and exam was not consistent with cord compression or cauda equina.
Neurology and radiology felt symptoms due to lumbosacral plexus invasion of tumor.
Her Foley was discontinued when she arrived to the floor and was urinating without issues.
There was some initial concern that there was metastasis in the liver, but after further review, it was decided that they were more likely hemangiomas.
She was seen by physical therapy and because of her lower extremity weakness she was discharged to Rehab.
Per OMR patient worked up at [**Hospital3 **] - felt to be rectal cancer stage T2N1Mx.
# UTI: on [**5-8**] patient had dysuria and grossly positive UA, she was treated with ciprofloxacin and will need to continue for a total of 7 days.
# Aortofemoral bypass [**2177-3-6**] for actute aortic thrombus: Vascular evaluated in ED felt no vascular issues.
# CAD s/p MI 8 years ago (no intervention): No chest pain.
# Chronic pain: Diffuse also with l humerus fracture and rectal cancer.
Her pain was well controlled during the course of her stay.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg IV Q4H:PRN anxiety or nausea 15.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Lower extremity weakness Rectal adenocarcinoma Urinary tract infection  Secondary Diagnosis: Type II diabetes Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were transferred from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] for weakness in your legs.
You were evaluated by the Neurosurgery and Neurology specialists and an MRI showed that the spread of your rectal cancer is compressing the nerves that go to your legs which explains your symptoms.
You started chemotherapy in this hospital stay with 5-Fluorouracil and also started external beam radiation therapy.
While in the hospital, you were also found to have a urinary tract infection and you were started on a course of antibiotics as an outpatient which will be continued on discharge as instructed below.
