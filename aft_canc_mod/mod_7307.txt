Melanotic stools: Ms. [**Known lastname 107686**] presented with black/melanotic stools most consistent with an upper GI source, however an EGD done on admission showed ulcers/erosions but no active source of bleeding.
Ms. [**Known lastname 107686**] has known colon cancer, so there may be a component of lower GI bleeding as well.
(25.5 to 36)  After the patient cleared her MTX therapy, she underwent a repeat EGD for reevaluation of continued melanotic stool as well as for biopsy.
The repeat EGD did not reveal any active bleeding, only known esophagitis and gastritis.
Biopsy revealed HSV and she was started on Acyclovir 400mg 5x/day for 14days.
CNS lymphoma: Ms. [**Known lastname 107686**] is s/p several cycles of high-dose MTX and was due for MTX treatment on the day of admission, however treatment was initially held due to acute GI bleeding and recent neutropenia.
During the hospitalization she was discovered to have a strep viridans bacteremia (1/4 bottles) in addition to her urinary tract infection.
She began HD MTX therapy with no signs or symptoms of toxicity.
She had good urine output, no nausea, vomiting and took good PO throughout.
A TTE was done which showed no changes from a previous TTE, no vegetations on her valves.
ID felt that a TEE was not necessary to do as she had a likely GI source.
ID felt that as she has a GI cancer, the strep viridans was likely due to that and not likely to be due to endocarditis.
UTI: The patient presented with dysuria and a positive UA on admission.
It was reported that she had relative hypotension at rehab.
Given recent neutropenia and presence of 2 central lines, she was treated broadly with cefepime and vancomycin due to concern for sepsis.
During the hospitalization her white count improved and blood cultures revealed serratia sensitive to ceftriaxone.
The ceftriaxone also helped to treat the strep viridans bacteremia as above.
She remained afebrile throughout the admission.
She is currently not undergoing active treatment for this cancer, despite the fact that it is likely contributing to current GI bleeding, as she has been consistently guaiac positive and has had melanotic stools in the past.
Pulmonary emboli: On admission the patient presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.
Hypoxia and shortness of breath resolved on their own.
Chronic renal failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 107686**] has a baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.9 and presented to the hospital with a Cr of 1.7.
Her chronic renal failure is likely due to recent MTX therapy, progressive HTN, and pre-renal state on admission.
She did not have chest pain during the hospitalization.
TTE compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2175-9-27**], revealed diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle which is now evident; otherwise no major change.
Her beta blocker was held throughout the hospitalization secondary to the GI bleed.
