Admission Date:  [**2182-4-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old man with a previous history of a spindle cell myoepithelial tumor involving the right parotid gland.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 62739**] for altered mental status and febrile neutropenia.
No clear cause for his altered mental was found and he had a negative LP and MRI.
D/C'd on 7 day course of Levofloxacin for febrile neutropenia with no clear source.
He now returns with severe epigastric pain since this morning with associated profuse vomitting and diarrhea.
Denies any aggravating or alleviating symptoms.
States he may have had a somewhat similar pain "a while ago".
Denies HA, visual changes, CP, SOB, palpitations, F/C, dysuria, focal weakness, numbness or tingling.
An initial CT scan showed signs concerning for pancreatitis.
He remained afebrile but given his persistent neutropenia and a lactate of 4.6, he was given cefepime, vanco, and clindamycin.
The patient also had some brief ([**6-2**] sec) of asymptomatic bradycardia to the 30s to 40s.
BP remained stable and no intervention given.
He first noticed a soft-tissue mass in front of his right ear in [**2180-12-23**].
The painless mass grew in size so a CT head was done on [**2181-1-19**], which was notable for a 2 cm enhancing mass in the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland.
Pathology was consistent with a 3.2 cm spindle cell myoepithelial carcinoma focally extending into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue.
It was in the background of a residual pleomorphic adenoma.
It was re-biopsied on [**2181-3-26**], and found to be consistent with mild pleomorphic spindle cells.
On [**2181-5-25**], he went back to the OR and underwent right anterolateral thigh flap to the right facial and temporal region and multiple facial nerve grafts after undergoing total parotidectomy, with sacrifice of the facial nerve and subtotal right auriculectomy and a right modified radical neck dissection.
Pathology was notable for a tumor which measured 2.4 cm in greatest dimension in the cartilage of the external ear canal.
Pathology seemed consistent with but not completely compatible with his previous myoepithelial carcinoma, although the thought was this difference was secondary to radiation.
No malignancy was identified in 10 lymph nodes.
At that time, he remained persistently pancytopenic and a concern for myelodysplastic syndrome was raised.
On [**2181-10-17**], he underwent a revision flap with right myocutaneous facial flap, right lower lid repair.
After creation of the external auditory canal with adjacent tissue of the thigh flap, he developed redness and drainage at the site of thigh flap on [**2181-12-31**].
Thrombus extended from the inferior portions of the superficial femoral vein to the entire  popliteal vein and superior portions of the left saphenous vein  with nonocclusive thrombus in the mid superficial femoral vein.
Coumadin discontinued [**2182-2-15**] due to ongoing thrombocytopenia.
History of coronary artery disease-- no history of MI or CABG, .
Has severe inferior hypokinesis, and less severe hypokinesis in the anterior/anterolateral/anteroseptal walls on echo ([**5-31**]).
Facial cellulitis .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: - Extensive surgery and reconstruction related to his parotid gland tumor (as above).
PHYSICAL EXAM GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing male in NAD HEENT: s/p facial reconstruction on right with facial nerve palsy.
Well healed reconstructive surgery.
PERRL, OP clear (exam  limited) without ulcers or thrush, MMM, poor dentition CARDIAC: Regular rhythm with occ.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
ABDOMEN: Soft, diffusely tender in epigastrium, no rebound, voluntary guarding EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Findings compatible with acute pancreatitis.
Consider US to further assess for choledocholithiasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3.9 cm in diameter.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification with an air-fluid level is in the left mastoid air cells, chronic  [**2182-4-24**] RUQ u/s IMPRESSION: Equivocal findings for cholecystitis with gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid but no biliary ductal dilatation or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
While GB wall thickening and free fluid may be reactive secondary to underlying pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis cannot be entirely excluded.
[**2182-4-25**] ERCP Successful removal of sludge from the common bile duct with interval placement of common bile duct stent.
Please refer to ERCP note in OMR from [**2182-4-24**], for further findings, full details, and further recommendations  [**5-1**] CXR: FINDINGS: Worsening volume status of the patient with increasing perihilar haziness and interstitial edema.
Persistent left basilar opacity with adjacent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old male MDS s/p gallstone pancreatitis and febrile neutropenia, hospital course complicated by tachy-brady syndrome, altered mental status in the setting of peri-operative opiods, hypernatremia, and pancreatitis.
Patient recovered mental status with correction of hypernatremia and treatment of pancreatitis long enough to express his wishes for hospice.
#Delerium: Multiple etiologies including peri-operative opiods, hypernatremia worsened by poor PO intake and diarrhea, hypoxia in the setting of pulmonary edema, and gallstone pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis and hypernatremia were treated (see below), and all bowel regimen was held.
Patient noted to become oliguric/anuric with discontinuation of IV fluids, and passed away peacefully on [**2182-5-4**].
# Hypernatremia: Noted to be hypernatremic in the setting of poor PO intake and diarrhea secondary to lactulose (given in ICU presumably to treat encephalopathy).
#Tachy-Brady Syndrome: Patient noted to be tachycardic and bradycardic intermittently, without hemodynamic instability.
Per HCP, patient was not to be coded (shocked, have chest compressions, or IV medications) if hemodynamically unstable in the event of any persistent tachycardic or bradycardic events.
Pacer not recommend (unofficially) by EP due to patients poor cancer prognosis.
Once made CMO and all IV fluids were stopped, patient rapidly became oliguric and passed away.
MDS/AML: Patient has MDS transforming to leukemia, with poor prognosis (< 1 year).
Neutrapenia improving spontaneously.
Levofloxacin 500 mg PO Q24H until [**2182-4-29**]   Discharge Medications: None, expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: You were admitted with abdominal pain due to gallstone pancreatitis.
