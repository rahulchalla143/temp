Admission Date:  [**2105-8-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2105-8-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2040-10-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 43439**] is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diverticulitis, hyperlipidemia and appendectomy who presents as an admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after having massive hemoptysis during outpatient procedure.
The patient was an otherwise healthy, retired 64-year-old gentleman without significant past medical history who presented for elective bronchoscopy [**2105-8-11**] for investigation of a right upper lobe lung mass.
He was also noted to have a subcarinal mass which was biopsied in the Interventional Pulmonology Suite.
The patient began to cough and have massive hemoptysis.
Subsequently, he had cardiac arrest, initially, ventricular fibrillation followed by asystole.
He was given epinephrine intravenously with return of a narrow complex rhythm pulse with intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Subsequent to that, he was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated on propofol drip with transient hypertension responding to intravenous fluids.
Hyperlipidemia 3.
Aspirin 81 mg po q day  ALLERGIES:  There are no known drug allergies.
CHEST:  He had coarse breath sounds throughout with bilateral rhonchi, right greater than left.
Decreased breath sounds at the right base, no crackles.
HEART:  Regular rate with 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, no gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, pulses 2+ distally, warm.
Post intubation chest x-ray showed right upper lobe mass, diffuse alveolar opacification on the right lungs with good position of endotracheal tube.
He had a myriad of issues and the following is a summary of each of his medical issues by system.
PULMONARY:  The patient had evidence of subsequent infiltrates in the left apex and diffuse interstitial markings, left greater than right, with question of asymmetric pulmonary edema.
On hospital day 2, he subsequently developed fevers and leukocytosis, was empirically covered for aspiration pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia broadly with levofloxacin and clindamycin.
He completed a 14 day course of empiric therapy for aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and clindamycin.
On [**2105-8-14**], he grew sparse gram negative rods and sparse yeast in a respiratory culture and had 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs on induced sputum.
Given continued low grade temperatures, vancomycin was added on [**2105-8-18**] for broader antibiotic coverage.
Given his slow wean from the ventilator, discussions were held with the family regarding utility of tracheostomy and the patient's wishes regarding reintubation should he fail extubation.
He has had no clear extrapulmonary disease, however given the location of his subcarinal lung mass which appeared to be eroding into the right main stem bronchus, he was given tumor classification of 3A.
Of note, the patient did not have a bone scan for further definitive staging of his mild small cell lung carcinoma given constraints while he was on the ventilator.
He did have some transient right lower rib pain with negative rib films resolving supportive therapy.
Question whether this is related to pleural base pulmonary process resolving with treatment of underlying pulmonary disease.
NEUROLOGIC STATUS:  The patient sustained VF and asystolic arrest, it was unclear of the duration, in which he was hypoxemic or hypotensive.
He had a head CT which showed no evidence of acute infarction.
He was also quite agitated intermittently, especially when he would have plugging in his airways likely secondary to bleeding or tumor embolization.
He responded with variable success to moderate doses of benzodiazepines.
The patient and his wife are routinely frustrated, given his difficulty in maintaining orientation and complying with medical therapy.
It is believed by the care team that he most likely sustained some measure of hypoxic encephalopathy during his cardiac arrest.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic throughout his hospital stay after stabilization of his blood pressure initially corresponding with his episodes of agitation.
His rhythm generally is sinus, occasionally shows evidence of multifocal atrial tachycardia and occasionally frequent atrial ectopy.
No evidence of atrial fibrillation was noted during his hospitalization.
His tachycardia generally responds to treatment of his underlying anxiety and suctioning.
He showed no evidence of coronary ischemia or cardiac failure during his hospitalization.
Subsequent to his cardiac arrest presentation, he had no ventricular ectopy or ventricular arrhythmias which were functionally or hemodynamically significant.
The patient had a generalized tonic clonic seizure post cardiac rest and was initially treated with Dilantin.
It is felt to be related to metabolic abnormalities during his arrest and after four to five days od therapy, Dilantin therapy was discontinued and the patient had no subsequent episodes of seizure.
He showed no evidence of postictal activity.
He had an EEG on [**2105-8-14**] which showed findings consistent with diffuse encephalopathy of cortical and subcortical structures without any evidence of epileptiform features.
NUTRITION:  Given the patient's initial pneumonic process which was potentially aspiration related and his difficulty in managing his airway given his secretions and his subcarinal tumor and his pulling out his nasogastric tube on a couple of occasions, we were somewhat concerned about oral refeeding.
Cardiac arrest during bronchoscopy, ventricular fibrillation and asystole.
Aspiration pneumonia with copious residual secretions requiring aggressive suctioning 4.
