Admission Date:  [**2192-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-1-11**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Intracerebral hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 72539**] is an 85 year old right-handed man with a history of hypertension (per his wife it is not severe) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (stable for 17 years), who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with the diagnosis of left intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Per his wife he had not recently been ill and was feeling quite well this morning, without complaint of headache, visual changes, or new trouble with his balance.
He has chronic low back pain and had an appointment with his chiropractor this morning.
They found him with right face/arm/leg weakness and slurred speech.
There he was described as having no speech output but he was following commands.
He had a head CT which revealed a small (about 3 x 2.5 cm) hemorrhage in the left external capsule, with no midline shift and no intraventricular blood.
Upon arrival here his blood pressure was elevated at 188/77 and he was given hydralazine.
He was taken for head CT, and per recommendation of Neurosurgery, CTA (presumably to look for dissection, although per his wife he gets no neck manipulation).
Review of systems:  No recent fever, weight loss, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.
No complaints of headache, diplopia, dysarthria, tinnitus, vertigo, dysphagia, weakness, numbness, or paresthesias prior to this event.
Past Medical History: - Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72540**] at BU; diagnosed in [**2174**], s/p treatment with "photopheresis" and currently maintained on a medication called "Targretin" - Hypertension - per his wife they have never been told that it is severe - S/p "tongue cancer" ?leukoplakia - Chronic back pain   Social History: Lives with his wife.
Physical Exam: (initially examined while lying flat awaiting CT, then later seen while sitting up, when much more awake) T  Afebrile   HR 54  BP 140/63   RR 18  Pulse Ox 98% on 2L NC General appearance:  Sleepy 85 year old man in NAD HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No carotid or vertebral bruits.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Mental Status: (when lying flat) Somnolent.
No spontaneous eye opening, briefly opens eyes to sternal rub but requires repeated stimulation.
Does not mimic movements.
There is no nystagmus.
Motor System: Exam somewhat limited due to global aphasia and initially, somnolence.
Sensory: Withdraws to noxious stimuli with left arm and leg, grimaces and extends right arm, does not respond to noxious in right leg.
Pertinent Results: At [**Hospital **] Hospital: 2.5>11.1/33.2<322 PT 11.6 INR 0.95  PTT 29.9  UA: SG 1011, negative  129  96  21  100    AGap=17 4.5  21  1.0 Comments: K: Hemolysis Falsely Elevates K  estGFR: 71 / >75 (click for details)  MCV 92 3.3 > 11.4 < 322       32.5  N:62.6 L:22.9 M:11.5 E:2.9 Bas:0.2  PT: 13.1  PTT: 27.2  INR: 1.1  Imaging: CXR: negative for CHF or PNA  Head CT/CTA [**1-9**]: FINDINGS: There is a large 4.1 x 7.8 cm intraparenchymal hematoma in the left basal ganglia,frontal and temporal lobes with intraventricular extension.
There is midline shift of approximately 8.8 mm with effacement of the ipsilateral ventricle.
There is mild trapping of the contralateral ventricle.
There are confluent hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter compatible with small vessel ischemia in a patient of this age group.
There is a prominent right frontal extra-axial space.
Evaluation of the CTA of the brain demonstrates no aneurysm or hemodynamically significant stenosis.
There is calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally.
There is mild stenosis of the left PCA.
Evaluation of the CTA of the neck demonstrates calcified atheromatous plaquing at the origin of the right distal common carotid artery and bulb extending to the proximal ICA.
There is approximately 50% stenosis of the distal common carotid artery/carotid bulb and mild stenosis of the proximal ICA which does not appear to be hemodynamically significant.
There is a focal calcific plaque at the origin of the right vertebral artery which is occluded.
Large left intraparenchymal hematoma in the left basal ganglia and frontal and temporal lobes.
No underlying lesion noted on the CTA.
Approximately 50% stenosis of the right carotid bulb extending to the proximal ICA with a calcified plaque.
Occlusion of the right vertebral artery with a calcific plaque at the origin.
EKG: Sinus bradycardia First degree A-V delay Consider left atrial abnormality although baseline artifact makes assessment difficult No previous tracing available for comparison   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 54 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 72541**] 31 54   Head CT [**1-10**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large evolving 7.4 x 3.8 cm left intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left basal ganglia.
There is surrounding edema which causes moderate mass effect.
There is compression of the left lateral ventricle and entrapping of the right lateral ventricle.
A small amount of blood is seen layering the right atrium and a moderate amount of blood is seen layering the left atrium.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
Evolving left intraparenchymal hematoma centered at the left basal ganglia with surrounding edema resulting in a 9-mm of rightward subfalcine herniation and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Moderate amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old man with history of hypertension, now with left external capsule hemorrhage, which had more than doubled in size in the past 4 hours, although he had no evidence of coagulopathy.
He had significant involvement of most of the left hemisphere, blood in the left lateral ventricle, midline shift and right subfalcine herniation.
The etiology of the hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive, although the location was a bit unusual (would expect basal ganglia or thalamus), but another spike in his blood pressure may have been responsible for the expansion of the bleed.
The subcortical location would not be typical for amyloid angiopathy.
Clinically, on initial exam, he was fairly awake, although he was globally aphasic and had a dense right hemiparesis.
He was at significant risk for deterioration of his mental status, especially given the subfalcine herniation.
Neurosurgery had spoken with the family about the possibility of an EVD, but Mrs. [**Known lastname 72539**] felt that he would not want to have any surgical intervention.
She expressed that initially he could be intubated if his mental status were to decline, but if the intubation were to become prolonged, they would reconsider whether they wanted to keep the tube in.
He was loaded with 1g Dilantin which was subsequently discontinued upon re-evaluation in the am since his bleed was subcortical and risk of seizure was low.
Head of bed elevated greater than 30 degrees and kept euthermic and euglycemic.
Repeat head CT the following morning showed an evolving left intraparenchymal hematoma centered at the left basal ganglia with surrounding edema resulting in a 9-mm of rightward subfalcine herniation and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
There was also a moderate amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
CV: Ruled out myocardial infarction.
EKG notable for first degree AV block and sinus bradycardia without priors for comparison.
