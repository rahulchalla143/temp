It also radiates up to the back of the head, consistent with occipital headaches.
He did do a course of physical therapy for what was thought to be muscle spasms, but it was not at all helpful.
Two after developing neck pain patient started have weakness on the left upper extremity.
He also complains of some clumsiness with his left hand more so than his right.
He also describes a generalized unsteadiness that has caused him to be much less active on his feet.
He had MRI/ cervical spine at Health Alliance MRI/center on [**2101-6-18**] which showed a large mass is best appreciated on the T1 and T2 Weighted sequence and appears to arise from the posterior elements of  C2.
[**2101-6-22**]  CT/Head at Health Alliance MRI center that showed a hypodensity within the brainstem.

**FINAL REPORT [**2101-7-12**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2101-7-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
No previous chest examinations available for comparison.
Lung mass measuring 3.1 x 6.0 x 6.8 cm proximal to the right hilum with a single adjacent enlarged hilar lymph node concerning for primary malignancy.
10 mm hypodense/hypoenhancing focus Segment VIII in the right liver lobe is not completely characterized on this exam.
7 mm arterial hyperenhancing nodule in the body of the pancreas.
Differential includes a primary pancreatic tumor (such as a neuroendocrine tumor) or metastasis.
8 mm soft tissue nodule in the mesentery in the left upper quadrant concerning for metastasis.
MRI L-SPINE [**2101-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous signal intensity mass involving the lateral mass of C2 vertebra, likely a bony metastasis.
Visualized lung parenchyma reveals multiple rim-enhancing lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere and brainstem likely metastasis.
Stable-appearing metastatic disease with no evidence of any new hemorrhage.
Mucosal thickening of left maxillary sinus.
FNA [**2101-7-8**] R HILAR MASS: DIAGNOSIS: FNA, Right hilar mass:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with poorly-differentiated non-small cell   carcinoma with extensive necrosis.
C-2 LESION PATH [**2101-7-12**]: DIAGNOSIS: C2 lesion (A-D): Metastatic large cell carcinoma consistent with lung origin, see note.
CXR [**2101-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No abnormalities to explain patient's symptoms within the limitations of this study technique.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
There are no signs of hardware-related complications.
There is generalized demineralization.
CT HEAD W/OUT CONTRAST [**2101-7-12**]: IMPRESSION: No overt interval change on noncontrast head CT. MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically indicated.
Status post posterior occipital-C4 fusion without evidence of hardware migration into the spinal canal or neural foramina.
Large right lateral paravertebral mass at C2 and C3 levels, completely destroying the right aspect of C2, similar to the prior exams.
Enhancing mass involving the right aspect of C2 vertebral body/lateral mass engulfing the right vertebral artery and obstructing the right neuroforamina.
No evidence of involvement of the spinal canal at this level.
Degenerative changes as described above worse at c5-6 and c6-7 with posterior osteophytes indenting and flattening the spinal cord but no evidence of spinal cord signal abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80yo man with a history of atrial fibrillation, HTN, HLD, likely coronary artery disease and significant smoking history with COPD who was admitted for the work up of a large C2 verterbral body mass with associated c-spine compression and radicular weakness.
Ultimately, by imaging, we have been able to show the presence of a mediastinal mass associated with abdominal metastasis as well as evidence of multiple CNS metastases with evidence of internal hemorrhage.
Preliminary pathology shows high grade poorly differentiated squamous cell.
# NEURO: Patient with L arm weakness that was likely related to his spinal met, but could also have been effected by his CNS mets.
He underwent C-spine stabilization and biopsy of his C-spine mass which showed metastatic lung pathology.
In addition we started pt on dexamethasone 4mg Q6H to prevent swelling and further CNS damage.
We controlled his pain on oxycodone 5mg Q6H PRN, but this does sedate patient, so we tried to avoid it as much as possible.
# HEM/ONC: Mediastinal mass biopsy returns as a poorly differentiated squamous cell cancer, and C-spine biopsy returned as lung pathology making pt's sx likely related to metastatic lung cancer.
# ORTHO: Pt s/p c-spine stabilization on [**7-11**], biopsy was obtained intraoperatively.
# CARDS: Pt with afib with rates at 100-120, but we decided to not anticoagulate at this time as pt's CNS mets are hemorrhagic.
His diltiazem can be increased if her continues to have elevated rates.
# ENDO: Pt shown to have elevated free T3 with low TSH, likely worsening his atrial fibrillation.
Endo consult felt that his hyperthyroidism could not be evaluated while pt was acutely ill as thyroid studies are not accurate for inpatients.
This will need to be followed as pt recovers from his acute illness  # PULM: Pt with known COPD, so we put him on albuterol and ipratropium nebs.

Some diffuse weakness of lower extremities bilaterally   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 60013**], You were admitted to the hospital for neck pain.
While here, we determined that you had lung cancer which had metastasized to your C2 vertebrae and your brain.
We made the following changes to your medications: 1) We STOPPED your WARFARIN, because your brain metastases are hemorrhagic and it would be dangerous to thin your blood at this time.
6) We STARTED you on DOCUSATE 200mg twice a day as needed for constipation.
