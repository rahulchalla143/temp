Left thalamic bleed 2.
Pleural thickening consistent with advanced stage mesothelioma 3.
Multiple nodules in the adrenal gland and liver consistent with possible metastatic spread of previous renal cell carcinoma  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old man with past medical history of asthma, metastases of renal cell carcinoma, status post nephrectomy in [**2191**] and history of deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin and was in his usual state of health until approximately 2 PM on the day of admission, [**11-29**].
He suddenly complained of weakness and being unable to stand up from sitting.
He was apparently conversant at the time and denied any headache, nausea, or vomiting.
At this time he began to become agitated and developed difficulty speaking which was apparently noted to be aphasia.
In the Emergency Room the patient is unable to give any additional history due to confusion and aphasia.
He had a computerized axial tomography scan repeated here which showed a 2.7 by 2 by 2 cm extension of bleed with minimal right shift.
He still denies headache, nausea, vomiting and chest pain.
He has shortness of breath which is found to be baseline due to his asbestosis.
Asbestosis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Renal cell carcinoma resected in [**2191**].
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Not able to be reliably obtained, but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, headache, fever or chills.
Pulmonary, decreased breathsounds throughout with fine crackles at the bases.
Extremities, no edema or calf tenderness.
Neurological examination showed the patient to be alert, oriented to name, speech fluent with frequent paraphrasic errors.
Cranial nerves showed pupils 2 mm and reactive on the left and right pupil post surgical, left gaze preference.
Right lower extremity with some tone and spontaneous movement but triple flexion to pain.
Difficult to assess          for left sensory, normal withdraw to pain on left, reflexes poor to pain on the right as described above, he does not say that he is feeling the pain or that he is being touch on the right leg.
He can not do DSS due to comprehension.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission outside hospital day #5 computerized tomography scan of head as above.

He was initially managed in the Intensive Care Unit and since then he had to be intubated on [**11-30**] for respiratory distress.
On the floor he had fevers and he had been started on Levaquin.
His pulmonary status has remained guarded with episodes of tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation.
Several chest x-rays have been done that were suggestive of consolidative process.
However, on one of the last x-rays the comment was made that findings were concerning for pleural thickening and on radiology's suggestion computerized axial tomography scan of the chest was obtained.
Left pleural thickening consistent with mesothelioma; 2.
Lymphangitic progression on the right base, also with bronchovascular thickening and there was extensive mucous plug noted.
They feel that this is metastatic cancer from either kidney or there is end stage mesothelioma.
He was in no acute distress, sitting up in a chair, regular rate and rhythm, difficult to assess lung sounds, because of coarse breathsounds.
The patient from the neurology point of view, the patient continues to have right hemiparesis, unable to communicate intelligibly.
Of note, the patient also had an episode of hypernatremia which was corrected by increasing free water boluses from 250 q.
