Admission Date:  [**2151-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-12-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Seizure and Increased Rt subdural hematoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The information was provided by the patient's daughter and son-in-law.
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old hypertensive diabetic gentleman with a past medical history of Atrial fibrillation(not on anticoagulation due to hemorrhagic stroke in [**2151-3-27**]), PMR/RA, BPH, urinary retention/chronic foley after stroke in [**4-4**], and prostate CA (on hormonal therapy, mets to pelvic bone) who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to the neurosurgical service for seizures and enlarging Right subdural hematoma (he has bilateral chronic subdural hematoma).
He fell down on [**2151-12-6**] while he was hospitalized for UTI & PNA (s/p Lt thoracentesis for para-pneumonic effusions) at [**Hospital1 **] that was treated with imipenem.
He had a CT head the same day that showed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma.
A repeat CT head next day was done which showed no significant change.
CT head at that time showed enlargement of the right subdural hematoma, and CXR showed a fractured left clavicle.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
Past Medical History: HTN, hemorrhagic stroke, NIDDM, PMR/RA, BPH and prostate CA.
AFIb (not on coumadin), chronic urine retention on chronic foley's   Social History: Lives with daughter at home   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission: ************* Vitals: 95.9, 116/73, 94 bpm irregular, RR 24, sat99%RA GEN: Not in acute distress sitting comfortably in bed.
HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, no lesions noted.
No conjunctival pallor noted.
CV: irregular rhythm with normal rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops PULM: relatively good A/E bilaterally, harsh exp gurggling sounds bilaterally and harsh end-insp "wheeze" like sounds are heard, particularly midzone and lower zone while upper zones are clear.
Wasn't capable of doing finger-to-nose test or rapid-alternating test.
SKIN: No ulcerations or rashes noted.
On discharge: ************* Vitals: T96, 135/90, 84 bpm irregular , RR 18, 94%sat on RA GEN: Not in acute distress, lying flat with elevated bed head at 30 degrees.
HEENT: Mucous membranes relatively dry, no lesions noted.
No conjunctival pallor noted.
CV: irregular rhythm with normal rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops PULM: relatively good A/E bilaterally, faint insp crackles on the right side, but no insp crackles could be appreciated on the left side.
SKIN: grade I ulcer at the sacral area.
Right base opacity raises concern for consolidation, such as pneumonia or aspiration.
Non-displaced distal left clavicle fracture of indeterminate age, but which may be acute.
However, the presence of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
The right lung base shows a minimal area of atelectasis.
Essentially unchanged bilateral subacute-to-chronic subdural hematomas compared to outside hospital studies.
No definite new foci of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No significant midline shift.
Allowing for differences in patient positioning, there is essentially no change in bilateral hypodense subdural collections, right greater than left.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
There is unchanged minimal leftward shift of the anterior falx and septum pellucidum.
Parenchymal hypodensity and encephalomalacia in the right posterior frontal and parietal lobes are again noted, likely a chronic right MCA infarct.
Scattered periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are also again seen, likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is a small amount of fluid in the right maxillary sinus.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral hypodense subdural collections, right greater than left, appear similar to [**2151-12-11**], but larger than on [**2151-12-7**].
EEG [**2151-12-16**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the slow posterior and other background and due to the occasional generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy.
With regard to the hematomas, there was no prominent loss of background voltage on either side though that is a very insensitive indicator of subdural fluid.
There may have been a bit of slowing on the left, but nothing persistent or prominent.
The single epileptiform sharp wave was likely related to movement artifact, and there were no similar findings in the rest of the tracing.
An abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman, DM, HTN, Afib (not on anticoagulation), BPH, urine retention on chronic foley after stroke on [**2151-3-27**], prostate Ca (mets to pelvic bone) was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of his very recent seizure on [**2151-12-10**] and enlarging right subdural hematoma (has chronic bilateral subdural hematomas).
# Goals of Care: Over the course of his hospitalization, the patient had a substantial clinical decline.
He was unable to interact with family and medical team in a meaningful way, and was unable to take oral nutrition and medications without aspiration.
If he is improving, there should be discussion about treatment of next infection ( resp or urine) with options to treat aggressively if this is within keeping of goals/current status.
This option will only be favorable if pt does not experience discomfort with catheterization.
Family has made decision that artificial feeding is not in keeping with overall goals of care.
Use of end of life care medications to manage respiratory distress should only be started after discussion with daughter."
# Seizure & chronic subdural hematoma:  Pt was thought to possibly have a seizure focus from the previous stroke, subdural hematoma, or significant lowering of seizure threshold secondary to imipenem that he received in his admission on [**2151-11-30**] to [**Hospital3 4107**] for UTI/PNA.
He was also evaluated by neurology who recommended that he continue Keppra 500 mg twice daily for seizure prophylaxis.
# Altered mental status: His mental status was noticed to deteriorate dramatically following his seizure (according to the daughter and son in law).
Possibly causes included multiple intracranial co-morbidities, and infections (pneumonia and UTI).
He was evaluated by speech and swallow several times which revealed his poor swallowing capability and high risk of aspiration.
However, NG tube was removed after a family decision was made to improve the patient's comfort despite risk of aspiration.
# Pneumonia: The patient was admitted on [**2151-11-30**] to [**Hospital1 **] for complex UTI and pneumonia.
CXR on admission showed Rt lower zone infiltrate with blunting of Rt costophrenic angle.
It was felt to be a new Rt sided pneumonia since from OSH his prior pneumonia was on the left side.
Aspiration was the most likely cause given his poor speech and swallow function.
# Diabetes Mellitus:  The patient was initially on fixed dose lantus and humalog sliding scale with meals.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient has been in atrial fibrillation for the duration of his hospitalization.
Coumadin has been held since [**2151-3-27**] due to recent hemorrhagic stroke.
7. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: Six [**Age over 90 1230**]y (650) mg PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Use either ativan or rectal diazepam, but not both.
Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: chronic bilateral subdural hematoma UTI Pneumonia Left Clavicle fracture  Secondary diagnoses: Diabetes Hypertension Atrial fibrillation (not on coumadin) metastatic prostate cancer chronic urine retention with indwelling foley's   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
DNR - DNI   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **] and family,  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of seizure and increase in the size of blood around his brain on the right side.
During his stay, he was evaluated by speech and swallow team several times that showed impaired swallowing and high risk of aspiration.
On admission, there was an infection in his right lower lung, for which he was receiving an IV antibiotic.
After few days of hospitalization, he had another infection in his left lower lung, most likely due to aspiration.
Keppra 500 mg twice daily was added to prevent further seizure.
