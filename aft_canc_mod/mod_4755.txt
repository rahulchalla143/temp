10 days prior to admission, he sustained a fall in his yard.
The pain was [**2145-6-24**] and is getting progressively worse.
He had pain on his right side which he attributed to broken ribs.
The following day, he presented to an OSH ED, where he was told to take Ibuprofen for pain control.
He had continued pain and visited his primary oncologist in clinic the day of presentation ([**6-15**]) where he was found to have fractures of the 7th-9th rib on CXR.
He was admitted for pain control.
He denies any focal weakness but notes some increased shakiness with his left hand.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI; difficult to take a deep breath secondary to rib pain.
Denies headache, chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.

Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63 year old male with Stage IV small cell lung cancer with involvement of the liver and a dermatomyositis paraneoplastic syndrome, h/o PE in the setting of malignancy and IVIG initially presented s/p fall for rib pain.
Patient subsequently had an MRI of the brain which showed a large cerebellar lesion which is presumed to be metastasis from his SCLC.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Cerebellar metastasis: Patient initially admitted to OMED for rib fractures and pain management.
He was noted to have right-sided weakness so MRI was performed.
MRI revealed new cerebellar mass, likely metastasis from his SCLC.
Neurosurgery was consulted and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] ICU where follow-up head CT showed no herniation, worse edema or hydrocephalus.
He was started on dexamethasone 6mg IV q4 hours and his symptoms (including weakness) resolved, however he remains at high risk for herniation.
Repeat CT head on [**6-28**] done to assess for edema showed some improvement in mass effect and edema so his dexamethasone was tapered to 4mg q6 hours.
Patient's neurologic exam has remained stable with slight dysmetria on finger-nose test.
# Falls/Rib Fracture:  Likely due to mechanical fall versus related imbalance from cerebellar lesion (see above).
Pt was started on narcotics for pain control.
MRI brain showed cerebellar met as above.
He was continued on oxycontin with oxycodone for pain control.
# Dermatomyositis: On Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg [**Hospital1 **].
Hx of treatment with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine.
