Postsurgical changes in the frontal lobes bilaterally.
Thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein with changes suggesting partial recanalization.
No evidence of thrombus within the right subclavian vein, left internal jugular vein, or left subclavian vein.
There is a persistent loculated fluid  collection with an adjacent pigtail catheter, unchanged.
Development of patchy opacities bilaterally, worrisome for a multifocal pneumonia.
[**2121-11-23**] Chest Xray: Right upper lobe cavity with an air fluid level.
No interval change in right upper lobe consolidation with diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral pleural effusions.
BRONCHOSCOPY: [**2121-11-11**]: Right upper lobe stump intact, diffuse right middle lobe/right lower lobe malacia with moderate secretions.
Progression of disease compared to [**2121-11-12**], with marked bronchovascular thickening suggestive of worsening lymphangitic spread of disease.
Soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe (series 3 image 23) that is increased when compared to [**2121-11-12**].
Tissue density within both hila and adjacent to the carina that have an appearance suggestive of lymphadenopathy that has worsened compared to the previous examination.
Unchanged destruction and soft tissue density involving 2 left-sided lateral ribs.
Slightly increased size of a left-sided pleural effusion with unchanged right-sided effusion/pleural thickening.
The thick-walled air-filled cavity within the right lung apex has decreased in size compared to [**2121-11-12**], within both lungs suggestive of hydrostatic edema.
Several low attenuation lesions within the liver that are suspicious for metastatic disease.
Successful 15-gauge core biopsy of a soft tissue mass within a left-sided rib, as discussed above.
Stable pleural effusions and diffuse lung disease within the partially imaged chest, as previously described on multiple recent chest CT exams.
Although this CT-guided biopsy procedure did not include an exhaustive evaluation of the liver parenchyma, these lesions are highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: RIB FNA BX DIAGNOSIS: Rib, FNA biopsy: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma consistent with lung origin.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 year old female with a complicated thoracic history who was admitted with mental status changes and nausea several days after being discharged status-post an Eloesser flap closure of a right chest empyema.
Cultures on admission were notable for Klebsiella in her urine and Klebsiella and MRSA in her sputum.
Blood cultures were all negative while subsequent sputum cultures and culture of drainage fluid from her Right chest revealed continued Klebsiella and MRSA; a subseqenet urine culture after admission was negative.
Her CT scan of her head was unremarkable.
She was also noted to be hypoxia on admission with desaturation to 80% on maximum nasal canula flow; this improved when she was placed on a non-rebreather face mask.
She underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2121-11-11**] which demonstrated malacia and secretions in her right lower and right middle lobe.
Post-operatively the patient had good pain control.
Her discharge plan was to continue with IV antibiotic coverage for Klebsiella and MRSA, coumadin for a right IJ clot diagnosed in early [**10-30**], intermittent irrigation of her apical right pleural compartment through her Malecot drain, and a regular diet in small meals.
She will be discharged to rehab with planned follow-up with thoracic surgery.
On [**11-26**], however, Pt had suddent onset of bleeding and hemoptysis with INR of 4.8.
Bronchoscopy done on [**11-27**] with evidence of clot but no active bleeding in the LUL/LLL.
Supportive care continued, with TF, mechanical ventilation, b-block for arrhythmia.
Pt spiking fevers while in SICU, started on Vanc and Zosyn.
Sputum cx after bronch on [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] positive for klebsiella pneumonia.
A bedside swallow eval performed on [**12-10**], which the pt failed secondary to frequent coughing.
Pt reintubated on [**12-12**] for increasing respiratory distress.
A Bronch performed which showed mod mucous plugs and increased secretions.
Pt then self-extubated on [**12-14**], but was able to tolerated extubation with aggressive pulmnary toilet.
Pt with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mentition at this time, attributed to ongoing pulmonary infections and medications.
Pt then reintubated due to increased labored breathing on [**12-19**].
CT chest done on [**1-1**] with evidence of increasing mass lesion on two left lateral ribs.
A biopsy was performed which showed metastatic disease.
Scopolamine Base 1.5 mg Patch every 72 hours for nausea 11.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Combivent 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
