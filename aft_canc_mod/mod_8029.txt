Mr. [**Known lastname 26438**] had been undergoing day 9 of XRT to his R shoulder and R hip for pain related to metastatic lesions and complained to his radiation oncologist of new onset burning symptoms in his LUE.
As a result of these symptoms an MRI was performed which demonstrated a T1 lesion with cord compression.
He denies neck pain/back pain, incontinence of stool/urine, fevers/chills, or other symptoms of paresthesias/weakness elsewhere.
In the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname 26438**]' vitals were 96.6 66 151/95 18 100% on RA, exam notable for no saddle anesthesia, but decreased rectal tone.
There he endoresed LUE paresthesias.
CT of T and C spine was obtained which demonstrated compression fracture at T1 with retropulsoin into the canal.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies dysuria, stool or urine incontinence.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
Past Medical History: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 26438**] developed hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of hepatitis C cirrhosis.
Screening ultrasound [**2132-11-29**] raised concern for a mass in the right liver, and his AFP was elevated at 56.9.
MRI [**2132-12-20**] showed a mass in segment V measuring 2.9 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm with arterial enhancement and wash-out, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
CT torso on [**2132-12-30**] identified a 3.2 cm mass with arterial enhancement and wash-out in segment VI/VII.
Also seen were two 2-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodules as well as a fracture in the right 10th rib.
Bone scan was negative for metastases.
EGD on [**2132-12-17**] showed grade II varices which were banded.
Despite this his AFP continued to rise, and bone [**2133-10-12**] identified numerous lesions concerning for bone metastases.
Bone biopsy performed [**2133-10-29**], confirmed the finding of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
Family History: His mother died at age 72 with metastatic breast cancer.
His sister has diabetes mellitus.

no edema NEURO: [**5-14**] diffusely, CN 2-12 intact.
Cortical irregularity of the inferior endplate of T12, possibly extending into posterior elements, likely representing metastatic disease and better evaluated on recent MRI.
Lucencies within the vertebral bodies of T5, T8 and T11 also corresponding to signal abnormality seen on recent MR and likely representing metastatic disease.
No evidence of cord compression in the thoracic spine from T2 through T12.
Coarse calcifications of the liver, likely from prior TACE procedure.
[**2133-12-2**] T-SPINE XRAY IN THE OR:  Limited evaluation of the upper thoracic spine due to overlying soft tissue and bony structures.
No prevertebral swelling is identified.
Cervical lordosis is preserved.
No cervical body vertebral fracture is identified.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Hardware is intact without signs of complication.
IMPRESSION: Anterior fusion from C7-T2 and cage placement status post T1 corpectomy without hardware complication.
Spine Tumor Pathology [**2133-12-2**]: Pending     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26438**] is a 59 year old with a PMHx s/f Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C and metastatic HCC who presents for evaluation of cord compression with resulting LUE "burning".
#  Cord Compression from metastatic HCC: Likely secondary to T11 retropulsion from metastatic HCC.
Pt with parastesias and pain in his arms.
Pain was controlled with MScontin and oxycodone as well as gabapentin for neuropathic pain.
He tolerated the procedure well without complication.
Post-operatively he denied any parastesias or pain.
He remained on his MS contin 60mg [**Hospital1 **], PRN oxycodone, and gabapentin for pain on discharge.
#  Cirrhosis with thrombocytopenia:  Pt was continued on his nadolol.
His thrombocytopenia was likely secondary to his Cirrhosis, and he received 7U of platelets during admission to maintain Plt>50 in the perioperative setting to reduce risk of bleed (see above section).
These were restarted without complication on discharge.
# Pathology from OR tumor specimen still pending # Pt given instructions to follow up with spine surgery in 2 weeks after discharge # He was encouraged to make a follow up appointment with his primary oncologist # Platelets should be monitored as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 26438**],  You were admitted to the hospital for compression of your spinal cord due to your cancer.
You received several units of platelets during admission to decrease the risk of post-operative bleeding.
-      Swallowing: Difficulty swallowing is not uncommon after this type of surgery.
If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
If you have an incision on your hip please follow the same instructions in terms of wound care.
