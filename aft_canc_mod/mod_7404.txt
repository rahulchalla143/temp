She had been c/o weakness for the past several weeks along with worsening back pain.
She has had a nonproductive cough 3 days PTA.
She has had intermittent nausea and some abdominal pain, but no vomiting.
She denies any burning when she urinates but does note that her R nephrostomy tube has been painful and the urine in it has been bloodier.
She denies any swelling in her legs, PND, or orthopnea.
She denies any recent bruising, bleeding, or skin changes.
However, [**First Name3 (LF) **] said her CXR did not show evidence of pneumonia so she was sent for CTA which was concerning for atypical pneumonia.
On the floor, she was treated for PCP pneumonia vs. HAP.
On the floor, in the PM [**2121-1-5**], the patient triggered for hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 90% on a NRB.
She is currently being treated for pneumonia, possible PCP pneumonia vs. HAP.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for possible non-invasive ventilation and closer hemodynamic monitoring.
Breast cancer - dx [**2112**] by chest MRI, s/p left mastectomy - ER+, her2/neu +, [**7-29**] LN +, treated initially w/ adriamycin, cytoxan, developed bone mets in [**2114**], treated w/ xeloda, then herceptin + gemcitabine, then herceptin + paclitaxel, brain mets dx [**4-26**] -> s/p WBXRT, 2000cGy, completed in [**5-26**], also underwent XRT to thoracic and lumbar mets, XRT to pelvic mets in [**8-26**], pelvic involvement -> hydronehprosis -> [**Date Range **] nephrostomy tubes, had also been receiving herceptin, vinblastine, and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mets recurred in [**10-27**] -> s/p 5 treatments w/ Cyberknife in [**11-26**] for recurrence; also on seizure medication currently, chemotherapy changed to Tykerb and Xeloda [**2120-12-25**] 2.

Linear atelectasis is noted at the mid-to-lower lung zones bilaterally.
Multiple sclerotic lesions involving the ribs and vertebral bodies are consistent with known osseous metastases.
IMPRESSION: Aside from atelectasis, no evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
Multiple scattered nodular and linear ground-glass opacities within a predominantly peripheral distribution, new compared to study performed less than one month prior.
Diagnostic considerations include an atypical infection; however, other etiologies such as drug reaction, eosinophilic pneumonia, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) should also be considered.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism  Brief Hospital Course: 65yo F w/ widely metastatic breast cancer, on dexamethasone taper for brain metastases, and w/ bilat nephrostomy p/w SOB and fever w/ likely PNA +/- UTI.
Given symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, hypoxia, and CTA findings of new nodular and linear ground glass opacities, initially treated for pneumonia.
Given her recent history of long hospitalizations and recent NH stay, will treat for health-care acquired pneumonia with cefepime, levaquin, and vancomycin.

Upon transfer to the ICU, the patient refused positive pressure ventilation, stating that she just wanted to be comfortable.
