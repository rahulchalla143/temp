Admission Date:  [**2159-2-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-3-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-1-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetracycline / Tape / Metal Can/Brush Top Applicat  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 16571**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 64 year-old female with a PMH significant for ASD repair with patch in [**11/2158**] complicated by sternal wound infection, post-op afib, and C. diff colitis; tobacco use, COPD, and HTN presenting with intermittent back pain and worsening SOB from baseline.
The back pain has been present for several weeks-it was initially intermittent and then became constant.
For the last several days she has complained of increasing shortness of breath.
She denies having chest pain, fever/ chills or cough.
She usually takes lasix for lower extremity edema but has not had worsening edema recently; however, stopped taking her Lasix several days ago because of aggravation with the frequent urination.
On her way home from the OSH ER she was contact[**Name (NI) **] by her primary care physician who told her to go to [**Hospital1 18**] ER because her CXR was concerning for a mass in her chest.
Her sternal wound has continued nonunion.
She was seen by the CT [**Doctor First Name **] PA who thought there was no active CSurg issues.
She was seen by the plastics team who also thought there were no active wound issues.
She came in with a HR 170 in atrial fibrillation with ST depressions in the lateral leads.
She refused flagyl given previous history of GI side effects, but is willing to reconsider if her clinical status worsens.
She continues to complain of mild shortness of breath, although is overall improved.
Past Medical History: ASD now s/p Gortex patch closure [**2158**] COPD (not on home O2) Sternal wound infection s/p surgery (completed course Nafcillin [**1-/2159**]) Hyperlipidemia c. diff colitis (current [**2-/2159**]) HTN s/p appendectomy R Femoral artery damage and repair (operative complication) Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled, never been on coumadin (use to be on digoxin, temporarily on amiodarone in [**11/2158**] for post op AF) Histoplasmosis of eyes  Social History: retired 45 pack year smoking history, quit [**2158-10-30**].
no EtOH or other illicits   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: GENERAL: She is a chronically ill-appearing female in no acute distress.
LYMPHATICS: She has no cervical, axillary, or supraclavicular adenopathy.
HEART: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs,  or gallops.
LUNGS: Clear with decreased breath sounds anteriorly.
She has a  midline sternal scar, which is healing by secondary intention.
ABDOMEN: She has no hepatosplenomegaly, no ascites.
EXTREMITIES: No peripheral edema.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: ECG Study Date of [**2159-2-14**] 2:40:38 AM Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats.
Compared to tracing #1 frequency of atrial premature beats has significantly increased.
[**2159-2-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Large region of post-obstructive consolidation in the left lung with left hilar mass.
Mild pulmonary edema and a small right-sided pleural effusion are seen, without overt congestive heart failure.
No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
Newly apparent marked lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum with mass and/or lymphadenopathy in the left hilum, highly concerning for a left hilar neoplasm with metastatic lymph nodes.
The infiltrate in the left lower lobe could represent post- obstructive consolidation, given that the bronchial obstruction of segmental lower lobe branches.
Sternal non-[**Hospital1 **], with unchanged appearance of multiple sternotomy wires, and pectoralis flap.
No adjacent fluid collections.
[**2159-2-14**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Normal head CT without and with contrast without evidence of hemorrhage, or masses.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-25**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced.
No residual atrial septal defect flow identified.
Multiple scattered hypodense lesions in the liver, measuring smaller than 9 mm.
These are also indeterminate, though it could potentially represent cysts or metastases.
Indeterminate 14 mm left adrenal nodule.
Further evaluation with MR recommended.
Differential includes metastasis versus benign adenoma.
Further partial collapse of the left lower lobe with partially enhancing left pleural effusion.
2 cm fluid collection at surgical site in right groin, likely seroma, though infection (abscess) should be considered in proper clinical setting.
Rectal distention with stool.
Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys, likely cysts.
Although some of this may reflect pleural fluid, the shift of the mediastinum to the left indicates that most of the opacification relates to volume loss.
The expanded right hemithorax shows no evidence of acute pneumonia.
16-mm enhancing lesion in segment IV-A of the liver along the anterior liver margin.
Additional small 7-mm segment IV-B lesion along the anterior liver margin of similar enhancement characteristics which could also represent metastases.
Hepatic ultrasound could be performed to assess as to whether the dominant lesion is amenable to ultrasound-guided biopsy, and whether further characterization of any of the smaller lesions is possible.
Nodular left adrenal gland, consistent with hyperplasia, without discrete lesion identified.
Consolidation of visualized left lung with associated effusion.
Significant improvement in aeration of the left upper lung as well as the lingular region, most likely secondary to resolution of an intrabronchial mucous plug.
Persistent mediastinal and hilar masses encasing and narrowing the left main bronchus.
Bilateral small pleural effusion with persistent left lower lobe collapse.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 64 year-old female with a PMHx sx for open ASD repair c/b sternal wound infection and post-operative AF who was initially admitted through the ED with SOB and back pain, with CTA in the ED demonstrating diffuse LAD and post-obstructive PNA concerning for malignancy.
#) Post Obstructive PNA - The patient was treated with a 2 week course of vancomycin and zosyn to cover for hospital acquired organisms, which ended on [**2-26**].
She remained afebrile with no recurrence of symptoms for the remainder of her hospital course.
# Large Cell Lung CA - As below, the pulmonary service performed a bronchoscopy which showed external compression of her left mainstem bronchus.
The patient underwent biopsy/FNA, which showed large cell carcinoma.
Of note, the patient also has a liver lesion suspicious for metastasis.
The patient became neutropenic on [**3-1**] to nadir ANC of approx.
Gran ct > 5000 by time of discharge with no recurrence of neutropenia.
# Atrial fibrillation - etiology was thought to be multifactorial, in setting of a post-obstructive pneumonia and atrial irritation from invasive and expansive pulmonary masses.
While on the floor, she had a bronchoscopy performed which showed external compression of her left mainstem bronchus, and she had a biopsy/FNA performed, which showed large cell carcinoma.
She was then readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with atrial fibrillation with HR 130s, and was started on a diltiazem gtt.
She was briefly called out, but developed HR 160s, w/EKG c/w AF with RVR, for which she received metoprolol 5 mg IV x2, followed by diltiazem 10 mg IV x2 without conversion.
However, she experienced an acute respiratory decompensation which precluded her from taking her po medications, and in that setting experienced RVR to the 140-150s again.
The patient was again transferred to the floor on regimen of diltiazem 120mg q8h and metoprolol 100mg po tid, where she remained somewhat tachycardic.
Anticoagulation was not pursued as the patient has a high risk of bleeding given large tumor burden and a CHADS score of 0. .
# Hypoxia - The patient began to suffer worsening oxygenation with desaturations on [**2-23**].
She also became agitated and delirious.
CXR was consistent with worsening edema in the remaining lung (known L lung collapse).
She required BiPaP for an ABG which showed hypercarbia to 60.
Cardiogenic etiology for edema was felt to be unlikely given NL echo on this admission, and EKGs without ischemic changes.
Central etiology for decreased respiratory drive was also felt to be unlikely.
Low suspicion for PE given that she was on a heparin gtt for afib at that time.
She was also treated for a COPD exacerbation, including nebs and incidental administration of high dose steroids (from chemotherapy for nausea ppx) without much success.
# C diff colitis - The patient was continued on po vanc for an additional 2 weeks after resolution of broad spectrum treatment for post-obstructive PNA.
This course was completed while inhouse with no further diarrhea.
# Dyspepsia: The patient began experiencing symptoms of dyspepsia, likely secondary to XRT.
# Nausea: This was also felt to be secondary to XRT.
Low dose dexamethasone may be started if symptoms persist.
# Dysphagia: Also likely secondary to XRT.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezing.
