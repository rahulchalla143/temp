Admission Date:  [**2185-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-10-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP and papillotomy with removal of 3 gallstones: Details as follows: 1.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.Three round stones ranging in size from 4mm to 6mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
The CBD was mildly dilated to 10 mm.
The intrahepatic cholangiogram was normal with no filling defects.
History of Present Illness: 87 yo M who was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2185-10-17**] with intermittent epigastric pain w/ eating x ~1 week.
He also had several episodes of vomiting after eating which releaved the pain.
CTA at OSH found questionable evidence of aortic dissection in 3 areas and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On further review of CT scan after admission it was determined that the patient had stable endovascular ulcerations and not an aortic dissection.
On further investigation of abdominal pain the patient was found to have elevated LFT's and bilirubin and was found to have suggestion of cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis on MRCP.
Following ERCP he was transferred to the MICU for concern for hypertensive urgency vs emergency.
Mental status change felt to be [**3-4**] combination of pain medications and underlying dementia.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Low back pain .
No hx of tatoos or IVDU.

The liver is unremarkable in echotexture without evidence of focal lesion.
There is no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign, biliary duct dilatation, or pericholecystic fluid to suggest acute cholecystitis.
No ascites is seen.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Gallbladder is distended and filled with innumerable small gallstones.
The extent of gallbladder distention is unchanged compared to the recent CT and ultrasound, however, circumferential gallbladder wall edema appears markedly increased in the interval.
After administration of contrast, there is subtle hyperemia within the hepatic parenchyma surrounding the gallbladder fossa.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is demonstrated.
Common bile duct is smooth in contour and normal in caliber without evidence of caliber change.
Incidentally noted, the right posterior hepatic duct originates from the proximal left hepatic duct.
Within the uncinate process of the pancreas is a branching T2 hyperintense cystic lesion measuring approximately 1 x 1 cm which appears to communicate with the main pancreatic duct and likely represents dilated side branches.
Pancreatic parenchyma enhances normally and is normal in signal intensity.
Multiple well-circumscribed T2 hyperintense lesions within the cortices of both kidneys are consistent with cysts, the majority of which are simple in nature.
A 2.3-cm cyst within the interpolar region of the right kidney contains a single septation but without internal enhancement or nodularity.
There is no hydronephrosis or solid renal masses.
A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is present.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease is seen throughout the abdominal aorta, which otherwise is normal in caliber.
No dissection is identified or aneurysmal dilatation.
There is focal high- grade narrowing involving the celiac artery and SMA origins, which was visualized on the recent CT, and secondary to atherosclerotic disease.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.
No free fluid is seen within the abdomen.
A T1 and T2 hyperintense lesion within the L3 vertebral body is consistent with a vertebral hemangioma.
Gallbladder appearance is concerning for acute cholecystitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
Choledocholithiasis with three nonobstructing stones seen in the distal common bile duct.
Approximately 1-cm branching cystic structure within the uncinate process of the pancreas likely representing dilated side branches, but IPMN remains in the differential.
Celiac and SMA origin stenoses.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the abdominal aorta without aneurysmal dilatation or dissection.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo M who was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2185-10-17**] with epigastric pain and concern for aortic dissection on CT scan at OSH.
On further review of CT scan after admission it was determined that the patient had stable endovascular ulcerations and not an aortic dissection.
He was also found to have choledocholithiasis and was treated with ERCP and sphincterotomy.
He was transferred to the MICU following ERCP for hypertensive urgency which resolved with medications.
1) Choledocolithiasis s/p ERCP: On evaluation of his abdominal pain he was found to have evidence of cholycystitis and choledocholithiasis.
Since stone removal and decompression he has been pain free and afebrile.
Felt unlikely to have been cholecystitis as following ERCP he remained afebrile without leukocytosis or fever.
2)Endovascular ulcerations of abdominal aorta - initially admitted from OSH with concern for aortic dissection however after further review of CT scan it was determined that he had stable endovascular ulcerations not requiring surgery.
3) Hypertensive urgency: Following ERCP there was concern as he became very hypertensive with associated confusion requiring admission to the MICU and IV antihypertensives.
While patient denies history of hypertension, he reportedly had been hypertensive since admission.
Hct remained stable since with no recurrent episodes of bleeding throughout the rest of his admission.
Recommended that he start ASA in one week, holding for time being [**3-4**] ERCP and post op hematemasis  6) Altered mental status: initially with increased confusion and mental status change following ERCP.
Thought to be most likely due to pain medciations given during surgery.
8) Prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy: No acute issues.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Celiac and SMA origin high grade stenoses.
Right Carotid Artery Stenosis.
Prostate CA s/p XRT.
Chronic Low Back Pain.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Call Vascular Surgery or General Surgery with any new abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting.
