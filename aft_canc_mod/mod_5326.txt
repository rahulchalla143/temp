Admission Date:  [**2172-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-1-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-5-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardial window   History of Present Illness: 54 yo man with AML s/p allo-SCT (MRD) now day 370 c/b GVH of liver and skin, disseminated TB, CMV viremia, hematuria and most recently admitted for tamponade secondary to large pericardial effusion accumulation, s/p pericardial drain now with chest tube POD #4.
In brief originally, he has a history of AML diagnosed in [**2169**], S/p induction and consolidation with Ara-C. During induction he developed neutropenic fever and was diagnosed with widely disseminated  tuberculosis with splenic, pancreatic, and pulmonary lesions as well as bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
Cultures from blood, pleural fluid, lymph node biopsy as well as sputums to the time of his discharge all ultimately grew MTB from culture despite have negative AFB smear.
His pyrazinamide was discontinue on month 5, however shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with a tuberculous paraspinal abscess at the level of the right kidney in [**2-16**] that required drainage.
In [**3-19**] his ethambutol was discontinued secondary to optic neuritis.
He has since had drainage of pulmonary tuberculomas and pleural effusion at [**Hospital1 336**].
Approximately 9 months after transplant on [**2171-10-9**] his medications were discontinued for elevated LFTs.
Prior liver biopsy was consistent with GVHD, and his LFTs continued to be elevated since discontinuation of his TB meds.
He was received pentostatin, rituxan and photopheresis for his GVHD which has affected his mouth, eyes, gut, skin, +/- bladder.
The patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 63310**] for symptoms of volume overload.
He was found to have a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
He [**Date range (1) 1834**] pericardial drain for 1300 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
The etiology of his effusion was undetermined, however viral infection vs TB vs GVHD vs medication effect (tacrolimus?)
During this admission he also had a chest CT which revealed bilaterally upper lobe infiltrates with nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance.
Sputums were negative for AFB smear but poor sampling precluded concentrated smear.
Incidentally he was diagnosed with VRE and morganella UTIs and completed a course of daptomycin and cefpodoxime.
He was seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who ordered a repeat level which remained elevated to 152.
Sputum cultures were negative for PCP on DFA (although these were poor samples), however bacterial cultures were positive for Stenotrophomonas.
Per the patient's wife, he was at baseline in regards to shortness of breath and had not been able to lay flat since discharge.
Yesterday he complained of fatigue and back pain, and at 3AM this morning he developed chest pain radiating to his left arm.
CTA was performed which did not reveal PE; however a large pericardial effusion and bilateral effusions as well as mild ascites and cystic mass in pancreatic head.
TTE at the OSH was reportedly negative for tamponade, although the patient did have one episode of hypotension with SBP to the 70s which responded to a 500 cc bolus.
Bedside TTE at our institution revealed tamponade physiology with collapsing RV.
CT scan revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a disseminated infection.
[**2169-8-17**]: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin complicated by persistent fevers and extensive workup ultimately revealing disseminated tuberculosis infection.
His course was also complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension and the development of a severe cardiomyopathy.
S/P one dose of high-dose ARA-C at 1.5 mg per meter squared, lowered dose due to his disseminated tuberculosis, and then he received a second course of HiDAC at 3 gram per meter squared dose and developed acute onset of gait instability.
Noted for pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for aspergillus and empirically treated with Voriconazole with improvement noted on CT. 5.
Allo course c/b increased LFTs of unclear etiology, possibly from chemotherapy, renal failure attributed to CSA, and received only 1 dose of MTX due to mucositis.
Post transplant course complicated by asymptomatic CMV viremia and viral/URI syndromes.
In [**2171-5-12**] developed diarrhea with e/o GVH on endoscopy.
He also had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus.
Therapy attempted for GVH of liver using pulse of prednisone and increase in CellCept with stabilization but no significant improvement.
Non-onc PMH - Disseminated TB - s/p treatment with INH, levofloxacin and rifabutin - Hypertension and a heart murmur - Diabetes mellitus type 2 - Chemo related heart failure and cardiomyopathy, EF 35-40% [**12-16**] - h/o atrial fibrillation, recent EKGs in NSR - CMV viremia ([**2-17**])  Social History: He is married and lives at home with his wife & children.
He is a machine operator, but is currently not working.

Neck: No LAD Cardiovascular:	RRR NL S1, S2, no M/R/G.
Respiratory: Atelectasis at bases bilaterally, coarse sounds lower right, otherwise CTA bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal: + BS, soft, no masses Musculoskeletal: Trace edema Skin: Dry, flaky.
L SC Triple lumen line without significant erythema, bilateral EJ lines and left peripheral UE IV.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-1-17**] 1:18 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o acute process  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 54 year old man with increased serosanguenous drainage from prior CT site with pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o acute process REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Increased drainage from chest tube.
There is no significant change in large left subcutaneous emphysema.
There is overall improvement in bibasilar opacities, especially in the right lower lobe.
There is no change in the cardiomediastinal contour and the position of the left central venous line with its tip terminating in mid-SVC.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a circumeferential large pericardial effusion with more around the right atrium and right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Pericardial Effusion:  The patient had a pericardial window placed as described in the HPI.
The etiology of his effusion was thought to be secondary to GVHD as workup for other infectious etiologies was negative.
The patient had episodes of serosanguinous discharge from the site of his chest tube after the chest tube was removed but this was determined to be normal per CT surgery and resolved prior to discharge.
GPC in his pericardial fluid, but this was discontinued once it grew staph epi.
The patient complained of dysuria and was found to have VRE that was treated with a 3 day course of daptomycin per ID recommendation.
3) AML s/p all-SCT with GVHD: The patient refused to have photopheresis.
4) Pain: The patient was pain-free on Morphine SR with IR for breakthrough.
5) LFT elevations: The patient had elevated LFTs upon admission that were thought to be secondary to shocked liver in the context of his pericardial tamponade.
These improved throughout his stay but never achieved baseline; they are likely a result of his chronic GVHD but should be followed as an outpatient.
