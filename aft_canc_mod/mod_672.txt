The patient reports having three episodes of melena since this morning with nausea, vomiting but no hematemesis.
He also endorsed epigoastric pain and exertional dyspnea and lightheadedness, but denied chest pain or syncope.

EKG reportedly showed NSR at 86 bpm and no acute ST changes.
He has no cough.
No shortness of breath.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] abnormality was detected in the left upper lobe and a CT of the chest was done on [**2116-1-3**].
He had a CT of the chest, which revealed a 2.2 cm left upper lobe nodule as well as mediastinal lymph node metastasis, skeletal metastasis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Transbronchial biopsy of the left upper lobe mass revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung, lymph node station 4R, 4L, 7, and 11 were biopsied and revealed adenocarcinoma.
He had pink-tinged sputum for several days after the biopsy and this progressed to hemoptysis.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2116-2-19**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):  Imaging: EGD [**2-9**]: Impression:	 - Blood in the stomach - Ulcer in the fundus (injection, thermal therapy) - Diverticulum in the fourth part of the duodenum - Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations:	 - Cannot exclude possibility of another lesion underneath clot.
Mixed interval changes, including: 1) enlarging left pleural effusion, worsening pattern of lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the left lung, and slight worsening of diffuse metastatic skeletal lesions; 2) relatively stable left upper lobe nodule, left hilar and supraclavicular nodes; and 3) stable to decreased mediastinal lymph nodes.
New small right pleural effusion and slight increase in pericardial effusion.
CXR ([**2-18**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-11**], there has been removal of pleural fluid from the left hemithorax.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 YOM with h/o NSCLC, CAD on aspirin presenting with melena, nausea, vomiting with signs suggestive of UGIB.
# UGIB: EGD performed by GI on admission showing large clot in the fundus.
A repeat EGD showed an underlying ulcer or gastric tear.
On the floor his Hct remained stable despite several episodes of melena and guaiac positive stool.
These were thought to represent old blood from the known ulcer.
# CAD: Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac catheterization on [**2115-5-28**] with DES to the mLAD and dRCA.
Catheterization was done due to symptoms of dyspnea on exertion.
# Pneumonia: The patient spiked a fever and was found to have a lower lobe infiltrate.
He was again febrile [**2-18**] to 101.5, concern for recurrent pneumonia, restarted vanco/cefepime.
Gram stain no organisms.
# Non-small cell lung cancer (metastatic):  Extensive FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, osseous metastatic involvement including a lytic inferior sternal lesion at risk of pathologic fracture and also several lytic and sclerotic lesions of the vertebrae, most prominent at T6.
The patient complained of persistent [**2114-2-8**] chest pain with a pleuritic component.
Pleural fluid positive for adenocarcinoma.
Mutation analysis from lung biopsy previously performed revealed EGFR mutation.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy: Patient complaining of some urinary symptoms (mostly retention).
Terazosin was held due to low BP (SBP 110s), may be restarted as an outpatient.
# Bleeding in eye:  Patient presented [**2-18**] with burst capillary in right eye.
No foreign body sensation, no active bleeding.
Diet controlled, no finger sticks.
# Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] HA (HCP, wife, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18341**]) # CODE:  DNR/DNI  TRANSITIONAL - Moderate pericardial effusion seen on prior PET CT.

You came to the hospital with several episodes of dark black stool, nausea, and vomiting.
You were found to have gastrointestinal bleeding due to a large ulcer in your stomach.
This was treated with cauterization, after which your bleeding stopped.
Given your recent cardiac stent placement, we worked with the Cardiology team to determine how to balance anti-coagulation with bleeding risk.
