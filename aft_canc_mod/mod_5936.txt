Today pt notes being very cold and having shaking chills.
CXR showed probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
While pt was febrile, she had a narrow complex tachycardia (likely AFib with RVR, rates 150s).
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for AFib with RVR in the setting of infection with borderline blood pressures.

Left shoulder fracture (traumatic) 7.
Osteoporosis 8. right vocal fold hypomobility, resolving left vocal fold hemorrhage, and laryngeal hyperfunction  CLL history: CLL diagnosed in [**2157**], followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] in the past, self treated with cadmium and semicarbazide (a Russian patented formulation studies in the 60s for multiple cancers) for many years at least intermittently since [**2169**] or [**2170**], last seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] in 1/[**2176**].
Not all of the information is available from Dr[**Name (NI) 13339**] original assessment, which apparently stretches back to early [**2157**], but as early as [**2162**] she had WBC 27 with marked lymphocytic predominance.
WBC peaked at 40, and it was sometime around [**2167**] that she began her Russian self treatment program, which remarkably has decreased her WBC to normal with no toxic side effects per the documentation from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].

The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged with mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
No overt pulmonary edema is present.
There is minimal streaky atelectasis at the lung bases.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
Mild loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body appears unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo F history of CLL, DM1, recent pneumonia 2 months ago (treated with ceftriaxone/azithro then switched to levo), who presents with chills, fever, leukocytosis.
# FEVER: There was initial concern for PNA and she was started on broad spectrum antiobiotics.
CXR was not felt to be consistent with PNA and therefore antibiotics were discontinued once cultures were negative x 48 hrs.
Other sources of infection were considered including urinary source (U/A normal), GI source (patient denied diarrhea).
Her CLL was also considered as a possible source of fever however her smear was not consistent with active disease.
Pt also complained of chest pressure during this event.
Could have been experiencing some demand ischemia through troponin was negative x 1.
# Hypotension - likely secondary to hypovolemia.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Patient's baseline platelet count is 100-150.
Smear on prior admission showed platelet clumping.
-acute thrombocytopenia likely effect of underlying inflammatory state or viral syndrome, had returned to baseline at discharge.
# DM type I: Has insulin pump.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Fever Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter with RVR (resolved) Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma Asthma, stable  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a fever, hypotension and tachycardia and admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
You initially received antibiotics but these were stopped as there was no bacterial source found and this was felt to be more consistent with a viral syndrome.
