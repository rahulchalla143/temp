Admission Date:  [**2138-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-8-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-6-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right craniotomy   History of Present Illness: 61 yo male with RCC s/p chemo and CK therapy on [**2138-7-17**] presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with LUE/LLE weakness 1 week after CK therapy.
He did have a headache in the back of his head, which he noticed more in the evening, it was not present in the AM and didn't wake him up out of sleep.
He denied any numbness on the left side, no dysphagia/dysarthria, no difficulty with hearing.
He feels his coordination is fine except for the weakness and that he can sit up and stand, but his gait is off because of the left-sided weakness.
He feels that his left leg has improved after the steroids; his headache has definitely disappeared after the steroids.
He has been taking his seizure meds and denies any seizure activity, no AM tongue biting, no AM urinary incontinence, no focal motor/sensory sx's, no AOC.
Past Medical History: ONC history: renal cell cancer in [**2131-10-26**].
He also had bilateral lung nodules, status post bilateral VATS in [**2131-12-27**].
He had continued disease progression and was treated on high-dose interferon and IL-2 in [**2133**].
On [**6-29**], presented with a five- to six-week history of a left hemiparesis with some decompensation.
brain imaging including MRI showed acute hemorrhagic lesion with contrast enhancement in the right frontal motor strip, common, small, more anterior one.
These were both consistent with metastasis.

Pertinent Results: CT HEAD NONCONTRAST FINDINGS:  There is slight interval increase in the size of the right parietal lobe hyperdense mass compared with the prior CT examination, currently measuring 1.8 cm.
However, compared to its size on MRI, it is grossly unchanged; however, accurate comparison is difficult due to differences in modalities.
There is associated slight interval increase in the marked surrounding vasogenic edema, causing progressive midline shift to the left measuring approximately 1.1 cm.
Apart from the hyperdensity within the mass, there is no evidence of intra-axial hemorrhage.
There is no uncal or cerebellar tonsillar herniation and the basal cisterns are preserved.
Hyperdense right parietal lobe metastasis, which appears slightly larger when compared to the previous CT examination dated [**7-2**].
Slight interval increase in marked right frontal, parietal and temporal lobe vasogenic edema causing increased midline shift to the left.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
These do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement and are unchanged.
A right hilar lesion is again noted and is increased in size, currently measuring 1.9 x 1.4 cm, (previously 1.3 x 1.7 cm).
A more inferior right hilar node is also increased in size and currently measures 4.7 x 2.5 cm (previously 2.7 x 1.5 cm).
There are small pulmonary nodules bilaterally.
A nodule in the right apex (series 3, image 7) is stable in size, however, nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 1.0 x 0.8 cm is new as is a tiny nodule in the right lower lobe immediately adjacent to the pleura.
The previously noted enhancing lesions in the right hepatic lobe demonstrate mixed response.
A lesion in segment VI of the liver currently measures 0.8 x 0.6 cm (previously 2.0 x 1.7 cm) and is thus decreased in size, however, another lesion has increased in size, currently measuring 1.7 x 2.3 cm (previously 1.5 x 1.1 cm).
A right omental lesion is also increased in size, currently measuring 11.3 x 7.1 cm (previously 10.8 x 6.4 cm).
2.2 x 2.2 cm lesion is seen in the lower pole of the left kidney.
A conglomerate of upper lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum currently measures 3.2 x 1.9 cm (previously 2.0 x 1.3 cm).
There is right external iliac adenopathy, currently measuring 2.3 x 2.3 cm (on the prior study, a lymph node in this location was borderline in size measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm).
A second lymph node anterior to the just described one measures 1.5 x 1.2 cm and is also increased in size.
Previously, this node did not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
On bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions.
Mixed response with predominant disease progression with increase in size of the right hilar adenopathy, right omental mass and one liver lesion.
New lesions are seen in the liver, lungs, as well as retroperitoneum with predominantly the right external iliac lymphadenopathy.
MRI HEAD: Again seen is a homogeneously enhancing mass involving the left parietal lobe which measures approximately 2.3 cm in size.
This appears to have minimally increased compared to the [**Month (only) 216**] study.
This tumor also has a tail of enhancing tissue which appears to extend into the adjacent sulcus.
A second tiny 0.3 cm enhancing lesion is seen in the right centrum semiovale, as before.
There is extensive surrounding T2 hyperintensity of the right frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes as well as the right subinsular region as before.
There is right to left subfalcine herniation, especially posteriorly as well as right to left shift of the normally midline structures which measures approximately 0.5 cm.
The peritumoral edema is causing compression of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle as before.
There is a mucous retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
Since [**2138-7-11**], increase in size of the enhancing metastasis involving the right parietal lobe with minimal leptomeningeal extension as before.
No significant change in 0.3 cm second enhancing metastasis of the right centrum semiovale.
Overall, extensive peritumoral edema does not appear to be significantly changed, but there is worsened right to left shift of the normally midline structures and subfalcine herniation since the [**2138-7-11**] study.
MRI NECK: FINDINGS:  No prior studies are available for comparison.
In the right level II b region, medial to the sternocleidomastoid and posterior to the right internal jugular vein, there is an 11 x 7.6 mm enhancing, oval lymph node.
There is no evidence of cavitation or pericapsular infiltration.
A few other small lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the neck.
No definite masses are identified.
There is a mucus retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
Allowing for positional differences, the overall apperance is little changed compared to prior study.
Again seen is an approximately 2 cm lesion consistent with metastasis in the right parietal lobe, with extensive edema involving the right frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.
Shift of normally midline structures towards the left is again identified, little changed compared to prior CT.  Again seen is effacement of the sulci in the right frontal lobe.
Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle again seen, possibly slightly increased.
No new foci of hemorrhage or mass effect identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
2 cm hyperdense mass again seen in the right parietal lobe with extensive surrounding edema involving the right hemisphere.
Possible slight increase in mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
Diffusion-weighted imaging was also performed.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: Postoperative changes are again seen in the right parietal region.
The well-defined rounded enhancing lesion of the right parietal lobe has been resected.
T1 hyperintensity is seen at the periphery of the resection bed, representing a small amount of postoperative blood.
Minimal peripheral enhancement is noted at the medial aspect of the resection bed, likely postoperative.
A 3 mm focus of enhancement in the right frontal centrum semiovale is unchanged from prior studies, possibly representing a tiny metastasis (9:17).
A second 1-2 mm focus of enhancement is seen in the superior right parietal region (9:20, 10:22), which is better defined today than on prior studies.
Minimal enhancement at the periphery of the resection bed is thought to be postoperative, but continued followup is recommended.
Unchanged 3 mm focus of enhancement in the right frontal region, possibly representing a tiny metastasis.
2 mm enhancing focus of the superior right parietal region, possibly representing a vessel on end or tiny metastasis.
[**-4/2883**]  SMALL BOWEL ENTEROSCOPY (2).
Note:  The specimen contains a single nodule of neoplasm composed of a uniform population of atypical cells with cleared cytoplasm within the brain parenchyma.
These features are most consistent with renal cell carcinoma, however immunohistochemistry staining with antibody to cytokeratin  is being performed and will be reported in an addendum.
in a container labeled with the patient's name, "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]", the medical record number and additionally labeled "right parietal tumor" and consists of a 2 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm firm red-tan mass that is sectioned revealing a white homogeneous firm nodule encompassing nearly the entire specimen.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/[**Location (un) 4223**]: "Mild necrosis with highly atypical epithelioid cells.
Suspicious for metastatic neoplasm."
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 61 yo M with metastatic RCC s.p CK therapy on [**2138-7-17**] now with LUE/LLE weakness improving on high dose dexamethasone.
The patient was found to have worsening edema and increasing symptoms, therefore he was started on mannitol IV.
As we tapered the mannitol, he would eventually redevelop symptoms such as headache, hemiparesis, and hiccups, so we had to increase the mannitol again.
#) Steroid induced hyperglycemia: The patient had elevated glucose levels due to his dexamethasone.
#) Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer: The patient has had right nephrectomy in the past.
