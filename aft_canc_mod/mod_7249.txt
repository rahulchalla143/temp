Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a 83 yo F w/PMHx sx for cholangiocarcinoma with malignant stricture admitted after biliary stent exchange with postoperative hypoxia.
She initially complained of severe chest pain.
A chest x-ray was performed and did not show evidence of infection or fluid overload.
Initially she was placed on telemetry, given aspirin 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, and started on metoprolol due to concern for an ischemic event in the setting of ERCP.
Over the course of the next day, she was noted to have a leukocytosis, and a fever, as well as hypoxia, concerning for an aspiration event.
She had chronic diastolic heart failure during her stay.
She was initially given a dose of 20 mg IV lasix for possible fluid overload related to her ERCP, but was noted to be fairly euvolumic with no evidnece of fluid overload on exam, and was transitioned to lasix 40 mg twice daily per her home dose.
For her cholangiocarcinoma with malignant stricture, she is s/p stent exchange.

She denies fevers, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.
She has not had a recurrence of the chest pain she experienced on the night of admission.
Patient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of PE on CT scan, no evidence of pna.
Presumed shortness of breath was thought to be secondary to bacteremia - grew out gram negative rods in blood which grew while on levofloxacin with increasing WBC, most likely biliary stent is the etiology.
TTE without evidence of vegetations, c. diff pending.
Would monitor for any evidence of allergic reaction.
