Admission Date:  [**2179-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-11-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Diphenhydramine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: transfer for monitoring, intubated  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and extubation failed transjugular intrahepatic protal shunt X 2 paracentesis   History of Present Illness: 66 year-old M with mantle cell lymphoma with pancytopenia, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and DM who presents s/p failed TIPS procedure for monitoring.
He was scheduled for an elective TIPS today for diuretic-resistant ascites and hyponatremia.
TIPS failed due to inability to cannulate the portal vein (last Doppler US in [**9-11**] showed patent vasculature).
Due to hypotension to SBP 70s, he was transfused 2 units of blood and given 10 mcg neosynephrine.
His sheath was removed in the PACU, but the patient was left intubated due to concern for hematoma formation with extubation.
Cryptogenic cirrhosis: complicated by portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and diuretic-resistant ascites.
No documented nephropathy, neuropathy or retinopathy.
No known CAD, no h/o CVA, no PVD.
Unspecified colitis: x years with intermittent diarrhea  Social History: The patient is married and lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 3597**], [**Name (NI) **].
Neck: supple, RIJ site with dry dressing, no hematoma appreciated.
Pulm: clear anteriorly, faint crackles to b/t bases Cardiac: RRR, nl S1/S2, 2/6 systolic murmur Chest: L port-o-cath site without erythema or fluctuance.
paracentesis site to RLQ with dry dressing Ext: 2+ LE edema b/t, warm Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
US with Dopplers [**4-22**]: Interval development of a hematoma within the left lobe of the liver.
No evidence for portal venous thrombosis.
LUE US [**4-24**]: No DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old M with mantle cell lymphoma with pancytopenia, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and DM who presents s/p failed TIPS procedure admitted for monitoring.
Hospital course by problem below:  # Cryptogenic Cirrhosis with failed TIPS: Doppler US showed patent vasculature.
# Post TIPS Hct Monitoring: Patient was monitored closely for blood loss following two failed percutaneous TIPS with multiple passes through liver.
He then developed a large echymosis covering most of his right flank as well as a 3 point Hct drop.
He was not transfused and remained hempdynamically stable.
Post procedure, he had mild hypotension attributed to general anesthesia.
His diuretics and nadolol were initially held given low BP, but then restarted on [**4-24**].
# Bradycardia: Patient had bradycardia in the post procedure period which was felt to be vagal etiology post-procedure or [**1-8**] to neosynephrine.
He was monitored on telemetry with no further events on the floor.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient has history of known splenomegaly and his thrombycytopenia was felt likely from myelosupression as well as splenic sequestration.
He received 2 bags of platelets in OR for procedure and then on day of dicharge received another two bags in anticipation of paracentesis.
# DM2: He was hypoglycemic post-procedure, thought to be due to effects of glyburide in setting of renal dysfunction.
Once he became normoglycemic, he was restarted on insulin sliding scale and a diabetic diet.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ascites cryptogenic cirrhosis  Secondary: mantle cell lymphoma anemia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You have ascities from your cryptogenic cirrhosis and had two failed TIPS procedures.
You had a paracentesis to remove some of your ascites.
Please call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have lightheadedness, dizzyness, fever, chills, shakes, abdominal pain, bloody stools, black stools, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
