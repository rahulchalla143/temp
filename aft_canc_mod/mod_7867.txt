Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2102**] TAH/BSO showed stage IIB ovarian Ca adjuvant treatment with six cycles of carboplatin and Taxol - [**2113-12-7**] had mammogram that showed a poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 mm in largest diameter, without LVI.
FNA of a palpable right axillary lymph node was consistent with malignancy.
Pathology from the right breast demonstrated LCIS, chemotherapy changes, and no evidence of residual IDC.
Zero of 24 right axillary lymph nodes were positive for disease.
There was no evidence of cancer in the left breast.
- [**2115-4-4**], she developed new lower back pain while undergoing planning for bilateral breast reconstruction surgery.
Her pain progressed, and on [**2115-6-4**], she presented to the emergency room at [**Hospital3 **].
At that time, she endorsed easy bruising, but denied fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or recurrent infections.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she  underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**2115-6-7**], with findings consistent with AML with monocytic differentiation.
Her treatment course was complicated by prolonged neutropenic fevers, multifocal pneumonia requiring lung biopsy that demonstrated evidence of BOOP.
Bone marrow biopsy performed on day +14 and day +24 showed residual blasts in the marrow, and she was treated with one cycle of HiDAC.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2115-7-16**], showed no evidence of blasts.
She did well following the transplant, with no evidence of recurrent disease  or graft-versus-host disease.
In [**2116-7-3**], she once again began  to develop low back pain with occasional radiation down her legs.
An L-spine MRI on [**2116-7-31**], demonstrated a new enhancing L2  spinous process mass with associated soft tissue component and no spinal canal involvement.
There was also new heterogeneous marrow signal noted in the iliac bone and sacrum.
Pelvis MRI on  [**2116-8-6**], once again demonstrated diffuse marrow signal abnormality with near complete homogenous replacement of the right posterior ilium to SI joint, and marrow replacement of the left femur to the mid diaphysis.
There were also bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures noted.
On [**2116-8-17**], she underwent bone marrow biopsy, which demonstrated a mildly hypocellular marrow with no evidence of AML.
Flow cytometry was  negative for evidence of blasts.
Pathology demonstrated skeletal muscle and soft tissue with an atypical mononuclear infiltrate consistent with myeloid  sarcoma.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2116-10-27**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
[**2116-9-29**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND EVIDENCE OF RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
Note: There is extensive zonal confluent necrosis alternating with sheets of blasts with abundant pink cytoplasm.
[**2116-11-11**]: Bone Marrow Biopsy: Mildly hypocellular for age erythroid dominant bone marrow.
No definitive morphological evidence of acute leukemia, see note.
Note:  While rare blasts and left shifted myeloids are seen along with atypical monocytes in peripheral blood.
Please correlate with clinical findings and progression, flow cytometry ([**-1/4753**]) and karyotype studies, to exclude minimal residual disease.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Right apical opacity is unchanged since the prior examination dating back to [**2116-7-3**] and reflects a focal area of consolidation seen back on [**2115-10-20**] radiograph and most likely represents a residua of the cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
[**2116-10-16**] Limited son[**Name (NI) **] of left arm demonstrated likely non-occlusive thrombus in the mid brachial vein.
[**2116-10-17**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: Hypocellular bone marrow consistent with chemotherapeutic ablation.
No diagnostic morphologic features of acute leukemia seen.
[**2116-10-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pneumonia.
Within limits of a noncontrast examination, no etiology for patient's fever within the limitation of this unenhanced CT. No drainable fluid collection.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
[**2116-10-26**]  ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation without evidence of discrete vegetation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-10-2**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and estimated PA systolic pressure are increased.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE would be better able to define the mitral valve morphology for possible vegetation.
[**2116-10-26**] LUE U/S: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
Mildly coarse liver.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with h/o breast CA and subsequent development of AML s/p allo HSCT (on [**2115-10-4**]) found to have a relapse of her AML with positive BM biopsy and chloroma of the L2 spine, admitted for C1 of MEC (started [**2116-10-3**]).
# Relapsed AML: [**2116-9-29**] BM biopsy showed HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND EVIDENCE OF RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
However, given her positive BM, it was decided she should have MEC.
Patient became neutropenic on D7.
Acyclovir and atovaquone were continued for prohylaxis (home regimen).
She was previously on posaconazole for fungal ppx, however this was changed to voriconazole for a few weeks for neutropenic fevers, but changed back to posaconazole before discharge.
She had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2116-11-11**] (day 40) which showed no evidence of her leukemia (3% blasts).
# Fever: Patient became febrile several days into MEC therapy, prior to neutropenia.
She was started on cefepime on [**10-5**], and remained afebrile for >1week.
CXR on [**10-3**] clear except for focal area of consolidation in right apice, thought to be residua of cryptogenic PNA from previous admission.
Pt without cough, sputum production, SOB.
PICC line was pulled for slight erythema, nonocclusive thrombus found at that time, so PICC could not be replaced.
Patient again began having fevers on [**10-17**] without localizing symptoms, with 1 out of 2 blood cultures growing enterococcus galinerum, sensitive to daptomycin.
Cefepime was discontinued on [**2116-10-20**] for diffuse rash.
ID consulted given patient's many allergies (i.e.
Patient developed fever to 103.5F, [**10-22**] Blood culture grew E Coli while on atreonam and ciproflozacin.
She became hypotensive, minimally responsive to fluids and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She soon developed a rash which was consistent with a drug rash and attributed to the zosyn (given her many penicillin-family allergies).
Sensitivity testing found the E Coli to be sensative to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on this in addition to the gentamicin.
Multiple surveillance cultures were drawn and had no growth.
She remained afebrile for the last 14+ days of her hospital stay and did not have any more positive cultures.
Her intravenous abx were stopped a few days prior to discharge, and she remained stable with no evidence of infection.
# Sepsis: Patient transferred to ICU with concern for septic shock, with hypotension initally not responsive to IVF's.
# L PICC line assoc blood clot: Patient found on US to have a nonocclusive thrombus from her left PICC.
# Transaminitis: LFTs rose abruptly on [**11-9**] from normal baseline.
RUQ US showed a "coarse liver", non-specific but could signify liver disease/inflammation.
It would be reasonable to obtain a future repeat RUQ US to assess for resolution of liver inflammation and rule out occult, ongoing process.
# Rashes: Developed Started out as erythamtous, blanching 0.5-1cm papules over flank, back, inner thighs.
No complaints, no trouble breathing.
Pt with h/o meropenem allergy.
While this rash was clearing, she was started on zosyn (pipericillin-tazobactam) and developed a new, separate rash across her arms and some puffiness in her face.
Initially dermatology and ID felt it was possible to treat through this reaction (given the need for zosyn for her E. coli bacteremia), however when she developed swelling of her lips and itching of her throat, the medication was stopped.
At this point, her rash and swelling began to subside and resolved within a week.
# Tooth pain: On admission, patient had been complaining of bilateral lower 1st molar tooth pain for the past week, worse on the left than the right.
There was minimal concern for infection on exam, and pain resolved within two days of admission.
# Back Pain: Patient presented with lower back and right hip pain, tender to palpation and limiting the range of motion of her back and right hip.
Likely related to her chloroma at the L2 level.
Patient required a lidocaine patch for pain on the first day of her admission, however pain resolved by day 2.
# Transient visual changes: Patient c/o visual changes, most notably increased floaters in right eye and 'light dimming'.
# Asthma - Stable, managed with home medications: prn albuterol, astepro.
