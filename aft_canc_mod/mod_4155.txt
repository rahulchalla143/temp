During workup last admission, CXR was abnormal with bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates.
BAL was non contributory, negative for PCP.
He had [**Name Initial (PRE) 1570**]'s checked on [**2168-4-26**], which showed FEV1 of 0.95 L. Last bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow with a cellularity of less than 10%.
No evidence of leukemia was seen and he was full donor chimerism.
He was found to have pancytopenia with a Hct of 15.
His initial bone marrow aspiration and biopsy on day +24 showed resolution of most of his prior abnormal cytogenetics, but persistence of aneuploidy 4.
A recent bone marrow biopsy revealed mildly hypocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of ALL, but cytogenetic testing revealed aneuploidy of chromosome 4 in 12% of cells.
LP cytology results demonstrated no malignant cells in sampled CSF.
The patient's course of chemotherapy was complicated by hypomania secondary to high dose prednisone, hypofibrinogenemia secondary to therapy with L-Asparaginase, neutropenic fever, and multiple LFT abnormalities.
Given that he was scheduled to undergo an allogeneic transplant with Cytoxan and TBI conditioning, he did undergo a liver biopsy to assess the degree of fibrosis as well as inflammation prior to proceeding with transplant.
The liver biopsy showed moderate microvascular steatosis with mild bile duct injury and occasional apoptotic hepatocytes, consistent with drug injury.
Bone marrow bx from [**10-1**] showed markedly hypocellular marrow with early recovering trilineage hemopoesis, no residual ALL identified.
Asthma as a child that resolved by fourth grade.

A/P: 19 y/o M day 176 s/p ablative MUD allogenic transplant with a recent admission for SOB, now presenting with persistent symptoms for workup.
No evidence of bleeding.
Transaminitis: Likely due to liver GVHD.
Eosinophilia: Likely due to GVHD.
Moving bowels without constipation or diarrhea.
He was admitted recently for new onset DOE, workup up with bronchospopy which was negative for infectious cause, and discharged, on azithromycin for atypical PNA and atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, with room air saturation in the mid 90's with ambulation.
Procedure went well, but post op course was complicated by chest tube related pneumothorax.
He reports feeling well currently with no SOB, but with some left sided pain with inspiration, coughing.
Pain has been well controlled with morphine PCA.
He denies headache, dysuria, constipation or diarrhea.
He was found to have pancytopenia with a Hct of 15.
His initial bone marrow aspiration and biopsy on day +24 showed resolution of most of his prior abnormal cytogenetics, but persistence of aneuploidy 4.

Childhood Asthma .
PHYSCIAL EXAM: 97.3  94  128/82  22  100%on 4L NC GEN: well appearing, not tachypneic, left sided chest tube in place HEENT: PEERL, EOMI, sclera anicteric NECK: no LAD CHEST: crackles on left side ant and posteriorly HEART: noraml s1/s2.
no m/g/r ABD: NABS, soft, NT, ND, no masses EXT: no edema or cyanosis NEURO: intact .
Small left apical pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Interval progression of perihilar and bibasilar patchy consolidation with relative sparing of the lung apices and periphery.
Given the time interval since transplant, differential diagnosis concerning for progressive opportunistic infection and less likely pulmonary edema.
Stable appearance of large right and smaller left pleural effusion.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
A small left pneumothorax with apical and lateral components is again demonstrated, with slight decrease in the lateral component.
Bilateral alveolar opacities are without change allowing for differences in lung volumes.

Physical Exam: 99.6/99.6,  105-134,  92-111/60-67,  90-100% 10LNRB Gen: increased work of breathing, mild respiratory distress, speaks    in single words, using abdominal muscles for respiration HEENT: NCAT, PERRL Cor: tachycardic, s1s2, no r/g/m Pulm: decreased BS bilaterally, L sided chest tube in place with serosanguinous fluid draining Abd: using abdominal muscles as above, soft, NTND, +bs Ext: no c/c/e, WWP, 2+ pt pulses bilaterally   Pertinent Results: .
CXR [**5-16**]: Moderate left pneumothorax with interval increase in size since recent radiograph of one day earlier.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection.
Bilateral patchy opacifications appearing slightly more diffuse in location and less consolidative.
Lung tissue with patchy chronic interstitial pneumonitis with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages.
No viral inclusions, granuloma or malignancy identified.
Lung tissue with patchy organizing and focally acute pneumonitis, with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages.
No viral inclusion, granuloma or malignancy identified.
[**4-22**]: BAL negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], influenza or other viral antigens .
Last bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow with a cellularity of less than 10%.
No evidence of leukemia was seen and he was full donor chimerism.
The lung biopsy was not pathognomonic but was consistent with GVHD of the lung, which was the presumed diagnosis.
VATS was complicated by a left apical pneumothorax for which chest tube was placed and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His breathing stabilized with chest tube and pneumothorax resolved.
The decision was made ot begin photopheresis for his GVHD and right internal jugular tunneled catheter was placed for this procedure.
This was complicated by a venous air embolus which caused transient hypotension and hypoxia as well as tachycardia.
The patient was again transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where he remained relatively stable although he did have an episode of what appeared to be atrial flutter, which was broken with Valsalva.
He was started on treatment for broad infectious coverage (vanco, cefepime, levofloxacin, pentamidine later changed to atovaquone, voriconazole), including Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment, but had no improvement and in fact CXR showed progression of infiltrates, particularly on the right side.
He was found on the floor to have a spontaneous second pneumothorax on the left side for which chest tube was placed again and the patient was transferred back to the MICU.
The running diagnosis at this time was more likely GVHD of the lung rather than infection and the patient had been started on cellcept in addition to his steroids and cyclosporine.
He was not able to start photopheresis as he remained too ill to go to the pheresis lab.
He went into rapid afib poorly responsive to beta blockers that lasted through the night.
He also acutely spontaneously desaturated and was found to have a left tension pneumothorax despite L sided chest tube that was still in place and had been demonstrating air leak.
