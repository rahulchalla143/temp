FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2200-11-13**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2200-11-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
Cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,  Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Possibilities include (but are not limited to) lung, breast and gynecologic primary malignancies.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..    Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2200-11-11**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS URINE CULTURE (Final [**2200-11-12**]):    NO GROWTH.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2200-11-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
Portable CXR [**2200-11-10**]: IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion with associated lower lung atelectasis.
Please note underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Portable CXR [**2200-11-10**]: Previous left pleural effusion has nearly resolved following thoracentesis.
No obvious pneumothorax.
Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung could be residual atelectasis or reexpansion edema and should be followed.
Mild interstitial abnormality and possible bronchiectasis noted in the right lung, but nothing acute.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged based on the size criteria.
There is left lower lobe extensive consolidation associated with pleural effusion.
In addition there are multiple pulmonary nodules with ill-defined margins noted throughout the lungs bilaterally.
Multiple pulmonary nodules are bilateral, ranging up to 15 mm in the left upper lobe, 10.5 mm in the right upper lobe.
No definite dominant lesion is noted in the lungs, but it potentially could be obscured by extensive consolidation in the lingula and left lower lobe.
Small amount of pleural effusion on the current study appears to be decreased as compared to [**2200-11-10**] and most likely unchanged since chest radiograph obtained after thoracocentesis.
Airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
No bone abnormalities to suggest lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for neoplasm or infectious process demonstrated.
Substantial consolidation in the left lower lobe and lingula with some degree of volume loss associated currently with minimal amount of pleural effusion.
Infectious etiology would be the first choice, although underlying neoplasm or vasculitis cannot be excluded.
All those etiologies may potentially explain the presence of multiple ill-defined pulmonary nodules seen in both lungs as well as consolidation, correlation with clinical symptoms and tissue diagnosis is required.
The extensive consolidations might potentially obscure pulmonary lesions being dominant in the case of malignancy.
Portable CXR [**2200-11-13**]: FINDINGS: Since the most recent examination, there has been interval increase in now a small-to-moderate left layering pleural effusion.
There is mild improvement in ill-defined nodular opacification scattered throughout all lung fields as better characterized on recent CT.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no right-sided effusion.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, demonstrating borderline enlarged heart size.
Mild interval increase in now small-to-moderate left layering pleural effusion since most recent examination.
Mild improvement in multifocal ill-defined nodular opacification, as better characterized on CT from [**2200-11-11**].
MRI head w and w/o contrast [**2200-11-14**]: FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate a small area of high signal in the right occipital lobe near the midline without corresponding enhancement.
Additionally, there is a focus of hyperintensity in the left centrum semiovale, which demonstrates an area of enhancement.
There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
There is moderate-to-severe brain atrophy seen with prominence of temporal horns indicating temporal lobe atrophy.
Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease are seen.
IMPRESSION: A focus of hyperintensity on diffusion images in the right occipital lobe without corresponding enhancement is too small to characterize on ADC map, but could represent a small acute infarct.
An abnormality in the left centrum semiovale demonstrates T2 abnormality with subtle enhancement.
Given the faint enhancement and T2 abnormality, the differential diagnosis includes a small deep white matter subacute infarct versus a metastatic lesion.
No other areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
No territorial infarcts are identified.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with dementia, HL, and osteoporosis who presented with SOB and was found to have large left sided pleural effusion on CXR.
#Pleural Effusion, malignant: Patient presented to the ED with shortness of breath, tachypnea and hypoxia.
Chest x-ray was significant for a large left pleural effusion.
Light criteria negative for exudate.
Differential is broad but based on history, physical, and labs question parapneumonic effusion vs malignancy.
Repeat chest x-ray was consistent with intersitial edema and questionable consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Repeat CXRs showed slow re-accumulation of left pleural effusion.
Cytology of the pleural fluid returned positive for malignant cells, showing metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Discussion of therapeutic options for the pleural effusion was held, including possible options of chest tube drain and pleurodesis.
# Somnolence/Encephalopathy: Pt exhibited waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] levels of somnolence during her hospital stay.
Because of the likelihood of malignancy and possibility of metastatic spread, MRI of the head was pursued after discussion with the family about risks and benefits of head imaging.
The MRI showed a focus of hyperintensity in right occipital lobe that could represent small acute infarct as well as abnormality in left centrum semiovale consistent with either subacute infarct vs metastatic lesion.
Etiology includes hypovolemia and hypoperfusion vs sepsis vs hypoxia.
Patient does have an elevated WBC to 15.6 with a left shift.
#Acute Kidney Injury: On admission, patient had acute elevation in her Cr from 0.8 to 1.5 with an elevated BUN to 59.
Pre-renal azotemia most likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Most likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Cr improved with fluid resusciation.
She was given conservative IV fluids prn for signs of volume depletion, including tachycardia to low 100s and low urine output.
#Hyperglycemia/DM type 2, uncontrolled, without complications: Patient with a history of diabetes and on glimepiride at home presenting with serum glucose of 394.
Prior to discharge home, fingersticks remained 100s-200s without insulin.
Risks and benefits of oral agents for diabetes were discussed with family.
Because of the risks of hypoglycemia and her minimal po intake, the patient was not discharged on home oral hypoglycemics.
#Cyanotic Digits: Patient has cyanosis of fingers and toes.
Not associated with any pain.
Currently does not appear to be ischemic but more likely to be chronic PVD.
After re-examining the patient during HD 1 morning rounds the extremity cyanosis resolved and pulses were present in all extremities.
ABI showed bilateral aortoiliac and likely infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease .
It was felt that this one positive blood culture was most likely contaminant as pt was afebrile and with downtrending WBC.
Subsequent blood cultures showed no growth.
#Diarrhea: Two days prior to discharge, pt developed increased frequency of loose stools.
She was given conservative IV fluids prn for volume depletion.
She did not have diarrhea on day of discharge.
She was seen by swallow therapist who performed a bedside evaluation and found no risk of aspiration.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of the [**Location (un) 1121**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pleural effusion Adenocarcinoma Acute/subacute infarct  Secondary: Diabetes mellitus type II Peripheral vascular disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted with shortness of breath.
You were found to have a large fluid collection around your lungs; this fluid was removed.
An MRI of the head also showed a possible stroke and possibly spread of cancer to the brain.
