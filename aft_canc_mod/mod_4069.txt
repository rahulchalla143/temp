Admission Date:  [**2178-5-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-5-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2135-10-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 42 year old woman who presented with seizures in the setting of crack use.
There was no incontinence.
She had another generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting two minutes.
A head CT there showed multi-focal intracerebral hemorrhage and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient started to have some recall of events during hospital day 2.
At transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor, she was still complaining of a stabbing right temporal headache.
Her Intensive Care course was notable for no further seizures.
There was a finding of a possible soft tissue mass on the right sphenoid sinus.
There was also an incidental finding of dermoid tumors on abdominal pelvic CT. She had intermittent agitation requiring Ativan and Haldol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  General examination:  Mildly agitated and disheveled.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  There were no cranial bruits, her head was normal cephalic and atraumatic, there was some dried blood in the right nostril with no visualized masses.
Extremities:  There were no palmar or plantar lesions.
LABS AT TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 8; hematocrit 34.5; platelets 87; sodium 137; potassium 2.9; chloride 101; bicarbonate 30; BUN 6; creatinine 0.6; glucose 96; calcium 8.6; magnesium 2.1; phosphatase 3.2; INR 1.2; PTT 32.8; ESR 20; ALT 68; AST 127; lipase 13; amylase 99; hepatitis B negative; hepatitis C positive; HIV negative; Dilantin 18.3; urine tox positive for cocaine on admission; blood cultures showed no growth to date; head CT on admission showed right parietal, left parietal, and right frontotemporal intracerebral hemorrhage with surrounding edema; brain magnetic resonance scan showed above intracranial hemorrhages with minimal enhancement in the right temporal region; CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed two large masses consistent with bilateral ovarian dermoids; TTE showed an ejection fraction of 50% and mildly thickened aortic and mitral valve leaflets.
IN SUMMARY:  The patient is a 42 year old woman who presented with a seizure in the setting of multi-focal intracerebral hemorrhage in the setting of crack use.
Her examination showed some right parietal dysfunction occurred.
Due to the high rate of intracranial aneurysms in this clinical setting, the patient underwent a conventional angiogram.
This showed a focal area of a spasm in the right MCA territory, but there was no evidence of an aneurysm.
She was continued on Dilantin with no further seizures.
Her transaminitis gradually improved, likely related to abstaining from alcohol.
Ear, Nose, and Throat Service was consulted and felt that the imaging and clinical findings were most consistent with acute and chronic sinusitis and recommended treatment with Augmentin which was started.
In summary, the patient is a 42 year old woman with poly-substance abuse who presented with seizure in the setting of multi-focal intracerebral hemorrhage, most likely related to her crack cocaine use.
Multi-focal intracerebral hemorrhage.
