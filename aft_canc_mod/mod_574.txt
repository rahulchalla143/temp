1) GI/Heme: EGD repeated, which showed injected mass in distal esophagus/cardia.
CT scan next performed showed pre and paratracheal enlarged LAD + smaller LAD along lesser curvature of stomach.
Endoscopic u/s next performed which showed non resectable T3 lesion invading into muscularis propria w/ nodal involvement, so LAD and mass biopsied for likely Stage III Esophageal Carcinoma.
Pt has minimum of T3N1 (Stage III) esophageal mass highly suggestive of carcinoma at GE jxn and path pending.
Endoscopic resection not possible given fungating mass w/ LAD spread; Surgery not actively pursued given increased operative mortality given cardiac risk factors.
Trend Hct TID reveals hemodynamically stable and no clinical signs of bleeding x 3 days while pt had 2 large bore IVs, protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **], and DC coumadin/heparin per cardiology to minimize potential risk of GI bleeding.
Pt exhibited mildly increased daily weight so lasix was temporarily held for risk of hypotension.
Furthermore, given the predicament of AVR anticoagulation vs. bleeding GI mass, cardiology was consulted who recommended DC coumadin/heparin but maintain on plavix for total 4 weeks given the lower mortality for stroke vs. bleed.
We are currently holding heparin, coumadin, and ASA despite AVR per cardiology because the risk of mortality from CVA approx 5-10%, but the mortality from GI bleed is higher(please see above).
4) Pulmonary: Clinical right basilar crackles likely secondary to esophageal mass.
5) Rheum: steroid dependent RA maintained on acetaminophen.
6) PPX: Ambulate & PPI.
