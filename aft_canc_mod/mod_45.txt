Admission Date:  [**2113-5-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-5-5**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old man with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, previous hypertension, atrial fibrillation, peptic ulcer disease, recently status post left below the knee amputation from [**4-27**] and discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-1**], and was transferred to rehab.
He returned to us on [**5-1**] because of increased shortness of breath and hypoxia, and was slightly obtunded.
The patient had dialysis on [**5-1**] and he was initially sating 96% on 2 liters.
In the Emergency Department, he was given a dose of ceftriaxone and Levaquin for a pneumonia and left pleural effusion that was drained 800 cc of fluid.
He did have a small pneumothorax as a complication of this procedure.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays.
Atrial fibrillation.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy with prostate cancer.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of MSSA line sepsis.
Chronic lower back pain.
Previous admissions for persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac pneumonia.
Dry mucous membranes.
Chest:  He had decreased breath sounds on the left with coarse breath sounds on the right.
Cardiac: Regular, rate, and rhythm with a systolic murmur, distant heart sounds.
Extremities:  Left below the knee amputation, tender stump bandage, right leg showed no edema with poor toenail care.
Electrocardiogram showed a junctional rhythm with questionable ST depressions in V3 through V6, but appears older consistent with electrocardiogram on [**2113-4-19**].
Regular rate at 86 with some low voltages.
Chest x-ray showed progression of a left pleural effusion, with partial layering and the right pleural effusion appeared to be stable.
Pulmonary:  The patient presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Chest x-ray showed a large left pleural effusion which was much increased from his previous chest x-ray.
His sats have been maintaining in the low 90s on a nonrebreather, given that the probability of a pneumonia and intermittent hypertension.
This was thought to be sepsis from a pneumonia.
Eventually his sputum cultures did grow out Staph coag positive species, and his ceftazidime was then switched over to levofloxacin and Flagyl po on [**2113-5-4**].
The possibility of pulmonary embolus was considered given his hypotension, his acute respiratory decompensation and increased left pleural effusion, however, the patient has since refused CTA.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.
His last issue was his elevated CK MB and troponin.
His elevated CK was thought to be secondary to his below the knee amputation since his MB index was low thought to be secondary to his renal failure.
Renal:  Patient with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
He had some degree of rhabdomyolysis, and the Renal team did not feel that there was any urgent need for dialysis initially.
GI:  Given his history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleed, he was given Protonix.
He is stable from that standpoint and has been having dressing changes as needed.
He has a multipodas boot on the right foot that should be continued given his tenderness on the right heel.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis with small pneumothorax.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
End-stage renal disease.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and he should also have multipodas boot to the right foot while in bed, sheepskin, and Physical Therapy for his left below the knee amputation.
