This patient first developed pelvic discomfort in 11/[**2164**].
She then was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 68008**] for severe pelvic pain.
Ultrasound revealed a complex area 7 cm x 1.6 cm, possible [**Last Name (un) **].
As an outpatient, she had a CT scan [**2165-7-4**] that showed complex bilateral adnexal masses with extensive free fluid and inflammatory change throughout the pelvis including pelvic omental thickening and a few small omental lymph nodes.
Although these findings could be explained by bilateral tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic phlegmon, malignancy cannot be excluded as the cause.
An MRI on [**2165-7-13**] showed a bilateral complex adnexal masses.
The cytology final report from the ultrasound guided drainage showed neoplastic cells consistent with mullerian adenocarcinoma.
Today she presented to the ED with lower abdominal pain.
The patient reports that she developed sharp constant abdominal pain at 2am.
She also had emesis x 3.

[**Month/Day/Year 706**] ---------- [**Month/Day/Year **] Report ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2165-7-16**] 4:54 PM IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with focal dilated air-filled loop of small bowel with air-fluid level.
Large, complex pelvic mass with associated enhancing soft tissue peritoneal nodules and masses consistent with likely ovarian malignancy and peritoneal spread.
Distended small bowel loops with air-fluid levels indicating high-grade small-bowel obstruction with a transition point in the deep pelvis at the pelvic mass.
Multiple high-attenuation hepatic lesions previously characterized on MR [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 68009**].
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Bibasal effusions and atelectasis in the lower lobes, ascites and free intraperitoneal air most likely are consistent with a recent pelvic surgery.
There is no evidence of failure.
Some haziness of the right base is present suggesting a small right effusion.
[**Date Range **] Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Study Date of [**2165-7-20**] 11:02AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities.
Since prior exam from [**2165-7-16**], patient is status post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy with significant reduction in tumor burden.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
A small linear fluid collection is seen in this region extending to the anterior pelvic wall, which likely represents a postoperative fluid collection, although superinfection cannot be entirely excluded.
Multiple lesions within the liver, previously characterized to be of [**Year (4 digits) 68009**] etiology on MRI from [**2165-5-26**].
Postoperative collections measuring up to 1 cm along the anterior abdominal wall incision site.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for small bowel obstruction secondary to advanced ovarian or fallopian tube cancer.
She was taken to the operating room on HD#3 for a  Exploratory laparotomy, radical abdominal debulking procedure, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ileocecectomy with reanastomosis, rectosigmoid resection with reanastomosis, right diaphragm stripping, infracolic omentectomy, and mobilization of splenic flexure.
Overnight, she developed tachycardia of unclear etiology and a CT chest was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolism, which was negative.
She also had bilateral ultrasounds of the lower extremities that was negative for DVTs.
She was extubated without complication and transferred to the surgical floor on POD#3.
Another CT chest was performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
A CT of the abdomen was performed on POD#11, given persistent ileus to assess for obstruction, which was negative.
She experienced nausea and vomiting with oral percocets.
* ID The patient had a temperature for which she was started on ampicillin, cipro and flagyl by IV.
She completed a 10 day course and remained afebrile since start of antibiotic regimen.
* Left flank pain The patient complained of left flank pain on POD #9.
Her urinanalysis and culture were without evidence for urinary tract infection.
The pain was more associated with movement and improved with palpation, thus was deemed to be musculoskeletal.
She was provided heat packs and noted mild improvment.
She is afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her incision appears without evidence of infection.
Around the umbilicus there is a raised 2-3cm area that is without evidence of infection or inflammation.
This area was demarcated and monitored for any signs of infection or seroma formation, without complications.
The CT of the abdomen showed collection of fluid measuring up to 1 cm along the anterior abdominal wall incision site, which likely will resorb.
The patient's pain was controlled on oral dilaudid and ibuprofen regimen.
The patient is voiding spontaneously and is ambulant without assistance.
