At around the same time, a cough developed, which was often productive of clear or yellow sputum in the morning.
He denies bloody sputum.
He notes that his SOB and cough worsened over the next few months.
In [**Month (only) 547**], he was seen for a stress test and a CXR was performed, which showed the pleural effusion.
This was tapped, which yielded about 2 L and pt noted symptomatic improvement.
Pt was admitted for bronchoscopy because of the concern for the RUL mass seen and because of the recurrent R pleural effusion.

Additionally, there is persistent narrowing of the right main stem bronchus with associated postobstructive consolidation, which appears similar to the prior study.
chest/abdomen/pelvis CT: [**5-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Narrowing of the right main stem bronchus, unchanged, however, complete consolidation of the inferior segments of the right lower lung lobe.
2) Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with decreased right pleural fluid.
New low-density loculations within the remaining right pleural fluid.
New small right hydropneumothorax.
3) No foci of disease within the abdomen or pelvis.
4) Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
head CT: [**5-9**]:  no evidence of intracranial mets  [**5-10**] LE Dopplers: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
No evidence of metastatic disease.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Right-sided post-procedure change and slight enlargement of right pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**5-4**] pleural biopsy: poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the tumor cells show staining for cytokeratin-7, but no staining for cytokeratin-20, TTF-1, prostate-specific antigen, or prostatic acid phosphatase.
However, the histologic features of this tumor and this immunophenotype could be consistent with a lung origin.
Absence of staining for the prostate markers and the cytokeratin-7 positivity rule out a prostatic origin.
The histologic appearance makes a gastrointestinal or pancreatico-biliary origin unlikely.
[**5-4**] pleural fluid, cell block:  adenocarcinoma   Brief Hospital Course: 1.  adenocarcinoma - Pt had recurrent right pleural effusion and a mass seen on CT scan; given his past history of smoking and asbestos exposure, concern was clearly for malignancy.
Bronchial biopsies were consistent with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
As pt had recurrent R pleural effusion, a pleuroscopy was performed, which showed studding of parietal pleura with small masses, which were biopsied and found to be consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Pt underwent talc pleurodesis; the first attempt was unsuccessful, so a second trial of talc pleurodesis was performed, and the chest tube had little output after [**2-1**] days and was successfully removed.
Hem/onc was consulted as the biopsy results returned positive for carcinoma.
Staging CT scans and a bone scan were performed, which showed no evidence of metastasis.
As pt had an acute infectious process, namely the pneumonia discussed below, chemotherapy was not an option while in the hospital.
XRT was consulted, as well, with the thought that perhaps tumor debulking would help to relieve a postobstructive pneumonia.
However, with further analysis of the CT scan, it was felt that inflammation from the VATS procedure and inflammation from the pneumonia were the causes of obstruction, and XRT would not improve the situation, and may in fact be harmful.
2.  postobstructive pneumonia - Pt completed a 7 day course of levo/flagyl but continued to have increased O2 requirements (up to 10L NC, satting in the low 90s) and was febrile.
A repeat chest CT scan showed increased consolidation in the RLL.
Further, pt had question of O2 requirement overnight, though physical therapy documented sats in the low 90s on room air during the daytime.
3.  diabetes mellitus type 2, poorly controlled - Pt was continued on rosiglitazone, metformin, and glyburide.
CAD s/p CABG and stent - Pt was continued on atenolol, statin, and ACE I.  Pt will need to be restarted on aspirin as an outpatient.
