Admission Date:  [**2119-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-1-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-10-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**] Chief Complaint: Liver failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Liver biopsy Intubation Arterial line  History of Present Illness:    This is a 74 year old post menopausal nulliparous woman with recent diagnosis of endometrial cancer, uterine fibroids and left adnexal cyst who was transferred from OSH for further work-up of new liver failure.
A pelvic ultrasound also revealed a left adnexal cyst (8.8cm) and uterine fibroids.
However during the initial admission, the patient was noted to be severely jaundiced, leading to an evaluation for liver failure.
The TAH was therefore placed on hold and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and w/u of her liver disease.
She has no history of Autoimmune disease and never drank EtoH.
No history of significant hypotension that she is aware of and she does not take tylenol.
She has been c/o early satiety and abd fullness for the past few days but denies any noticable weight loss.
She underwent an abd U/S which did not show any stones or ductal dilatation.
Endometrial cancer (dx'd by D&C recently) 2.
Left adnexal cyst seen on pelvic US and pelvic CT from OSH 4.

STUDIES FROM OSH: U/S [**2119-1-8**]: GB contracted, no stones, bile ducts not dilated, liver texture inhomogenous and coarse - infiltrating cancer vs sclerotic changes, spleen borderline enlarged (12 cm) w/ satisfactory texture, kidneys/pancreas WNL, no ascites .
CT abd/pelvis ([**2119-1-10**]): timy bilateral pl eff, mild bibasilar atelectasis, 8 cm left adnexal cyst and a heterogeneous lobulated uterus c/w fibroids, 2 small cysts in left kidney .
Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe atelectasis vs consolidation.
Mild cardiac failure.
Abd US [**2119-1-18**]: REPORT: The liver is of heterogeneous echotexture throughout and also appears a little shrunken.
Within the posterior aspect of the liver is a 3.5-cm hyperechoic lesion that is producing some subtle deformity of the liver capsule.
No other focal liver lesions are seen.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation seen.
There is no splenomegaly and the spleen measures 11 cm.
CONCLUSION: The findings are consistent with cirrhosis.
There is mild-to- moderate ascites.
A single hyperechoic lesion is identified within the liver parenchyma which should be evaluated by multidetector CT and multiphasic CT.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: bicuspid aortic valve without stenosis or regurgitation; hyperdynamic left ventricle .
KUB [**2119-1-20**]: FINDINGS: The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable, with residual contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the ascending colon, without evidence of significant obstruction or dilatation.
No evidence of free air is identified on this plain film.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
Renal US [**2119-1-21**]: Normal renal ultrasound with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Minimal amount of free fluid within the abdomen.
There is increased prominence of the azygos contour and new pulmonary edema with perihilar opacities and peripheral septal lines.
Small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Increasing diffuse bilateral airspace opacities and fluid within the minor fissure, as well as layering bilateral pleural effusions in this supine patient, suggest increasing pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild increase in pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
Hepatocellular necrosis, single cell apoptosis and cholestasis with focal bile duct proliferation and areas of collapse (Reticulin stain evaluated).
No increased iron seen on iron stain.
Note:  The findings are consistent with autoimmune hepatitis with severe activity and areas of collapse the degree of fibrosis is difficult to assess due to collapse.
Brief Hospital Course: 74yo F with recently diagnosed endometial cancer transferred from OSH for continued w/u of new liver failure of unknown etiology.
Liver failure:  The pt was originally diagnosed with liver disease at OSH where she was found to be jaundiced.
Since her transfer here, she was found to have elevated LFTs suggest underlying hepatitis.
DDX was broad and included viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, infiltrative liver metastasis or primary, sclerosis, cholangiocarcinoma or hepatobiliary cancer related to [**Doctor Last Name **] II, reaction to medication (concern re: OTC cholesterol med), PBC, or PSC.
Also on ddx includes hemochromatosis or  Wilson's dz.
Upon presentation here, the pt received an Abdominal US which demonstrated findings consistent with cirrhosis as well as mild-to-moderate ascites and a single hyperechoic lesion is identified within the liver parenchyma which was concerning for adenoma vs. carcinoma.
A wide panel of serologic markers were checked under the guidance of the Liver team.
Other viral serologies were also negative for acute infection (CMV and EBV IgM neg but IgG positive indicating previous exposure but no acute infection).
Her iron studies were not consistent with hemochromotosis and her ceruloplasmin were wnl.
A transjugular biopsy was performed on [**2119-1-20**] which demonstrated severe portal/periportal and lobular mixed inflammation including neutrophils, plasma cells and eosinophils.
In addtion, she was also found to have hepatocellular necrosis, single cell apoptosis and cholestasis with focal bile duct proliferation and areas of collapse (Reticulin stain evaluated).
These findings were consistent with autoimmune hepatitis with severe activity.
No increased iron seen on iron stain.
In addition, given her worsening mental status, the pt was also started on lactulose and rifaximin as well.
Her renal function also began to decline during her hospital course possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome vs. Pre-renal azotemia vs. ATN.
In the MICU, the pt was continued on IV steroids for her autoimmune hepatitis, as well as her lactulose and rifaximin for her altered mental status.
The pt was intubated for respiratory failure on [**2119-1-25**].
As she was in oliguric renal failure, the pt was becoming progressively volume overloaded with clinically significant pulmonary edema.
However given her poor prognosis, the pt was declined for liver transplant and shortly thereafter she was also declined for hemodialysis.
The pt was made DNR/DNI (as she was already intubated, decision was to not re-intubate in the event the ETT were to be dislodged or the pt was extubated) on [**2119-1-26**].
Coagulopathy: On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was found to have a significant coagulopathy with elevated INR.
This was thought to be due primarily to her liver disease with possible nutritional component due to poor po.
This was initially thought to be due to prerenal azotemia given history of poor po intake.
Urine lytes were consitent with a Na avid state suggesting possible Hepato-Renal Syndrome.
Renal U/S and CT from OSH successfully ruled out hydronephrosis and possible post renal obstruction.
The Renal Team was consulted re: the etiology and management of the renal failure.
As the renal team declined to initiate HD, the pt became progressively more volume overloaded with worsening pulmonary edema.
ID: The WBC count was elevated from 7 on [**1-21**] at OSH to 20s during her admission at [**Hospital1 18**].
Although this was obviously concerning for a possible infection, as she was also on high dose steroids, this may have been a steroid effect and not indicative of any acute infection.
Levofloxcain was chosen for broad spectrum pulmonary source as she had some cough and an episode of hematemesis on [**2119-1-18**] with CXR findings of ?atelectasis.
This was therefore thought to be due to uterinr/endometrial bleeding from her endometrial CA.
Endometrial CA: This was not thought to be an active issue during this hospitalization while the pt was undergoing fulminant hepatic failure as above.
