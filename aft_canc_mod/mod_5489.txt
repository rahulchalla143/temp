He decribes the fall as a loss of balance.
He describes hitting his head with no more than a second of loss of consciousnesss and difficulty speaking.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], at which point he began to have some resolution of the numbnesss in his chest, and left leg, but was left with weakness of the right and left hands, and numbness and weakness of the right leg.
On the floor, he reported spasms of pain moving up and down his whole spine.
He denies fevers, chills, bowel or bladder incontinence, or a history of IV drug use.
He has had decreased perianal and penile sensation over the last year, as well as chronic constipation.
He reports many falls and poor balance over the last several years, described as loss of balance and falling to the right because of inability to lift his right leg while walking.
He has had three years of progressive right lower extremity numbness and 6-9 months of right lower extremity weakness making getting in and out of cars difficult, but he was still able to climb stairs and drive.
In addition, he has had numbness and weakness of the last two fingers of the right hand and recently has progressed to left lower extremity numbness.

[**8-19**] T/L spine MRI No post-traumatic abnormality seen in the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Moderate-to-severe canal stenosis from L2 through L5, multifactorial related to DJD and epidural lipomatosis.
[**8-20**] C spine MRI On the sagittal images, there is no malalignment or loss of vertebral body height.
No suspect marrow lesions are seen.
There is moderately severe spinal stenosis and cord compression extending from approximately C4 down to C6 with abnormal cord signal at C6 likely representing myelomalacia from cord compression.
There are large disc osteophyte complexes from C4 through C6, also with probable ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
There is no evidence for ligamentous injury on the STIR images.
Axial images at C2-C3 demonstrate mild disc bulge without significant central or foraminal stenosis.
At C3-C4, there is a disc osteophyte complex with mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.
There is mild central stenosis.
At C4-C5, there is a large disc osteophyte complex causing moderate cord compression and canal stenosis.
There is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing from uncovertebral hypertrophy.
At C5-C6, there is a large disc osteophyte complex causing severe cord compression and canal stenosis.
There is also moderately severe bilateral foraminal narrowing from uncovertebral hypertrophy.
At C6-C7, there is a disc osteophyte complex with a central disc protrusion.
There is moderate central stenosis.
There is severe right and moderate left foraminal narrowing from uncovertebral hypertrophy.
Abnormal cord signal is also noted at this level reflecting myelomalacia from cord compression.
At C7-T1, no significant abnormality is seen except for mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION: Significant cervical degenerative disease with moderately severe canal stenosis and cord compression with abnormal cord signal from C4-C5 through C6- C7.
[**8-31**] CTA chest FINDINGS: There are extensive filling defects within bilateral pulmonary arteries and extending into all branches.
The aorta maintains a normal contour without evidence of dissection.
The lungs demonstrate bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
A wedge shaped opacity is seen in the peripheral right lung base, which may be related to infarction given large pulmonay emboli.
No hilar, axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine with DISH.
IMPRESSION: Extensive filling defects within bilateral bilateral pulmonary arteries extening into all segments of the lungs, consistent with pulmonary embolus.
Wedge shaped opacity in the right lower lobe, which may be related to pulmonary infarction.
[**9-2**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with hypokinesis of the basal free wall and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
This constellation of findings is c/w pulmonary embolism.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
**FINAL REPORT [**2148-9-8**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2148-9-8**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Stomach: Mucosa: Diffuse petechiae were noted in the fundus and stomach body.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Spinal stenosis: The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and uninstrumented fusion from C4-C7 with no complications on [**8-23**].
DVT: The patient was found to have a left lower extremity thrombosis on [**8-31**].
Note that due to his spinal surgery no pharmacologic prophalaxis was possible.
He will continue coumadin for his atrial fibrillation.
Pulmonary embolism: The patient was found to have a pulmonary embolism on [**8-31**].
An echocardiogram obtained on [**9-2**] showed evidence of impaired right ventricular function, but troponins were negative.
Atrial fibrillation, with rapid ventricular response: On [**8-31**] the patient experienced palpitations and was found to have a heart rate in the 140's.
Heme positive stools: The patient was noted to have heme positive stools after starting IV heparin, without any hematochezia or melena.
His hematocrit decreased from 38.9 on [**8-30**] to 32.8 on [**8-31**]; this was thought to be at least partially due to dilution.
Urinary tract infection: The patient was found to have an E. coli urinary tract infection in the setting of a Foley catheter.
Delirium and anxiety: While in the MICU, the patient experienced auditory and visual hallucinations.
This was likely multifactorial in etiology, as he had experiences the stresses of recent surgery, PE and DVT, and was on multiple pain medications.
While on the floor he remained confused at night, improving with pre-bedtime Seroquel.
He can continue taking prn ativan as needed for anxiety and may benefit from re-evaluation by psychiatry.
Use of sedating medications (including flexeril and other pain medications) should be minimized to the extent possible.
Decubitus ulcer: During his long hospital course, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed a decubitus ulcer on his buttocks.
C. difficile colitis: The patient developed low grade fevers (Tmax 100.6) prior to discharge but had no abdominal discomfort, and was hemodynamically stable.
As he was having loose stools, C. diff toxin was sent which was positive ([**9-15**]) sample.
Anemia: The patient's iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Quetiapine 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. cervical spondylosis, cervical spinal stenosis, incomplete spinal cord injury (myelopathy), and central cord syndrome.
Deep venous thrombosis 4.
Atrial fibrillation 5.
Urinary tract infection 6.
C diff colitis   Discharge Condition: Fair, with limited use of lower extremities and hands   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a fall and had decreased strength and sensation in your legs.
Following your surgery, you had a rapid irregular heart rate (atrial fibrillation) that required admission to the ICU for control.
You also had blood clots in your left leg and in your lung (pulmonary embolism) and had a blood clot filter placed in one of your large veins to reduce the risk of further clots traveling to your lungs.
You had very small amounts of blood in your stool after starting the heparin so you underwent a colonoscopy.
Finally, you developed some diarrhea due to a bacterial infection (C. difficile colitis) and were started on an antibiotic prior to transfer to the rehab hospital.
Call your doctor and seek medical attention at once if you develop: ** fevers, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, pain in your abdomen or chest, bloody or black stools, worsening weakness and numbness, redness, pain, or discharge from the surgical wounds, or other symptoms that worry you.
No bending or twisting neck.
You had a colon polyp removed at colonoscopy on [**2148-9-12**].
