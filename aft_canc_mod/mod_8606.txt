Spontaneous gastritis in the setting of the coagulopathy was the most likely source.
EGD was performed and he did not show any signs of active bleeding or oozing.
Colonoscopy was performed and showed diverticulosis and two polyps the largest of which was removed.
His metoprolol was restarted but his bumex and lisinopril were held due to low  blood pressure.
# AMS:  Thought to be secondary to acute illness in the setting of a GIB coupled with sundowning.
# Hypoxia:  He had mild hypoxia in the setting of a white count and dry cough.
His chest x-ray was unremarkable, however he did have unilateral crackles.
# Coagulopathy:  This may be secondary to a drug-drug interaction between his coumadin and colchicine.
# AFIB:  HIs metoprolol was initially held but he had several episodes of AFib with RVR.
He was treated with 5 mg IV Metoprolol with resolution of these episodes.
Transitional Issues: Anticoagulation: Mr [**Known lastname 103486**] warfarin was held in the setting of his GIB and elevated INR.
