Admission Date:  [**2118-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-3-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis Placement of of Rt and Lt pleurex drains in your lungs.
History of Present Illness: 60 y/o F with mantle-cell lymphoma s/p RCHOP (4 cycles), s/p R-[**Hospital1 **] (2 cycles), and s/p RICE (Day 1 on [**2118-6-29**]) who was seen in clinic on [**2118-8-29**].
She says she has no difficulty with swallowing and her oral intake is only limited by nausea and vomiting and not inability to swallow.
It is productive of clear sputum and is keeping her awake at night.
She also reports shortness of breath.
On the way to clinic today, she had to stop several times and ended up coming up in a wheelchair as every few steps she needed to sit down and take a break due to shortness of breath.
She has no fevers and she has been checking diligently.
She has no discomfort in this area.
She has no headache.
She has no chest pain.
She has no diarrhea, or rash.
CXR done prior to clinic visit revealed a large left pleural effusion and was therefore planned for admission on 11r for pleurocentesis.
However prior to transfer she developed acute respiratory distress with stridor requiring 100mg of iv solumedrol and o2 therapy.
She responded well to these but continued to have audible stridor so was transferred to ED for further work-up prior to admission.
she was seen by ENT consult who recommended humidified air / O2 via shovel mask to soothe airway, prevent mucous plugging.
Past Medical History: - dx mantle cell lymphoma in [**2114**] - completed four cycles of R-CHOP followed by Zevalin by [**4-9**] - progressed by [**7-11**] -> began velcade/rituxan ** had L cervical LN - again progressed by 5th cycle velcade/rituxan/dex in L cervical LN - admitted for [**Hospital1 **] on [**2117-12-11**], [**2118-1-10**] and R-[**Hospital1 **] on [**2118-2-4**] - PET showed good response initially - planned for autoSCT on [**2118-3-15**] but CT on admit showed progressive dz - received ESHAP w/ plans for autoSCT if dz stable post ESHAP - PET on [**2118-4-11**] reported progression of her disease - BMB on [**2118-3-15**] showed a mildly hypocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis, no evidence of mantle cell, NL cytogenetics - admitted for 2nd cycle of ESHAP [**Date range (1) 57305**] - given rituxan on [**5-6**] and 3rd cycle ESHAP [**Date range (1) 57306**] - C1D1 Rituxan/Bendamustine on [**2118-6-6**] - CT showed disease progression [**2118-6-28**] .
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: reduced air entry bilaterally left more than right Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l cns [**2-15**] intact   Pertinent Results: CXR [**8-29**]: Since [**2118-7-28**], anterior mediastinal mass decreased in thickness on the left, adjacent to the aortic knob, from 2.7 cm to 1.5 cm.
Small right pleural effusion is new.
Moderate to large left pleural effusion significantly increased with associated basilar consolidation mostly on the left, probably due to atelectasis.
Right pleural effusion insinuates along the right major fissure.
Slight lobulated appearance of right basilar axillary chest wall is probably due to loculated fluid.
New pleural thickening due to lymphoma is less likely due to rapid change and improvement of the anterior mediastinal mass.
There is a moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent (2cm) inferior to the left ventricle, 1.4 cm around the right ventricle and right atrium.
There is intermittent right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

The patient received XRT and two doses of gemcitabine during her hospitalization, however her pericardial effusion reaccumulated with consolidation and the patient was transitioned to comfort care.
Mantle cell Lymphoma: Patient was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma in [**2114**].
She has had one episode of radiation of an anterior mediastinal mass during this hospitaliztion.
Long-range plan is for allogeneic SCT from sib donor with TLI, ATG.
Patient had daily XRT held while in CCU.
Her allopurinol was discontinued on [**9-10**] and her atovaquone was stopped per her request due to intolerance of the taste and she was switched to PCP prophylaxis with [**Name9 (PRE) 57308**].
She remained pancytopenic during her hospitalization and required multiple platelet and PRBC transfusions.
On [**9-13**] she noticed a large mass the medial side of her left breast which was likely a mass of enlarged lymph nodes due to her lymphoma.
On [**9-14**] she had a TTE which showed a reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion with consolidation.
She began to become hypotensive and was bolused with fluids.
Her dilt was held due to hypotension and her HR slowly came up to the 140's to 160's.
A discussion was had with her, and then with her and her family about her prognosis: the inability to drain her pericardial effusion and the fact that her lymphoma was not responding well to the chemotherapy.
It was explained to her that there were no more chemotherapeutic agents which were likely to induce remission and that a bone marrow transplant at this time would have a very low likelihood of inducing remission while exposing her to toxicity from the chemotherapy.
Patient had an ECHO which showed tamponade physiology.
She was sent to the cath lab, where 370 cc of blood-tinged fluid was removed.
Fluid was sent for cytology and cultures, and a pericardial drain was placed.
Patient subsequently also developed bilateral pleural effusions, a pleurex drain was placed on the left for extended drainage and a thoracentesis was done on the right for 1.9L of fluids.
Her shortness resolved over time and she was weaned off oxygen on the BMT floor.
A CXR on [**9-8**] showed no reaccumulation of the pleural effusions.
She had a TTE on [**9-6**] which showed no reacccumulation of her pericardial effusion.
She had a CXR on [**9-11**] done due to increasing cough which showed reaccumulation of her pleural effusions so she had a pleurex drain placed by IP on [**9-12**] for drainage.
A TTE on [**9-12**] showed a small pericardial effusion.
Due to episodes of hypotension and tachycardia another TTE was done on [**9-14**] which showed a reaccumulation of a moderate to large pericardial effusion with consolidation.
EKG at the time showed possible SVT versus sinus tachy.
CTA was negative for PE on [**8-31**].
She reverted back to sinus tachycardia after receiving 5 mg IV verapamil.
A TTE on [**9-12**] showed a small pericardial effusion.
Due to episodes of hypotension and tachycardia another TTE was done on [**9-14**] which showed a reaccumulation of a moderate to large pericardial effusion with consolidation.
This was initially concerning as patient had a recent pericardial effusion, but pulsus measured by doppler was never above 6 mmHg.
BP was controlled with gentle fluid boluses as patient had multiple thoraceneces to remove fluid in the CCU.
In the end, pressures gradually increased and were likely due to diltiazem.
On [**9-12**] and [**9-13**] she had a few episodes of hypotension in response to pain medications which responded to IVF boluses.
After these episodes her diltiazem was discontinued and she was monitored on tele, however the dilt was started at a lower dose as she became tachycardic.
She continued to become hypotensive, likely due to the reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion and was supported by fluid boluses.

Disp:*10 suppositories* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Cardiac tamponade Mantle cell lymphoma complicated by bilateral malignant effusions  Secondary - Tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Stable, progressive lymphoma, comfort, hospice, DNR/DNI   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath and found to have bilateral pleural effusions (fluid in the sacs around your lungs) related to your lymphoma.
You were also found to have a pericardial effusion (fluid in the sac around your heart) which was impairing the ability of your heart to beat so you had a pericardiocentesis for removal of the fluid.
There was also radiographic evidence of rapid regrowth of lymphoma, and after discussion with the patient, her husband and sons it was decided that patient will have no further chemotherapy or radiation and will have comfort measures and hospice arranged at home.
You will be on nystatin for thrush (the white coating in the mouth) treatment as needed, ativan prn for anxiety or insomnia, morphine and oxycodone as needed for pain, morphine as need for respiratory distress, omeprazole for GERD, compazine as needed for nausea, and albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath.
You can also take colace [**Hospital1 **] and senna prn for constipation.
