is a 63 year-old gentleman with a history of [**Doctor Last Name **] stage IV metastatic melanoma who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-3-2**] with acute-onset right-sided weakness and expressive dysphasia.
He was originally scheduled to undergo craniotomy and stereotactic surgery on [**2134-3-8**] for known metastatic lesions to the brain.
He was started on dacarbazine on [**2134-3-1**] and presented on the following day with the acute onset of right-sided weakness and dysphasia.
He was found to have increased size of a left frontal lobe mass (1cm on [**2134-1-29**] to 3cm on [**2134-3-2**]) with vasogenic edema exerting a mass effect.
He was taken to the OR for a craniotomy on [**2134-3-3**] and a stereotactically-guided procedure was performed and the left frontal mass was removed.
The mass was noted to have associated hemorrhage.
and pain control.
His course has been complicated by post-operative fever and FTT in addition to significant pain.
He was transferred to OMED to initiate palliative XRT and continued pain control.
offered no specific complaints.
He stated that his back pain was currently well-controlled.
Past Medical History: -[**Doctor Last Name **] stage IV metastatic melanoma Oncologic Hx:  In mid [**2131**],  the pt.
His melanoma returned on R great toe stump and biopsy on [**2134-2-4**] showed dermal metastatic melanoma.
A full body CT/PET was performed and showed metastatic lesions to the vertebral bodies, spleen, liver, and brain (L frontal lobe).
HEENT: Craniotomy scar noted over L frontal bone, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: tachycardic, RR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, nontender to palpation, mildly distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.

Vasogenic edema has also increased.
No new lesions are identified  -MRI of head, [**2134-3-4**]: There are postoperative changes in the posterior left frontal lobe with no increase in mass effect compared to the preoperative study.
There is linear enhancement along the anterior aspect of the operative site and a small amount of residual tumor cannot be excluded.
There are areas of T1 hyperintensity and susceptibility effect in the operative site which might be related to small amounts of blood breakdown products following the surgery, although they are also identical in signal intensity to the original melanoma  Labs on transfer:  [**2134-3-15**] 05:50AM BLOOD WBC-7.2 RBC-3.02* Hgb-8.7* Hct-26.9* MCV-89 MCH-28.7 MCHC-32.2 RDW-14.6 Plt Ct-184 [**2134-3-15**] 05:50AM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-9 Creat-0.4* Na-138 K-3.3 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-12  Brief Hospital Course: For details of the hospitalization prior to [**2134-3-14**], please refer to the HPI.
