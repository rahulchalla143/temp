He called for his wife and tried to walk; however, he had difficulty in turning left despite being able to ambulate with no unsteadiness.
The EMS was activated, and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 85745**] Hospital, where a CT scan was reported to demonstrate an ischemic stroke in the right parietal lobe with an area of subarachnoid hemorrhage superimposed.
Upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ER a stroke code was activated  Past Medical History: HTN CAD - MI x 2 in approximately 20 years ago HLP   Social History: No tobacco; quit 27 years ago No alcohol No drugs   Family History: No family hx of CNS malignancy  Physical Exam: Gen - NAD, calm, comfortable, appropriate affect Neck - no bruits to auscultation CV - RRR, no murmurs or gallops Lungs - Clear  Neurological exam: MS: AAOx3 Language: repetition intact, naming intact, follows 2 step commands Speech: no dysarthria CN: PERRL, left homonimous hemianopsia, EMOI, no nystagmus, V1-V3 intact, face symmetric, palate elevates symmetrically, tongue protrudes in midline.
DTR: 3+ throughout, symmetrically Coordination: FTN and HTS intact Plantar response: flexor bilaterally Station: deferred Gait: deferred   Pertinent Results: Labs on admission:  [**2156-8-14**] 12:34PM   PT-12.8 PTT-34.2 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2156-8-14**] 12:34PM   PLT COUNT-269 [**2156-8-14**] 12:34PM   WBC-9.1 RBC-4.41* HGB-13.6* HCT-39.7* MCV-90 MCH-30.9 MCHC-34.3 RDW-13.4 [**2156-8-14**] 12:34PM   estGFR-Using this [**2156-8-14**] 12:34PM   GLUCOSE-125* UREA N-28* CREAT-1.7* SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-16 [**2156-8-14**] 01:05PM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-NEG [**2156-8-14**] 01:05PM URINE  COLOR-Straw APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.007 [**2156-8-14**] 01:05PM URINE  GR HOLD-HOLD [**2156-8-14**] 01:05PM URINE  HOURS-RANDOM  Imaging:  CT 7//11 FINDINGS:  CT HEAD: There is an area of vasogenic edema in the right parietal lobe with a small approximately 1-cm hypodense area peripherally located.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY NECK: CT angiography of the neck demonstrates atherosclerotic disease and calcification at both carotid bifurcations without high-grade stenosis.
The vertebral arteries are patent without stenosis or occlusion.
In the visualized upper lungs, there is a parenchymal abnormality seen in the left upper lung as well as a partially visualized left lower lobe abnormality identified.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of vascular stenosis or occlusion.
Mild atherosclerotic disease is seen.
Head CT shows vasogenic edema with a 1-cm hypodense area which could be suggestive of a hemorrhagic metastasis.
CT angiography of the head and neck demonstrates patent vascular structures with mild atherosclerotic disease.
Two enhancing lesions are identified on the right parietal lobe, the largest is noted on the inferior aspect of the right parietal lobe, with significant vasogenic edema.
These lesions are concerning for metastatic disease.
Multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR signal are demonstrated in the subcortical white matter, likely reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
3 cm rounded solid mass in the left upper lobe, with peripheral ground-glass opacity, concerning for a primary lung malignancy.
Predominantly ground-glass nodules in the left upper lobe and right upper lobe, concerning for regional metastases.
No pleural effusions.
No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Numerous small hypodense hepatic lesions, with the largest one measuring 17 mm in segment V, incompletely assessed in this single-phase study but could potentially represent biliary hamartomas and/or small hepatic cysts.
Bilateral duplex kidneys, with severe upper moiety hydroureter, right worse than left.
No renal tissue or excretion is identified in the obstructed upper pole moieties.
Colonic diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
Recent right occipital craniotomy with small amount of blood present within the surgical cavity and expected pneumocephalus.
Vasogenic edema, unchanged with negligible shift of the midline structures and no evidence of central herniation   Brief Hospital Course: 72yo RHM with HTN, HLD and gout here after confusion found to have R parietal bleed with significant edema and enhancing mass concerning for malignancy.
#Neuro:  Further imaging revealed a significant mass in lung concerning for primary CA.
The best course of action for tackling this presentation was deemed to be a tumor resection of the malignancy, and then - depending on type of CA- further chemo/radiation with possible pulmonary biopy.
He did not have a repeat episode of confusion or "staring spell" during this admission and did not developed new symptoms.
preliminary pathology was consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
His post-op CT was stable and showed expected post-op changes, his post-op check was significant only for a slight left upper quadrantanopia.
His pain was well controlled with PO medications.
Disp:*50 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 6. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain or T>100.4.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**11-19**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
