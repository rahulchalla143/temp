Admission Date:  [**2186-4-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2186-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-4-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medicine/[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit/Bone Marrow Transplant  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (status post autologous bone marrow transplant) who was recently admitted with syncope of unclear etiology who presented with a recurrent syncopal episode.
The patient is status post a recent admission on [**2186-4-20**] with syncope without a prodrome with a fall and seventh left rib fracture.
During that hospitalization, the patient had a 10-beat run of supraventricular tachycardia and bradycardia to the 30s.
Electrophysiology felt there was no evidence of sinus node dysfunction and recommended atenolol and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.
She has had a recent lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging with no evidence of central nervous system lymphoma.
The patient was also started on prednisone as an outpatient for questionable temporal arteritis.
She was possibly confused for a few seconds and had bowel incontinence.
The patient pressed her [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor button both times.
There were no palpitations or shortness of breath, and there were no witnesses to these falls.
The patient has had continued headaches for six weeks with a left eye droop, which is now slightly better.
Follicular low-grade lymphoma in [**2175**] secondary to cervical lymphadenopathy.
She was initially treated with six cycles of CHOP with recurrence when diagnosed.
The patient was treated with Rituximab in [**2184-7-5**] for nasopharyngeal recurrence.
The patient had a recent admission to the Neurology Service in [**2186-3-6**] with persistent temporal headaches.
Hypothyroidism and history of a thyroid nodule.
Chronic headaches.
Recent admission in [**2186-4-6**] with syncope; ruled out for a myocardial infarction, had a rib fracture, bradycardia, and supraventricular tachycardic episodes with pauses and discharge of [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor.
In general, in no acute distress.
The patient had left eye ptosis.
There were no carotid bruits.
Extremities revealed no edema.
Her syncopal episodes were associated with episodes of bradycardia as well as hypotension.
The patient had two episodes of syncope while resting in bed.
The patient would be bradycardic to the 30s with blood pressures of 60/palpable with spontaneous resumption of her blood pressure to 100/60s without intervention except laying supine.
No supraventricular tachycardia with a baseline heart rate in the 40s.
After 25 minutes on the table at 60 degrees, the patient developed hypotension to the 50s which resolved after returning to the supine position.
Electrophysiology surmised that the patient's symptoms were likely due to autonomic dysfunction rather than cardiac disease.
The patient had a second episode of bradycardia with hypotension on [**4-28**] with good mentation.
Because the patient had been complaining of persistent left temporal headaches, with worsening over the past days, a magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was obtained which showed a soft tissue mass at the left skull base centered at the jugular foramen.
The left internal carotid artery was anterolaterally displaced on imaging, and it was thought to be causing these syncopal episodes as well as vagal stimulation.
On [**4-29**], the patient was transferred to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service for further treatment and evaluation of possible lymphoma recurrence.
Upon arrival to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, the patient suffered from two to three episodes of hypotension, bradycardia, and near syncope.
The patient had some decreased mentation with difficulty to arouse her.
It was thought that the mass in the patient's neck had to be biopsied.
SOFT TISSUE MASS ISSUES:  The patient had a biopsy by Neurosurgery on [**4-29**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].
It was thought at the time of this dictation that the patient's mass was due to an [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disease.
After one day in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient suffered no more episodes of vagal stimulation and syncope, and she was transferred back to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service on [**4-30**] for further care.
The patient received high-dose Decadron while in the Intensive Care Unit with resolution of her headache.
The patient had some improvement, but she suffered from mild headaches which are relieved with Fioricet and morphine sulfate immediate release tablets.
VAGAL EPISODE ISSUES:  It was thought that the patient's vagal episodes were due to impingement on the carotid sinus by this mass in the patient's neck.
After episode on [**4-29**], the patient had no further episodes of hypotension or bradycardia.
The patient will not be discharged on Fioricet as this was thought to be causing withdrawal headaches.
