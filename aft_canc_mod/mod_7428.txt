Admission Date:  [**2105-4-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-4-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2042-11-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 108541**] is a 62-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer status post surgery and XRT in [**2089**] status post radical resection in [**2103-3-7**], atrial fibrillation and flutter, status post failed ablation in [**2104**] who presented to the Emergency Room on [**2105-4-13**] with shortness of breath and cough.
She was treated as an outpatient for a right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia with Amoxicillin but presented to the Emergency Room with worsening symptoms as described above.
She reported no chest pain, no headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or any other symptoms.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 63%.
2) Rheumatoid arthritis.
3) Pyoderma gangrenosum.
4) Horner's syndrome.
5) Left sided breast cancer status post surgery and XRT in [**2089**] and status post radical resection in [**2103**].
6) Question metastatic lesion to the left femur.
8) Possible lung cancer of the right lower lobe status post resection in [**2101**].
9) History of MRSA foot infection.
10) Recently diagnosed vertebral compression fractures.
11) Superficial cutaneous Mycobacterium infection undergoing treatment with Cipro and Clindamycin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the Emergency Room the patient was afebrile and had a room air O2 sat of 97%.
Physical examination was most significant for right sided crackles.
Chest x-ray on admission significant for right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia which appeared worsened compared to the first chest x-ray taken a week prior.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's respiratory status worsened with increasing oxygen requirements.
The infiltrate in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe appeared to worsen radiographically, now encompassing the entire right lung field and the hilar sections of the left lung field.
This was presumed to be infectious as the patient had continued fevers, elevated white count and had cough and sputum production.
ID service was consulted given the patient's relatively immunocompromised state as she was on Prednisone for her rheumatoid arthritis and given the fact that she had a mycobacterial infection on her right forearm which had not been completely treated with oral antibiotics.
Initially she expressed very clearly that she did not want to be intubated or resuscitated for any reason at all, however, it was felt that her worsening lung process was likely infectious and likely to get better with antibiotic treatment and given this bit of information, she consented to be intubated for hypoxemia and also for a bronchoscopy which was performed on [**2105-4-18**].
Samples were taken including fungal AFB, routine bacterial and viral cultures, all of which yielded no specific pathogen.
She had poor urine output initially which was somewhat responsive to fluid boluses but became unresponsive to fluid boluses.
The patient's oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates appeared to worsen and on [**2105-4-21**] the patient was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and had large ST elevations in the lateral leads.
