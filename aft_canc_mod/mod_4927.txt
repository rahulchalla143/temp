There are low lung volumes.
No definite pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
On the lateral view, there appears to be an opacity posteriorly, most likely in the left lower lobe.
IMPRESSION:  Findings likely represent a left lower lobe pneumonia  INDICATION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia, hypoxic, tachypneic, tachycardic.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, with associated atelectasis/consolidation, worse on the left.
No pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is evidence of atherosclerotic disease with calcification seen within the aorta as well as coronary vessels.
BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Degenerative changes, including loose body, seen in the right shoulder.
Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation with effusions, worse on the left side.
Findings consistent with pneumonia.
Atherosclerotic disease with marked calcifications seen within the aorta and coronary vessels.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2148-3-22**]:  per report by radiology, bilateral renal cysts; no evidence of renal abscess on CT scan.
He was found to have urosepsis with pseudomonoas and was treated with Zosyn.
#  Hypoxia: The patient was initially admitted with mild hypoxia which quickly worsened with from fluid boluses for his hypotension resulting in pulmonary edema.
He was also thought to have an pneumonia, though this was later thought to be atlectasis.
ABG showed worsening respiratory alakalosis.
He was gently diuresed and on discharge, was no longer hypoxic.
# Sepsis: The patient had pseuodomonal urosepsis likely related to his recent prostate insturmentation.
He was fluid recucxiteec in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and responded well to antibiotics.
# Continued fevers: The patient continued to have low grade temps after DC from the ICU.
A fever workup ensued.
He had diarrhea which was cdiff neg x2 witn the 3rd pending, though he was started on flagyl for emperic treatment.
Ultrasound of his kidneys showed a cyst vs. abscess, therefore a CTU was done.
The CT showed no evidence of abscess.
# s/p prostate vaporization for urinary retention: Initially urology was consulted who felt that there was no acute urologic issue.
# Acute renal failure: The paitent does not have a history of renal failure.
