The pt was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital from [**Date range (1) 94558**] w/ refractory peripheral edema [**2-13**] chronic right sided heart failure and was diuresed; he was also developed pneumococcal pneumonia/bacteremia so was treated with two weeks of CTX which he completed in rehab.
He underwent EGD which showed only a small amount of blood in the stomach and signs of congestive gastropathy with multiple hemorrhagic changes.
On the cardiac surgery service, GI was consulted given his recent GI bleed and plan were made for colonscopy on [**4-15**].

There is moderate to severe reduction of the left ventricular ejection fraction at least partially due to ventricular interaction (LVEF = 30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2172-4-14**] CXR: The left pectoral pacemaker lead terminates in the region of the base of the right ventricle.
There is severe cardiomegaly with surrounding atelectasis.
There is opacification in the right lower lobe with air bronchograms that likely represents pneumonia.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax.
There are probably small pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
[**2172-4-14**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2172-4-15**] EGD: Mottled erythema (giraffe skin pattern) and atrophy in the antrum compatible with atrophic gastritis (biopsy) Fundic gland polyps Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
[**2172-4-15**] Colonoscopy: Polyp at 65cm in the transverse colon (polypectomy).
Mild inflow arterial disease to the right lower extremity, likely located at the iliac level.
No evidence of arterial insufficiency to the left lower extremity.
Exaggerated phasicity within the portal vein; dilated hepatic veins and IVC; pleural effusion and ascites; findings all consistent with changes of congestive heart failure and valvular regurgitation.
Gallbladder wall edema, also compatible with congestive heart failure.
[**2172-4-24**] GI BLEEDING STUDY: Intermittent GI bleeding localized to the ascending colon, just proximal to the hepatic flexure.
Multiple digital subtraction angiograms from the superior mesenteric artery did not demonstrate any active extravasation.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated mesenteric arteriogram of the superior mesenteric artery with no active extravasation demonstrated.
PATHOLOGY: [**2172-4-15**] A)  Antrum, biopsy: Fundic/antral mucosa with scattered dilated gastric pits.
Some of the fragments of tissue may represent (portions of) fundic gland polyps.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M w/ h/o CHF (EF 45%), porcine AV replacement, severe MR/TR, AFib, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacemaker, diverticulosis s/p bleed in [**2171**], transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-13**] for evaluation of melena.
Multiple discussions were had with the patient, his longtime girlfriend, and his sons, including his health care proxy, and the decision was made to treat his GI bleed conservatively and to transition his code status to "DNR/DNI".
#) GIB: Pt had hx of melena with hct drop to 25 in setting of anticoagulation with coumadin at rehab.
EGD at OSH showed congestive gastropathy, repeat EGD at [**Hospital1 18**] showed atrophic gastritis.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of mid-ascending colon and sigmoid w/o any active bleeding; a polyp was also noted in the transverse colon which was removed, pathology c/w adenoma.
The GI team felt that given his history of large amounts of bloody and black stool neither of these findings might account for his bleed.
His initial bleeding was ultimately attributed to his gastritis/gastropathy in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
The patient again had a GI bleed on [**4-24**], this time with BRBPR.
He underwent a tagged RBC scan which revealed a bleeding near the hepatic flexure, unfortunately IR was unable localize the source for an intervention.
A colonoscopy was consider however, given the patients poor functional status, significant comorbidities, and shift in the patient's goals of care, the decision was made to treat his bleed conservatively.
He continues to have maroonish stools.
#) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure secondary to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]: The patient was initially evaluated for the possibility of valve replacement, however it was felt he was a very poor surgical candidate.
He had an episode of respiratory distress and hypotension prompting transfer to the CCU.
He continues to have LE edema and slight pulmonary edema.
#) Severe Malnutrition: The patient reported 70 pounds weight loss in the last 3 years and is cachetic.
#) Atrial fibrillation: The patient remained in atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital stay.
All of his anticoagulation has been stopped given both his GI bleed and his new goals of care.
Concern that coagulopathy may be secondary to impaired hepatic function given CHF with evidence of congestive hepatopathy on ultrasound.
The etiology of the thrombocytopenia was unclear but may have been reactive in the setting of illness vs. related to evolving liver disease.
#) Acute on chronic kidney disease: Pt with stage III CKD with baseline creatinine of 1.6.
#) RLL infiltrate on CXR: Pt found to have RLL infiltrate on CXR on admission.
He was recently treated with CTX and azithro for strep pneumo pna/bacteremia in [**Month (only) 958**] so this was felt to be residual infiltrate vs. new aspiration pneumonitis.
Patient had no active cough, fever or leukocytosis and antibiotics were not started.
#) LE ulcers: Pt's ulcers were likely [**2-13**] blistering from chronic LE edema.
Pulses were intact so arterial disease was felt less likely to be etiology.
Vascular was consulted and ABIs performed which showed low level R LE disease at iliac level.
Vascular was not concerned about mild arterial disease and patient was managed with leg elevation, ABM foam dressings, and ACE wrap bandaging.
#) Unstageable sacral decub: Pt with pre-existing sacral decubitus ulcer.
5. morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 mg PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain/dypsnea.
8. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] house  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Lower gastrointestinal bleeding  Secondary Atrial fibrillation Severe malnutrition Acute on chronic kidney injury Coagulopathy Thrombocytopenia.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted as you were bleeding in to your intestines.
You also had an exacerbation of your heart failure.
You developed a second episode of bleeding in to your intestines, which were were unable to stop.
