Lung cancer was diagnosed incidentally in [**Month (only) 1096**] when a mass was found on rib films after a fall.
About 30 minutes into treatment, he became nauseated with right-sided chest pain, facial flushing and vomited.
He was given solumedrol 125 mg IVP, zofran 8 mg with resolution of vomiting and flushing within 15 minutes.
On arrival to the ER, his initial ECG was NSR at [**Street Address(2) 92500**]-elevations or frank ischemic changes.
In the morning, the patient developed 10/10 chest pain with nausea and vomiting suddenly.
ECG showed deep T-wave depressions in lateral leads.
Patient was given SLNGT, morphine without much relief.
In the cath lab he was found to have three vessel disease including left main, LAD and RCA.
He continued to have chest pain after the procedure.
He had no complaints aside from [**5-3**] right sided non pleuritic chest pain that was ongoing.
Additional history: - On arrival to the ED, he had pulse ox in high 80s with diffuse wheezes and left lung with increased consolidation.
CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality and known lung mass.
Hypoxemia resolved with above interventions.

There is now increased extension to the posterior superior chest wall.
There is persistent encasement and near total occlusion of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery.
There is encasement of the lingula and lower lobe pulmonary arterial branches with increased compression on the lingular branches, however these branches are all patent.
No filling defect is seen within the central pulmonary arteries to suggest a pulmonary embolism.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque involving the aorta and the visualized branching vessels.
There is a new 2 x 2 cm left adrenal mass.
Again seen are bilateral renal cysts, the largest is an exophytic left renal cyst measuring up to 5 cm.
No lytic or blastic lesions are seen in the visualized bones.
Enlarging left upper lobe mass with persistent occlusion of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery and bronchus with new occlusion of the lingular bronchus.
New left adrenal mass concerning for metastasis.
No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
[**2198-3-23**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated left main and three vessel disease.
The LMCA had a 70% distal stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated systemic arterial pressures at the central aortic level 158/58 mmHg.
Successful PCI to distal left main and ostial LAD stenosis (70% left main) with deployment of a 3.5 x 18 mm Integrity bare metal stent.
Successful PCI to proximal LAD 90% calcified stenosis with deployment of a 3.0 x 15 mm and a 3.0 x 12 mm Integrity bare metal stents.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo M HTN, DM, CAD, HL, heavy tobacco abuse, recently diagnosed primary squamous cell of the lung that presented to ER with chest pain and was found to have three vessel disease on cath, PCI with two bare metal stents.
# NSTEMI Chest pain started initially while undergoing his first round of chemotherapy with carboplatin/taxol.
His chest pain improved in the ED, and troponins and ECGs were unremarkable.
He was observed overnight, then in the morning had 10/10 chest pain with lateral ST changes.
Given his poor operative candicacy, he underwent successful PCI to distal left main and ostial LAD stenosis with bare metal stents.
Heparin and nitro drips were continued post-cath due to ongoing chest pain.
His chest pain resolved with 24 hours and the nitro drip was stopped.
# Hypoxia/Dyspnea He was initially hypoxic on arrival to the ED and for the beginning of his stay in the CCU.
There was a concern that he could have a pneumonia or a PE given his chest pain.
He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin but this was stopped given lack of fever and WBC.
Heparin drip was initially continued due to concern of compression of pulmonic artery, but was then stopped prior to discharge.
#  Squamous cell cancer of the lung Originally diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1096**] with incidental finding on rib films after a fall.
He began chemotherapy but developed chest pain.
A CTA repeated yesterday shows interval enlargement of lung cancer, with possible adrenal met and compression of pulmonary arteries as well.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy with obstruction A foley was placed earlier in [**Month (only) 958**] due to obstruction after lung biopsy was performed.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction Lung cancer  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a procedure done to evaluate the arteries that supply your heart, and were found to have several blockages.
You did not have any blood clots in your lung, however there was evidence that your cancer has progressed.
