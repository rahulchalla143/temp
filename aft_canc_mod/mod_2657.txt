She was also given DDAVP for presumed dysfunctional platelets.
Last night she was also found to be febrile and was started on Cefepime and Flagyl and then changed over to Zosyn as she complained of severe nausea on Flagyl.
This am the patient developed worsening BRBPR and again had one bloody stool with associated abdominal pain as well as hypotension with a systolic BP of 90 and tachycardia.
ROS: negative for lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, SOB, dysuria or altered mental status.
She reports fatigue, mild cramping abdominal pain, and increased number of echymoses across her abdomen, arms, and legs.

Does not smoke, drink alcohol or coffee   Family History: Mother died of scleroderma, father died of CAD  Physical Exam: Vital signs: T:100.4, HR 80, RR 20, Sats 94% ra General: Awake, alert, NAD.
Neck: supple, no JVD no lymphadenopathy Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: purpura and echymoses across arms, legs and abdomen.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor -DTRs: Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.
There is peribronchial thickening and increased markings in both lung bases without gross consolidation however early pneumonitis in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
Nuclear bleeding scan: negative per oral report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: progression of opacities, likely PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome, with fever and neutropenia, with decreased o2 sats and SOB.
Shortness of breath.
Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates similar cardiomediastinal contour to that seen on [**2138-10-15**].
Increased opacity involving the bilateral lungs remains similar in appearance.
There is very mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles.
IMPRESSION:  No interval change.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-9-28**] 3:47 PM  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please evaluate for infiltrates  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old woman with MDS fevers, acute hypoxia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for infiltrates CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 70-year-old female with history of myelodysplastic syndrome presenting with fevers, acute hypoxia.
Assess for infiltrates.
No pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are present.
A small pericardial effusion is relatively unchanged in size compared to the examination four days prior.
Lung windows demonstrate dramatic interval change with diffuse, ground-glass opacities present throughout both lungs, mostly new compared to the previous examination.
A few pulmonary nodules within the right lung are again noted and unchanged compared to the previous examination.
Incidental note is also made of bibasilar atelectasis.
No lytic or blastic lesions within the osseous structures are noted.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal air-space process throughout both lungs dramatically new compared to examination from four days prior.
Given the non-pathologic but prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, infectious etiologies including atypical infections if the patient is immunocompromised should be considered.
No pleural effusion.
woman with myelodysplastic syndrome and resultant pancytopenia and recurrent GIB associated with ulcerations in her small intestine.
# GI Bleeding: Likely due from previously discovered small intestinal ulcerations, with increased propensity for bleeding given thrombocytopenia.
No evidence of UGIB.
On the second day of hospitalization the patient had further bleeding per rectum, became hypotensive, and had sinus tachycardia to 140.
At present, there are no surgical or endoscopic options, so will continue with supportive care.
# Neutropenic fever: The patient finished her 5th day of decitabine for MDS treatment on [**9-12**].
Previous to decitabine therapy the patient had adequate cell counts, and after decitabine the patient became progressively  neutropenic.
The source of fever was not identified.
CT Pelvis revealed fat stranding and questionable external iliac [**Last Name (un) **] thrombus, followup MRI showed fat stranding but no thrombus.
Thought initially to be due to fluid overload in setting of increased platelet and prbc transfusions, and CT on [**9-24**] showing bibasilar atelectasis.
CT chest showed extensive infiltrates.
ID reccomended broad antibiotic coverage, and biggest concern was for PCP in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.
On [**10-12**] the patient was transferred back to the ICU after having another acute oxygen desaturation of 78% on 6LNC.
She remained afebrile and was continued on Bactrim and voriconazole.
Given her risk of GIB it was very important to taper her steroid dose.
Further treatment for underlying disease at Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] discretion.
Her medication list was reviewed and with treatment of her underlying disease her mental status improved.

Your hospital course was further complicated by hypoxia which was treated as PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
You completed treatment for PCP pneumonia and your oxygen was weaned to 3 liter by nasal canula.
