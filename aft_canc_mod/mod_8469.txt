He was transported to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where he had a head CT which showed a large left SDH with significant midline shift and impending uncal herniation.
He is having difficulty speaking and is moving his extremities but the left side is moving much more than the right side.
No tenderness.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
He withdraws to pain in the RUE and briskly triple flexes with the RLE.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-10-1**]  CONCLUSION: Persistent, large mixed density gas and fluid collection presumably representing residual left cerebral hemispheric subdural hemorrhage.
No change in the degree of subfalcine herniation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-30**]  IMPRESSION: Compared to [**2142-9-28**], there has been no significant interval change of left subdural hematoma and drain in place.
Persistent mass effect and shift of normally midline structures in addition to a component of subfalcine herniation.
New left eye preseptal emphysema.
Interval removal of left-sided drain with no significant change in left subdural hematoma and rightward subfalcine herniation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-28**]  IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of a large left subdural hematoma, with postoperative changes, residual hemorrhage layering posteriorly.
Air now replaces the previous subdural hematoma, with mass effect upon the left frontal and parietal lobes.
Slightly decreased shift of normally midline structures measuring 1.5 cm and subfalcine herniation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-27**]  IMPRESSION: Massive left subdural hematoma as above resulting in approximately 19 mm of rightward midline shift and subfalcine herniation  Brief Hospital Course: 86M transferred from OSH on [**2142-9-27**] for L SDH evacuation and placement of L SDH drain.
Since the previous study, the amount of air in the subdural space has decreased with better visualization of residual blood products.
There is left to right midline shift and subfalcine herniation with mass effect on the sulci of the left cerebral hemisphere as noted before.
Compared to the prior study, there is now some visualization of the sulci at the convexity indicating decreasing mass effect.
There are no significant new abnormalities noted.
His neurologic exam slowly improved and he was following commands with weakness on right.
SDH drain had minimal output and was d/c'd on [**2142-9-30**].
Head CT after drain removal: Compared to [**2142-9-28**], there has been no significant interval change of left subdural hematoma and drain in place.
Persistent mass effect and shift of normally midline structures in addition to a component of subfalcine herniation.
New left eye preseptal emphysema noted, these findings are expected given his surgical approach.
