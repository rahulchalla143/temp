Admission Date:  [**2185-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-1-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD x3 Flex sig under anesthesia Cortis CVL placement  History of Present Illness: 65 y/o male with hx of colon cancer s/p subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis in [**2167**], prostate cancer managed conservatively, CAD s/p DES about a year and half ago, presents with sudden onset of hematochezia.
This is the third episode of hematochezia in the last two weeks.
He had a prostate biopsy on [**12-30**] and 1 hour later he had severe lower GI bleed from the site of the biopsy which responded to packing in the ED.
One week ago (last Tuesday), he again developed second episode of hematochezia of the same intensity and was taken to OSH where he was again packed.
He had a quick flexsig when they noted a bleeding vessel at the site of the prostate biopsy that was clipped and the bleeding stopped.
[**1-10**] at ~9:00 PM, he strained for bowel movement and noticed brisk rectal bleeding.
At patient's request the ED physician did not put a packing but instead tried to stop bleeding by a foley baloon dilation but that failed to stop the bleed and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
He denies any abdominal pain.
Bleeding appeared to be due to AV fistula involving superior hemorrhoidal artery.
Six coils were placed with good result and no residual bleeding identified after rectal balloon deflated.
Past Medical History:  Colon cancer s/p subtotal colectomy with ileo sigmoid anastomosis in [**2167**] - Coronary artery disease s/p DES [**4-28**] - High cholesterol - Hypertension - Low testosterone - Obesity - Prostate cancer on active surveillance   Social History: TOBACCO: denies ETOH: beer 3-4 times per week ILLICITS: denies, no IVDA Self employed and is rebuilding his business franchise   Family History: His father passed away from lung CA at age 62 and his mother died at 87 having had a prior CABG in her 80s.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.3, HR 92, BP 102/75, RR 13, O2Sat 100% 2L NC GEN: Sedated, laying flat HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no pallor, scleral edema NECK: Supple PULM: CTAB anteriorly CARD: RRR, S1S2 normal, no m/r/g ABD: S, NT, ND, NABS, verticle scar along left abdomen RECTAL: Active bright red bleeding with clots pooling between legs EXT: No edema, pulses 2+   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: [**1-12**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an orogastric tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach.
There is still atelectatic change at the left base, though this is less prominent than on the previous study.
Mild dilatation of the small bowel loops where oral contrast is located with a relatively collapsed loop at the distal jejunum/proximal ileum, but with more normal distal ileum.
This could reflect normal small bowel distension due to oral contrast vs. a partial low-grade small-bowel obstruction.
No free air.
These findings are suggestive of fluid overload.
Multiple subcentimeter hypodense lesions throughout the liver and are too small to characterize.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o male with hx of colon cancer s/p subtotal colectomy with anastomosis, prostate cancer, CAD s/p DES 1.5 years ago, who initially presented on [**1-10**] with sudden onset of hematochezia, now s/p 13 units PRBCs, 6 FFP, 3 units platelets and 2 units cryo, s/p hemrrhoidal artery coiling, transferred out of the MICU to the floor with stable Hcts and hemodynamics.
Under GA, they put a stitch in site of what looked like prior bleeding at the AV fistula; and packed the rectum.
Patient remained intubated for EGD, which showed some bright blood in oropharynx, probably NGT/intubation trauma and stomach full of food and coffee grounds, but no active bleeding.
Repeat EGD on [**1-12**] showed patient still had coffee grounds, and a suspected AVM underlying the debris.
Thus, 2 sources currently suspected: Upper GI bleed from AVM, causing coffee grounds seen on CT scan and hemorrhoidal AVM causing BRBPR s/p prostate biopsy on [**12-30**].
Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital because of an upper and lower GI bleed.
You had an artery that was bleeding near your rectum, and this was coiled by interventional radiology.
On discharge, you blood counts were all stable and there were no new signs of bleeding.
You had developed a minor rash which was likely just an irritation from the sheets at the hospital.
If your rash does not resolve within the next week please call your physician's office to have it further evaluated.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED PLAVIX STARTED Pantprazole twice a day STARTED Triamcinalone cream for your rash which you should use for the next 7 days  It was a pleaure taking care of you during your hospital stay.
You should also follow-up with the GI doctors.
