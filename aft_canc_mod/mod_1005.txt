He was diagnosed with AML in [**2194-2-16**] when he presented to the hospital with dizziness.
He was found to be neutropenic and anemic, and BM biopsy was consistent with AML.
His 6[**Hospital **] hospital stay included a brief ICU stay for respiratory distress while receiving idarubicin for 7+3 induction, and then his post-chemo course was complicated by C. [**Hospital 563**] candidemia.
He was initially started on Micafungin for the candidemia, however LFTs were noted to rise with a new abdominal pain.
MRI was performed which ruled out hepatosplenic involvement.
His lower back has been bothering him since he "fell back in the winter time," and he feels weak in the legs on prolonged ambulation.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The degree of MR has slightly increased.
Pulmonary hypertension is now detected.
There was a concern for leukostasis and pt was transferred to MICU for urgent pheresis.
His urine output dropped off, and a chest xray showed mild hilar prominence.
Given concern for leukostasis, preparations for initiation of pheresis were made.
Given his likely tumor lysis, early DIC, likely leukostasis, and tenuous respiratory and hemodynamic status, he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the ICU, constellation of symptoms, including low urine output and worsening respiratory status concerning for leukostasis.
Hypoxia was thought to be secondary to leukostasis, and he maintained his O2 Sat on 2L NC.
He was afebrile but was given levaquin + vancomycin + zosyn for recent fevers and functional neutropenia.
He was on allopurinol to reduce risk of hyperuricemia.
Tumor lysis and DIC labs were checked frequently.
Pt had occasional fevers with no evidence of infection.
He was continued on Vanc, Cefepime, Acyclovr and Fluconazole as he was neutropenic, but his fevers were thought to be most likely due to disease process.
# Past hepatitis B exposure: HBV surface antigen negative, HBV surface antibody positive, HBV core antibody (IGM) positive - Pt was started on Lamivudine for concern of HBV reactivation during prior admission.
On the BMT service, his WBC initially seemed to respond to this therapy, but his peripheral counts ulitmately demonstrated a recurrence of his disease.
