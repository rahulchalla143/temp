#Pleural Fluid: Negative for malignant cells  #CT-guided Pleural Biopsy:  Peliminary Report:  Positive for malignancy  Labs on discharge:  [**2192-11-16**] 06:00AM BLOOD Glucose-15* UreaN-112* Creat-5.5* Na-137 K-5.7* Cl-100 HCO3-22 AnGap-21* [**2192-11-16**] 06:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-6.3* Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 71 year old male with pmh of coronary artery disease s/p CABG, CHF, CKD (baseline Cr [**3-30**]), hypertension, a fib w/ PPM on amiodarone, hyperlipidemia, DM2 on insulin with recent admissions for CHF exacerbation, NSTEMI/pneumonia who represents with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
# Dyspnea - Pt's etiology of dyspnea is most likely multifactorial including lung malignancy w/ worsening pleural effusion, CHF exacerbation (based on increased crackles and bilateral 2+ pitting lower extremity edema) and ESRD.
We attempted to diurese pt with IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] and metolazone with minimal success as pt was unable to maintain a negative fluid balance because of his ESRD.
Pt initially had a thoracentesis that was negative for malignant cells.
Pt then had a CT-giuded IR biopsy on Tuesday [**11-13**] which did confirm the presumed diagnosis of malignancy.
Pt will be sent home on PO lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and metolazone 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] for symptomatic relief of dyspnea and orthopnea.
He will also continue albuterol nebulizer treatments every 6h for dyspnea relief.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure - pt p/w Cr 5.9, worse than his baseline.
Discussion of hemodialysis had been brought up on last admission with renal and was briefly discussed after malignancy diagnosis, but pt was not amenable to this plan.
# Hypotension -  Pt was hypotensive on non-invasives on admission, but had SBP's in 120's when an A-line was placed.
Chest x-ray's did not show any sign of pneumonia and pt was afebrile (pt with baseline leukocytosis).
He also denies any cough or sputum production consitent with PNA.
Echo did not show any acute worsening of pump function.
Pt dis not have any s/s of sepsis (blood cultures were negative).
Imdur and metoprolol were held during admission becuase of low blood pressures.
# Hyperkalemia - Pt had a persistently elevated potassium despite recieving IV lasix [**Hospital1 **].
It is possible that kidneys are not able to excrete potassium because of a severely depressed GFR.
Pt recieved multiple doses of kayexalate to reduce potassium levels with minimal affectiveness.
He will be discharged with daily kayexalate to reduce potassium levels and for contibued constipation.
He will also be discharged with zofran 4 mg q8h for nausea [**2-29**] the kayexalate.
# Pleural effusion and multiple pulmonary nodules- Initial pleural biopsy results were consistent with malignancy.
# Leukocytosis - Has had chronic WBC of 20-30 since [**Month (only) 216**] most likely [**2-29**] lung malignancy.
# Anemia -  H&H has remained stable during admission around 8-9/25-27.
Does have history of severe bleed into renal cyst and was recently on heparin, however no evidence of active bleed throughout the admission  # Abdominal pain: Thought to be [**2-29**] fluid distention of abdomen or MSK in nature as CT scan from [**9-/2192**] showed no evidence for an acute process.
We adjusted his sliding scale for persistent hypoglycemia in the am, as wel as decreasing his lantus to 7 units at bedtime.
# Hypothyroid: Pt will be continued on levothyroxine 125 mcg /day for symptomatic relief.
#Constipation:  Pt had issues with constipation during admission and will be discharged with docusate, senna, mirlalax and kayexalate.
#CAD:  Pt will continue on aspirin 81 mg daily and SL nitro for relief of chest pain.

You were admitted with shortness of breath.
We found that you did not have an infection, but had a worsening of your heart failure.
We attempted to get some fluid off, but it was difficult because of your renal failure.
We also performed a biopsy of the tissue surrounding your lung because of a very concerning Chest CT a few weeks ago.
