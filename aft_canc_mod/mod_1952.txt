1) anemia- felt likely [**1-16**] slow GIB given guiac + stool.
Egd showed gastritis and grade I varices, and GI consult felt this was the explanation for the patient's hct drop.
Seemed unlikely to be related to med effect and there was no evidence of ongoing infection.
Also could be related to acute etoh effect (particularly given elevated AST).
Very low suspicion for diffuse marrow process or malignancy.

No evidence of ACS.

She was started back on lasix/aldactone at home dose on [**8-27**] but became hypernatremic so subsequently held again.
Head ct performed given that pt had recent fall and it was negative for ICH.
Mental status changes resolved w/ aggressive lactulose and clearing of benzodiazepenes.
