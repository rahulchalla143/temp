He describes feeling fatigued and very short of breath for two days prior to admission, with dyspnea with "any movement," relieved by lying still.
He denies experiencing chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, n/v, diaphoresis, abdominal pain or abdominal cramping, dyspepsia, or fever during this time period.
He has no prior history of melena, BRBPR, or hematemesis, but notes that he has 1-2 episodes per week of coughing blood related to his postnasal drip.
On the following day ([**12-4**]) he underwent EGD where he had multiple findings (see below) including a single linear ulcer at gastroesophageal junction with stigmata of recent bleeding but no active bleeding, as well as 2 AVMs in the stomach fundus.
He has no previous history of PUD or gastritis.
He does report a past history of acid reflux at night, which he has not experienced since he stopped eating late-night meals 2 years ago.

Marked muscle atrophy of limbs and shoulders.
A single nonbleeding linear ulcer was found in the gastroesophageal junction.
There was stigmata of recent bleeding but no active bleeding.
Angioectasia in the fundus .
A few medium localized angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen in the fundus and stomach body.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Impression: Extrinsic impression of the stomach Angioectasias in the fundus and stomach body Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] Follow Hct CT scan abdomen to evaluate for extrinsic compression of the stomach.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2116-12-9**]: CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax demonstrate a right pleural effusion.
There is uniform hepatomegaly.
There is no biliary dilatation.
The right kidney is grossly normal except for the presence of a large upper pole simple cyst, which measures 6.5 x 9.0 cm in AP and transverse dimensions.
Also, present in the left kidney are two nonobstructing calculi, one measures 1.2 cm in length and the other measures 0.8 cm in length, the width of each of these calculi is approximately 4-6 mm.
There is no pancreatic duct dilatation, however.
There are no dilated bowel loops.
There is a small to moderate amount of pelvic free fluid.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.
Degenerative changes are present throughout the spine.
This compression may be the cause of the mass effect seen in the recent EGD.
There is no bowel or gastric outlet obstruction, however.
Dilated splenic vein and ascites are suggestive of portal hypertension.
Cystic structure in the region of the pancreatic tail and spleen.
Nonobstructing left renal calculi.
Diffuse atherosclerosis.
Small right pleural effusion.
CXR [**2116-12-4**]: FINDINGS: Minor area of increased opacity above the mid portion of the left mid diaphragm likley to represent some left basilar atelectasis.
No pneumothorax or effusion demonstrated.
No gross pulmonary edema.
In addition to the left basilar atelectasis seen on the prior examination, there is slightly increasing opacity, consistent with effusion.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded in this region.
No other focal pulmonary opacities or evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis with component of effusion.
LABS: [**2116-12-3**] 11:20AM   WBC-22.5  RBC-1.76  HGB-5.6  HCT-16.3  MCV-93 MCH-31.8 MCHC-34.2  RDW-20.0 PT-25.8  PTT-35.9  INR(PT)-4.9 GLUCOSE-153  UREA N-78  CREAT-1.6  SODIUM-137  POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-22  ANION GAP-16 CALCIUM-8.0  PHOSPHATE-3.3  MAGNESIUM-2.6  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment:  75 year old man with history of Atrail Fibrillation and left sided thrombus on Coumadin with  4-5 days of melena and associated anemia determined to be secondary to gastric AVMs successfully cauderized.
Diltiazem, Losartan and furosemide were held for volume depletion.
On [**12-4**], he underwent EGD and was found to have ulcer at the GE junction with stigmata of recent bleeding but no active bleeding.
EGD also identifed a non-bleeding erosion in the lower esophagus and two small non-bleeding angioectasias in the fundus.
After EGD and stabilization of vital signs, Mr. [**Known lastname 7457**] was transferred to the floor, where he was monitored for recurrent GI bleed with vital signs, serial HCT checks, serial abdominal exams, and stool collection.
Nasogastric lavage was performed to assess whether the previously identified esophageal ulcer was bleeding; no blood was seen on NGL.
On repeat EGD there were no ulcers seen in the esophagus.
After the second EGD, the patient remained stable with no signs of recurrent bleeding: HCT and vital signs remained stable, and the patient's bowel movements were non-bloody and non-melenous.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin and heparin was started again on [**12-10**], and for the duration of his hospitalization the patient remained hemodynamically stable and without signs of GI bleeding.
2) Atrial fibrillation and left atrium thrombus:  The patient has A Fib and a known left atrial thrombus normally treated with Coumadin 5mg daily.
The patient's GI bleed on admission occurred in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR of 4.9, so coumadin was held and anticoagulation was reversed in the ED with 4 units Fresh Frozen Plasma and Vitamin K. Given his known left atrial thrombus and associated increased risk of stroke, it was recommended by cardiology that he restart Coumadin as soon as the GI team considered his GI bleed stable.
3) Dyspnea: For two days prior to admission the patient experienced shortness of breath with minimal exertion, likely related to his severe anemia.
CXR was obtained which showed a small opacity in the L lower lobe which was consistent with pneumonia.
By discharge, the patient no longer had an oxygen requirement, and only noted mild dyspnea while in certain positions, which he attributed to his enlarged liver exerting pressure on his lungs.
4) Edema: The patient has a history of lower extremity edema and scrotal anasarca for which he takes furosemide 80mg daily.
By discharge, there was moderate resolution of scrotal swelling, but the patient's lower extremitity edema had not resolved.
5) Myelodysplastic Syndrome: Heme was consulted and felt that there was no acute process at this time.
Given that the patient is known to have thrombocytosis and transfusion-dependent anemia, his blood counts were closely followed.
6) CAD s/p PCI:  The patient's CAD remained stable throughout his hospitalization.
He was monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia, especially in the setting of his GI bleed and low HCT, and remained without signs of active ischemia.
Aspirin was held, and the patient should restart it as an outpatient, in consultation with his PCP or cardiologist.
7) Findings on CT scan: The patient had multiple significant findings on abdominal/pelvic CT obtained on [**12-9**]: - Dilated splenic vein and ascites, indicative of portal hypertension - 2.0 x 3.3 cm cystic lesion between the tail of the pancreas and the spleen; it is not clear if this arises from the pancreatic tail or the spleen.
Outpatient work-up of portal hypertension is recommended.
It is also recommended that the patient undergo MRI for follow-up of the cystic lesion in the area of the pancreatic tail.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed in the setting of high INR, Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mr. [**Known lastname 7458**] GI bleeding and shortness of breath have resolved.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Department if you experience recurrence of blood in your bowel movements or dark bowel movements, or any of the following: chest pain, shortness of breath, dizzyness, fevers, chills, weakness, fatigue.
