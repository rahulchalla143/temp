The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.6.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
CXR: [**2191-12-28**]: INDICATION: History CAD, CHF, possibly new aspiration pneumonia, Swan placement.
The appearance of the lungs are not significantly changed with persistent bilateral patchy opacities predominantly in the mid and lower lung zones.
There are also persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR [**2192-1-6**]: HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia status post extubation.
The degree of pulmonary edema is unchanged.
There is patchy atelectasis at the bases, unchanged as well.
IMPRESSION: Patchy bibasilar atelectasis unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old male with multiple medical problems, on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, who initially presented with melanotic stools in setting of supratherapudic INR.
Patient suffered repiratory failure from fluid overlaod and was transferred to the ICU, was extubated and re-intubated, suffered aspiration event, and ultimately made CMO.
The following issues were addressed during his hospital stay:  * Respiratory failure: Intubated for hypercarbic resp failure [**1-5**] volume overload.
Peak pressures elevated on vent so nebs added to decrease airway resistance.
PIPs and plat still elevated likely [**1-5**] volume overload but improved following diuresis.
He was extubated on [**12-23**] but as above, reintubated on [**12-26**] due to an episode of pulmonary edema/aspiration/mucous plug/VAP.
During his second course of intubation, he was treated for his pneumonia and his secretions improved.
At a family meeting following his second intubation, it was decided that there would be no trach and no reintubation once he was extubated.
Had aspiration event, per family meeting, decision for Comfort Measures Only, patient expired on on morphine gtt due to respiratory distress.
* Pneumonia: During his first course of intubation, pt grew out Klebsiella and MRSA in his sputum.
However, given the lack of fever, infiltrate or leukocytosis, he was not started on antibiotics.
Once he was reintubated, his wbc rose and he was noted to have a fever with possible new RML infiltrate.
No evidence of sepsis.
Swan on [**12-14**] shows elevated CVP and wedge with low CO and elevated SVR indicating poor forward flow [**1-5**] afib with RVR.
Echo on [**12-15**] showed a new decreased EF to 35% (>60% on [**2191-12-2**]) with new wall motion abnormalities suggesting NSTEMI.
When pt was reintubated on [**12-26**], his BP dropped again suggesting that his hypotension is related to positive pressure and sedation.
* CHF: As above, pt with new depressed EF on recent echo.
Multiple valvular abnormalities including mod MR, mod AR, severe TR, severe PR.
Swan on [**12-14**] showed elevated CVP and wedge indicating volume overload.
Started on Lasix gtt on [**12-15**] with no increase in urine output.
On a few occasions, pt was noted to have elevated BP, HR and CVP indicating flash pulmonary edema.
On [**12-26**], pt had another episode of pulm edema that was not responsive to nitro patch, morphine and lasix x 2. he was placed on BiPAP but was tachypneic to 40-50s with minute ventilation of 22-23.
Again, he was started on levophed for a drop in his BP but also on a lasix gtt for diuresis.
His became alkalotic with further diuresis with difficultly in weaning and was started on diamox on [**1-2**].
* Afib with RVR: Pt went into a fib with RVR during acute event of GI bleed with resp distress.
* CAD: Pt with troponin bump to 0.56 in setting of acute event of GI bleed and afib/RVR with hypotension, hence likely demand ischemia.
Now with new wall motion abnormalities.
It was thought that pt was failing to wean [**1-5**] his heart disease (leading to ischemic MR which led to flash pulm edema during an SBT).
The pt tolerated the SBT so there was no evidence that ischemia was preventing his extubation.
EGD on [**12-22**] showed no signs of gastritis or ulcers.
hct slowly trended down during ICU stay possible due to slow lower GI bleed (hemorrhoids?).
He was transfused for a hct<25 due to his recent NSTEMI.
* UTI: When UA checked for sediment, noted to have 21-50 WBC with mod bacteria.
* Decreased urine output: Urine lytes show Na of 10 indicating pre-renal likely [**1-5**] poor forward flow.
Creatinine slowly increased over hosp stay likely [**1-5**] ATN (in setting of hypotension) and poor forward flow.
