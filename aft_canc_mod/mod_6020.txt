Cholecystitis- Although her abdominal exam was benign on admission, her LFTs were elevated on admission and her ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall with pericholecystic fluid and multiple gallbladder stones.

A MRCP was obtained on [**2140-10-18**] which showed a a thickened edematous gallbladder wall with stones in the gallbladder and cystic duct.
No bile duct dilitation.
A 4x3x3 cm mass was visualized in the pancreas.

Acute on chronic renal failure- The patient's baseline creatinine of approximately 4.5 increased to 6.0 and she had decreased urine output.
She developed a worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis with decreasing bicarb most consistent with worsening renal failure.
