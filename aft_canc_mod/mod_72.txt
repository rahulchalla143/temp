CT ruled out PE but showed extensive metastatic disease to pleura.
EKG showed e/o possible prior septal infarct, no acute ST changes.
Per report, she had an episode of chest pain that responded to nitro this afternoon.
Episode of SOB while watching TV as well as +Substernal pressure, rating [**7-13**], no radiation.
On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5, patient denied any chest pain.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery.
Past Medical History: -Breast Cancer with mets to pleura: On hormonal therapy for breast ca, no chemo or xrt.
Family History: Father with MI at 58 yo.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Right pleural effusion.
Mild congestive heart failure.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with mid to distal septal and inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 5448**] is an 89yo w CAD and a-fib (formerly on warfarin and dofetilide), who presented originally to OSH w SOB, was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath for NSTEMI, course complicated by polymorphic VT. .
# CORONARIES: Pt w known CAD and prior stenting, now p/w NSTEMI at OSH, s/p cath at [**Hospital1 18**] with bare metal stent to R-PDA.
On heparin drip for NSTEMI at first, then on heparin to coumadin bridge for a-fb.
Had frequent runs of polymorphic VT with no symptoms on floor, broke with isoproterenol gtt.
Likely induced by dofetilide in setting of cardiac ischemia and reduced renal clearance (Cr 1.1, unclear baseline).
Though bradycardia might increase the risk of ectopic ventricular arrhythmias, it is likely not the cause of the VT on this admission (VT caused by ischemia/dofetilide).
# PUMP: Likely new diagnosis of systolic CHF, though unclear whether h/o chronic CHF, unknown EF.
Echo with EF 40-45% with mid to distal septal and inferior/lateral hypokinesis s/p cath.
On hormonal therapy; no chemo or xrt.
# CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient .
Disp:*45 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST elevation MI Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia .
Systolic heart failure, acute on chronic hypertension hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to a heart failure exacerbation and were found to have a heart attack.
You also had an irregular heart rhythm of your heart, called polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
Seek medical attention if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, groin pain or bleeding, or any other concerning symptom.
