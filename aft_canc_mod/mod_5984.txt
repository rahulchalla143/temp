Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to thoracic surgery on [**2184-8-2**] for evaluation and treatment of right pleural effusion.
On admission, patient was short of breath but with sats 90-95% on 2LNC.
CXR showed large right pleural effusion and interventional pulmonology was consulted for thoracentesis.
EKG was performed revealing no ST-T changes and a left bundle branch block, present on previous EKG from [**Hospital1 1562**].
Stat CXR was done with stable effusion and no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Lung exam demonstrated bilateral wheezes but no crackles.
Patient's increased oxygen requirements and concern for acute on chronic heart failure prompted a transfer to first ICU bed available, in Trauma ICU.
Her dyspnea and hypertension responded well to BIPAP with O2 sats >95% on 4LNC.
IP performed right pigtail placement with 1600cc of serosanginous fluid drained and samples sent for analysis.
Trops peaked at 0.39 with CKMB of 12 and began to trend downward, c/w demand ischemia from fluid overload and hypertensive urgency.
At this point, patient was transferred to medical service for continued management of multiple medical problems.
[**Name (NI) **] had her left pleural effusion also tapped by IP with transudative findings on analysis.
Her BPs were noted to be in the 60s-70s, although the patient was completely asymptomatic and was able to walk from her bed to bedside chair without difficulty.
Medicine Service Course # Shortness of breath: Due to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
She was started on lasix 20 mg po qdaily but was held due to low systolic blood pressure.
Her pleural effusion on CXR were slightly large but stable.
Cardiology was consulted for further management of her diastolic heart failure.
Betablocker could not be started due to her sinus bradycardia.
Pulmonology was also consulted with history of radiation for breat cancer in the past.
Pulmonology did not think there was a pulmonary pathology based on their evaluation and CT Chest.
RHC was done to evaluate furthere whether her heart failure is restrictive or constrictive.
RHC showed elevated right and left heart filling pressure with moderate pulmonary hypertension and severe systemic hypertension.
She was transferred to cardiology service for further management of her diastolic heart failure.
