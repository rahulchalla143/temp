Admission Date:  [**2151-10-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-10-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-12-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Doxycycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: [**Known lastname **] is a 51 F with metastatic breast ca who went for her first dose of Herceptin (traztuzumab) today.
Once the infusion started, she developed a subjective feeling of cold and rigors.
The infusion was stopped for rigors and fever to 102 and the patient was sent to the ED for further evaluation.
There, she was found to be tachycardic to the 140s and slightly more tachypneic than usual.
She initially was found to be saturating 92% on 4L, an increase from her home 02, which is 2L at baseline and used for management of her malignant pleural effusions.
Chest X ray was unchanged but she was found to have left shifted differential with 9 bands and of lactate 2.1.
It was thought that these symptoms were either a rxn to Herceptin or an infectious process.
Of note, patient is s/p VATS with talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusions on [**10-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Past Medical History: ER-/PR- Her2+ Invasive ductal carcinoma grade [**1-22**] in R breast, metastatic to lung and liver s/p R lumpectomy/mastectomy and chemotherapy in [**2147**] s/p VATS and talc pleurodesis [**10-16**] Cat scratch disease--[**2107**] Left groin excision (cyst)--[**2107**] HTN (SBP 150s) while smoked ([**2147-3-22**]), no htn after quit smoking  Social History: Former homemaker x 20 yr, currently working as LNA for 2.5 yrs up until [**2151-9-13**].
The patient is from NH and is in the process of moving to MA to be closer to her boyfriend and to have further care of her breast cancer.
Family History: Mother--HTN, DM, heart disease, sarcoid, obesity Maternal uncle--prostate cancer Father with parkinson's disease  Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Tm 103.7 Tc 96.6 HR 111 BP 96/74 RR 16 94% on 4L NC Gen appears tired HEENT: dry MM, PERRLA EOMI Neck: supple Cor: tachy, regular, no murmurs Pulm: crackles bilaterally, R> L 3/4 up Abd: soft mild TTP on RUQ Ext: WWP trace pedal edema strength 5/5 upper and lower extremities bilaterally to flexion and extension   Pertinent Results: CXR: Again demonstrated are bilateral diffuse opacities as well as pleural thickening most prominent along the right lateral pleural surface, unchanged.
No pneumothorax is evident.
Paired to prior radiograph, there is decreased subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall.
There may be a small right pleural effusion unchanged.
Persistent bilateral diffuse opacities and pleural thickening consistent with given history of metastatic breast cancer, unchanged.
Bone scan ([**2151-10-20**]): No evidence of osseous metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 51 woman with widely metastatic breast CA, now with fevers, rigors, hypoxia and bandemia in setting of herceptin infusion with recent portacath placement.
Plan: # Fevers and hypoxia.
This was concerning for an infectious process vs. an atypical herceptin reaction.
There was high concern for community acquired or post obstructive pneumonia, empyema or hepatic abscess as the patient had a transaminitis (not new).
The patient's chest x-ray revealed an unchanged R sided pleural effusion at the site of prior malignant effusion s/p recent talc pleurodesis.
It was difficult to assess for infiltrate given the underlying pathology.
The patient's cultures were without growth and the patient's antibiotic regimen was trimmed to 10 total days of levofloxacin.
Her transaminitis resolved and this was felt consistent with known liver metastases.
The patient quickly deffervesced, her hypoxia returned to her 2L NC baseline requirement and her somewhat cloudy mental status improved over days.
It seems likely that this represented an atypical drug reaction to herceptin.
The patient had a bone scan prior to discharge that revealed no osseous metastases.
# Hypoxia.
This is likely secondary to her known malignant effusion.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atypical herceptin reaction vs. pulmonary infection .
Breast cancer   Discharge Condition: Good, without fevers, hypoxia at baseline   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers, chills, hypoxia and tachycardia, all occurring while your were being infused with Herceptin.
This was likely due to either an unusual drug reaction or an infection.
You were started on chemotherapy for your breast cancer while you were in the hospital.
You have prescriptions for pain medications, including a fentanyl patch which should be applied for 12 hours and then removed for 12 hours, oxycodone 5mg to be taken as needed for breakthrough pain.
Fentanyl and oxycodone are narcotic pain medications and as such can cause constipation and nausea.
For possible constipation you have prescriptions for docusate and senna.
For possible nausea you have compazine (also called prochlorperazine).
Also you have a prescription for ativan (also called lorazepam) to be used as needed for anxiety.
Call your physician or return to the hospital for any new or worsening fevers, shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, confusion or other concerning signs.
