Admission Date:  [**2112-2-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-2-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2040-6-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year-old male with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and a history of gastrointestinal bleed, recent myocardial infarction and hypotension.
The patient went to the Emergency Department with chest pain and received po and intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen platelets and INR dropped to 1.0.
The patient had vague intermittent chest pain throughout admission to the outside hospital for which he received morphine and sublingual nitroglycerin.
CKs were negative, but troponin was .63 with an unknown baseline value.
Upon being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service and sent for catheterization the patient was found to have maroon stool preprocedure.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Hypercalcemia secondary to end stage renal disease and hyperparathyroidism with a PTH of 491 in [**2110-11-11**].
Coronary artery disease with history of myocardial infarction in the anteroseptal region unclear when.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
History of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate and primary AV delay in [**2110-11-11**].
Catheterization [**2110-11-11**] revealed one vessel disease in left anterior descending coronary artery disease approximately 50% stenosis of the left circumflex, impaired ejection fraction at 40% and 1+ aortic regurgitation and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
History of OB positive stool in [**2110-11-11**].
Diabetes type 2 diagnosed in [**2110-11-11**] during inpatient admission, but no medical treatment.
Right middle lobe pneumonia, history of aspiration.
History of left subclavian vein stenosis status post stenting.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife whose name is [**Name (NI) **] who care for each other although the patient is not mobilized well given his left hemiplegia.
No elevation in JVP or JVD.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities were cool with no edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  Anemia with a hematocrit of 30.7, white blood cell count of 13.6 with 95% neutrophilia.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute with lateral T wave inversions.
Electrocardiogram revealed no R wave progression and no R wave despite changes in lead placement.
IMPRESSION:  Our impression was that this is a 71 year-old man with a gastrointestinal bleed and hypotension whose treatment was complicated by end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis and the patient having a history of congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
Over the first night of admission the patient had 10 out of 10 chest pain in the substernal area with burning decreased with two sublingual nitroglycerin.
No hypotension throughout event and no electrocardiogram changes from his baseline.
The patient also had esophagogastroduodenoscopy to investigate source of gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient received additional bolus of intravenous fluids with no change in saturations.
CKs were cycled after initial event of chest pain and were positive with an MB index of 12.3.
The patient was given GoLYTELY for colonoscopy prep and had persistent maroon stool.
The patient had second hemodialysis without event.
Given the patient's change in mental status and frequent memory impairment he had a head CT to rule out subdural hemorrhage and there was no evidence of bleeding.
The patient had a polypectomy and there was another ulcer in the hepatic flexure consistent with ischemic colitis after hypotension.
The line placement was extremely difficult given that he had multiple clots in multiple regions including the subclavians bilaterally and very narrow vessels in the femoral region bilaterally not allowing for the normal J wire to be passed through.
The following day the patient was noted to be bleeding from his AV fistula site that was oozing stopping with pressure dressings applied.
Tissue plasminogen activator injection was done with no effect and fistula site persistently oozed.
The patient was sent to the Operating Room with Vascular Surgery to have fistula repaired without difficulty.
Final sensitivities of gram negative rods revealed Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension secondary to ulcerations in the ulcerations in the colon due to ischemic colitis secondary to hypotension as well as polyp.
Pathology of polyp on [**2112-2-17**] found in the descending colon revealed adenoma with high grade dysplasia.
For non ST elevation myocardial infarction that occurred on [**2112-2-13**] the patient was maintained on beta-blockers by mouth and nitroglycerin prn for medical management to follow up with cardiology a full two weeks after having his polypectomy at which time it was presumed that anticoagulation would be safe.
For end stage renal disease on hemodialysis the patient had a left AV fistula that clotted and led to excessive bleeding after tissue plasminogen activator use and then with repair in vascular surgery.
The fistula was highly functional at the time of discharge and was used by dialysis on the day of discharge without any problems.
The patient has hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism.
The patient was followed throughout his stay by renal consult and had hemodialysis three times weekly.
The patient had a history of atrial fibrillation.
He was in normal sinus rhythm throughout his stay and was maintained on Amiodarone and anticoagulation was held despite concerns for subsequent cerebrovascular accidents.
For fever and bacteremia, this was presumed due to femoral line.
The patient also had gram positive anaerobic rod in one bottle that was Enterococcus faecalis managed on Vancomycin for a two week course renally dosed.
Diabetes, the patient had no home treatment.
Obstructive sleep apnea, the patient was maintained on BIPAP each night.
He had no home oxygen requirement and had no desaturations throughout his stay.
Dementia, this was presumed to be some baseline level of dementia without any evidence for reversible causes present as well as due to his history of cerebrovascular accident and left hemiplegia.
Poor musculoskeletal strength and deconditioning, the patient was unable to care for self or transfer.
Diabetes type 2 with nephropathy uncontrolled.
Renal failure chronic.
Coagulation disorder not otherwise specified.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
History of cerebrovascular accident.
Anemia due to blood loss.
Atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal.
Myocardial infarction, non Q wave myocardial infarction.
The patient was instructed to see a cardiolgoist for a myocardial perfusion study or catheterization to prevent additional myocardial infarctions.
