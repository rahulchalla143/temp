Admission Date:  [**2132-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-12-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Beta-Blockers (Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agts)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**] Chief Complaint: pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: 77yo M with HTN, HL, COPD presenting with cardiac tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis and drainage.
Patient presented for scheduled echocardiogram today and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
The pericardial effusion was noted on a CT chest performed [**2132-8-26**], at which time a 2cm spiculated mass was also noted in the RUL concerning for malignancy.
Patient reports that over the past several months he has had worsening fatigue.
He also reports worsening shortness of breath.
Patient presented to his PCP with these symptoms, and labs were significant for anemia, macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia and small IgG kappa and IgM kappa monoclonal proteins.
Patient was referred to a hematologist who was concerned about the potential for a lymphoid neoplasm associated with IgM such as lymphplasmacytic lymphoma, multiple myeloma or Waldenstroms.
The hematologist ordered a CT chest/abd/pelvis to investigate for adenopathy and organomegaly, and the above findings were discovered.
Patient denies recent weight loss or change in appetite.
He reports a brief episode recently when his right lower leg was dragging and "not responding".
This improved after several hours and was not associated with numbness or tingling in the limb, speech deficits, word finding difficulties or vision changes.
He has never had similar symptoms and they have not recurred since this original episode.
He reports shortness of breath which has been worsening over the past several weeks.
He denies chest pain or palpitations.
He reports constipation, without change in caliber of stool, melena or hematochezia.
He denies urinary urgency or frequency, hematuria or dysuria.
He denies bowel or bladder incontinence.
He has had two episdoes of prolonged bleeding; one nosebleed and one post-operative bleeding after MOHS.
Today after echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, patient was taken to cath lab for drainage.
Approximately 1L of bloody fluid was drained and sent for cytology, hematology and chemistries.

The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is left atrial diastolic collapse.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

Moderate to large pericardial effusion.
Pertinent labs/studies: Pericardial fluid cytology ([**2132-9-4**])- POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Preliminary read: trace to small effusion without evidence of tamponade  Discharge labs: WBC 10.1  Hgb 13.4  Hct 39.8 Plts 220 Na 140 K 4.4 Cl 100 HCO3 30 BUN 37 Cr 1.7 Glucose 120   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo M with h/o HTN, HL, COPD with RUL lung mass and pericardial effusion recently noted on CT scan, presenting with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology, s/p drainage of approximately 1L bloody fluid with malignant cells on cytology  # Pericardial effusion - Given findings on CT scan of lung mass and bloody fluid drained from pericardium, there was concern for a malignant effusion.
A pericardiocentesis was done with a pericardial drain placed for two days until fluid output slowed to a minimal level with a total of roughly 1L output from initial drainage plus drain output.
The drain was clamped and a TTE was done 24hrs later which showed no significant fluid reaccumulation and the drain was then pulled.
Preliminary cytology is positive for malignant cells, most likely non-small cell lung cancer but final results and additional tissue staining was pending at time of discharge.
There was no ongoing pericardial rub.
# RUL mass - Patient has been in the process of being worked up for recent fatigue and anemia.
Outpatient laboratories were concerning for a macrocytosis and IgG/IgM monoclonal gammopathy.
Patient was seen by hematology who wanted to work him up further for concern for a lymphocytoclastic leukemia.
Patient had prior lung imaging with a spiculated lung nodule concerning for malignancy.
In addition, the pericardial effusion was found which was positive for malignant cells.
Due to suspicion for lung cancer, a brain MRI was done looking for metastatic disease.
Patient was followed by the [**Location (un) 2274**] oncology service during admission and they will follow up with him as an outpatient regarding final diagnosis and treatment.
Because of his lowish blood pressures, his home HCTZ dose was decreased to 25mg daily and his verapamil was stopped as it provides relatively little blood pressure control and their was no need for nodal blocking.
# COPD - Patient was wheezing on exam but without gross sputum production or fever.
# H/o gout - No active flare.
# Gastritis - Continue home omeprazole  # Transitional Issues: - Discussion with patient of final MRI results - Discussion of patient with final pre-discharge ECHO results - Follow-up on final cytology/pathology from pericardial fluid - Outpatient PET Scan - Possible outpatient bronchoscopy if final cytology not diagnostic - Outpatient [**Location (un) 2274**] heme/onc f/u to discuss diagnosis and treatment - Continuing support for smoking cessation  Medications on Admission: - Verapamil SR 240mg po daily - Lisinopril 20mg po daily - Hydrochlorothiazide 50mg po daily - Aspirin 81mg po daily - Colchicine 0.6mg po daily - Allopurinol 200mg po daily - Albuterol INH 1-2puffs q4-6hrs PRN - Flutcasone 220mcg/INH 2puffs [**Hospital1 **] - Omeprazole 20mg po BID   Discharge Medications: 1. colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Gastritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of an effusion that developed around your heart and caused compression of your heart.
We discussed that the most likely source of the malignancy is the mass in your right upper lung which was found recently on a CAT scan.
