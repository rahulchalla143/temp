History of Present Illness: This 53-year-old lady has a history of pancreas divisum and has been treated endoscopically for this at our institution.
She has had about a month-long history of a general uneasiness in her abdomen and low-lying abdominal pain.
This was investigated at an outside hospital where she was found to have a mass in the head of the pancreas.
We found her to have a 2.5 cm hypodense lesion in the head of her pancreas which  was separate from the pancreatic duct and bile duct.
There was no evidence of any metastatic disease on her CAT scan.
An endoscopic ultrasound examination was performed  the week before this procedure, and this confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma as the diagnosis.
