The patient initially present to [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital following onset of right sided weakness and difficulty speaking that had reportedly developed over a week.
The pt & family reported difficulty walking and using right side.
He went to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital and then transferred here after a head CT showed a possible left frontal mass with a the bleed.
No chest pain/palpitations/[**Doctor Last Name **] Extremity swelling; no abdominal pain/N/V/D/C.
Hypertension 8. h/o migraine 9. cochlear implants 10.
Gastroesophageal reflux 12. depression .
Physical Exam: Tm 98.7 Tc 97.6 BP 120/60, 73, RR 22, Sat94% on 2L NC Pt sitting up in bed, NAD, cooperative and pleasant, alert and oriented person, place, and time neck supple, JVP 7.5 cm distant heart sounds RRR no M/R/G Diffuse ronchi w/ high pitched wheezes, decreased breath sounds R>L soft NT/D + BS, (+)surgical scars no C/C/E CN 2-12 intact, 4+/5 Left upper and lower extremity strength, 3+/5 Right upper and lower extremity strength; pt has word finding difficulties though understands language    Pertinent Results:  [**9-10**] HEAD CT: 1.
Large intraparenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe.
The finding could be a result of amyloid angiopathy or underlying neoplasm.
Status post aneurysm repair, with evidence of a small residual aneurysm in the left suprasellar cistern region.
Emphysema with spiculated 10 mm nodular opacity in right lower lobe.
4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
No evidence of leak.
Right inguinal hernia w/ nonincarcerated/nonobstructed small bowel.
Diverticulosis, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
If not, correlate with UA results as urinary tract infection is also possible.
Multiple thyroid nodules.
Expected post-biopsy changes surrounding the large left superior frontal hemorrhagic mass with significant surrounding vasogenic edema.
New focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe.
Head CT [**2171-9-27**]: No change in the large hemorrhagic superior left frontal lobe mass.
The small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left parietal lobe has evolved and now appears isointense to [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is noted.
Irregular opacification of the lung bases is atelectasis.
Focal opacities in the right lung on two previous studies are less obvious today and could represent sparing of fissural pleural loculations.
Upper lungs demonstrate severe emphysema, right worse than left.
The vertical component of sternal wiring shows several breaks, but no interval change.
No pneumothorax appreciable.
Pleural effusion is present.

Mestatic Carcinoma: The patient was transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital for evaluation and management of his left frontal mass.
The patients right sided weakness and expressive aphasia (which have persisted during his hospitalization) were attributed to the left frontal mass.
The scans were remarkable for a 10mm spiculated mass in the right lower lobe of the lung.
There were also some thyroid nodules noted.
The patient underwent sterotatic brain biopsy (with local anethesia only), with pathology consistent revealed metastic carcinoma.
Of note, the patient's poor pulmonary status was not thought to be relate to his lung mass given how small the lung mass is--the patient clearly has severe underlying emphysema as well as probable recurrent aspiration.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: following brain biopsy, the patient had routine post-surgical head CT which showed a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left parietal region.
Of note, the patient was asymptomatic during these episodes, and his saturations improved with nebulizer treatment and supplemental oxygen.
Community Acquired Pneumonia: as above, upon admission, the patient found to have a right middle lobe pneumonia, for which he recieved a 7 day course of levofloxacin.
The patient's pulmonary status did improve with treatment; however, during his stay he was noted to have difficultly clearing secretions and ronchorus breath sounds.
The pt underwent video swallow study which was negative for aspiration.
UTI: the patient was treated for enterococcal urinary tract infection with a 7 day course of ampicillin.
HTN: pt was not hypertensive during his admission.
EKG was unremarkable for active disease (see results section).
Mild leukocytosis: the pt was noted to have mild leukocytosis (13) on day of discharge.
The patient is afebrile, non-toxic, and without complaints.
The elevated WBC is likely due to stress response to radiation (started yesterday) and perhaps steroid-associated as well.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
