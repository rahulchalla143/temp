Admission Date:  [**2117-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-8-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilantin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: slurred speech, headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 48422**] is a 36-year-old man with a history of metastatic, dedifferentiated thyroid cancer on doxarubucin (C1D18) and celiac disease, presenting with one day of headache and altered mental status.
Patient developed a headache after using a suppository for constipation yesterday.
He has had several weeks of low grade temperatures to 99.5 and night sweats.
He states he was having difficulty word finding, following commands, and writing sentences at that time.
He was referred to the ED where his symptoms resolved again, but then re-occurred in the ED where he was noted to be having difficulty finding words, making paraphrasic errors, and appearing overall globally confused.
Neurology recommended LP for rule out meningitis which was performed in the ED and demonstrated WBC of 8, normal protein and glucose, and RBCS that did not clear from tube 1->tube 4. .
Review of systems: (+) overall weakness (-) Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History (Per Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 11574**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note): -[**2103**]: Nodule felt on physical examination, biopsy revealed papillary thyroid cancer and patient underwent a total thyroidectomy.
Per reports, patient had 1.1 cm tumor with lymph node involvement.
Abnormalities were detected in [**2107**] with evidence of possible remnant thyroid tissue, and he underwent repeat radioactive iodine ablation with good result.
The ultrasound demonstrated three enlarged morphologically abnormal lymph nodes on the left at level IV and further evaluation was recommended.
He then underwent a Thyrogen radioactive iodine uptake scan, which was negative for residual thyroid uptake and had no  evidence of metastatic disease.
He subsequently went on to an ultrasound-guided biopsy and cytology from this procedure was positive for malignant cells consistent with carcinoma.
The malignant cells had a large nuclei with prominent nucleoli and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios.
These findings were consistent with dedifferentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, but second primary could not be entirely excluded.
As a result of this pathology, the patient underwent PET-CT scan, which demonstrated FDG avid nodal disease in the left neck at levels IV and IIa within the right thyroidectomy bed.
There was atypical diffuse FDG avid nodal disease within the thorax along the periaortic and paraesophageal chain.
The findings were consistent suggestive of dedifferentiated metastatic thyroid cancer; however, the pattern was atypical.
There were no other sites of abnormal FDG uptake to suggest a secondary malignancy.
Biopsy of the paraesophageal mass on [**2-17**] with pathology consistent with his previously diagnosed, dedifferentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Family History: Mother had papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.
Father died of colon cancer at age 63, was diagnosed at age 57.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely multifactorial.
DDx is broad and includes pulmonary embolism (possible given tachycardia, hypercoagulable state in setting of neoplasm, and additional oxygen requirement), pulmonary infection (favor atypical infection such as PCP as opposed to acute bacterial pneumonia given lack of fever and leukocytosis), or, more likely rapidly rising tumor burden (favored diagnosis after reviewing his progressive disease on CT scan and discussing with radiology).
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient demonstrated tachypnea, increased work of breathing on NRB, and required intubation.
# Hct drop/anemia/thrombocytopenia: DDx includes bleeding (possible given hematuria, hematochezia, and now hemoptysis), DIC (possible though unlikely given normal coagulation parameters and fibrinogen > 300), TTP-HUS (possible given thrombocytopenia and evidence of schistocytes on peripheral smear).
Evidence for hemolysis includes elevated direct bilirubin, and marked drop in haptoglobin to 6.
# Subdural hematoma: known subdural hematoma with thrombocytopenia.
# Metastatic Thyroid cancer: He received a dose of chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel on [**8-25**] and has been on decadron, calcitriol and levothyroxine.
# Altered mental status: now resolved.
Previously with delirium likely secondary to infection, pain meds & lack of sleep [**12-22**] ICU environment.
The cause of his severe agitation and AMS that led to intubation & transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] is unclear, but there was concern for seizure with AMS [**12-22**] post-ictal state.
EEG was negative for seizure activity, but patient was placed on keppra for generalized slowing on EEG without epileptiform activity.
Chronic subdural hematoma was stable.
# Hypoxia: Patient was intubated from [**Date range (1) 16628**] secondary to inability to protect his airway due to sedation that was required to control his agitation and altered mental status.
Had one episode of dyspnea requiring non-rebreather secondary to volume overload.
-------------  MICU course: patient was transferred to ICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, and acute hematocrit drop, with concern for hemolysis.
Patient underwent cardiac arrest with rhythm of ventricular fibrillation.
Primary cause of death was felt to be underlying, rapidly progressive thyroid cancer.
