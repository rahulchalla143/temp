Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 yo man with PMH significant for CML s/p allo SCT approximately 2 1/2 years ago and chronic GVHD on Cellcept/Prednisone, chronic RUQ pain, pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas in sputum, PE on Lovenox, multiple vertebral fractures, and chronic lower extremity edema with intermittent episodes of cellulitis presenting with a multilobar pneumonia and new sternal/vertebral fractures.
A good sputum sample was obtained on admission and it was felt that it would be best to avoid a bronchoscopy given his poor respiratory status and the quality sample.
He was initially treated with Levaquin and ceftazidime until his initial sputum culture was positive for ESBL E. coli.
He got an aggressive pulmonary toilet with an acapella valve and in/exsufflator.
Given this, he was bronched on [**6-8**] to evaluate for possible fungal etiology of his persistent RUL infiltrate.
Secretions noted to be thick and profuse.
Pt had a multifocal pneumonia, thought to be caused by ESBL E. Coli that grew on a [**5-25**] tracheal aspirate, prior to being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
After his (+) B-glucan and since his clinical picture was worsening he underwent BAL to assess for fungal PNA which resulted in his respiratory failure on [**6-8**].
BAL cultures subsequently grew 2 strains of resistant pseudomonas, sensitive to Tobramycin and Zosyn, antibiotics were changed accordingly.
The patient's clinical picture continued to improve dramatically but CXR continued to show diffuse patchy alveolar opacities in the right upper zone, right infrahilar region, and in the left upper> mid zones as well as worsening of existing left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
On the floor, pulmonary continued to follow him, and CXR's showed continued radiographic resolution of his pneumonia that corellated with an improving clinical picture.
This was thought to be due to chronic GVHD of the lung and ensuing bronchiectasis.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt's repiratoty failure was felt to be secondary to components of bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
Also on differential was progression of multifocal pneumonia and acute CHF exacerbation.
He tolerated non-invasives on the night of [**6-8**] but had to be intubated to AC on [**6-9**] because of respiratory failure with difficulty ventilating, increased work of breathing and rising PCO2.
Patient continued to be on AC and [**6-11**] a trial of PSV 15/PEEP 5 was done which patient tolerated well for several hours.
The reason for failure was thought to be a combination of his COPD (needing PEEP), moderate to large amount of secretions because of his ongoing PNA and persistent pulmonary edema.
On [**6-15**] he was taken of non-invasives and continued to tolerate high flow O2 during the day, requiring BiPAP 11/5 only at night because of prolonged work of breathing causing him to tire and hypercapnia secondary to this.
He initially did well, however on [**6-23**] he was apneic in the morning with a depressed mental status.
His respiratory failure remained well controlled throughout the rest of his hospital stay.
#Pain control:  A CT scan performed on admission showed a new sternum fracture and several compression fractures from chronic steroid use.
The chronic pain service was consulted, and he was slowly titrated up on methadone tid to a final dose of 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] and 7.5 mg at noon.
#Cellulitis:  He completed his previous course of linezolid for cellulitis during this hospitalization.
#Anti-coagulation:  The patient has a history of PE's and bilateral DVTs that have been present since [**Month (only) 956**].
His Lovenox was held initially on admission due to profuse bleeding from his right leg ulcer.
The bleeding was controlled, although he did have one other episode of bleeding from the right leg after he was transferred from the ICU to the floor.
Repeat lower extremity ultrasounds showed no change in his DVTs since [**Month (only) **].
He was continued on lovenox for the remainder of his admission, but at a dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **] which is lower than the normal treatment dose for DVTs due to his propensity .
# CML/Chronic GVHD:  We continued his home prednisone 10mg daily and Cellcept 500mg twice daily.
On [**6-28**], it was felt that his continued O2 requirement may have been due to GVHD of the lung, and he was pulsed with 40mg of prednisone for 2 days with a taper.
#Hematuria - The patient had hematuria that resolved spontaneously after he came to the floor from the ICU.
Infectious disease was consulted, and they did not recommend that this be treated given that his symptoms had resolved spontaneously.
#Urinary retention - upon discontinuation of the foley, the patient had some urinary retention and was unable to void.
Worsening infection, post-procedure increased inflammatory response and relative adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steroids, not started on stress dose pre-procedure) may have all contributed in the acute setting.
He was started on hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6h for stress presumed adrenal insuficiency.
#Hypertension:  The patient carries a diagnosis of hypertension but in the setting of hypotension his anti-hypertensives were held.
On [**6-13**] SBP was consistently in the 130-180s and metoprolol 25mg TID was started ([**11-19**] pt's reg dose), BP remained high and on [**6-14**] metoprolol was increased to 50mg TID.
No source of bleeding was found and hemolysis labs were negative.
His Hct continued to increase steadily w/o intervention.
#RLE rash:  Pt developed RLE rash, on [**6-15**], that was erythematous and warm.
Thought to be a new cellulitis as pt is prone to skin infections because of his GVHD.
He  remained afebrile w/ stable WBC and was started on Vancomycin for empiric treatment of MRSA cellulitis as recommended by ID.
# Transaminitis: Patient had AST, ALT, AP and LDH that were mildly elevated from previous measurements.
MRI liver negative for acute process.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia secondary to pseudomonas Secondary: Graft vs. host disease Stem cell transplant   Discharge Condition: Good, stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a cough and shortness of breath and found to have a pneumonia.
This pneumonia was an extremely severe one caused by E. Coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and you had to be intubated in the intensive care unit for this.
While at [**Hospital1 **], you will have to continue to work hard at your pulmonary rehabilitation, including using the acappella valve and incentive spirometry, and getting up and moving about as much as you can.
During your stay, you also had some bleeding from your urinary tract.
You also were having some trouble urinating, requiring straight catherization to relieve the urine.
Your pain was also an issue while you were here.
You were also diagnosed with a new sternal fracture in addition to your compression fractures.
At that time you should arrange to have your reclast injection, which is a once yearly injection.
