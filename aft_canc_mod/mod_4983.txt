He has poor appetite and refuses most meals.
CT head showed "lytic bone lesions in left occiput and right frontal [**Location (un) **] likely represent lytic mets.
Pending reformations, but no obvious intracranial extension.
No acute intracranial process."
Review of sytems: Difficult to obtain due to dysarthria.
Denied any headache, chest pain.

Right frontal and left basilar occiput lytic metastatic lesions without intra-articular extension.
Minimal soft tissue thickening at the level of cricoid and thyroid cartilage likely represents vocal cords, although further evaluation in this region is limited due to presence of the tube.
A small area of ill-defined density anterior to the endotracheal tube just below the level of vocal cord (301B, 70) may represent synechia or scar tissue or secretion.
Left cervical soft tissue thickening with adjacent fat stranding may represent post-surgical and radiation therapy change in this region.
Partial strap muscle resection and submental surgical clips evident on the left.
Partial visualization of a large right chest wall mass extending into right lung with multifocal osseous metastasis.
Multilevel degenerative disease in the cervical spine, concurrent metastasis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course by problem:  Respiratory Failure secondary to difficulty protecting airway from oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: Intially treated for pneumonia and ruled out for PE.
Echo was also performed as well which showed normal systolic function suggesting a non-cardiogenic cause.
He was noted to have very thick and purulent secretions from his upper airway and his respiratory failure was felt to be secondary to mucous plugging.
Has some blood loss from tumor, esophageal candidiasis.
Acute renal failure: Pre-renal azotemia initially that resolved with IVF.
Metastatic Squamous Cell CA: Per [**Hospital1 2177**] oncologist no further care that patient could tolerate or would be a candidate for.
Secondary to malignancy vs bony mets.
Latent TB: History of positive PPD at [**Hospital1 2177**].
FEN: Dubhoff placed during inbutation to allow for gastric access and patient was transitioned from TPN to tube feeds.
Tube feeds were eventually stopped due to exacerbation of diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions: You were treated for your difficulty breathing due to your metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and clostridium difficile colitis.
You were ruled out for active tuberculosis and did require a breathing tube as we sorted out whether any further treatment for your cancer was possible.
After discussing with you that no further treatment was available for your cancer, the breathing tube was removed and your care was transitioned to hospice care with a goal of treating any breathing difficulty with oxygen, good oral care, and pain medications.
