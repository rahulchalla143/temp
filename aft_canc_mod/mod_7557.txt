CT HEAD [**2156-8-31**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right thalamic hemorrhage, now with a small amount of intraventricular extension.
CT HEAD [**2156-9-2**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right posterior internal capsule and thalamic hemorrhage.
MRI/A: FINDINGS: MRI: There is no short interval change with regard to the left thalamic hemorrhage, measuring 27 x 23 mm in an axial projection.
Moderate mass effect with distortion of the third ventricle and minimal midline shift is stable in appearance.
Mild extension into the ventricular system is seen with blood products layering in both posterior horns.
However, size and configuration of the ventricles is stable and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The hemorrhage has expected perilesional edema; it is not associated with territorial infarct.
3D time-of-flight, T2 images and contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE sequences do not suggest an associated DVA or vascular malformation.
The bleeding displays expected intrinsic T1 hyperintensity but there is no additional contrast enhancement that might suggest an underlying mass.
An additional focus of susceptibility is seen in the right parieto-occipital junction, likely representing a focus of prior microbleed.
There is no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement.
There is no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
No progression of right thalamic hemorrhage with discrete interventricular extension and blood products layering in the bilateral posterior horns.
No new hydrocephalus.
No evidence of associated mass or vascular malformation.
An additional focus of susceptibility in the right parieto-occipital junction, likely representing previous microbleed.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 90894**] [**Known lastname 90895**]-[**Known lastname 90896**] is a 46 yo woman with PMHx significant for borderline HTN (SBP of 135's) who presented from an OSH with a thalamic hemorrhage.
[] Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage - The patient had a R thalamic IPH.
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was a potential etiology, but her imaging was not entirely consistent with this.
There was no evidence of vascular abnormality and no history or external signs suggesting malignancy.
Her initial leukocytosis resolved quickly, suggesting a potential spurious laboratory finding.
She remained normotensive and without any worsening of her symptoms or examination.
She may not fly for at least 10 days, aroudn [**9-10**]  [] Cardiac - EKG showed no signs of LVH, so we got an echo to help determine if she had any systemic signs of hypertension.
The echo showed no major abnormalities.
She did have elevated diastolic BP before she left and we started Hydrocholorothiazide at 25mg daily.
[] Leukocytosis - WBC on admission 26, quickly trending down to 9.
She remained afebrile throughout this admission.
NO PENDING STUDIES  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: [ ] She needs a repeat MRI/MRA in 1 month to evaluate the possibility of a vascular malformation/cavernoma underlying the hemorrhage.
Neurologic - Awake, alert, oriented, speech fluent, left arm and leg mild weakness.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 90897**],  You were seen in the hospital because you had a bleed in your brain.
The bleed caused you to have some left-sided weakness, for which you will need rehabilitation to get stronger.
We suspect that the bleed was either related to a vascular malformation (a cavernoma) or high blood pressure.
However, your blood pressure has not been elevated and has not required medication while you were here in the hospital.
For safety, please do not fly until after [**2156-9-10**] due to your recent hemorrhage.
