There is no sign for the presence of a visible intracranial mass lesion.
Both studies show slightly asymmetric atrophy of the cerebellum, more evident in the region of the right cerebellar hemisphere.
In any case, visualization of the MR- described cavernous hemangioma would be extremely difficult, given its reported small size and typically limited visibility on a noncontrast head CT scan.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures show no additional abnormalities.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2132-4-3**] 8:11 AM CT ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS: The main right and left, lobar and proximal segmental pulmonary arteries are widely patent and appear normal, no evidence of acute pulmonary embolus.
At the peripheral segmental level the contrast opacification is slightly suboptimal.
Small right posterior basal pleural effusion.
Partial atelectasis of the medial segment of the right middle lobe.
Patchy consolidation in the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe also patchy airspace consolidation in the posterior portion of left lower lobe.
There is associated increased ground-glass attenuation in these areas more marked on the left lung.
Differential possibilities include aspirational pneumonia.
Minor area of residual localized pneumothorax in the central medial thorax.
No bone lesions demonstrated.
No acute pulmonary embolus demonstrated.
Extensive patchy consolidation in the left lung and posterior aspect of the remaining right lower lobe with associated ground-glass attenuation in those areas.
Differential considerations include aspiration pneumonia possibly with some associated and asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Small localized right posterior basal pleural effusion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2132-4-8**] 11:02 AM The patient is status post partial resection of the right lung with volume loss and a persistent small right apical pneumothorax.
There are bibasilar areas of consolidation, left greater than right, which appear worsened in the interval.
Small right pleural effusion is without change.
Small right apical pneumothorax.
[**Doctor Last Name **]/vf Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 111712**]  4 R/L LOWER PARATRACHEAL,2 R UPPER PARATRACHEAL,7 DIAGNOSIS: I.  Parietal pleura (A): Fragments of lung and pleura with focal fibrosis.
Note:  Sections show a monotypic population of atypical spindled and epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli, arranged in nodules and small nests.
This immunophenotype supports the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.
Bronchial and vascular margins with no malignancy.
Lung parenchyma with emphysematous changes and vascular congestion; no malignancy identified.
Lymph node, level 9, pulmonary ligament (S): Two lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/2).
V.  Lymph node, level 10, hilar (T): One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
Lymph node, level 11, interlobar (U): One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
Lymph node, level 12, lobar (V): One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
Part 1 is received fresh in the OR and consists of two fibrofatty fragments measuring 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm in aggregate.
The bronchial margin is identified and submitted en face for frozen section and carries a frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7108**] of: "Bronchial margin, negative for malignancy".
The bronchial margin frozen section is submitted entirely in K. On the pleural and inferior surface of the specimen approximately 5.5 cm away from the bronchial resection margin is a pleural nodule that is tan-[**Doctor Last Name 352**] in color that measures 3.5 x 2.0 cm and is inked entirely in black.
The specimen is serially sectioned and represented as follows: L = multiple sections of pleural nodule, M = representation of unremarkable lung adjacent to pleural nodule, N-P = additional sections of bronchus and vascular resection margins, Q = multiple areas suggestive of lymph nodes, R = unattached small free floating piece of dark [**Doctor Last Name 352**] tissue contained with lung specimen.

Some tremor episodes somewhat suspicious for seizure.
PE:easily distracted, paucity of speech with poor naming, difficult to engage in activities and amotivational.
+ ataxia on right (may be related to right CBL hemangioma), + cogwheeling on the left.
Very unsteady gait.
