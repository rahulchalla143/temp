he was seen by his wife's PCP on day of admission, and was found to have CHF by CXR.
The patient was sent to [**Hospital3 3583**] ED and found to be hypertensive to 211/90 with EKG changes of inferior and lateral Q waves and ST elevations, 92% on RA, and positive cardiac enzymes (Trop I 0.038 --> 0.210).
He was found to have triple [**Last Name (un) 12599**] disease with mild LAD stenosis (feeding the Cx) so effective LM.
Of note, pt had increased DOE x 2 weeks.
No CP, palpitations.
No fevers/chills, leg edema, orthopnea, PND, high salt intake or change in diet.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with apical akinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD was diffusely diseased and had a 90% stenosis in the mid vessel between moderate sized D1 and D2 branches.
The LCX had a 90% ostial lesion and supplied small OM1 and OM2 branches before terminating in the AV groove.
A moderate sized PDA was subtotally occluded and appeared to fill in part via L->R collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 27 mmHg in the setting of moderate to severe  systemic arterial hypertension.
There was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 50/18/30.
The cardiac output was mildly reduced at 4.3 L/min.
No gradient across the aortic valve was detected.
Left ventriculography was not performed due to the patient's elevated filling pressures and recent non-invasive assessment of his underlying LVEF.
Distal aortography demonstrated moderate distal aortic disease as well as disease in the external iliacs.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Myocardial Infarction: The patient had a large ST elevation MI.
At cath, he was found to have 3VD and markedly elevated filling pressures with a wedge of 27 and moderate pulmonary hypertension and a IABP was placed in hopes that the patient would go the CABG.
Echo on admission revealed severe LV global hypokinesis.
Congestive Heart Failure - Given patients elevated filling pressures and chest x-ray consistent with failure, patient was diuresed in house.
Asystole/Apnea: The patient had his first asystolic pause on [**9-18**] which was a 7 second pause with junctional escape.
This was felt to be a vagal episode as these occurred in the setting of sleep apnea, heavy sedation, and were presence by bradycardia.
During these pauses, he would be awake, bradycardic, his respirations would cease, and would be responsive with a preserved blood pressure.
Since his mental status was unstable and it was felt that he would not be able to corporate with a colonoscopy or EGD, he was taken for a virtual colonoscopy which revealed a thickened area of his sigmoid colon.
By sigmoidoscopy, he had a small polyp that was non-bleeding that likely not responsible for this melana.
He was transfused 1 unit and had an EGD and colonoscopy which showed gastritis and two non-bleeding angioectasias which were cauterized.
In addition, the patient had multiple non bleeding diverticular lesions throughout the colon.
UTI/phimosis/Foley trauma - Patient was seen by urology in house for severe phimosis and a Foley was blindly placed and patient was put on Ciprofloxacin for ten days as UTI prophylaxis.
He then partially removed his Foley catheter and had significant prostate trauma from this.
Urology inserted a second Foley and the patient passed several clots and had a good amount of hematuria.
Mental Status: When the patient was admitted, the patient did not have mental status changes.
However, he became acutely delirious after he returned from his first cath and had a balloon pump in.
Repeat ABGs did not revelad significant hypoxia or hypercarbia.
He continued to wax and wane with his mental status often not oriented to place or time.
This culminated to becoming unresponsive and frequently apneic on the day of his 30 second asystolic pauses.
He no longer needed psychoactive medications or a sitter.
He continues to have slight confusion at night which is improving with time.
However, as his mental status waned, and he had more severe asystolic episodes, he became apneic while awake for episodes for up to 30 seconds.
The patient was tried on BiPap and continued to have apneic pauses.
After the patient received his pacemaker, he did not have any further witnessed events of apnea.
Pneumonia: Several days after admission, the patient was diagnosed with a retrocardiac infiltrate on chest xray.
Following the second intubation, the patient developed a RLL infiltrate though to be due to aspiration.
He will also need to have a follow up chest xray to confirm resolution of his infiltrate.
Acute vs. chronic renal insufficency - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.2, with his baseline unknown.
his creatine steadidly rose to a peak of 2.5 though to be due to intravascular depletion secondary to CHF and contrast nephropathy.
His anemia was though to be due to melana and chronic disease.
