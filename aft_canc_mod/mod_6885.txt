Admission Date:  [**2151-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-4-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-5-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: Transfer s/p Bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 65384**] is a 66 year old woman with a history of metastatic colon cancer s/p colon resection in [**2143**], recurrence in [**2146**] s/p thoracotomy/left lower lobectomy who is transferred to the MICU after a rigid brochoscopy for altered mental status and question of acute CVA.
Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname 65384**] was transfered in [**8-/2150**] here from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with hemoptysis and collapse of the left upper lobe and found to have left main bronchus tumor with surrounding blood clot.
This was debrided using both cryotherapy as well as mechanical debridement.
The left upper lobe was also notable for tumor and was further debrided.
She had been hemoptysis free for 2 months at most after this procedure but reported hemoptysis restarting with her chemotherapy regimen.
She has been having 3-5 episodes of hemoptysis a day, about 1 tsp of pink-tinged sputum each.
She returned to the Chest Disease Center yesterday for further evaluation.
In the bronch suite yesteday, bronchoscopy demonstrated left main stem brochus obstructing necrotic lesion with moderate bleeding.
No intervention was done.
She was transferred to IR for bronchial artery embolization of tumor.
In the IR suite, initial access through right groin was difficult due to bad atherosclerotic disease, so access was re-tried through left groin.
She did have a L groin hematoma extending over abdomen as access was slightly higher than ideal but pt remained HD stable.
She was transferred to the floor with plan for OR on [**4-23**] for rigid bronchoscopy and electric cautery by IP.
She received argon thereapy for several seconds, but this was discontinued when bubbles were seen on TEE in the left atrium with positive pressure ventilation.
Flex bronch did not reveal open blood vessels.
After this ST depressions over 2 mm were noticed on telemetry for approximately 20 minutes, so she was started on a Nitro drip for presumed NSTEMI, running at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
She was extubated at 953 am, but patient was not responding to commands so there was concern for CVA given findings on bubble study.
On transfer to the MICU, patient is awake but unable to phonate, likely due to recent bronch.

Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung could be edema, since the pulmonary vasculature in the right lung is congested, but I am concerned about disseminated tumor with lymphangitic extension.
Mediastinum is shifted into the left chest, therefore displacement of the right heart border to the right of the spine, probably represents interval increase in heart size or pericardial effusion.
No pneumothorax.
ECHO/BUBBLE STUDY: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There was no hemodynamic compromise associated with it.
9:03 AM Argon coagulation commenced and immediately significant amount of air bubbles noted in the left atrium and left ventricle.
This was associated with ST and T wave changes as well as hypotension.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old female with metastatic colon cancer with ongoing hemoptysis, evidence of left mainstem bronchus necrotic lesion on bronch, now s/p IR embolization and rigid bronch with Argon therapy leading to left-sided bubbles on TEE, now transferred to MICU for concern of NSTEMI and CVA.
# Altered mental status: Concern for CVA given positive bubbles on TEE, and question of air emboli to cranial circulation.
# ST depressions: STDs noted on tele peri-bronchoscopy, but 12 lead EKG reassuring.
No baseline for comparison.
Patient without known CAD history.
Asymptomatic, but given DM could be at risk for silent ischemia.
ABG with excellent oxygenation, with acute acidosis and hypercarbia.
Likely due to recent procedure and poor ventilation.
# Hypotension: Baseline SBP on the floor 80s to 100s, maintained pressures of SBP ~80 while in the ICU post procedure.
# Hemoptysis: Left mainstem bronchus necrotic lesion likely representating metastatic disease, s/p IR embolization and rigid bronch with argon therapy.
Her hemoptysis improved significantly post procedure, with only small amounts of blood tinged sputum being coughed up at the time of discharge.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable without back pain suggestive of an RP bleed.
Her hematocrit remained stable, and the groin hematoma improved and was soft with overlaying ecchymosis at the time of discharge.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Followed at [**Location (un) 8641**], on irinotecan, will continue outpatient follow up.
# Anxiety/insomnia: Continued lorazepam.
# GERD: Continued famotidine.
