No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the apex, apical and mid portions of the inferior and inferoseptal walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%).
RV function is mildly depressed.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RV function is mildly depressed.
Mild mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation persist.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was short with mild plaquing.
D1 had a proximal tubular 65% in a large vessel.
The LCX was heavily calcified and had a proximal 60% stenosis before giving rise to a large OM2.
OM2 had 60% stenoses in the main vessel prior to and separately after a branch vessel (the brnach having its own 60% stenosis at the origin).
The AV groove LCX had a 50% stenosis just after OM2.
The RCA was heavily calcified (with calcification of the right coronary cusp) and had a near-ostial 70% stenosis before proximal 70%, mid 75% tubular, and distal diffuse 40% stenoses.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left-ventricular filling pressures with an LVEDP of 13 mmHg, and systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 155/78 mmHg.
No gradient was seen across the aortic valve on left-heart pullback.
Left ventriculography was deferred given mild renal insufficiency.
Ground-glass opacity involving most of the right upper lobe corresponding to the abnormality on radiograph is with other smaller foci as above is most likely related to pneumonia or pneumonitis(including aspiration).
The differential diagnosis is broad but includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema given hx of recent MI.
No concerning arterial enhancing lesions displaying washout noted within the liver.
Small non-specific arterial enhancing foci within the right lobe are likely perfusional can be followed up with a repeat CT or MRI in 6 months.
These are most concerning for possibility of multifocal pheochromocytomas and correlation with serum markers is recommended.
Additionally, given the multifocality, the patient should be evaluated for possible syndromic associations (such as MEN 2).
Differential includes hypervascular lipid poor adenomas or hypervascular metastases but the latter is less likely given the lack of any primary tumor noted within the abdomen or chest.
Recommend endocrine evaluation of adrenal nodules.
Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic calcification within the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal aorta as detailed above.
There is no significant calcification within the ascending aorta for pre-operative CABG planning.
Brief Hospital Course: 62yoM with HTN, DLP, DM presenting with symptomatic bradycardia in the 30's in the setting of third degree heart block with ventricular escape rhythm and presenting with NSTEMI whose hospital course included cardiac cath showing triple vessel disease requiring Cardiac surgery evaluation and subsequent CABG.
During pre-op evaluation, found to have adrenal lesions concerning for metastatic disease versus pheochromacytoma.
============= [**Hospital 662**] HOSPITAL COURSE: [**2185-12-28**] - [**2186-1-4**] ================ # Coronary Artery Disease/CAD: Patient presented with NSTEMI and had cardiac catherization on [**2185-12-28**] showing multivessel disease.
# Adrenal nodules: As part of pre-op evaluation, cardiac surgery requested a CT abdomen given history of hepatitis C. On CT, adrenal nodules were found with specific concern for pheochromacytoma versus metastatic disease.
# Chronic Hepatitis C: Hepatology was consulted prior to surgery for any pre-operative recommendations.
Anxiety appeared to contribute slightly to hypertension.
# DM:  Patient's blood sugars were not controlled during admission with last A1c 9.8.
#CARDIAC: Experienced episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on postoperative day three.
Given history of complete heart block, EP was consulted and recommended that Amiodarone be avoided.
Rate control and management of his atrial tachycardia should be with beta blockade only.
No further episodes of atrial fibrillation were noted for the remainder of his hospital stay.
No neurologic complications noted.
Over several days, the erythema and white count improved.
