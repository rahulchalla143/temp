Stable appearance of the large right lung opacity, and right-sided chest wall increase density with several right-sided ribs periosteal reaction consistent with known extensive mesothelioma.
The left lung demonstrates multiple nodular opacities consistent with metastatic disease, unchanged when compared to prior study.
No evidence for intracranial metastatic disease.
Evidence for small chronic right insular infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yo woman with history of metastatic mesothelioma recently s/p cycle 2 of Alimta chemotherapy initially presented with SIRS/sepsis with fever and hypotension requiring volume resuscitation and pressor therapy; now called out from MICU, hemodynamically stable and initially on broad spectrum antibiotics without focal infectious source to date, being treated for ongoing n/v.
Hypotension (thought intially to be sepsis): Pt initially admitted to ICU and was thought to have sepsis supported at presentation by fever, leukopenia, hypotension requiring volume resuscitation and pressor therapy.
It may well have been transient bacteremia in setting of recent chemotherapy, mucositis, and bacterial translocation across the gut mucosa.
We discontinued cefipime and vanco given afebrile without specific source ever identified, and vital signs remained stable.
Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea- Pt initially sent with severe nausea and vomiting which was likely due to side effect of recent chemotherapy.
Both nausea and vomiting were under better control with compazine.
Still awaiting final stool studies result.
Rash: Pt was found to have rash on presentation.
This was thought likely associated with chemo as pt had similar rash [**2-17**] to cycle #1.
Metastatic Mesothelioma  Pt was not treated while inpatient.
Neuro: vague h/o arm shaking when waking up from sleep while in ICU.
Per report there was no real seizure activity, though patient convinced she had a seizure.
MRI of the head was obtained and showed no focal lesion that could cause seizures.
No further episodes occured while in the hospital.
Depression/ anxiety- Pt with continued symptoms at night of anxiety requesting klonapin.
She did receive heparin for a 1-2 days of hospitalization, but had decreased platelets and the heparin was stopped.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Acetaminophen-Codeine 300-30 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for rib pain.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
