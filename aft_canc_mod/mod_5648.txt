He has hx of obesity hypoventilation, pickwikian syndrome, COPD which may all have contributed.
COPD or CHF exacerbation or possible viral illness could also have contributed to acute worsening of chronic hypercarbia.
Overall goal was to prevent the need to intubate him, as he had a difficult airway and would need fiber-optic intubation.
A-line was placed to monitor ABGs (patient was chronically hypercarbic and hypoxic) and he was given nebulizers PRN wheezing.
CXR was difficult to read but was not suggestive of any infectious process and he was not put on antibiotics.
<br>HTN: Patient had a history of hypertension treated with isosorbite mononitrate.
He was diuresed with lasix 80mg IV BID as well as diamox because of his persistently elevated bicarb level.
When he began to show signs of dryness (bumping Cr from 1.0 to 1.5 and dry on physical exam), lasix, diamox and lisinopril were temporarily held.
CAD/CHF: Patient was stable and denied any chest pain on admission.
Given discussions with his PCP and the dangers of extended continuation of this medication without followup given the patient's repeated noncompliance, he will only be given a short course of the coumadin which he can renew with PCP secondary to compliance with outpatient [**Hospital 263**] clinic.
Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Patient had a history of diabetes [**2-10**] pituitary adenoma, originally requiring insulin but after treatment of tumor the diabetes had then been controlled on diet alone.
While hospitalized, he was kept on insulin SS and a heart healthy diet.
