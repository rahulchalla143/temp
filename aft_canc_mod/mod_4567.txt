The patient was in his usual state of health, with chronic abdominal pain, and was seen today in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a third round of chemotherapy.
While sitting in the chair in the waiting room, he felt his heart beat "fast."
There he was found to have SVT to 180s and was sent to the ED.
He denies any chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea, or vomiting.
At baseline, he ambulates independently and without dyspnea on exertion.
Of note, he also denies noticing any lower extremity edema, fevers, chills, diarrhea, constipation, melena or BRBPR.
He endorses ~30lb weight loss over the course of 3 months.
He remained persistantly tachycardic to 120s and so a CTA was done that showed bilateral subsegmental PEs.
Notably, he was recently hospitalized ([**Date range (1) 84012**]) for BRBPR s/p colonoscopy significant for segmental colitis with biopsies suggestive of ischemic vs infectious colitis.
On that admission, he developed a fever 2 days and CT scan showed likely colitis; he was treated with Cipro, Flagyl, and Asacol (which was discontinued recently by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9916**].
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness.

Bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism without evidence of right heart strain.
Nodular mural atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta with configuration worrisome for future embolization.
Hypoenhancing infiltrative hepatic mass extending into the porta hepatis and left hepatic lobe compatible with known cholangiocarcinoma.
Associated biliary obstruction again noted.
Increasing ascites with persistent multiple nodular peritoneal implants.
Persistent pancreatic ductal dilation.
It is outside the heart and anatomically could be associated with the esophagus or the surrounding structures.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Very small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Probable extracardiac posterior mediastinal mass.
The extracardiac mass was not appreciated on the prior study.
Ultrasound LE: Occlusive DVT in one of the two right posterior tibial veins.
No other thrombus noted.

# Pulmonary Embolism / DVT: Patient was started on heparin gtt for bilateral subsegmental PE noted on CTA and DVT on LENI then switched to lovenox SQ.
She had IVC filter placed today due to hx of GI bleed and the risk of bleeding with anticoagulation.
She tolerated the procedure well and had no signs of bleeding.
History of BRBPR / ischemic colitis: Sigmoidoscopy [**12-23**] sig for biopsies consistent with ischemic colitis though patient was also treated for possible infectious colitis.
He was recently seen by his outpatient GI doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9916**], who stopped his Asacol and has sent off stool cx for E. coli and c diff which were negative.
Has had episodes of AVNRT/AVRT in the past controlled by metoprolol/amiodarone though these have been held since last admission, given concern for bleed.
Metoprolol was restarted on [**2188-1-18**] at higher dose at 25mg TID and was started on diltiazen 30mg QID (will change to long acting prior to discharge) for rate control.
Pt had short runs, only a few seconds of sinus tachycardia, asymptomatic.
She also had aggressive electrolytes control.
Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma: Preliminary read is concerning for progression of metastatic disease, increase size of hepatic mass, and worsening ascites.
Prior CT scan notable for sclerotic lesion in sacrum.
Prior head CT w/ multiple subcentimeter low density regions (likely small vessel disease) and no evidence of obvious mets.
Pt also has increase in abdominal girth and fluid shift on exam consistant with ascitis.
# PPx: Pain control with dilaudid prn, bowel regimen, DVT PPx lovenox .
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea, anxiety.
