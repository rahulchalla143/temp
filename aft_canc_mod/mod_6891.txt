His oncologic history began in [**2101-3-27**] when he developed severe right gluteal pain with workup revealing destructive lesions in the right ilium, right sacral area, and left ilium, as well as a left renal mass.
Fine needle aspiration and core biopsy of a right posterior iliac lesion in [**2101-5-27**] revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He had evidence of tumor thrombus in the left renal vein and IVC.
The torso CT showed bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and hilar adenopathy.
He began high-dose IL-2 therapy on [**2101-8-29**], receiving 13 of 14 doses week 1, and 8 of 14 doses week 2, complicated by toxic encephalopathy, shock and shoulder pain.
