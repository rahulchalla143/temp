Postoperatively, she had some chest tightness and a cardiac workup ensued.
An echo was done that revealed a mass on the non- coronary cusp of the aortic valve that measured approximately 1.3cm and was confirmed by TEE.
A stress MIBI was also done at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] which was negative for ischemia.
She was afebrile and serial blood cultures done to r/o endocarditis were negative, however she was given prophylactic IV antibiotics.
She was cared for by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] who is of the opinion that the mass is a fibroelastoma, given the location of the tumor and lack of clinical symptoms of endocarditis.
It has been recommended that this tumor be removed to prevent a thromboembolic event and the patient has been referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgery.
During her hospitalization she was noted to have ventricular ectopy/trigeminy but did not have any sustained arrhythmias.
She denies any chest pain or dyspnea.

Interval increase in the retrocardiac density reflects increased left lower lung atelectasis.
Atelectasis is present at the right lung base and unchanged since prior study.
There are no discrete lung opacities concerning for pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the operating room on [**2149-11-20**] where the patient underwent removal of aortic valve mass.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD #3 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
