He presented on [**2-22**] with lethargy, disorientation, and fever to 105 with abdominal pain after his roommate called EMS.
Blood cultures grew E.coli bacteremia and he developed septic shock and was admitted to the ICU.
He also had NSTEMI in setting of his sepsis with peak troponin 37.88 on [**2-24**].
Echo showed EF 25-30% with severe global LV HK.
There was also concern for worsening RLE ischemia on pressors vs. true graft thrombosis.
Procedure notable for somewhat difficult to remove gallbladder with some resultant bleeding in gallbladder fossa.
Post op noted to have increasing amylase (to 551) and lipase (to 288).
Also developed fever to 100.8.
Speaking with patient's wife, she notes a change in mental status since extubation.
No noted weakness in UEs/LEs.
Past Medical History: - Severe PVD s/p multiple bypass surgeries of LEs (L femoral to above knee bypass [**2115**], R external iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass [**2115**] and R common iliac to above knee [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass [**2116**]) and carotids (L CEA [**2115**]).
- HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Polysubstance abuse including EtOH and cocaine, ?others - ?COPD - Motorcycle accident resulting in need for reconstructive surgery of L jaw.
Physical Exam: General: Alert but somewhat lethargic at times, no distress.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL, MMM, appears to have some thrush on posterior tongue.
Poor dentition with most teeth missing.
L CEA scar.
RUQ port incision had been draining small amount serous fluid, no purulence or bleeding.
Old healed RLQ scar from bypass.
Soft, appears to be diffusely tender, non-distended, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
Facial asymmetry with ?droop of L lower face, though appears c/w past trauma and asymmetric tooth loss.
Initially ?very mild L ptosis and inability to raise L eyebrow, but able to do so later in exam.
Of LLE, [**5-12**] in dorsi/plantar flexing, but will not move rest of muscle groups.
[**4-11**]+/5 intrinsic hand muscles.
Unable to look for pronator drift or asterixis due to lack of patient participation.
This is felt to be a reactive thrombocytosis due to the combined effects of: multiple recent surgeries, and also possibly post alcohol abuse thrombocytopenia recovery.
ESR and CRP were checked and are elevated supporting this etiology.
will need evaluation by hematology to rule out underlying ET or PV by peripheral smear review and or bone marrow biopsy.
Here thre were no stigmata or symptoms of thrombotic complication of this thrombocytosis (uncommon in reactive thrombocytosis) and aspirin 325 mg was started for combined effect of platelet inhibition and secondary prevention given known cad and nstemi suffered at outside hospital prior to admission here.

Medications: Cetacaine topical spray Monitored anesthesia care  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: Normal major papilla Cannulation:  Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed in order to place a PD stent to facilitate biliary cannulation.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
Biliary Tree: A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 9-10 mm.
There was no extravasation of contrast seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka.
A small amount of biliary sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx balloon catheter.
Pancreas: A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main pancreatic duct.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main pancreatic duct.
A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 9-10 mm.
There was no extravasation of contrast seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka.
A small amount of biliary sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx balloon catheter.
Recommend MRCP to evaluate his dilated pancreatic duct.

# Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.
If HCV genotype on patient's sample is desired, please contact       laboratory at ext.
Clinically, he had no abdominal pain, n/v, jaundice, fevers.
# Septic shock/bacteremia.
Shock resolved and normotensive with no evidence of poor perfusion; note - pt.
leg BKA prior to admission for ischemia of the rt.
LE and remaining rt LE without any evidence of diminished perfusion (warm, good capillary refil, no pallor or dusky appearance, no pain other than some tenderness at the rt.
Treatment for bacteremia continued with meropenem, and course was completed on [**2117-3-9**].
# Altered mental status consistent with delerium.
Likely due to combined effects of illness and narcotic medications.
He required some parenteral haldol for agitation while in the intensive care unit.
Very elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of hypotension/sepsis, though patient with bad PVD (thus likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.
ECG with inferior Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission though unclear exactly how old.
After ERCP, aspirin was started - his aspirin allergy is GERD only, so a PPI was added for prophylaxis and protection.
Unclear if was graft or arterial thrombus formation vs. global effects of pressors.
CT abdomen obtained and seemed to show graft thrombosis.
# Polysubstance abuse.
No evidence for withdrawal.
# Thrombocytosis.
From recent infection and acute stressors most likely.
