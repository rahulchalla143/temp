There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is no VSD.
Other than some left basal linear atelectasis the lungs appear clear and without evidence of pneumothorax, edema, effusions, or lymphadenopathy.
No osseous abnormalities are noted.
[**2-17**]: Heart size, mediastinal width and pulmonary vascularity remain normal.
Worsening patchy and linear opacities at both lung bases, favoring atelectasis over infectious pneumonia and accompanied by small pleural effusions.
There is minimal streaky density bilaterally consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as before.
There is new blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus with hazy increased density in the lower left chest.
IMPRESSION: Evidence for development of small left effusion.
No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or abnormal enhancement.
Low signal within the bony structures due to marrow infiltrative process or hypoplasia.
Colonic wall thickening/edema more marked along right colon than the left, similar to 3 days ago, but with increased thickening/edema of terminal ileum.
Findings are non-specific, more likely infectious or inflammatory, but given new AML, if the patient is undergoing treatment, typhlitis is possible.
Otherwise inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's could also be considered.
Prominent right lower quadrant mesenteric lymph nodes.
Increased ascites and third-spacing compared to three days prior.
Splenic infarct as first imaged on [**2187-2-13**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Unchanged liver hypodensities, left adrenal nodule, presacral perirectal multilobulated endometriomas.
Persistent cecal and terminal ileum wall thickening is again seen although slightly improved compared to prior CT.along the most prominent in the right colon, involving the cecum and proximal ascending colon with involvement of the terminal ileum.
Increased now moderated size pleural effusions with associated lower lobe atelectasis.
Persistent wedge-shaped hypodensity in the spleen consistent with an infarct.
Stable presacral and perirectal partially cystic lesion previously characterized as endometriomas.

SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS: INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA WITH MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION, SEE NOTE.
Note: Please correlate with cytogenetic findings.
Morphologically and immunophenotypically, this is in keeping with acute monoblastic leukemia (FAB subtype M5a).
The white blood cell count appears markedly increased, and consists predominantly of large cells with moderate amounts of pale blue cytoplasm, including some with granules, round to indented nuclei, [**Doctor Last Name **] open chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of several hypercellular spicules consisting primarily of monoblasts and promonocytes with morphology similar to that seen in the peripheral smear.
Megakaryocytes are present in  decreased numbers; abnormal forms are not seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 1.5 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone.
Overall cellularity is estimated to be greater than 90%, and largely consists of large atypical cells morphologically consistent with blasts.
Residual hematopoietic elements are scant.
Touch prep adds no additional information.
No sideroblasts or ringed sideroblasts are seen however these are difficult to assess due to the scant numbers of erythroid precursors present.
Location: INPATIENT   Cell culture was established to provide metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
A normal MLL FISH finding can result from absence of a MLL rearrangement, from a variant MLL rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate.
Erythrocytes appear decreased in number, are mildly hypochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including bite cells, echinocytes, acanthocytes, dacrocytes, and microcytes.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate and consists of several hypocellular spicules composed of stromal cells, histiocytes, plasma cells, and lymphocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate and consists of a 1.1 cm core of trabecular bone.
The remainder is composed of stromal cells, macrophages, and background eosinophilic material consistent with ablative chemotherapy.
Location: INPATIENT    Cell culture was established to provide metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
-------FOCUSED ANALYSIS--------  KARYOTYPE: 46,XX[6]  INTERPRETATION: No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 6 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
This study does not represent a full cytogenetic analysis of 20 cells due to poor growth of the specimen in culture.
A limited panel is performed to look for residual disease.
INTERPRETATION The findings are suspicious for increased blasts.
However, this small population of blasts cannot be further distinguished, due to lack of unique markers.
The differential diagnosis includes residual/blasts relapse of leukemia vs regenerating myeloblasts.

Rare mature lymphocytes.
Brief Hospital Course: 50-year-old woman with HTN and hyperlipidemia here with hyperleukocytosis with WBC 250,000 with smear suggesting of acute myeloid leukemia.
# Acute Monoblastic Leukemia: presented with one week of muscle aches, neck tenderness, several bruises, and fever, found to have WBC 233,000, and bone marow biopsy showing acute monoblastic leukemia (FAB subtype M5a) with monocytic differentiation.
Treated with 7+3 regimen (cytarabine and idarubicin) with significant complications of prolonged neutropenic fever, typhlitis, mucositis, all discussed separately.
D28 BM biopsy, however, was concerning for increased blasts, but could not be further analyzed due to lack of markers.
# CNS Involvement: Concern for CNS involvement of disease partly due to perceived mental status changes although in context of significant pain and medication.
LP showed no specific malignant cells but a high monocyte count felt to be concerning for leptomeningeal spread of disease.
# Febrile Neutropenia/VRE Bacteremia: Admitted ([**2-4**]) with fever to 101.7 which rose to 103.2 on day #2 and peaked at 104.9 on [**2-10**].
No source of infection was initially found, and she was empirically treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime and fluconazole but continued to spike.
She developed significant typhlitis (discussed below) which was felt to be a possible source of infection, and then blood cultures on [**2-25**] grew out VRE in [**2-15**] bottles.
She was afebrile for 3 days prior to discharge.
# Typhlitis (pseudomembranous enterocolitis): Developed severe abdominal pain after becoming neutropenic.
CT abdomen/pelvis significant for colonic wall thickening/edema suggestive of typhilitis in the setting of treatment for AML.
Developed peritoneal signs on exam including significant rebound tenderness.
Resolved gradually with rising ANC and patient's diet was slowly advanced.
# Mucocitis: Patient developed severe Grade III mucositis as she became neutropenic.
# Hypertension: Patient with a history of hypertension on atenolol and lisinopril at home.
Lisinopril was initially held due to the risk of renal failure during the initial treatement course and atenolol was switched to [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol due to ease of dosing control.
She remaind hypertensive across much of her admission with difficulty controlling BPs on a range of medications.
She was transferred back to the ICU briefly for hypertensive urgency in the context of severe pain from typhlitis.
No evidence of end organ damage by history or exam.
BPs improved with increased pain control but she remained hypertensive across most of the remainder of her hospitalization.
Her pressures normalized during the final three days of her hospitalization with amlodipine on top of an increased doses of her home beta blocker and her regular home lisinopril.
# Hyperleukocytosis: Patient presented with one week of muscle aches, neck tenderness, several bruises, and fever, found to have WBC 233,000 concerning for acute leukemia.
# ARF: Developed ARF on second day of hospitalization with creatinine rising to 2.0 from 1.0 on admission.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Developed hypoxic respiratory distress [**2-13**] fluid overload in context of significant IVF given for ARF and DIC previous mentioned.
No intubation.
Small pleural effusion noted on imaging close to discharge.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Brief rise in conjugated bilirubin in the setting of fevers concerning for obstructive process although with normal LFTs.
RUQ U/S showed sludge but no evidence of cholelithiasis/cholangitis.
# Splenic Infarct: Incidentally found on CT scan, unclear age and etiology.
# Radiographic Abnormalities for Outpatient Follow-Up: In addition to the splenic infarct CTs and MRIs showed persistent liver hypodensities (previously seen on imaging), a left adrenal nodule, and presacral perirectal multilobulated endometriomas previously seen on MR in [**2185-3-17**].
