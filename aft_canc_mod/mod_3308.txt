Admission Date:  [**2107-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-4-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for evaluation of left piriform sinus mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest Tubes Surgical Biopsy Gastric Tube Tracheostomy Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 71M with multiple medical problems including a 59 pack year smoking history, 45 year alcoholic hx and CABG, recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **] for pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, now transferred from the same hospital for work-up for a left piriform sinus mass, after presenting with difficulty swallowing.
Patient reports gradual dysphagia for 5 months, first to solids, later to liquids.
Subsequent to this dysphagia, the patient experienced a 45 pound weight loss over the past 5 months.
He denied hematemesis, chest pain, sob, palpitations, abd pain, hematuria or dysuria.
CT of the neck at [**Hospital3 **] showed a 3.6 cm mass in the L piriform sinus.
An EGD was unable to be completed due to severe esophageal stricture.
A modified barium study showed achalasia and severe esophageal narrowing.
The patient's course there was additionally complicated by hypertension requiring IV meds, given his intolerance for PO.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Hypertension Coronary Artery Disease, s/p CABG x 5 Permanent Pacemaker for ?sick sinus/tachy brady Peripheral Vascular Disease (AAA s/p repair) COPD Spontaneous Pneumothorax s/p chest tube Colon Cancer s/p resection in approximately [**2102**]   Social History: Patient is not married.
There is the large pneumothorax on the right with total collapse of the right lower lobe, partial collapse of the left middle lobe and the right upper lobe.
There has not been a significant shift in the mediastinum however.
There are no previous films for comparison.
A right pneumothorax is no longer apparent.
There is interval increase in subcutaneous emphysema on that side.
There is interval decrease in a small right effusion.
A bipolar transvenous pacemaker remains in place.
There is no pneumothorax.
In addition, free-flowing bilateral pleural effusions are increased.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax.
Increased effusions and right lower lobe opacity.
There are no perfusion defects seen in the rest images.
CT Neck ([**2107-7-27**]): FINDINGS: There is an ill-defined, heterogeneous, enhancing mass filling the left piriform sinus with the bulk centered at the C5 level on the lateral scout film.
This mass extends into the left tonsillar space and has several central areas of hypodensity consistent with necrosis.
There is associated narrowing and compression of the airway at the level of the hyoid bone and more inferiorly at the valleculae.
The inferior portion of the mass abuts the superior aspect of the thyroid gland.
There is no associated neck pathologic lymphadenopathy.
There is diffuse atherosclerotic calcification at the aortic arch and of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
Incidental note is made of extensive degenerative, multilevel disease with mild narrowing of the spinal canal at the C5 level secondary to posterior osteophytosis.
Limited views of the lung apices demonstrate striking centrilobular emphysematous changes with several peripheral bullae noted.
Furthermore, there is a partially imaged tubular structure extending along the anterior aspect of the right lobe.
IMPRESSION: Large, heterogeneously enhancing suspicious mass centered within the left piriform sinus at the C5 level suspicious for underlying malignancy such as squamous cell carcinoma.
No pathologic associated lymphadenopathy within the neck.
No evidence for retroperitoneal hematoma.
Status post abdominal aneurysm repair.
This likely explains the unusual appearance of the aorta at the level of the renal arteries where a waist is seen as well as a left lateral wide-mouthed focal outpouching.
High grade stenosis of the left renal artery and celiac trunc as described above.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Small left kidney with perfusion abnormality likely due to compromise of the left renal artery by the aneurysm.
Left hydrocele and presacral fluid of uncertain clinical significance.
Echo ([**2107-7-26**]): Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
PLEURAL FLUID: exudative, negative for malignant cells.
male w/ MMP including extensive alcohol and smoking hx, transferred from an outside hospital with a 3.5 cm piriform sinus mass and right tension PTX.
# PTX: Patient had had a spontaneous PTX at the OSH, which per CXR report on transfer, had resolved s/p chest tube placement.
Thus, the PTX observed on arrival was felt to be recurrent rather than persistent.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and the patient eventually received two chest tubes with resolution of the pneumothorax after removal of the chest tubes.
Although initially he was deemed safe for comfort POs (coffee, water sips), subsequent evaluations demonstrated that he has a high risk of aspiration.
There was concern for developing pneumonia on the R lobe of the lung and for this reason unasyn and vancomycin were started.
He underwent thoracentesis which yielded exudative fluid with [**Numeric Identifier 73096**] RBCs and no malignant cells.
# Anemia: Hematocrit gradually trended down from admission with no clear source.
He did not have hematemesis or hemoptysis.
Given abdominal bruit on exam with history of AAA s/p repair, an endoleak was considered, but there was no evidence of RP bleed on CTA.
Iron studies pointed to anemia of chronic disease.
The patient received several blood transfusions for continuously dropping hematocrit.
For the past 14 days prior to discharge, his hematocrit stabilized and had no further changes.
# HTN: Poorly-controlled and chronically elevated.
Patient was not symptomatic with this hypertension and was continued on IV/TD antihypertensives with SBP goal of 160- 170: permissive hypertension given chronic elevation as an outpatient.
The patient remained rate-controlled and in sinus on successive EKGs.
He had one run of 7 beats VT which resolved spontaneously and during which the patient remained asymptomatic.
After TPN was discontinued, once his tube feeds were at goal, his sugars became elevated >200.
# Fevers: In the week prior to d/c, he spiked fevers to 101 twice.
He has remained afebrile for >48 hours and is ready for discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Piriform Sinus Mass: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Right Pneumothorax Diabetes Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for a tumor in your throat as well as a collapsed lung.
A biopsy was performed of this tumor and it is a cancer that has not spread (squamous cell carcinoma).
You cannot take anything per mouth except ice chips, as you run the risk of a fatal pneumonia if you do that.
Call your doctor or go to the ER for any of the following: fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
