Cervical anterior epidural collection, with severe narrowing of the thecal sac from C2 through C5, without evidence of spinal cord edema.
Sagittal post-contrast images suggest that this collection contains fluid at the level of C2, which would indicate an abscess rather than a phlegmon.
Anterior epidural collection from T11 through the upper sacrum, compressing the thecal sac and crowding the cauda equina.
This collection appears to contain fluid from T12 through L3, indicative of an abscess rather than a phlegmon.
No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
Bilateral posterior paravertebral muscle phlegmon at the level of L4-5 with a possible 5 mm abscess on the right.
Contrast enhancement surrounding the L4-5 facet joints may represent inflammation secondary to the severe degenerative facet arthropathy, but septic facet arthropathy cannot be excluded  Echo [**7-4**]: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild mitral leaflet thickening but without discrete vegetation or pathologic flow.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cervical region: No STIR signal abnormality in the cord.
No evidence of cord compression.
Lumbar region: Small epidural signal abnormality, could represent residual abscess collection from debridement or post-surgical changes.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subtotal lower lobe collapse.
Evidence of loculated pleural effusions tracking up in the right upper lateral pleural space.
Multiple lung nodules likely infectious in this cl inical setting.
No pneumothorax.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**8-12**] Significant increase in volume of the epidural fluid collection/abscess extending from the uppermost C1 epidural space to the inferior aspect of the study at L1, largest at the upper cervical spine where it measures approximately 1 cm in greatest thickness.
The patient is status post cervical laminectomy from approximately C2-C6 but the epidural collection displaces the cervical cord posteriorly and the cervical cord appears compressed against the posterior ring of C1.
There is increased signal within the cervical cord from the medulla to C3.
The epidural collection/abscess within the thoracic spine mildly displaces the thoracic cord without evidence of cord signal abnormality.
CT-Thoracentesis (drainage) [**7-13**] IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis yielding 270 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the right pleural cavity.
Samples were sent for microbiology and chemistry per the ordering team's request.
New soft tissue paraspinal pockets of fluid collection are seen in the lumbar region since the examination of [**2135-7-2**] and [**2135-7-4**], visualized in the lower lumbar region involving the psoas muscles and the erector spinae muscles.
Additional left psoas muscle fluid pocket measures 2.8 cm.
Lumbar epidural fluid collection ventral and dorsal to the thecal sac in the lower lumbar region may be slightly smaller compared to [**2135-7-2**].
Epidural collection in the cervical region extending from C2 inferiorly is not significantly changed since the MRI of [**2135-7-14**].
Minimal indentation on the spinal cord in cervical region is unchanged.
Postoperative changes and laminectomies are seen in this region.
Thoracic epidural collection has not changed and there is no cord compression in thoracic region.
Thin rim of epidural collection again seen in the thoracic region which is unchanged.
No cord compression is identified in the thoracic region.
Overall, stable appearance of multiple small fluid collection seen in the paraspinal muscles along with the erector spinae and psoas muscles, as described above.
No new intraabdominal or intrapelvic collections identified.
Stable bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar airspace disease.
Cholelithiasis with edematous and thick walled but contracted gallbladder.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Gallbladder wall thickening and edema may be caused by multiple factors such as liver disease and hypoalbuminemia, and clinical correlation is recommended.
Multiple soft tissue abscesses appear similar to prior examination with erector spinae abscess on the right, left iliopsoas abscess, and fluid pockets overlying the lower lumbar spine spinous processes.
Left posterior rotator cuff region possible new abscess, not well seen on prior studies.
Bilateral basal pulmonary volume loss and consolidation, similar to prior examination in lesion addition to bilateral pleural effusions, more pronounced and somewhat loculated on the right but similar to prior study.
Nonspecific lesion in the right renal upper pole.
If there is clinical suspicion for renal abscess, targeted ultrasound could be performed to further assess.
MRI C-Spine [**8-6**] IMPRESSION: Again, epidural enhancement and abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region.
As described above, the fluid collection around C2-C3 level appears slightly increased in thickness, but the differences in measurements are small and this could also be due to partial volume averaging, but continued followup is recommended.
Again, lower thoracic and upper lumbar laminectomies and epidural enhancement is seen in the thoracic region without epidural abscess.
CT Scan Abd/Pelvis ([**8-9**]): with abdominal pain of unclear etiology, look for possible underlying abdominal abscess.
FINDINGS: Of note, evaluation of abdominal organs is limited without any intravenous or oral contrast administered.
Once again, there are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying collapse/consolidation that has slightly improved from previous study.
A nodular density previously seen in the right middle lobe is not visualized in the current study.
CT ABDOMEN W/O Contrast: There is no focal liver lesion seen.
There is evidence of a large stone within the gallbladder; however, there are no signs of gallbladder wall thickening or other associated signs to suggest inflammation or infection.
There is no focal splenic lesion or abscess seen.
Small periaortic and portacaval lymph nodes are again seen, however, they do not meet CT criteria for lymphadenopathy.
There is no bowel obstruction.
There is no significant mesenteric lymphadenopathy or fluid collection seen.
This collection appears unchanged, both in size and in character and further characterization is limited without contrast.
Once again seen are the small areas of low attenuation, representing fluid in the proximal thigh as well as stranding in the left greater trochanter.
There is no epidural abscess seen in the thoracic region.
3D reconstructions, coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
BONES: There is no osseous destruction seen.
As mentioned, evidence of priorlaminectomies at the lower thoracic spine and upper lumbar spine are seen.There are no epidural collections suggestive of epidural abscess in the lumbaror visualized thoracic spine.
Slight interval decrease in bilateral basal pulmonary volume loss and consolidation and pleural effusions.
Large gallstone within the gallbladder without sign of gallbladder inflammation.
Unchanged fluid collection in the left proximal thigh compared to prior.
Unilateral upper extremity venous ultrasound.
([**8-17**]) COMPARISON: Upper extremity venous ultrasound [**2135-7-11**].
IMPRESSION: PICC in the basilic vein but no DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo female with no significant past medical history who initially presented with back pain, urinary retention on [**7-3**], found to have multiple epidural abscesses s/p multiple surgical debridements with hospital course complicated by episodes of flash pulmonary/respiratory compromise requiring intubation and febrile neutropenia secondary to lasix and vancomycin administration.
Patient initially presented with back pain, associated urinary retention and LE weakness.
Admission imaging positive for cervical and lumbar epidural abscesses (though patient with no known risk factors).
She subsequently developed a septic right knee and returned to the OR on [**2135-7-4**] for right knee washout.
Regarding further initial infectious work-up at that time: a TEE was obtained which showed no vegetations; CT head without evidence of intracranial abscess.
However, due to signs and symptoms of leukocytosis, hypoxia there was concern for hospital acquired pneumonia and antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin on [**7-10**].
Surveillance imaging obtained on [**7-12**] which demonstrated increased epidural collection within anterior cervical epidural space and displacement of the cervical cord.
Patient had been doing well with normalized temperature and WBC however four days after starting nafcillin, developed a abdominal rash.
Derm was consulted, biopsies were taken which were c/w drug rash secondary to nafcillin.
Repeat MR spine with new paraspinal fluid collections, and mild epidural fluid collection throughout the spine.
Due to concern for continued infection cefepime was added to antibiotic regimen.
Follow-up CT torso was obtained on [**8-1**] due to persistent fevers on cefepime and vanc; finding were stable to previous imaging and cefepime was discontinued.
Surveilance MR C/T-Spine on [**8-6**] showed stable epidural enhancement and abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region, thoracic region without epidural abscess.
CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression to neutropenia [**8-8**].
# Febrile Neutropenia .
Neutropenia was felt secondary to medication effect; subsequently omeprazole, furosemide, vancomycin and seroquel were discontinued.
On [**8-9**] she was febrile 102.6 and meropenem started for treatment of neutropenic fever.
Respiratory Distress .
On [**7-8**], developed worsening tachypnea and hypoxemia (95% on 4L by nasal canula).
CTA ruled out PE, however showed evidence of bilateral loculated pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules.
Estimated EF by TEE was >55%; 2 repeat echos without evidence of valvular pathology.
On [**7-10**], transferred to the floor; latered became hypoxic and was transfered back to the MICU and started on BiPAP.
She developed hypertension to 180 SBP and respiratory distress secondary to pulm edema, which responded to lasix and labetolol.
Unfortunately, again developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, requiring reintubation on [**7-27**].
CT on [**8-9**] showed improvement in pleural effusions and basilar consolidations.
She had one episode of flash pulmonary edema, during which she desaturated to high 80s.
# Blood Pressure .
During MICU stay pt had repeated episodes of transient bradycardia and hypotension as well as episodes of paroxysmal hypertension into the SBP 180-200s.
Her hypertension responded to 5mg-10mg doses of IV labetalol.
# Nutrition .
Patient underwent severeal video swallowing evaluation due to concern for silent aspiration.
Repeat speech and swallow on [**8-15**] demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallow with continued swallow delay, premature spillover and reduced base of tongue retraction.
Patient continued to aspirate thin liquids silently, but speech deemed it safe to initiate a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and moist, ground solids with the aspiration precautions documented below.
# Delirium .
She received several doses of seroquel, which was discontinued when the patient became neutropenic, as it can be a potential cause of leukopenia.
# Elbow mass .
Mass noted on right elbow.
Derm consulted; felt to be consistent with lipoma.
# UTI:  She developed low grade fevers on [**8-21**] to 100.4, prompting urinalysis, which demonstrated UTI.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus Bacteremia  SECONDARY Hypertension Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Known lastname **] it was a pleasure taking care of you.
You were initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to symptoms of back pain.
Upon imaging it was found that you had several abscesses throughout your spine as well as in your right knee.
You underwent several surgeries to evacuate these infection and you were also started on antibiotics.
Your antibiotic regimen was altered several times due to significant side effects.
You experienced a rash after Nafcillin, and Vancomyocin was thought to contribute to low cell counts.
We discontinued the medications we felt responsible for declining counts (lasix and vancomycin) and also administered a medication called Neupogen to increase WBC production.
We also found your blood pressures to be elevated at times during your hospitalization.
Regarding nutrition, after extubation you were noted to have difficultly swallowing.
On arrival to the hospital you were no prescription medications.
--To treat PAIN we STARTED:  1.
Lorazepam  0.5 mg Tablet, you can take one 0.5 tablet by mouth at at bedtime as needed for anxiety.
