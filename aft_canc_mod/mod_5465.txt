Cirrhosis of the liver without concerning liver lesions.
Splenomegaly and ascites, suggests portal hypertension.
[**2142-6-27**] Echo IMPRESSION There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No evidence of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage to explain drop in hematocrit.
Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and intra-abdominal and esophageal varices, and a small amount of ascites, compatible with portal hypertension.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with greater than expected degree of consolidation at the right lung base, and scattered foci of nodular ground glass opacity bilaterally, which is concerning for aspiration or infection.
Mild anasarca and mesenteric stranding compatible with third spacing.
No evidence of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage to explain drop in hematocrit.
Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and intra-abdominal and esophageal varices, and a small amount of ascites, compatible with portal hypertension.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with greater than expected degree of consolidation at the right lung base, and scattered foci of nodular ground glass opacity bilaterally, which is concerning for aspiration or infection.
Mild anasarca and mesenteric stranding compatible with third spacing.
No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Findings compatible with diffuse anasarca and possible ascites as described above.
Altered biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical with relative poor uptake in the bones and increased uptake in the kidneys of unclear etiology.
Two additional 1 cm lesions demonstrates only arterial enhancement without washout, but that are new as compared to the prior examination.
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusion.
Large recanalized paraumbilical vein.
Mild splenomegaly.
Irregular mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Mild pulmonary edema, as manifested by perihilar haziness and increase in diameter of the central pulmonary vessels.
Moderate cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis.
Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a pleural effusion cannot be ruled out.
However, patient was severely decompensated with multiple organ failure.
His hospital course can be summarized by the following review of systems:  Neuro: Patient with worsening encephalopathy despite lactulose and rifaximin.
Cardio: Several echocardiogram performed to assess for pulmonary hypertension.
GI: Summary per medical service and hepatology -  # Worsening ESLD- The patient presented after discharge from OSH with a worsening INR and T bili consistent with worsening liver disease.
The differential for the acute change  acute worsening is broad and included recent sepsis with perhaps persistent SBP (got 5D ceftaz, flagyl at OSH), other infection(PNA or UTI), alcoholic hepatitis (although pt and wife state no ETOH since [**3-7**]) and gastro-intestinal bleed.
On the evening of admission the combination of the patient's, acute worsening liver disease and renal failure, he was started on octreotide, midodrine and 50mg of albumin and lactulose.
A non contrast CT of the liver on [**6-28**] revealed a cirrhotic liver with mild ascites and intra-abdominal and esophageal varices.
The patient's LFTs throughout his stay in the MICU remained elevated, likely secondary to extensive hepatic injury.
With worsening mental status and heavy transfusion requirement, he was transferred to the MICU for further care and then to the surgical service.
# Liver Transplant - The liver transplant team was consulted.
On [**7-2**] MRI/MRA showed 2 new lesions thought to be HCC that were approximately 1cm in diameter.
His bone scan was negative for mets and he was placed at the top of the transplant list.
On [**7-7**] he was offered a donor liver but it was deemed to be unfit for transplant secondary to overall quality.
Another offer was made but due to overall hemodynamic instability and high mortality rate, it was withdrawn.
# Acute Renal Failure -  The patient's baseline creatinine was up to 2.2 on admission from a baseline of 1.0.
The patient's acute renal failure was initially concerning for hepatorenal syndrome in the setting of worsening liver function versus pre-renal etiology from volume depletion in the setting of sepsis at outside hospital.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3728**] creatinine trended down and was 1.6 at the time of transfer making hepatorenal syndrome less likely as he responded favorably to a fluid challenge and auto-diuresed.
Over the next several days his Cr was monitored and when below 1.0 he was given 10mg IV lasix doses in an effort to remove the large amount of fluid he was retaining secondary to his multiple transfusions.
With significant amount of transfusions, patient remained volume overloaded.
The patient had presented a unique fluid balance challenge and an effort was made to find a compromise between correcting his coagulopathy and avoiding fluid overload while protecting his kidney function.
On [**7-5**] he developed an O2 requirement  and a cxr demonstrated evidence of fluid overload.
# Low Hematocrit - The patient presented with guaiac positive stools and low hematocrit of 22.9.
Initially there was concern was that the etiology of his acute blood loss was from a GI bleed, he had a prior history of two variceal bandings.
An upper endoscopy on the evening of admission, [**6-27**] revealed small varcies, gastropathy and no active bleeding.
A CT of the patients torso was performed on [**6-28**] and ruled out evidence of lower GI bleeding.
A colonoscopy on [**6-29**] showed no evidence of acute gastro-intestinal bleed.
The patient's hematocrit was stable in the low 20s with no acute drops.
No further transfusions were required and transfusion requirements were liberalized (INR>5, PLt <50 Hct < 21) as the patient was not actively bleeding.
Indirect bilirubinemia and schistocytes on smear indicated possible hemolysis.
The persistent anemia was thought to be secondary to splenic sequestration and active blood loss at IJ site and recent bleeding foley.
Patient's family expressed clear understanding of his disease process and elected to remove all intervention.
