Renal cell carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old male who was first diagnosed with male diagnosed breast cancer in [**2190-5-19**].
During his course of the evaluation, he underwent a chest and abdominal CT that was performed on [**2190-7-2**], which demonstrated a left breast mass measuring 2.1 x 1.7 cm.
Also work-up included a CT of the abdomen demonstrating a metastatic tumor.
The CT of the abdomen demonstrated a 2.8 x 3.7 cm lesion in the segment VI of the liver, and a 3.9 x 4.1 cm mass in the midpole of the right kidney.
On [**2190-7-13**], a PET scan was performed demonstrating a left breast FDG avid mass, and an anterior midpole right renal mass that is FDG avid, and a large non-FDG avid mediastinal lymph node.
Biopsy was performed of the right renal mass on [**2190-8-10**], demonstrating no evidence of malignancy, but a fine- needle aspirate was positive for renal cell carcinoma.
Part of the work-up included head CT on [**2190-9-1**], which was negative for metastatic disease.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a possible hepatic resection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hemachromatosis in [**2181**].
History of TIA in [**2179**] and takes aspirin daily.
History of a ruptured diverticular disease.
History of mild COPD.
In the [**2164**], the patient is status post colon resection for ruptured diverticulitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General: He is a well-developed, well- nourished male in no acute distress.
Skin: Normal except for actinic changes in upper extremities and face.
HEENT: No scleral icterus.

Small hernia in the upper third of the midline incision.
No hepatosplenomegaly masses or tenderness.
No peripheral edema.
The patient was admitted on [**2190-9-24**], for a right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, radical right nephrectomy, with intraoperative ultrasound, and two incisional hernia repairs, and lysis of adhesions performed by Drs.
The patient had a postoperative chest x-ray demonstrating mild congestive heart failure which has improved, small bilateral pleural effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax identified.
The patient continued with the epidural for pain control.
Repeat chest x-ray [**9-26**] revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral bibasilar atelectasis.
The patient was ambulating with a walker without shortness of breath or distress.
Portal lymph node; 1 lymph node with sinus histiocytosis     and lipophagic granulomas.
No malignancy identified.
Liver, right lobe, resection (S-N) hepatocellular     carcinoma and also non-carcinomatous liver tissue with a     1) trichome stain: Mild periportal fibrosis, 2) iron     stain: No stainable iron, 3) reticulin stain:     Condensation of reticulin fibers in periportal areas.
Right kidney resection demonstrated renal cell carcinoma.
A liver duplex was obtained on [**2190-10-2**], demonstrating status post right hepatic lobectomy with patent vasculature and no large fluid collections identified.
Also a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained on [**2190-10-2**], demonstrated 1) no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation or perihepatic fluid collections, 2) no intraperitoneal or intrapelvic abscess, and 3) basilar lung changes with small effusions, emphysematous changes and areas of consolidations.
The peritoneal fluid that was obtained demonstrated no growth.
Anaerobic culture demonstrated no growth.
Gram-stain showed no microorganisms.
He continued to be afebrile with vital signs stable.
On [**2190-10-3**], the patient complaining of some shortness of breath.
The patient does have underlying emphysema.
Another chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating improving pneumonia in both lower lobes, continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly superimposed on underlying emphysema.
On [**2190-10-5**], the patient continued to be afebrile with vital signs stable.
Abdomen is soft and nontender.
The patient needs to call the Chestnut Team immediately at the same number, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**], for any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, inability to eat or drink, any shortness of breath, chest pain, any changes in incision, any redness, discharge from the incision or swelling from the incision too.
