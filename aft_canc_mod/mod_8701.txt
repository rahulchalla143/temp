She was first evaluated for these symptoms in [**Month (only) 116**] at [**Hospital1 2177**], where a CT scan showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
She did well immediately post-op, but in the PACU developed tachycardia to the 140s, tachypnia to the high 30s, hypotensive to the high 80s systolic and febrile to 102, concerning for a SIRS response.
She complained of chest tightness and so an ekg, chest xray, and labs were sent she was monitored.
The ekg showed sinus tachycardia and the first trop was negative.
When her tachycardia resolved and her blood pressure stabilized, she was sent to the floor.
As for recent infections, she was treated at [**Hospital1 2177**] for PNA in [**5-8**], and was treated with a z-pack without resolution of symptoms.
She went to [**Hospital1 112**] with persistent symptoms, and was diagnosed with EBV.
It was during this hospitalization that she had a CT chest/abd/pelvis showing mediastinal and abdominal LAD, prompting the above work up.
ROS: Reports fluctuations in weight over the last few months, chronic constipation, and recent HA which she describes as throbbing, are focal and can occur anywhere in her head, happen any time of the day, have associated white spots in her visual fields, and are relieved by 2 tablets of Alieve.
Patient also has a baseline cough of clear sputum [**1-30**] cup/day.
Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT INTERPRETATION: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Correlation with clinical findings and concurrent morphology (see cytology report) is recommended.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
[**2160-8-6**] Cytology EBUS TBNA LEVEL 7 Lymph node (Level 7), EBUS-TBNA: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.Bronchial epithelial cells and polymorphous lymphocytes consistent with lymph node sampling (see note).
DIAGNOSIS: TISSUE WITH EXTENSIVE HEMORRHAGE AND NECROSIS, INFILTRATION BY MACROPHAGES AND SPARSE LYMPHOID INFILTRATE.
Microscopic description:  Slides reveal fibrous tissue with a vaguely nodular cellular infiltrate comprised of histiocytes and lymphocytes.
There is extensive hemorrhage and liquefactive necrosis between the histiocytic nodules.
Focal fibrosis is also present.
The pattern of necrosis overall is suggestive of therapy effect or infection, rather than tumor necrosis.
CD10 highlights stromal elements.
MIB1 stains only scattered cells.
DIAGNOSIS:CELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY LYMPHOMA, SEE NOTE.
Note:  The findings of increased macrophages with ingestion of cells and debris, as well as an increased cytotoxic T cell infiltrate with concurrent markedly elevated ferritin level, raise the possibility of a primary, or more likely secondary, macrophage activation syndrome.
Nevertheless, lymphoma remains a strong consideration and procurement of adequate tissue from the PET avid mediastinal mass may represent the best chance for a definitive diagnosis.
EBV viremia increases the risk of both macrophage activation syndrome and B cell lymphoma.
IMAGING: EKG [**2160-8-6**]: Sinus tachycardia @128 nl axis, pr 150, qrs 98, Qtc413 no stemi, no st dep, good r-r progression, no q waves  IMAGING STUDIES: CXR [**2160-8-6**] - No previous radiographs available.
No evidence of pneumothorax following surgery.
Bibasilar opacification most likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
[**2160-8-8**] Cardiovascular ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
FINDINGS: Evaluation was limited due to poor acoustic penetration.
The liver is mildly echogenic consistent with fatty infiltration.
No intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
No cholelithiasis noted.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
The right kidney measures 10.4 cm and no stones or hydronephrosis is noted.
The aorta and pancreas were not adequately imaged due to body habitus.
A prominent portal lymph node is noted measuring 9 mm.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease or more advanced liver disease cannot be excluded.
Prominent 9-mm portal venous lymph node is non-specific and may relate to underlying lymphoma or liver disease.
Likely small bilateral pleural effusions, reactive bilateral basal areas of atelectasis, but no newly appeared parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Moderate cardiomegaly, known right-sided Port-A-Cath.
The FEV1 is mildly reduced.
Flow-Volume Loop: Moderate restrictive pattern with an abrupt and early   termination of exhalation and a starting hesitation.
Impression:   Mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a moderate gas   exchange defect.
The DLCO is reduced out of proportion to the reduction in TLC which is consistent with an interstitial process.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
The right calf veins were not visualized due to edema in the calf.
IMPRESSION:  Limited study demonstrates edema with no evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in the paratracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and right hilar stations, unchanged from the prior study.
Diffuse interstitial lung abnormality with traction bronchiectasis and fibrosis which is may be due to NSIP is similar compared to the prior study except for new bilateral pulmonary nodules.
These nodules are most likely infectious given the rapid development, however could also be due to lymphoma and less likely other neoplasms.
New right pleural effusion.
Spleen with multiple hypodense lesions is slightly smaller compared to the prior, although this is incompletely imaged.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
[**2160-8-25**]: Right middle lobe biopsy PATHOLOGY report The poor viability and presence of extensive necrosis and histiocytic infiltrate makes assessment difficult.
Given the extensive necrosis, presence of immunoblasts and scattered large LMP-1 immunoreactive cells, a diagnostic consideration is an infectious lymphadenitis, such as due to persistent EBV infection ([**Last Name (un) **] pending).
However, in patients with a known prior history of Hodgkin lymphoma, the presence of a scattered large cells also raises the concern for possible lymphoma with histological appearance modified by intercurrent therapy (steroids, etc); the strong CD20 immunoreactivity in a majority, albeit rare, large cells, and the absence of convincing CD30-immunoreactivity in the RS-like cells precludes an unequivocal diagnosis of lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 55yoF with a h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**2148**], treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy [**2149**]-[**2150**] (no radiation), and asthma who presents with 5 months of B-symptoms (afternoon fevers to 102, chills, night sweats, progressive shortness of breath, easy bruising); admitted after developing tachycardia, hypotension, and fever in the PACU status post rigid bronchoscopy for mediastinal LN biopsy.
Following extensive work up, patient was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged EBV viremia, possibly resulting in her abnormal LFTs, nephrotic syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.
Active Diagnoses:  # Macrophage activating syndrome: Cellular debris within macrophages on bone marrow biopsy, admission ferritin 11k.
Etiology is unclear, possibly due to lymphoma or EBV infection.
Bone marrow showed cellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and no morphological evidence of lymphoma, but with evidence of MAS.
Ferritin down - trend EBV PCR on Mondays  # Malignancy work up: History of lymphoma, presented with B-symptoms and lymphadenopathy on CT torso concerning for underlying malignant process.
Bone marrow biopsy showed cellular debris in macrophages consistent with macrophage activation syndrome but no evidence of malignancy.
-Patient had persistent pleural effusion following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
Chest tube was removed [**2160-8-27**] for decreased drainage, but drainage persisted for [**3-30**] days after but had resolved by time of discharge.
Surgical inscisions were healing well without signs of infection as well.
Post-surgical effusion was slow to resorb due to underlying nephrotic syndrome causing hypoalbuminemia.
# EBV viremia: VL was obtained given prolonged fevers and liver abnormalities.
EBV VL noted to be initialy [**2171**] but weekly titers showed persistent viremia at >1k copies.
- Weekly EBV viral load as outpatient (last was [**2160-9-1**], VL 1469)  # Nephrotic syndrome: Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis on biopsy, likely related to EBV viremia vs macrophage activation syndrome.
Patient with [**Last Name (un) **] on admission (Cr 1.5), developed extensive anasarca with 24 hr urine protein 8 grams and hypoalbuminemia.
She was not anticoagulated for the increased risk of thrombosis associated with nephrotic syndrome because of concurrent thrombocytopenia.
She did have one isolated episode of leg pain, ultrasound with doppler did not show DVT, leg edema remained symmetric.
- Continue lisinopril 5mg, hold for SBP <100 - Continue diuresis with 40 PO lasix [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <90 - Elevate legs, wrap as needed - Follow up with nephrology as scheduled [**2160-10-8**]  # Hypogammaglobulinemia: Acquired vs. inherited, possible common variable immune deficiency (CVID).
H flu immune, meningococcal IgG consistent with pre-vaccination reference ranges.
- Monthly IVIG to be determined by outpatient heme/onc  # Abnormal LFTs - Most likley EBV-induced vs macrophage activating syndrom vs NASH, other infections, malignancy, or drug reactions, autoimmune less likley following extensive work up.
Patient presented with transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, abnormalities dating back at least to [**Month (only) 547**] or [**2160-5-27**] upon presentation to [**Hospital1 112**].
RUQ ultrasound remarkable for fatty liver infiltration and splenomegaly, hepatitis serologies were negative.
# Pulmonary fibrosis s/p bleomycin: Pulmonary function testing was performed which showed mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a moderate gas exchange defect.
The DLCO was reduced out of proportion to the reduction in  TLC, consistent with an interstitial process, likely due to bleomycin toxicity.
Confirmation of fibrosis on biopsy this admission.

You presented with fevers, sweats and shortness of breath along with enlarged lymph nodes on CT scan of your chest and abdomen.
You had a procedure called a bronchoscopy to obtain a biopsy of your enlarged lymph nodes, following which you had low blood pressures and difficulty breathing, for which you required a brief stay in the intensive care unit.
To further investigate the cause of your symptoms you underwent biopsies of your bone marrow, kidney and lymph nodes in your lung and neck.
You were found to be suffering from an immune deficiency (low antibodies) that may have allowed an infection with [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus to affect your blood cells, liver, and kidneys.
Wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse, pat dry * No tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed * No lotions or creams to incision site * Walk 4-5 times a day and gradually increase your activity as you can tolerate.
