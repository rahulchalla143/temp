Admission Date:  [**2166-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-7-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-2-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Thrombocytopenia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of presumptive Crohn's ileitis who presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia.
He carries a presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease since [**2166-6-8**] when he presented to [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital in New [**Location (un) **] with small bowel obstruction, and abdominal CT demonstrated "...ileocecal valve appears abnormal.
Findings are of concern for Crohn's disease... a soft-tissue mass is seen in the right pelvis, this measures 4cm x 3.8cm."
Colonoscopy was done on [**2166-6-16**] and showed nodularity of terminal ileum more pronounced than usual.
Biopsy from terminal ileum was normal, and rectal biopsy showed reactive lymphoid aggregates.
At that time he complained of fatigue and dyspnoea and continued to have abdominal distention.
He was instructed to discontinue mesalamine (as a possible cause of thrombocytopenia) and to report to the emergency room.
Presently, the patient reports weight loss from 245 lbs.
He continues to report marked fatigue and exertional dyspnoea.
No blood or mucus in stools.
Patient endorses nausea, but no vomitting.
n, or focal weakness.
Laboratories: From [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital: [**2166-6-16**]: ANCA <1:20 (<1:20) No c- or p-ANCA by IFA [**Doctor First Name **] <7.5 (<7.5) Endomysial IgA <1:10 (<1:10) TTG IgA <4.0 (<4.0) Gliadin IgG <10.0 (<10.0) Gliadin IgA <5.0 (<5.0) Stool for ova & parasite negative Fecal leukocytes negative .
Imaging: Colonoscopy on [**2166-6-16**]: "Mucosa of terminal ileum is nodular in the typ08ical pattern of lymphoid nodules often seen in this area, although itis somewhat more pronounced thn usual.
Biopsy results from [**2166-6-16**]: "Ileum: no pathologic diagnosis Rectum: Rectal Mucosa with reactive lymphoid aggregate, no pathologic diagnosis"   Past Medical History: asthma on albuterol only  Social History: No cigarettes.
Family History: 3 first cousins with ulcerative colitis.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98.7 BP:137/84 HR:98 RR:24 O2Sat:99% on 2L GEN: Thin male, NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Distended, no shifting dullness or fluid wave, +BS, NT EXT: No oedema NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Large soft tissue mass involving a distal ileal loop.
Differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, carcinoid (although there is no significant desmoplastic reaction or calcification) or primary small bowel adenocarcinoma.
Extensive omental infiltration.
Marked mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Focal liver lesion in right lobe, which may represent metastasis.
PERITONEAL FLUID DIAGNOSIS: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with lymphoma.
Highly atypical medium to large-sized lymphocytes,   consistent with lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman who presented being treated at OSH with steroids for several weeks for diagnosis of Crohn's disease.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after presenting to the ED of OSH with SOB and anemia, low platelets and increasing abdominal girth.
Following admission, a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**2166-7-27**] and which ultimately showed cells consistent with non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
The patient was treated for tumor lysis syndrome in preparation for chemotherapy.
He had a paracentesis done on [**2166-7-29**] to remove fluid to help with respiratory distress from restriction in the setting of abdominal distention.
Cells from the ascitic fluid also were sent for evaluation and were found to be positive for malignant cells and consistent with Lymphoma.
A diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was made based on the available clinical evidence and the findings on diagnostic testing conducted.
The morning following the paracentesis ([**2166-7-30**]) the patient deveolped worsening abdominal distention and pain and respiratory distress.
Surgical evaluation was requested and patient was moved to the MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 25144**] ICU) for further care where he was intubated and broad spectrum antibiotics were given given concern for evolving sepsis.
CT scan showed peritoneal carcinomatosis and bowel dilitation but no evidence of free air.
The patient had central venous catheter, femoral dialysis catheter and arterial catheter placed to allow administration of chemotherapy and management of hypotension and worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia expected to worsen with tumor lysis.
During his ICU course he subsequently and rapidly developed sepsis with refractory hypotension, abdominal compartment syndrome and acute renal failure despite all interventions.
The patient was placed on CVVH to allow management of volume and elecrolyte abnormalities.
In the setting of rapid expansion of abdominal distention and worsening elevations in intra-abdominal pressures bedside U/S and X-ray of the abdomen was performed and continued to show minimal ascites and no evidence of free air.
The patient developed worsening sepsis requiring pressor support and aggressive IVF resuscitation.
The patient was unable to maintain his cardiac output and he was give nitrogen mustard and a second dose of cyclophosphamide emergently in hopes of reducing his tumor burden.
The patient developed hepatic ischemia, bowel ischemia, and complete renal failure secondary to his compartment syndrome and sepis.
