HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with a history of right cecal adenocarcinoma resected in [**2169-7-21**].
On follow-up colonoscopy, a lesion was noted at the anastomosis with a patch of mucinous adenocarcinoma and necrosis.
The patient noted no change in bowel habits, no bright red blood per rectum, no abdominal pain, or nausea or vomiting.
A preoperative stress echocardiogram on [**7-18**] showed a reversible moderate inferior wall perfusion defect, mild apical perfusion defect, ejection fraction of 48%, no wall motion abnormalities.
Review of systems reveals occasional dyspnea, questionable angina with exertion.
No chest pain at rest.
No shortness of breath at rest.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2134**], status post percutaneous transluminal angiography in [**2160**] to left anterior descending artery and diagonal I.
Diabetic neuropathy.
Colon cancer as above.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
General:  Pleasant-elderly male in no acute distress.
There is no carotid bruit.
Pulmonary:  Crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Heart is regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmur.
There is a faded right perimedial incision scar and a right lateral hernia without hepatosplenomegaly.
There is a dorsalis pedis and PT pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Chest x-ray from the [**7-12**] showed a small right pleural effusion, a nodular opacity in the right upper field, bibasilar interstitial opacities, no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 49.
ST depression in I, II, and V6, ST elevation in V1 and V2.
Urinalysis negative.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with recurrent colon cancer presenting for resection.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy and ileocolectomy at the ileocolonic anastomosis as well as a small bowel resection.
There are no complications.
This was done under epidural and local anesthesia, and required no transfusions.
Was given 3100 cc of Crystalloid and sent to Recovery Room in stable condition.
His hypertension which was controlled with Nipride, plan was to take his nasogastric tube out the following morning.
He was transferred to the SICU for postoperative monitoring.
Patient's epidural was left in postoperatively for perioperative pain control.
Patient on overnight postoperatively became agitated, and combative, and was given some Ativan for sedation.
He had no chest pain.
He is still on IV fluids, no feedings.
On postoperative day one, approximately 4 pm in the afternoon, patient had desaturation into the 50s, which increased to the 90s with bagging.
His blood pressure is in the 170s sinus tachycardia, ST depression in V3 through V5.
He had no complaint of chest pain.
Plan was to check laboratories, give Lasix IV, and Lopressor for rate control to rule out for myocardial infarction, given pulmonary toilet, and contact Cardiology for consultation.
Cardiology saw the patient and recommendations were to cycle cardiac enzymes to rule out ischemia and to recommend aspirin from a cardiac perspective, to proceed with diuresis to control heart rate and blood pressure with beta blocker and ACE, nitroglycerin, and Morphine.
Patient did rule in for myocardial infarction by troponin, however, the CKs remained relatively flat and his electrocardiogram changes resolved.
He did remain tachycardic and hypertensive.
My recommendation is to continue aspirin, to increase beta blocker for rate control.
On the [**7-16**] in the afternoon, the patient had been suffering from progressive respiratory distress due to the complications of his heart condition as well as congestive heart failure, and had developed increasing acidosis and hypertension and decreasing renal function.
At that time, his picture appeared to be consistent with sepsis in the setting of perioperative ischemia, and plan was to start Levophed to support blood pressure, to begin Heparin drip, to broaden his antibiotic coverage to attempt further diuresis.
After discussion with family after these events, it was decided to make the patient DNR with no chest compressions, shock.
He had been restarted on trophic tube feeds and showed some bowel activity with a small bowel movement.
Patient did not show any signs of regaining his mental status, however, after extubation, this is felt possibly due to prolonged sedative effect as he had been given Ativan earlier in his hospital course.
Additionally, the patient developed progressive uremia up to as high as 105-108.
This is thought secondary to progressive renal failure earlier in his hospital course with cardiogenic shock with myocardial infarction as well as a possible sepsis picture.
However, the patient's cultures never grew out any organisms.
On examination the patient can only open his eyes to deep pain and would only withdraw slightly to deep pain.
Additionally, he had no verbal response.
He continued to require supplemental oxygen which the requirements have increased overnight.
Around 9 am, the patient desaturated markedly to 60s and became bradycardic.
He quickly progressed to asystole, and on examination he had no heart sounds and no breath sounds.
Cause of death is likely secondary to respiratory failure.
