HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year-old male with a history of CLL with massive splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fistulizing Crohn's disease status post ileostomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension who was admitted recently at [**Hospital1 346**] from [**2105-3-7**] to [**2105-3-17**] for upper GI bleed, hypotension, pneumococcal pneumonia with sepsis status post intubation who had presented after discharge to Leminster follow up with dyspnea, lower extremity edema, weight gain and lower extremity cellulitis on the [**4-1**].
Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and worsening respiratory status his oncologist and primary care physician at [**Name9 (PRE) 48159**] elected to make the patient hospice care.
However, the patient's daughter requested transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] for reevaluation and further management.
Also at the outside hospital the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction and treated for pneumonia with Ceftriaxone.
Cardiology there did not feel the patient was in left sided heart failure.
He had an echocardiogram performed there that showed decreased right ventricular function.
BiPAP was tried several times without benefit.
A chest x-ray was negative for congestive heart failure.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit the patient denied any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in stools, urinary symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, cough or sputum.
The patient denies ever having chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.
Ankylosing spondylitis with restriction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with baseline 2 liter O2 requirement and PCO2s running in the 50s chronically.
Fistulizing Crohn's disease status post colectomy and ileectomy with ileostomy.
Chronic lower extremity edema with hyperalbuminemia.
Pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure.
Question of diastolic dysfunction.
Pneumococcal pneumonia with sepsis resistant to Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone treated with Azithromycin status post intubation in [**2105-3-17**].
Bilateral pleural effusion status post right thoracentesis.
Acute renal failure superimposed on chronic renal insufficiency.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to arterial bleed at the ileostomy site ligated in [**2105-3-17**], varices at the ileostomy site chronically guaiac positive.
Left elbow cellulitis.
Positive S3, prior sternal heave and 1 out of 6 systolic descrendo murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Pulmonary examination revealed long E time, otherwise lungs that had decreased breath sounds at the bases left greater then right.
On abdominal examination the patient had slight tenderness in the left lower quadrant without rebound or guarding.
He had multiple abdominal scars, ileostomy in the right lower quadrant and was nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema with a right lower extremity having some erythema and warmth and multiple ecchymosis petechia and purpura all over his extremities from previous blood draws.
PERTINENT PAST DATA:  The patient had an echocardiogram performed at his last admission with an EF of 75 to 80%, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient had an upper gastrointestinal series, which showed massive spleen and inflammatory changes to the small bowel in [**2105-2-14**].
The patient had an abdominal ultrasound on [**2105-2-14**], which showed massive spleen, dilated portal veins and normal flow.
The patient had a chest x-ray at the outside hospital, which showed bilateral basilar infiltrates and effusions left greater then right.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 56 year-old male with a history of CLL, massive splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with restriction, cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary hypertension, fistulizing Crohn's who presents with dyspnea.
Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred for further evaluation of his declining pulmonary status.
His clinical examination and repeat echocardiogram showed severe and progressive cor pulmonale likely secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension from pulmonary parenchymal disease.
His dyspnea was probably complicated by chronic anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive lung disease as well.
An echocardiogram did not reveal any left ventricular component to suggest congestive heart failure, although he did hve very severe right ventricular dysfunction.
The patient had a CT scan performed, which showed endobronchial filling defect with question of tumor versus mucous impaction.
Distal to the filling defect there was ground glass opacities that was consistent with hemorrhage or a post obstructive pneumonia.
After this finding he was started on Azithromycin as he had a Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin resistant Pneumococcal pneumonia in the same distribution as the last admission.
He had bilateral pleural effusions right greater then left, which had recurred quickly after being tapped at the outside hospital.
CT angiogram was performed, which did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary embolism.
A bronchoscopy was tentatively scheduled to achieve a definitive diagnosis for an endobronchial mass.
Multiple family meetings were held to discuss the likelihood of not having much further therapeutic intervention for the patient's severe dyspnea.
He was transiently transferred to the floor after five or so days with a desaturation in his oxygen level that brought him back to the Intensive Care Unit.
On the last day of the patient's admission he developed decreased mental status, tachypnea and was found to hve a respiratory acidosis.
He was tried on BiPAP with no improvement.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with worsening cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, although the possibility of diastolic dysfunction was entertained.
He was not hypertensive nor ischemic to suggest diastolic dysfunction as a possible contributor to his dyspnea.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction three times.
He was somewhat hypotensive on the last day of admission responsive to volume resuscitation and his diuretics had been held for several days prior to this.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a right lower extremity cellulitis, which was treated with Clindamycin with good response.
He did not have any evidence of diarrhea.
He was treated empirically for a post obstructive pneumonia with Azithromycin.
When he became hypotensive he was switched to Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.
He also had evidence of ongoing hemolysis probably from destruction of white blood cells in the setting of steroids as well as some autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
The patient with a history of fistulizing Crohn's disease status post ileostomy complicated by recent gastrointestinal bleed.
He did develop some postprandial discomfort likely secondary to splenomegaly, which improved with simethicone and Maalox.
Renal:  The patient developed acute renal insufficiency in the setting of hypotension, hypovolemia and contrast from the CT angio.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired secondary to respiratory acidosis from respiratory failure.
His respiratory failure was likely secondary to severe and progressive cor pulmonale from pulmonary hypertension.
This was also complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease.
Severe progressive cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
CLL with anemia and thrombocytopenia and massive splenomegaly.
Ankylosing spondylitis with restrictive lung disease.
Acute renal failure.
