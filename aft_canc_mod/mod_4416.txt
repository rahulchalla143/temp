Admission Date:  [**2151-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-5-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-11-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Bee Pollen / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Line Placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old male with history of Myelofibrosis, diagnosed in the last year admitted today for allogenic stem cell transplant.
He initially presented to his PCP with fatigue and lower extremity swelling.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
Bone marrow biopsy at that time was suggestive of myelofibrosis.
Pathology reviewed his BM bx and agreed with diagnosis of myelofibrosis.
On review of symptoms, he notes a rash on his buttocks, occasionally pruritic, non vesicular, usually in the winter months only.
No known exposures.
Family History: No family history of malignancy, leukemia or lymphoma.
Father - diabetes, hypertension, PVD, CAD and TIA.
Physical Exam: VITALS: T: 98.8  BP: 114/60  HR: 82  RR: 20  O2: 100%RA GEN: NAD, lying in bed comfortably HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, eyes with disconjugate movement (chronic), oropharynx clear, EOMI NECK: No LAD, No JVD, right tunneled line in place CV: RRR, no m/g/r LUNGS: CTAB, no wheezes of rhonchi ABD: soft, splenomegally across midline and to top of illiac crest, +BS, no guarding or rebound EXT: no c/c/e, DP pulses palpable bilaterally in LE, radial pulses palpabel and equal in bilateral UE.
SKIN: discreet erythematous rash over bilateral buttocks with some scaling of skin, no exudate or pus, no sign of infection.
There is small amount of ascites and a small right pleural effusion.
Gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid is likely secondary to the patient's underlying disease process and ascites.
Severe splenomegaly.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Massive splenomegaly.
# Myelofibrosis s/p Failed Allo Stem Cell Transplant s/p Double Cord Transplant - Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for allogenic stem cell transplant for treatment of his myelofibrosis.
He recieved his stem cell transplant without complication.
After transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-19**], the patient was given a 2 cord stem cell transplant on [**4-21**] without complication, while intubated for fluid overload.
Due to renal toxicity of cyclosporine, patient was maintained on IV methylprednisolone [**Hospital1 **] dosing in addition to his mycophenolate mofetil.
Mr. [**Known lastname 84821**] hospital course was complicated by GI bleed, acute renal failure, and neutropenic fever (see below).
# Neutropenic fever/sepsis: The patient experienced several episodes of neutropenic fever, first on [**2-20**] at which time he was placed on Cefepime and Vancomycin.
The patient's fever resolved and he did not experience any further episodes until spiking to 103.3 on [**3-11**] in the context of a presumed aspiration event with a brief episode of hypoxia.
A CXR at the time demonstrated some increased opacities, so Metronidazole was added with resolution of his fever and hypoxia, but he spiked again on [**3-12**].
He remained afebrile afterwards, but had several episodes of hypothermia with a nadir of 94.4.
In the context of low cell counts, the Infectious disease team later review the patient's medications and recommended discontinuing his Flagyl and switching his Meropenem to Ciprofloxacin to prevent any medication driven reduction in his cell counts.
Later in his hospital course he developed acute lethargy, and was found to be hypothermic and hypotensive.
He also c/o worsening abdominal pain.
He had developed acute on chronic renal failure, lactic acidosis of 11.7, acidemia with pH 6.95 and was intubated for a respiratory rate near the 40s.
# Acute Renal Failure: On [**3-1**], the patient's previously stable renal function began to climb from a baseline of 0.6-0.8.
A Vancomycin trough was found to be elevated to 40.6 in conjunction with the patient's Cyclosporine.
Renal was re-consulted and, based on a bland urine sediment, felt that this was a new injury not consistent with ATN.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the cyclosporine was stopped, patient's renal function continued to worsen and he was briefly placed on CVVH, to facilitate handling the fluid boluses he was receiving with antibiotics and stem cell transplant and to help diurese him in the setting of acute systolic CHF.
However, as above he continued to have chronically elevated creatinine.
Just prior to his death, he developed acute renal failure in the setting of sepsis with a creatinine 3.3.
# GI bleed: One week after transplant, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an acute drop in hematocrit.
A CT abdomen and pelvis was negative for acute retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient had repeated episodes of rectal bleed and melanotic stool.
GI was consulted on a couple of occasions, but did not favor endoscopic intervention unless the patient became hemodynamically unstable, given the patient's overall tenuous state, complete neutropenia and significant thrombocytopenia.
# Respiratory distress: On [**4-19**], patient developed respiratory distress on the floor in setting of fluid overload and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU.
On [**4-20**], his respiratory distress appeared to be worsening, he appeared to be fatigued, and was subsequently intubated from [**Date range (1) 61876**].
He was reintubated according to his wishes the night prior to his death due to respiratory distress with a rate in the 40s.
# Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-19**], the patient's volume status was concerning for heart failure.
TTE revealed dramatic decrease in the patient's ejection fraction from normal to 20-25%, thought to possibly be secondary to cyclophosphamide toxicity.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended aggressive IV diuresis and beta blockade, as well as holding ace inhibitors, given acute kidney injury.
Upon transfer back to the BMT floor on [**4-26**], patient was noted to complain of significant abdominal pain; he was noted to have large volume ascites and increasing splenomegaly, likely the cause of his pain.
The ascites was felt to be secondary to acute heart failure.
Because he could not undergo paracentesis in the setting of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, patient was given furosemide one-time doses to attempt diuresis.
Because he was felt to be intravascularly volume depleted, furosemide doses were given after receiving pRBCs, which he received almost daily for depressed counts.
# Abdominal Pain: Patient was started on oxycontin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] due to chronic pain from myelofibrosis.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress [**4-19**], his pain medications were held, given his respiratory status.
Following extubation, he was complaining of significant epigastric abdominal pain, and was given PRN doses of IV dilaudid.
Abdominal film was suboptimal but did not show free air in the abdomen.
He did not undergo CT at that time, given his contraindications to IV or PO contrast (renal failure and nausea/vomiting, respectively).
Following transfer back to the BMT service, his pain was controlled with a morphine PCA pump.
He underwent a non-contrast abdominal CT which ruled out perforation or major bleed but did show large volume ascites, likely secondary to heart failure, and massive splenomegaly, which were both likely the major contributors to his pain.
Because patient could not undergo therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis in setting of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, slow diuresis was attempted with furosemide prn doses.
