A small hiatal hernia is noted.
The aorta is densely calcified, as well as most of its major vessels including dense calcifications of the SMA.
There is focal aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta measuring up to 3.1 cm (2:46).
A 1.2 cm simple cyst is seen at the dome of the right lobe of the liver.
Multiple renal cysts including a prominent 2.7 cm left parapelvic cyst is noted.
Intra- abdominal small and large bowel loops contain oral contrast with no evidence of wall thickening, obstruction, or perforation.
No free fluid or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen, the largest of which measures 1.1 cm in short-axis just behind the aortic bifurcation (2:53).
There are large left external iliac nodes measuring 3 x 2.8 cm (2:77) and 2.1 x 1.5 cm (2:74).
There is a large lymph node conglomerate in the left inguinal region measuring approximately 6 x 6 x 5.5 cm with small adjacent lymph nodes and surrounding fat stranding.
There is no right inguinal or right external iliac lymphadenopathy.
Scattered diverticula are seen within the sigmoid colon.
Severe degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine with anterior wedge deformity of L2.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology, including no evidence of colitis or abscess.
Pathologically enlarged 6 cm left inguinal lymph node conglomerate and regional lymphadenopathy.
Differential includes lymphoma, or metastatases from melanoma or other tumors.
DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma (see note).
These findings support the diagnosis, and are suggestive of a squamous cell origin.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Leukocytosis)  Given the patient's neutrophilic leukocytosis of 36K on admission in the setting of a pathologically enlarged 6cm left inguinal LN (by CT abd/pelvis)and left iliac LAD and lack of any evidence of infectious etiology, concern was for lymphoma or other malignancy.
Patient has never had a colonoscopy.
Ct abd/pelvis with oral and IV contrast revealed left inguinal LAD per above.
Heme/onc was consulted and review of the peripheral smear revealed numerous neutrophils with toxic granulations but no lymphocytosis or evidence of blasts.
Path showed findings c/w squamous cell carcinoma (please see above for detailed pathology report).
Prior to receiving the official path reports suggestive on an epithelial tumor, the patient was found to have a fungating tumor on the shaft of his penis.
A urology consult was obtained, and they felt that biopsy of this lesion was of limited value given the pt's known squmous cell carcinoma seen in the LN biosy and given persistent dyspnea and hypoxia and declining clinical status.
Oncology recommended biopsy of this lesion if possible for definitive diagnosis.
The patient received a CT-PA for his dyspnea during this admission (see below) and was found to have multiple enlarged lymph nodes and lymphadenopathy.
The oncology team also noted that chest lympadenopathy would have been a most atypical presentation for penile cancer and it was felt that a biopsy would be needed to further evaluate these lesions as well.
3) DOE--the patient was found to have an oxygen requirement on admission of 2L NC on admission and one of his initial complaints was DOE.
The patient had a minimal distant smoking history and no heart failure symptoms.
Admission x-ray showed only bilateral atelectasis with a question of a mild pleural effusion.
The patient received IVF for possible tumor lysis syndrome during his initial admit and subsequently developed worsening hypoxia.
This was negative for a large pulmonary embolism.
The patient subsequently developed worsening hypoxia which was felt to be related to fluid overload as seen on serial CXR's.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
