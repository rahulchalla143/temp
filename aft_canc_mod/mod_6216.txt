Admission Date:  [**2194-2-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-3-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-3-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: necrotizing fasciitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p multiple debridements left leg, IVF filter placement, STSG VAC placement   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 76935**] is a 59 year old woman with hx thyroid disease who presented initially to [**Hospital 8641**] hospital on [**2-4**] with 2-3 week history of swelling and redness in area of ingrown hair on left thigh.
On initial evaluation she had a 12x4cm abscess in the perineum with areas of necrosis as per ED charts, a WBC of 14.9 with 31% bands and glucose of 452.
She was started on Zosyn and taken to the OR for debridement, where "an enormous amount of necrotic subcutaneous tissue... and pockets of pus all the way to medial aspect of the thigh" was noted in the OR note.
She initially improved, however on [**2-7**] she developed worsening elevated WBC and fever and the patient was taken back to the OR for a second debridement where "extensive pus and probable necrotizing fasciitis" was noted.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism s/p radioablation   Social History: Lives with boyfriend in [**Name (NI) 76936**] + ETOH + 1 ppd cigarette smoking Works at [**Company 2486**]   Family History: CAD  Physical Exam: T: 100.4  P: 89  R: 16	BP: 111/49  99% AC 20/300/40/5 General: Intubated, sedated Neck: No LAD Cardiovascular:	RRR no murmurs Respiratory: Coarse vented breath sounds Gastrointestinal: Decrease BS, obese, soft, no masses Genitourinary: Foley in place, candidal rash in vaginal fold Musculoskeletal: Extensive incision extending from lateral aspect of superior thigh, medially to groin and caudally to mid thigh, draining clear yellow fluid.
+ erythema, warmth and nonpitting edema of left calf.
+ erythematous rash right groin.
Bilateral subclavian CVLs without erythema.
Findings suggesting pyelonephritis with the possibility of a focal (non-drainable) abscess within the right kidney as detailed above.
Additionally, fluid collection identified within the posterior pararenal space as well as within the right psoas muscle.
Post-surgical changes related to extensive debridement of the left lower extremity.
Trace free fluid is seen within the peritoneal cavity.
Small effusions and adjacent areas of passive atelectasis noted.
REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] DIAGNOSIS: FNA, Breast mass, left: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,    consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Cellular specimen with atypical epithelioid cells in   clusters and singly with nuclear pleomorphism, nuclear   membrane irregularities and prominent nucleoli; some   cells with intracytoplasmic vacuoles.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Note that non-contrast CT is less sensitive for detection of small parenchymal metastases in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.
Opacification of several left mastoid air cells and fluid level in the sphenoid sinus, likely inflammatory in etiology.
No evidence for osseous erosion.
Irregularity of the right distal vertebral artery with focal outpouching could represent focal aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or area of dissection.
Air-fluid level within the sphenoid sinus, fluid/mucosal thickening within the mastoid air cells, and fluid within the right middle ear cavity.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2194-3-8**] 8:41 PM CONCLUSION: Confirmation of aneurysm within the distal right vertebral artery, which may well represent a component of dissection.
ADDENDUM: There is ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament posterior to the C4 vertebral body, as well as prominent disc space narrowing and probable reactive sclerosis involving the C4-5 and C5-6 disc spaces.
She was intubated in the ICU for her multiple left leg debridements.
She had persistent post-op ICU confusion.
A Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
MR brain showed irregularity of the right distal vertebral artery with focal outpouching could represent focal aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or area of dissection.
Next, a CTA on [**2194-3-9**] confirmation of aneurysm within the distal right vertebral artery, which may well represent a component of dissection.
Neurology felt the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer's dementia.
GU: The patient had a Foley catheter, and her urine output was routinely monitored Heme: The patient's cbc was routinely monitored ID: The patient was put on vancomycin, zosyn, clindamycin, fluconazole for necrotizing fasciitis as well as a perineal yeast infection in close proximity to her wound.
She initially had clinical deterioration on Zosyn and culture + for E. fergisonii and group B strep.
Her infection is likely mixed aerobic / anaerobic and it is unclear that previous culture results represent all pathogenic organisms.
Would favor broadening antibiotic coverage for B-lactamase producing anaerobes as well as possible toxin producing strep and staph species.
No GAS isolated yet, but given hemodynamic instability, may consider IVIG, would hold for now as data is somewhat limited.
For her Ecoli and viridans strep, she continued on Zosyn and this will end on [**2194-3-14**].

She then went to the OR with Plastic Surgery on [**2194-2-21**] for rectus flap to cover femoral vessels with VAC placement.
s/p IVF filter placement ([**2-17**])  Breast CA: She had a biopsy of a breast mass and has a new adenocarcinoma of breast.
PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Constipation.
