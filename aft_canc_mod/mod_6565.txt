# Symptomatic Bradycardia: Patient's fall was suspected to be secondary to symptomatic bradyarrhythmia.
Per report, as an outpatient patient had sinus pauses on Holter monitor.
# Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction:  Patient has a history of CABG (anatomy unknown).
While here he denied any chest pain.
There was a discussion at discharge about persuing stress testing but given his CLL, it was thought that medical management was most appropriate at this time.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient's Cr was 1.6 at OSH.
His urine was notable for large blood and there was a concern for rhabdo.
He also had protein in his urine which suggested likely underlying renal insufficiency likely secondary to diabetes.
# CLL: With likely bone marrow involvement: thrombocytopenia and anemia.
No signs of overt bleeding.
# Thyroid nodule: An incidental thyroid nodule was seen on CT scan, which needs to be followed as an outpatient.
# S/P Mohs Surgery for Squamous Cell CA on scalp on [**7-14**].
