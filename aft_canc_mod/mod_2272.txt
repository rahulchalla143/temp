This corresponds to the known cavernous angioma at this site, in this patient with known multiple cavernomas (as demonstrated on the MR), with likely compression of the aqueduct.
CT head [**1-14**]: Mild improvement in the degree of hydrocephalus compared to study obtained roughly 13 hours earlier.
