Admission Date:  [**2149-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-10-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-3-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: SOB, LE edema, decreased urine ouput  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 57523**] is a 63 y.o.
Male w/ DM, ESRD on PD, CABG (15yrs ago), A. fib on Coumadin, CLL who initially presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8125**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] w/ 2 weeks of progressive shortness of breath and LE edema.
The evening prior to admission, he noted some SOB as well as lower extremity edema and decided to come to the ED.
Although this represents an acute issue he does notice over the past 2 weeks a mild progression of DOE and lower extremity edema.
He has also noted a decrease in his urinary output, he usually urinates 700cc a day approximately, however over the past 2 weeks he has been putting out 250cc.
His BUn/Cr were also markedly elevated at 106 and 12.1.
CBC showed a mild leukocytosis of 11.8, that was neutrophillic (86.3%).
An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with no acute ST changes.
CXR showed fluid overload state.
On the floor, he developed worsening dyspnea and was placed on a non-rebreather mask with O2 saturations in the high 90s.
He received an 80 mg dose of IV lasix followed by a 120 mg dose of IV lasix with no significant improvement.
He received a repeat CXR which showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that radiology felt was consistent with ARDS.
Past Medical History: CKD on PD started [**11-21**] DMII HTN CAD, S/P CABG [**2136**] S/P CCY S/P L knee arthroscopy S/P L ankle fx S/P 5th L toe amputation for osteomyelitis H/O "fluid in lungs" Neuropathy Retinopathy   Social History: Married, has grown children, smokes cigars occassionally, rare glass of wine, no drugs   Family History: [**Name (NI) 59483**], Father CAD  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM VS: T=98.8 BP=162/103 HR=92 RR=16 O2 sat=92% on 2L GENERAL: Caucasian Male laying down in bed in NARD HEENT: Sclera anicteric.
CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular S1, S2, no m/g/r, RRR LUNGS: Crackles noted mid thorax down b/l ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND.
Selective coronary angiorgraphy in this right dominant system  demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had moderate diffuse disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension SBP 164 mmHg.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST X RAY IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality or significant change from prior.
Male with ESRD on PD [**2-18**] diabetic nephropathy, CAD s/p distant CABG, DM II presenting with hypervolemia in the setting of high sodium intake, with worsening lower extremity edema, worsening short of breath, and reduced urine output.
Dyspnea/Volume Overload: Patient presented in acute respiratory distress and required a MICU transfer requiring non-invasive ventilation.
Respiratory distress appeared [**2-18**] fluid overlead.
Given poor response of UOP to lasix, Renal was consulted to increase PD cycles with concentrated dialysate.
It was unclear whether worsening renal function or cardiac decompensation caused respiratory distress.
Lungs with minimal rales at bases.
Etiology of vol overload thought to be [**2-18**] salt indiscretion and decreased UOP.
Symptoms improved after dialysis with high osmotic draw.
We continued with daily weights, fluid restricction to 1.5L, and a low Na and Renal diet.
# Troponin Leak v. NSTEMI: Pt remains CP free.
A cath was done in case of NSTEMI, however no intervention was done as existing CAD was seen on cath without focal occlusive lesion requiring stent.
THe pt was started on plavix, but as there was no NSTEMI and the troponin leak was thought likely [**2-18**] volume overload and cardiac strain, the plavix was d/c'ed prior to discharge.
# Hypertension: Likely related to volume overload.
# ESRD on PD: PD tx per renal dialysis team.
Seems to have stopped bleeding once coumadin was stopped.
# DM II: continued on home regimen of humalog 70/30, ISS and checked CBGs QID.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled.
Did not feel the need to bridge from heparin to coumadin as pt has not had previous h/o stroke.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Volume overload   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath thought due to too much fluid.
We also performed a cardiac catheterization as you had an elevation in your cardiac enzymes.
