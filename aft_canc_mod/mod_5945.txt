Admission Date:  [**2140-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-2-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: feel weak   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 82M with myeloproliferative d/o and PCV, discharged yesterday from hospitalization with same chief complaint, now returns from rehab center with concern for increasing lethargy.
Imaging included negative head CT, abdominal CT with large R buttock/thigh hematoma, splenomegaly, and L adrenal nodule.
Surgery consult felt R hematoma was concerning for possible persistent bleed but no concern for compartment syndrome and no surgical intervention indicated.
Patient was admitted to the ICU, fluid hydrated, treated for hyperkalemia, given 2U PRBCs, and rate controlled for intermittent atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Hematology consulted, concluded that mental status changes and electrolyte imbalances cannot be attributed to tumor lysis syndrome or leukostasis, as patient's smear showed no signs of leukemic transformation.
Hematology did find pt to be iron deficient, and suggested possible noncompliance with outpatient PCV meds given absence of expected macrocytic anemia while on allopurinol.
Renal consult found ATN, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis from R thigh hematoma.
Renal ultrasound negative for hydronephrosis.
Today patient sent back from rehab for persistent/worsening lethargy.
Found to have jaundice, RUQ pain, abdominal distension, hematuria, and new RBBB on EKG.
RUQ ultrasound showed normal portal vein flor, a gallbladder full of slude but without e/o cholecystitis, and small ascites.
CT abd/pelvis revealed mild ileus (gaseous distention of large bowel without obstruction or [**Last Name (un) **]), abdominal ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse anasarca and stable splenomegaly.
Grossly dilated bowel loops also seen on KUB.
Volume overload on CXR seen as increased perihilar markings and cardiomegaly, plus increased R retrocardiac opacity, with concern for atelectasis vs developing infection.
Surgery consult suggested percutaneous cholecystostomy; poor surgical candidate.
Given 2L IVF, 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for presumed obstructive cholangitis and admitted to the ICU for further management.
Denies chest pain and abdominal pain.
Some mild shortness of breath.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

===================== Imaging: ===================== RUQ U/S [**6-22**]: (wet read) - Increased liver echogenicity.
Gallbladder w/layering sludge but o/w nl gallbladder, no evidence of cholecystitis.
Small ascites.
B/l pleural effusions.
Gaseous distention of large bowel without obstruction represent mild ileus.
Interval development of small volume abdominal ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and diffuse anasarca could reflect third spacing in the setting of heart failure.
Stable splenomegaly as well as renal hypo- and hyper-dense lesions, likely cysts, though incompletely characterized.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
no air/fluid level.
degenerative change lumbar spine.
KUB [**6-23**] (wetread): continued gas-distended dilated loops of small and large bowel, similar to slightly progressed from 6 hrs prior.
assessment for free air limited by supine positioning and exclusion of non-dependent portion of abdomen on lateral decub view.
CXR [**6-22**]: increased retrocardiac opacity, atelectasis v developing infection, increased perihilar markings and cardiomegaly.
ECHO [**6-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
The above findings are consistent with delayed tracer excretion secondary to hepatic dysfunction.
IMPRESSION: Delayed biliary excretion secondary to hepatic dysfunction.
There is no deep vein thrombosis.
Bilateral lower extremity soft tissue edema is moderate, right worse than left.
No deep vein thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Moderate bilateral lower extremity soft tissue edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M w/polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and myeloproliferative disorder re-presents from rehab facility with persistent lethargy, found to have dilated bowel, obstructive LFTs, and negative head imaging in addition to chronically elevated WBC/Plt/splenomegaly, admitted direct to the ICU for workup and management.
ICU team's ddx included new CHF, hypothyroidism and occult malignancy, either progression of myeloproliferative disorder to AML, or other MPD-association solid tumors.
Pt provided history of gradual 20-lb weight loss with abdominal/lower extremity fluid overload.
Hoarseness especially concerning for small cell lung cancer but no concerning nodules on CXR.
Possible new congestive heart failure or thrombosis was another possible explanation for his current presentation.
Echo showed normal EF (70%) with no significant valve pathology.
Doppler ultrasound of the portal vein was negative for thrombus, and CT head showed no signs of bleed or infarction.
For his polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], patient is on anagrelide; since anagrelide has edema and new CHF among its side effects, it was stopped.
Despite all of the above, weakness & fatigue were likely secondary to the worsening ileus and free abdominal air ultimately seen on KUB.
#Sepsis ED admitted the patient directly to the ICU with concern for sepsis but patient was notably not hypotensive or febrile, and had no positive cultures/UA/CXR findings concerning for infection so this was not considered to be a likely explanation for his current presentation.
However, he did develop fever to 101.7 on the evening following admission.
At that time he was agitated & tachypnic, with increasing abdominal pain.
Purulent discharge noted at urethral foley insertion site + small purulence at IV insertion sites.
Urinalysis showed new leukesterase and WBCs.
Serial KUB in context of worsening abdominal distension and fever showed free air under the diaphragm.
Bowel grossly distended on imaging without obstruction or transition point.
Bowel dilatation increased on serial KUBs, so an NGT was placed for decompression.
Rectal exam showed no impaction, no masses, stool guaiac negative.
Serial KUB obtained for worsening abdominal exam showed free air under the diaphragm.
#RUQ tenderness to palpation, elevated tbili/dbili.
Biliary obstruction suspected but not seen on imaging.
HIDA scan showed delayed gallbladder filling but no obstruction.
The pt was followed by surgery, who recommended ERCP and possible percutaneous cholecystostomy.
IVF were initially avoided, but he was given IVF boluses when febrile hypotension developed, with underlying etiology free abdominal air, as above.
History of post-traumatic hematoma diagnosed on previous exam.
ICU team had concern for coagulopathy/ongoing slow bleed given extensive dependent purpuric appearance of his hematoma appearance ~10 days after fall against car.
Patient denied CP but endorsed SOB.
New RBBB may represent new ischemia, especially given increased risk of coronary vessel thrombosis in this patient with PVC.
Echo revealed no wall motion artifact within a limited exam.
#Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
Hct stable over past week, but likely down from baseline due to extensive soft tissue bleeding evidenced on exam.
No e/o thrombosis on imaging: negative LENIs during prior admission, head CT negative, limited RUS doppler study negative.
He was continued on home ASA and allopurinol, anagrelide held (as above), and hydroxyurea continued to be held per heme recommendations during last admission given the current state of relative anemia with blood loss into the hematoma.
due to known neutrophil-predominant myelodysplasia.
Likely secondary to dehydration, but also considered multiple myeloma, so SPEP/UPEP sent.
Bladder pressure, obtained for question of increased intra-abdominal pressure as a cause for anuria, was normal.
Patient was given lasix to promote diuresis and urine output, with minimal response.
Patient had a speech & swallow evaluation during his last admission, with concern for aspiration given coughing observed while eating/drinking.
He was kept NPO while awaiting resolution of abdominal distension/bowel dilation.
