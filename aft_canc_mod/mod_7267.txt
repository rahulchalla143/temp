There is a tiny area of low density within the body of the left caudate nucleus, likely representing a chronic lacunar infarct.
There is mild prominence of the ventricles and cortical sulci of the brain, suggesting mild atrophic change.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is a symmetric irregular lucent appearance of the occipital bone, on either side of the midline.
The remaining osseous and soft tissue structures are notable for discontinuity of the bony nasal septum, raising the question of a fracture, of indeterminate age.
* CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2115-4-9**] 3:05 AM CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST: There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery, proximal, or distal branches to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
There are coronary artery calcifications, and arthrosclerotic plaque along the aorta.
There is no pleural, or pericardial effusion.
There is no significant axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Lung windows reveal panacinar emphysema, with a 1.8 x 0.9 mm spiculated nodule within the left lower lobe anteriorly, as well as a 9 x 9 mm spiculated nodule within the right middle lobe, with surrounding peribronchial thickening.
Additionally, a 7 x 6 mm rounded nodule is seen within the right upper lobe.
Finally, within the right middle lobe, anteriorly, there is a 5 x 9 mm spiculated nodule, with surrounding acinar, and paraseptal thickening.
Limited imaging through the abdomen demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease, and calcifications within the pancreas consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities.
Degenerative changes are seen along the thoracic spine.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Multiple spiculated nodules within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe.
3) Panacinar emphysema.
4) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
* CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-4-9**] 5:16 AM CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Lung bases demonstrate focal opacities within the right posterior and anterior lung bases.
There is atherosclerotic disease, with mild coronary artery calcifications.
There is diffuse atherosclerotic disease along the abdominal aorta, and iliacs.
There are no intra- abdominal fluid collections, or masses.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air and no free fluid.
There is a Foley catheter.
There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air and no free fluid.
Multiple prosthetic calcifications are noted.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: 1) No intra-abdominal fluid collections.
No free air.
No evidence of obstruction.
2) Multifocal opacities within bilateral lung bases consistent with patient's history of lung cancer, and possibly representing lymphangitic spread versus multifocal pneumonia.
3) Atherosclerotic disease, without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
* CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-4-9**] 1:59 AM There are vague linear opacities in the right and left lower lung zones, consistent with the patient's CT scan showing spiculated nodules in these regions.
IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in bilateral lower lung zones, consistent with the patient's CT scan showing spiculated nodules in those areas.
No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7049**] is a 55 year old homeless man with h/o lung CA (metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary) and EtOH dependence who was admitted after being found on the street by EMS.
It appeared that he began to show signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in the ED with increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
He also spiked a temprature and became short of breath.
A CTA was negative for PE, head CT was negative for bleed, and abd/pelvic CT was negative for intra-abdominal source for infection.
Although he had a fever with headache, the patient refused an LP.
He did well overnight with improvement in his mental status and minimal valium requriments.
The following day, the ceftriaxone and vancomycin were discontinued because there was a very low suspicion for meningitis in this patient.
Given his altered mental status on admission, there was some concern for aspiration so he was continued on levofloxacin.
He was also continued on a very short prednisone taper for the possibility of COPD exacerbation given wheezes on exam.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Please return to the Emergency Room if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, or fever/chills.
