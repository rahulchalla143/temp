The patient was evaluated and had a positive exercise ETT MIBI, went for catheterization on [**2164-5-30**] with left main 50% ostial lesion, left circumflex 60-70% lesion, RCA with fractured stenosis 80%, 80% ostial lesion, 1+ MR, EF 46%.
She denies symptoms preoperatively.
She had no orthopnea or PND.
Preoperative she had complained of episodes of palpitations which have resolved spontaneously in less than one hour.
She reported an uneventful operative course except for difficulty with hallucinations after anesthesia and she had left arm and shoulder tingling.
Since discharge post-CABG, the patient reports increasing dyspnea, and inability to lay flat secondary to the dyspnea.
She had two-three pillow orthopnea.
She had increasing lower extremity edema, increasing dyspnea with exertion, and chronic nonproductive cough.
She had palpitations and increasing fatigue with minimal exertion.
She presented to the Emergency Room on the 28th with the complaints of dyspnea and palpitations.
She was started on oxygen and Lasix with some improvement, and EKG at that time showed new onset AFib.
An echocardiogram on the 29th showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, moderate pericardial effusion, no tamponade.
The patient had been stable hemodynamically without pulsus paradoxus on the floor.
A repeat echocardiogram on [**8-16**] showed an increasing effusion at this time, it was felt now to be moderate to large size.
A CTA was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolus, however, the CT was held in light of the patient's enlarging effusion.
There were no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory:  She had decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally to [**1-20**] of the way up her lung fields.
There was no egophony.
Extremities:  She had 2+ pitting edema just to up below the knees.
Slight interval increase of the bilateral pleural effusions, her left hemidiaphragm was not well visualized which is consistent with effusion or left lower lobe collapse or consolidation.

CAD with a history of IMI as noted in the history of present illness.
After the drain was placed, shortness of breath and cough resolved, and the patient was given 30 mg of IV Lasix and she could lay flat at 30 degrees and rest without shortness of breath.
Her O2 requirement at this point fell.
Prior to the pericardial drainage, the patient was anxious and went into rapid AFib with rates of 140-160, 5 mg of IV Lopressor were given x2.
Her Synthroid was increased, this was felt to be consistent with hypothyroidism and her Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg a day.
On the 4th, a bedside echocardiogram was done, which showed a very small pericardial effusion.
