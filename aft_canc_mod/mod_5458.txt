Left retrocardiac opacity, may be from effusion and atelectasis though underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
[**2123-12-5**]:        11.5 462.6>---------< 46     95% lymphs        34.6  ABG: 7.13/ 45.7/ 64/ 16/ -14   Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o gentleman with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia s/p chemotherapy and recent use of prednisone, was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fevers of 104, sepsis and respiratory distress.
Given patient's immunocompromised state due to advanced cancer and prednisone use, infectious etiologies of fever are most likely.
Due to presentation of respiratory difficulty, cough and high fever, pulmonary infectious processes such as bacterial pneumonia, (especially w/ encapsulated organisms like strep pneumo) PCP pneumonia or influenza are highly likely, or his pulmonary infiltrates seen on CXR could be due to inflammatory vascular leak causing an ARDS type picture.
Legionella is another possibility given PNA like symptoms in conjunction w/ diarrhea or diarrhea itself could be caused by C. diff colitis or bacterial or viral etiologies.
CVA tenderness and fever could point to pyelonephritis as a potential source of infection.
Another possibility is aggressive transformation of his malignancy such as [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation which would be characterized by high fever, elevated LDH and association with previous fludarabine use.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  Mr. [**Known lastname 64264**] fevers and hypotension were likely due to sepsis, complicated by underlying malignancy and immunosuppression.
He was diaphoretic, tachycardic and tachypneic and was having difficulty speaking in complete sentences due to respiratory distress.
Patient was pan-cultured, and given IVF for hydration with 1 L NS boluses.
He developed increased work of breathing and went into atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 160s, refractory to low-dose diltiazem, so amiodarone drip was started.
Anesthesia arrived to intubate patient at assist/cmv at Vt 500 x 30 RR, PEEP 15, 100% FiO2.
A left internal jugular central line and right radial arterial line were placed emergently due to hypotension.
Patient's blood pressures continued to drop with systolic pressures in the 70s and 80s, so levophed was initiated, and titrated til it was at maximum dose.
Serial arterial blood gasses were measured and patient was profoundly acidotic, with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis having pH of 7.19.
Vasopressin was initiated as a second pressor, but only had minimal effect on blood pressure.
Repeat ABGs showed no improvement.
Dopamine was initiated as a 3rd pressor due to systolic pressures in the 60s-70s.
Blood cultures returned positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and patient's vancomycin was changed to linezolid as per ID recommendations, for better VRE coverage.
His zosyn was changed to meropenem for broad coverage and clindamycin was added due to its inhibitory effects on bacterial protein synthesis and therefore, action against endotoxins.
Patient continued to do poorly, and emergent femoral line was placed due to concern of inaccurate readings from right radial arterial line.
Mini BAL was conducted on [**12-5**] and results later showed positivity for pneumocystis.
