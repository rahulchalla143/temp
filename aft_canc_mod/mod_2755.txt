Per daughter, patient was in her usual state of health until early [**Month (only) **] when she had back pain after making her bed.
Subsequently, on the week of [**2124-8-21**], she began to complain of abdominal pain and general malaise.
The following week, on [**2124-8-28**], she had a fever at home as well as rash on her arms and legs, which was raised and painful to touch.
Per her daughter, she was feeling extremely weak and had poor po intake during these days.
She was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 56871**] on [**2124-9-1**] for her pancytopenia and admitted directly to the hospital as she appeared tachypneic and unwell.
During her hospital admission, bone marrow biopsy was performed that showed 18% blasts concerning for high grade myelodysplastic syndrome as well as granulomas concerning for fungal infections.
Heme/onc was consulted who felt that initiating treatment for myelodysplasia was not warranted.
ID was also consulted as she had persistent fevers to 102-103, ANC ranged 1000-1400.
She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension with intermittent fluid boluses to maintain BPs.
Urine was weakly positive for histoplasmosis.
She was then placed on trial of IV solumedrol 80mg TID and fevers defervesced.
On day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she had worsening hypoxemia with increasing FiO2 requirement.
CXR showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate, predominantely perihilar in distribution, and b/l pleural effusions.
She was also given a dose of lasix for volume overload prior to transfer.
She denies pain anywhere, including abdominal pain.
She reports her diarrhea has resolved with immodium.
+ dry mouth, but was able to tollerate po in the ICU.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.

CXR [**2124-9-22**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-13**] through 18: Radiographically, there has been no change since [**9-18**] in large areas of perihilar consolidation, left greater than right.
In the interim, moderate bilateral pleural effusions have decreased.
Much of the perihilar consolidation is probably pulmonary edema given the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in the severity of at least the left upper lobe component between [**9-14**] and [**9-17**].
No pneumothorax.
Slight decrease in diffuse alveolar ground-glass opacities with a perihilar and lower lung predominance, likely secondary to either infection, drug reaction, or pulmonary edema.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, not significantly changed in size compared to prior CT from [**9-13**], [**2123**].
Fluid within the endometrial cavity without other definite uterine abnormalities.
Increase opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally greater on the right are a combination of atelectasis and large pleural effusions; part of the change is due to difference in position of the patient.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Bilateral pulmonary edema is essentially unchanged.
[**2124-9-14**]   Pathology Tissue: Slides referred for   [**2124-9-14**] Skin, left thigh, punch biopsy (consult from [**Hospital **] Hospital S-[**Numeric Identifier 14526**]-11, [**2124-9-5**], 1 H&E, 1 AFB, 1 GMS, 4 immunostains with neg controls): Mild superficial to mid-dermal perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with focal mixed cell inflammation in the superficial subcutis.
No leukemic infiltrate is identified.
Predominantly central perihilar opacities, in the setting of bilateral pleural effusions and mildly enlarged heart, these findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema.
No definite findings to suggest infection.
Moderate-to-large hiatal hernia.
[**2124-9-13**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Patient is not intubated, heart is mildly to moderately enlarged and small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
The very symmetric perihilar pulmonary consolidation in both lungs could therefore be pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia.
Right bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

INPATIENT   Brief Hospital Course: 82-year-old Spanish-speaking female with hx of ulcerative colitis in remission s/p colectomy being transferred from OSH for hypoxemic respiratory failure in setting of new diagnosis of myelodysplasia and pancytopenia.
# Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Stable.
She was transferred from OSH with worsening respiratory distress satting mid 90's on NRB.
CXR showed diffuse b/l pulmonary infiltrates and small pleural effusions.
Also continued on ambisome per ID recs due to reports of positive histoplasmosis antigen from OSH.
On [**9-18**], the again began to experience respiratory distress associated with borderline BP and a 10 point decrease in her hematocrit.
It was felt that the etiology of her hypoxia and hypotension was possible due to additional alveolar hemorrhage.
On one occasion on the night of [**9-22**], the patient spiked a fever after 48 hours of afebrile condition.
A chest x-ray showed possible LUL pneumonia, which was treated emperically with vanco/zosyn.
# Fever: She had persistent fevers at OSH despite being on ceftriaxone and then amphotericin/itraconazole.
Urine was weakly positive for histoplasma antigen at OSH, and she was started on amphotericin.
Urine culture on admission grew 10-100K VSE and BAL returned bloody fluid.
She continued to spike fevers, and CT a/p showed no source of infection, although did mention fluid in the endometrial cavity.
Histoplasma and autoimmune serologies are negative.
After transfer to the floor, patient was afebrile for 48 hours.
Spiked spontaneously on one evening, and initially the chest x-ray was concerning for LUL pneumonia, and the patient was started on vancomycin/zosyn for treatment of ventilator acquired PNA.
# Pancytopenia: Bone marrow biopsy from OSH reportedly showed 18% blasts with myelodysplasia concerning for new diagnosis of AML.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy was consistent with MDS as opposed to AML.
# Rash: Initial presentation concerning for erythema nodosum.
Per OSH records, biopsy was sent to [**Last Name (un) **] Life Sciences for outside consultation.
Pathology report also consistent with erythema nodosum.
# Diarrhea: She has chronic diarrhea, and arrived from OSH with flexiseal in place.
C. Diff and stool cutlures were negative.
Continue home loperamide as needed for diarrhea upon discharge from the hospital.
UENI showed clot in left arm associated with PICC line.
Line was pulled, and there was resolution of the erythema associated with the left upper extremity DVT.
Follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**] for further evaluation and management of her myelodysplastic syndrome.
Check chem 10 and CBC on Friday [**9-29**] and follow up as needed including electrolyte repletions and blood and platelet transfusions if needed (for a hematocrit < 25 or platelets < 30).
2. loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
6. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
You presented to us with shortness of breath and fevers.
While with us, we determined that you likely suffered the fevers from an infection infection.
Your shortness of breath was attributed to bleeding in your lungs, which stopped during your hospital [**Last Name (un) 10128**].
We also determined that you likely have myelodysplastic syndrome, which will require further workup and treatment as an outpatient.
Until then the dressing on the wound from your biopsy should be changed daily and the wound treated with vaseline.
