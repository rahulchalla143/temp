Admission Date:  [**2159-5-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-6-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-2-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year-old female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets, history of PE, recent radiation therapy and steroids who presented in [**2159-4-2**] with myopathy presumed secondary to sterids, which have been given for her brain mets.
She was later sent to rehab, but returned early in [**Month (only) 547**] with increased cough with exertion with fever to 101.
She was treated with Levaquin given her temperatures and differential diagnosis of increased PE burden load, infections or pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer.
The patient did not experience improvement in her symptoms and was readmitted on [**5-21**] with continued dyspnea and fevers.
Review of CTA showed no PE, but there was ground glass opacities on CT, so PCP was considered highly unlikely given her recent history of steroid use.
She was given Bactrim and she had improvement in the shortness of breath after her Bactrim was started and improved room air sats and was sent home on Bactrim.
Chest x-ray showed a question of left lung opacity.
Currently the patient is short of breath without chest pain or dysphagia.
Breast cancer left side diagnosed in [**2129**] status post [**2150**] mastectomy with 5 out of 9 positive lymph nodes.
She had diagnosed brain mets in [**2159-3-4**] right side cerebella and parietal for which she was treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and Decadron.
History of pulmonary embolism in [**2159-4-2**] treated with only aspirin secondary to brain mets.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit she is febrile with a low grade temperature of 100.1, tachycardic to 110, hypotensive 85/49, tachypneic into the 50s and 60s, 95% on nonrebreather.
Her heart is regular without murmurs, rubs or gallops, slightly tachycardic.
Her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion.
Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray.
The exact etiology of the patient's respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial.
Also she had a history of PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast CA.
Given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz, Levaquin and __________ and Clindamycin.
The patient was initially trialed on BiPAP, but the patient was increasingly dyspneic, increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on [**6-1**].
Earlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she underwent bronchoscopy, which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative.
The patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn.
She was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy.
Unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days.
Later in her Intensive Care Unit course family meetings took place and given the patient's overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become CMO.
However, she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory distress.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially transferred to the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology, respiratory distress and hypotensive.
Later during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back.
Later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads.
Her echocardiogram, however, was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology.
Hematology:  Patient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from [**2159-4-2**].
Earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient's respiratory decompensation.
However, the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors.
Infectious disease:  As mentioned above patient initially hypotension, febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary.
She was negative for PCP and subsequently _____________ was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage.
The patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course.
As her Intensive Care Unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement, continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status.
Metastatic breast cancer end stage.
Respiratory failure unclear etiology, presumed secondary to possible pneumonia, questionable lymphangitic spread.
Sepsis presumed pulmonary source.
