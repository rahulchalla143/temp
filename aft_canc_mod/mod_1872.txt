High-grade large bowel obstruction, with marked dilation of the cecum, ascending and transverse colon up to the sigmoid flexure.
A focally narrowed segment of proximal ascending colon is present just above the cecum, with adjacent extraluminal air and inflammatory soft tissue, worrisome for microperforation.
The narrowing could represent an underlying stricture or stenosis, neoplastic etiology for which remains a differential consideration, particularly in the setting of ulcerative colitis.
Multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections with mild peripheral enhancement with the largest measuring approximately 8 x 16 x 14 cm extending from the left mid abdomen into the pelvis.
