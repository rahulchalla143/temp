Brief Hospital Course: 37F with ALL admitted with neutropenic fever and found to have GNR sepsis, initially requiring pressor support and MICU stay.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #Neutropenic fever: Admitted to ICU from clinic in setting of fever, hypotension and altered mental status.
It was felt that the source of infection was bacterial translocation from the GI tract.

Likely source is transient gut migration, MRCP ruled out hepatic abscess.
Although MRCP was read as suggestive focal cholangitis, this was not thought to be cause of abnormality.
Iron studies significant for ferritin >[**2117**], but this cannot be evaluated properly in the setting of chronic blood transfusions.
#Thrush: Several plaques of thrush noted on posterior oropharynx.
Thought to be [**1-19**] sepsis and subsequent cytokine release.
