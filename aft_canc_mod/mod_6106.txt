male with PMHx of DM, HTN, CAD s/p IMI with 3 stents to RCA and recently diagnosed RCC who is transferred from [**Hospital **]for ongoing work-up of acute renal failure and change in mental status.
He ruled out for an MI with cardiac biomarkers and was felt to be constipated as was illustrated on CT and thought to be due to chronic narcotic use for lower back pain and right hip pain (awaiting hip replacement).
His constipation was treated aggressively with medications and disimpaction with minimal effect.
On day 4 of his hospitalization, he was febrile to 104 with a leukocytosis to 14 and was pan-cultured while Vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically with specific concern for a PIV infection suggested by surrounding erythema and edema.
Blood cultures later grew GPCs in [**2-23**] bottles and chronic foot ulcers were swabbed and reportedly grew staph aureus with pending sensitivities.
In the setting of infection, patient became delirious, noted to be attempting to grab things from the air and talking to people in the room.
Of note, patient was continued on narcotics, reportedly at the wife's insistence given concern for narcotic withdrawal.
Neurology was consulted and recommended a head CT which was unremarkable, leaving them to conclude that the mental status was toxic/metabolic in the setting of infection and narcotic use.
On day 5, patient was noted to develop acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3, up from 1.3 and was also anuric.
CKs were checked to evaluate renal failure from rhabdomyolysis and were not likely contributing at a level of 361.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of his renal failure progressing to the point of needing HD, since [**Hospital3 77641**] no HD facilities.
Discussion with the patient's wife, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, revealed that the patient has never had a seizure disorder and does not drink alcohol.
Additionally, he had a CT scan with contrast at [**Hospital1 2025**] 3 days prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 **]as a part of his RCC work-up and the wife expressed concern for contrast-induced nephropathy.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p IMI in '[**60**] with stents in RCA DM HTN Morbid Obesity OA - awaiting right hip replacement Gout  Social History: Per wife, no alcohol.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.5, BP: 139/110, P: 117, R: 16 O2: 93% AC 600/14/100%/5 General: Awake, but not able to follow commands, responding with one word sentences, occasionally not responsive to sternal rub, noted to have fasiculations of tongue and low-amplitude clonus of hands and legs bilaterally HEENT: NC/AT; PERRLA, EOMI; OP with dry mucous membranes Neck: Obese neck, unable to appreciate JVD Lungs: CTAB CV: S1, S2 nl, no m/r/g appreciated Abdomen: Markedly distended and tympanic to percussion, bowel sounds not appreciated Ext: No c/c/e; Left foot with 2 stage 3 ulcers without surrounding cellulitis and amputation of 2 toes Neuro: Patient largely unable to cooperate.
Lung volumes are low and there are several areas of plate-like atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
[**2165-4-21**] Abd XR: Diffuse colonic dilatation without air within the rectum.
There is a focus of air overlying the surgical bed of the first ray, representing either air within an area of ulceration or subcutaneous emphysema.
There is relative lucency of the adjoining portion of the first metatarsal bony remnant suspicious for osteomyelitis.
Correlation with any previous (outside) radiographs and history of recent debridement is recommended for full assessment.
The posterior calcaneus is obscured by overlying material and not fully evaluated on this examination.
[**2165-4-22**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
[**2165-4-22**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the pattern of widespread alpha range activity alternating with relative suppression of the background without reactivity which is suggestive of an alpha coma pattern.
This abnormality suggests a severe encephalopathy.
There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen and no electrographic seizures were seen in this recording.
[**2165-4-22**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
[**2165-4-22**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity enlargement and preserved global  biventricular systolic function.
[**2165-4-25**] TEE: No intracardiac mass or vegetations.
No significant valvular regurgitation.
Complex, mobile atheroma in descending aorta, simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
No evidence of acute infarction.
Patent major dural venous sinuses.
Decreased signal in the posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus, including the torcular herophili and the right sigmoid sinus, likely relates to slow flow rather than thrombosis given the lack of increased signal on the sagittal T1-weighted sequences.
No definite epidural or subdural abscess collection seen in the thoracolumabr spine.
If this remains of clinical concern, follow-up CT study, dedicated CT- myelography or MRI, when feasible, might be helpful for further evaluation.
No fracture or malalignment.
Mild spondylosis of the thoracolumbar spine, with no canal compromise.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate bibasilar consolidations; differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, aspiration and bacterial pneumonia.
[**2165-5-2**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis and no perinephric collections seen in this very limited mobile renal ultrasound study.
Definite abnormal focus of tracer accumulation in the left foot correlating with known sites of ulceration/infection.
Indeterminate foci in the right proximal thigh medially or scrotum and the soft-tissues of the left knee medially, for which clinical correlation is needed.
Possible nasal infection or ethmoid sinusitis.
[**2165-5-13**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and poorly modulated background indicative of a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform discharges noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male had prolonged hospital course complicated by multiple infections, mental status changes, and renal failure who requires long term antibiotic therapy.
He also required pressors intermittently on the day after presenting but this was ultimately thought to represent a low-baseline blood pressure, and pressors were subsequently discontinued, with MAPs that remained greater than 65.
The source of his infection was unclear but thought to be secondary to left foot ulcers, which also grew MSSA.
This was evaluated by podiatry and vascular, and he was found to have osteomyelitis of the first toe, and would possibly need L BKA for definitive treatment.
There was also concern for encephalopathy given his worsening mental status prior to and after transfer, and neurology was consulted.
An LP was initially deferred because of the unlikelihood of him developing meningitis during his hospitalization at [**Location (un) **], as he did not initially present with symptoms suggestive of this condition.
However, it was later performed and was consistent with bacterial meningitis, and antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.
# Altered mental status: After extubation, patient was delirious, not responding to commands, and with jerking motions of his head.
An MRI/MRV was negative for structural abnormality on [**2165-4-25**], after EEG showed possible alpha-coma waves.
hypodense region in TT2 area of spinal cord:  Intial concern was for abscess with cord compression as patient was febrile with MSSA infection and not moving his lower extremities for several days pre-extubation [**2165-4-30**].
Consider f/u MRI in open MRI scanner as an outpatient.
# Respiratory failure:  He was intubated shortly after ariving at [**Hospital1 18**] because of concern for airway protection in the setting of question seizures, as he had low-amplitude clonic movements of his hands and legs.
EEG obtained showed no epileptiform activity.
# Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to transfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal failure.
Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine was consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no clear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.
He had to be started on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia.
The patient had another dialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent self-removal secondary to agitation.
# Hypertension: After septic picture resolved, patient was hypertensive to 200s/80s.
Pt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer with the current medication regimen at discharge.
- Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted and stated they would defer amputation and await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.
- no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on floor on vancomycin - pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]  # Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required large doses of narcotics prior to admission.
# Large bowel obstruction:  A KUB demonstrated a distended transverse colon concerning for ileus in the setting of large narcotic use for R hip pain.
He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan was started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.
# CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on ASA/plavix.
# DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of elevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma: Is seen at [**Hospital1 2025**].
# Communication: [**Name (NI) **] wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77643**] - cell  # Patient was made DNR, but okay to re-intubate for respiratory failure post-extubation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
