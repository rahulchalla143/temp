He suffered from multiple medical problems, including untreatable acute myelocytic leukemia, severe graft vs host disease, acute kidney injury, and hypoxia likely due to pneumonia.
#Hypoxemia: Pt presented with hypoxemia with O2 sats 89-93% on 50% ventimask, and hypoxia continued to be a problem throughout this hospitalization.
The etiology of this hypoxemia was thought to be secondary to pneumonia (see below), PE, graft versus host disease, leukemic infiltration or transfusion related acute lung injury.
Gradual improvement while on stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics pointed towards leukemic infiltration, GVHD or pneumonia as the cause.
Chest CT showed central bronchial wall thickening, consistent with small airway disease.
No consolidations noted.
After respiratory status improved (and other issues stabilized) the pt was discharged to [**Date Range 3242**], but later re-presented to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and increased oxygen requirement.
At that time, WBC bumped from 10 to 15 with predominantly lymphocytes and monocyte lineages changing, which was suspicious for leukemic infiltration.
Pt was without PNA on imaging but persistent hypoxia and cough in this chronically immunosuppresed patient led to agressive antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia and pneumonia prophylaxis.
Induced sputums were collected multiple times but cultures were consistently negative, apart from one sputum culture growing yeast (subsequently negative).
The patient became acutely hypoxic on his most recent stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after an episode of emesis.
CXR was concernign for aspiration, and the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened to include meorpenem.
#GVHD: Patient has suspected intestinal GVHD, with copious volume (100cc/hour) guaiac-negative liquid stool.
This was discontinued when pt became fluid overloaded with bibasilar crackles and elevated JVD.
Given presentation with large-volume liquid stools and cultures negative for shigella, campylobacter, yersinia, and c diff toxin, he was started on stress-dose solumedrol 60mg [**Hospital1 **], made NPO and TPN was initiated for bowel rest.
Loperamide and opium tincture were startedv for symptomatic control.
CT scan of the abdomen showed submucosal fat-deposition and/or edema involving a long segment of mid-to-distal small bowel and ascending colon, consistent with graft-versus-host disease.
He was continued on Methylprednisolone, CellCept, and etancercept during his second stay in the ICU, plus prophylactic Flagyl given risk of developing C diff colitis.
No active chemotherapy was begun given the patient's clinical status.
A urine sediment also showed crystals on the urine which were concerning given that the patient was on acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis.
The patient also had an elevated urine Protein:Creatine ratio of 0.3, suggesting an intrarenal cause for the patient's ARF.
Early during admission, given his thrombocytopenia, he had a head CT to evaluation for intracranial bleed but this was not seen.
However, during ICU readmission his mental status was once again low-baseline, moaning with exhalation and unable to communicate with ICU staff.
The patient's rate was mostly sinus tachycardia, but would intermittently convert to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
For episodes of sinus tachycardia, the patient received 1L boluses of fluid in the setting of his fluid losses from diarrhea.
For episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, he patient intermittently received IV diltiazem or metoprolol.
#Neutropenia: On neutropenic precautions for absolute neutropenia on admission but developed only low-grade temperatures.
To review: initially given Vancomycin/Zosyn for possible neutropenic fever with a suspected pulmonary source.
And given recent history of cdiff and copious diarrhea, PO vancomycin and IV flagyl started as empiric therapy for severe C diff and continued after stool cultures negative x3.
Prophylaxis with acyclovir and fluconazole continued; fluconazole later switched to Micafungin.
Tobramycin was never added in part due to the patient's acute renal failure and his clinical picture: he did not develop fever.
ANCs steadily rose throughout his first ICU stay; during the second ICU admission labs showed an elevated white count without neutropenia.
No signs of active bleeding.
Family (brother and mother) changed pt's code status from Full Code to DNR/DNI on [**2176-9-1**] in context of worsening unexplained hypoxia on broad-spectrum antibiotics, poor mental status, and worsening leukemia prognosis.
