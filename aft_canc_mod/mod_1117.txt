Admission Date:  [**2182-5-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2182-5-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-8-12**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU EAST  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year-old woman with a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastases to bone, axilla, thyroid with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2144**] and recent right bronchial stent with Photofrin injection in [**4-/2182**] and a right subclavian deep venous thrombosis previously on Lovenox and Coumadin who presented for a bronchoscopy and stent placement.
Since that time the patient has been progressively more short of breath with increased dyspnea on exertion from room to room.
She denied fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
The patient reports resolved hemoptysis and now persistent nonproductive cough.
The patient also reports two weeks of occasional dull cranial occipital pain.
The patient was CT angio on [**2182-5-10**], which did not reveal a pulmonary embolus, but did show tumor progression with compression of trachea and bronchi and a right subclavian deep venous thrombosis.
The patient was started at that time on Lovenox and Coumadin, which was discontinued on [**5-12**] in preparation for her procedure.
She denies any hearing changes, dysphagia, bowel and bladder incontinence or back pain.
Non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2178**], status post right lobectomy in [**2178**] with metastases in [**2182**] in right axilla, thyroid and bone.
Ventricular irritability including premature ventricular contractions.
Right and left subclavian deep venous thrombosis.
Zofran causes syncope.
No occipital masses or tenderness.
Neck revealed no JVD or lymphadenopathy, but a subclavian paratracheal mass.
Lungs were coarse bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right with occasional rhonchi.
Normal S1 and S2 with a 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She did have right upper extremity edema with trace pitting.
Babinski was unable to quantified and she had no spinal tenderness.
CT angiogram on [**5-10**] revealed no PE, but did reveal extensive mediastinal disease with distortion and compression and invasion of the airway with interval increase since [**4-6**].
Mass source marked worsening at the carina and main stem bronchi, right subclavian and bronchocephalic vein.
Small pulmonary nodules likely lymphangitic and hematogenous metastases as well as a right chest wall mass and right breast lesion with skeletal metastases.
IMPRESSION:  This was a 64 year-old woman with nonsmall cell lung cancer and right subclavian deep venous thrombosis here for stent placement secondary to disease progression.
Pulmonary, nonsmall cell lung cancer with increased mediastinal burden, increased shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with recent right bronchial stent placement.
No evidence of PE by CT angio.
The patient was brought to interventional pulmonary Operating Room on [**5-15**] where a bronchoscopy revealed significant obstruction to the trachea at main stem as well as in the left main bronchus.
The patient had a stent placed in the trachea as well as in the left main bronchus and the right upper lobe revealed obstruction in the posterior apical and anterior segments.
The patient was extubated and was reintubated for hypoxia and tachypnea and attempt at second extubation was done, however, the patient was unable to remain extubated and was reintubated for hypoxia and tachypnea.
A repeat flexible bronchoscopy was performed in the PACU with concerns for left upper lobe collapse with question of upper lobe obstruction from stent, but this was not clearly visualized.
Therefore the patient remained intubated with etiology as probably worsening of large airway obstruction.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for palliative radiation therapy to her mediastinal mass for which she received on [**5-17**].
The patient, however, continued to have worsening oxygen requirements as well as had respiratory acidosis and at this time the patient and her family discussed with the attending changing her aim of care toward comfort measures only.
I was called to see the patient after telemetry noted asystole and no blood pressure.
Autopsy was deferred by the patient's family and the cause of death was respiratory distress secondary to metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Deep venous thrombosis:  The patient had a deep venous thrombosis on the site of the Port-A-Cath on the right.
Hypotension in PACU in the setting of Propofol.
The patient's A line did not always correlate with her manual cuff, but her maps remained above 65 until her aim of care changed at which time the patient became hypotensive.
