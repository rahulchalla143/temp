History of Present Illness: 82 year old man with a 1 year history of mitral regurgitation/ partial flail mitral leaflet.
He states that he has had chronic dyspnea on exertion, although over the past month or so it has become significantly pronounced associated with PND/orthopnea.
He recently went to see his primary physician who found him to be in atrial fibrillation and started coumadin.
On [**2193-6-11**] he was admitted to [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 620**] Campus for CHF exacerbation.
Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Severe pulmonary hypertension noted.
[**2193-6-13**] Persantine ETT: ventricular couplets noted at peak heart rate.
The preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was reported as a fixed mild lateral defect as well as a fixed mild inferior defect- EF 48%.
Earlier in the week he was finding it enormously difficult to sleep due to severe orthopnea/PND.
He denies any significant history of chest discomfort or palpitations.
LMCA mild disease, LAD 40% distal lesion, LCx 40% after OM1, LCA mild luminal irregularities.
Summary: Severe biventricular diastolic dysfxn with severe pulm HTN.
Patient has no complaints.
Denies SOB or CP.

No gross failure is seen allowing for the supine position.
No infiltrates are present.
There continues to be a small left pleural effusion as well as basilar atelectasis versus possible consolidation.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2193-6-21**] EKG Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Intraventricular conduction defect of right bundle-branch block type.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes - cannot rule out myocardial ischemia.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes persist.
Small right pleural effusion.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
LMCA had mild disease.
LAD had a 40% stenosis in the distal vessel.
LCx had a 40% lesion after OM1.
RCA had mild luminal irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (80/43 mmHg).
Filling pressures were markedly elevated (RA 17 mmHg, RVEDP 17 mmHg, PCWP 26 mmHg with "v" waves to 40 mmHg).
There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
Administration of nitroglycerin 200 mg IV resulted in a mild  decrease in PA systolic pressure to 70 mmHg, with a concomitant decrease in the systemic systolic pressure to 85 mmHg.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was admitted to then [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical Center on [**2193-6-17**] for further management of his congestive heart failure.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed mild coronary artery disease, severe biventricular dysfunction, severe pulmonary hypertension and severe mitral regurgitation.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for severe pulmonary hypertension.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which showed no significant stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
The hematology service was consulted for thrombocytopenia and found evidence of myelodysplasia likely secondary to chemotherapy.
No contraindication to surgery was noted after discussion with his oncologist.
