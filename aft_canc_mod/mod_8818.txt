[**2110-10-23**] found to have pancreatic mass after 1 month abdominal pain.
For the past [**11-24**] weeks pt reports no appetite and weight loss of 13 pounds total.
She has been extremely constipated and with each bowel movement she experiences severe cramping pain [**9-1**] in severity located in the left lower quadrant and sometimes also in the right lower quadrant.
Denies melena/hematochezia, has nausea but no vomiting.
States that pain goes down to 2/10 in the periods between bowel movements.
Her stools have changed in caliber and are now small hard pellets.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Oncologic history: - Ms. [**Known lastname **] initially presented in [**2110-10-23**] with one month of lower abdominal pain.
- ultrasound of her abdomen on [**2110-10-23**] which showed a mass within the pancreas and a concerning liver lesion.
- CT scan on [**2110-10-24**] showed a large mass within the body of pancreas as well as several soft tissues within the anterior abdominal cavity likely metastasis, innumerable pulmonary nodules.
Her father died of emphysema, and she has a brother who is healthy.

IMAGING: KUB [**2110-11-12**] FINDINGS: Upright and supine views of the abdomen show a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence for ileus or obstruction.
There is a moderate amount of stool present extending to the cecum.
No intraperitoneal air is seen.
Innumerable small rounded opacities within the lungs are metastatic foci as demonstrated on previous CT.
There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
CXR [**2110-11-14**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral multiple nodular opacities, left side more than right, may reflect pre-existing nodular metastatic disease, better assessed on the CT torso study dated [**2110-10-24**] and if any of the opacities represent lung infection, is very difficult to determine based on the chest x-ray alone.
Appropriate treatment with followup radiographs will be helpful to assess for the interval changes if clinical concern for infection persists.
[**2110-11-6**] biopsy of pancreatic mass: POSIIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with adenocarcinoma .
There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are mildly prominent lymph nodes within the mediastinum, none of which are pathologically enlarged.
There is no pericardial effusion.
These nodules are most consistent with metastatic disease.
There are no pleural effusions.
There are no hepatic masses or lesions.
There is mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilation.
Within the body and tail of the pancreas is a 71 x 23 mm mass (5, 56).
It encases the splenic artery, which has mild stenosis, but is patent.
There is also occlusion of the right anterior portal vein and the left portal vein.
There is attenuation of the right posterior portal vein, but it is patent.
This is likely due to infiltrative disease of the hepatic hilum from the primary tumor, or due to diffuse adenopathy within the hilum.
In the anterior abdominal cavity, there are several small soft tissue nodules, which is likely metastatic disease.
There is a 12 x 8 mm soft tissue nodule anterior to the stomach (3B, 90).
There are other small nodules in the area which are less than 5 mm (3A, 28).
There is no mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
This is likely a benign congenital or acquired cyst.
PELVIS: The large bowel is unremarkable without mass, strictures, or focal wall thickening.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid within the pelvis.
There is no evidence of drop metastases in the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
There are mild degenerative changes of the spine.
Large mass within the body of the pancreas is likely a primary pancreatic tumor.
Occlusion of the splenic vein and the right anterior hepatic vein and left hepatic vein, likely secondary to tumor invasion or encasement.
Several soft tissue nodules within the anterior abdominal cavity, likely metastases.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules, likely diffuse metastases.
New diffuse bowel wall thickening and mucosal hyperemia, likely infectious or inflammatory.
No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
Pancreatic body/tail mass with varices and adenopathy.
Splenic vein occlusion, portal vein attenuation, and moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation.
Diffuse mesenteric and omental implants.
Innumerable pulmonary metastases.
Narrowing and attenuation of right portal vein.
[**11-14**] CHEST CT  Bilateral multiple nodular opacities, left side more than right, may reflect pre-existing nodular metastatic disease, better assessed on the CT torso study dated [**2110-10-24**] and if any of the opacities represent lung infection, is very difficult to determine based on the chest x-ray alone.
Appropriate treatment with followup radiographs will be helpful to assess for the interval changes if clinical concern for infection persists.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o F w/ pancreatic cancer discovered in [**11-2**] who presented with 1-2 weeks of crampy abdominal pain in setting of known metastatic disease.
#  abdominal pain - pt with crampy abdominal pain during bowel movements but resolved when not stooling.
Felt initially to be secondary to partial bowel obstruction in setting of known metastatic disease.
As the obstruction appeared to be lower down - two small lesions suspicious for metastasis had been seen in the lower pelvis on CT - flex sig was considered but pt was neutropenic and thrombocytopenic (see below) so no rectal manipulation was possible including enemas.
The morning after her admission she developed watery diarrhea, with imaging c/w enteritis.
Her abdominal pain persisted as dull cramping in the lower abdominal that was responsive to opioids.
CT A/P  revealed diffuse colitis and enteritis on [**11-14**] with no signs of mesenteric ischemia.
Colonoscopy was contra-indicated in setting of neutropenia.
# hypotension/sepsis - day after admission pt reported one episode of watery diarrhea in the morning without blood.
Midday she went to the bathroom and had another high output episode of watery diarrhea, began feeling dizzy, and had 1 episode of emesis (bilious, nonbloody).
No obvious source of bleeding and this hypotension developed in the setting of diarrhea/vomiting/decreased PO intake and new pain medications having been recently administered including ativan.
Despite these interventions her blood pressure crept down to mid - high 60s systolic even with aggressive fluid resuscitation and she developed tachycardia with HR up to 120s.
Her elevated lactate resolved with fluids.
There were no other signs of hypoperfusion and patient mentated well with good UOP.
She was treated with empiric 7 day course of vanc, cefepime, flagyl for possible GI source.
She had a normal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim which rules out adrenal insufficiency.
# Febrile neutropenia: She was febrile to 101.9 in the MICU.
Given treatment with neupogen and no fevers or new localizing source of infection, limited infectious work-up was undertaken, including blood and urine cultures, which were pending at discharge.
#  pancreatic cancer - 1st chemo sesion had been roughly 1 week prior to admission, received FOLFIRINOX.
Given symptoms of abdominal obstruction and known metastatic disease it was felt most likely that disease was progressing.
She was admitted for pain and symptom control.
# Hiccups Patient developed persistent hiccups a few days prior to discharge, likely secondary to diaphragmatic irritation.
We ultimately chose to treat with gabapentin, which would also improve control of chronic back pain.
# Acute kidney injury: [**11-15**] urine lytes showed FENa 0.31%, consistent with prerenal etiology from patient's clinical picture of negligible PO intake and ongoing diarrheal losses.
# Mucositis: Patient had small blisters on lower lip, arising in setting of recent chemotherapy.
#  transaminitis - pt with elevated alk phos, ALT/AST, lipase.
Likely [**12-25**] presence of tumor in pancreas and known hepatic disease.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: pancreatic cancer, colitis Secondary Diagnosis: chronic back pain, hypotension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and diarrhea.
You were found to have colitis, likely secondary to chemotherapy.
Your diarrhea and abdominal pain improved slowly, and your appetite also improved prior to discharge.
While you were here, we decided not to continue treatment for your cancer.
You will be seen in the outpatient setting by the Hospice team regarding further recommendations to keep you comfortable and pain free.
