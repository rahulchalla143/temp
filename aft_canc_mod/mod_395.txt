PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
History of malignant melanoma as previously described.
Status post ventral hernia repair.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where he was noted to have congestive heart failure by chest x-ray, was started on Heparin drip, Lasix for diuresis and he subsequently improved.
During the cardiac catheterization, the patient developed worsening pulmonary edema and subsequent respiratory failure and required emergent intubation for this.
The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and the patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] emergently for a coronary artery bypass graft and a mitral valve repair.
In the operating room upon performing sternotomy, it was noted the patient had a fair number of darkly colored nodules as well as a dark rubbery spot on the heart.
These tissues were sent to the pathology department with the subsequent frozen section coming back positive for melanoma.
In the operating room, the patient [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass graft times two, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, as well as a mitral valve repair.
On postoperative day number two after the patient developed atrial fibrillation, the patient was started on Amiodarone and Lopressor after the pressors and inotropes had been weaned off.
On postoperative day number three, the patient began working with physical therapy.
He had no further atrial fibrillation.
By postoperative day number six, the patient had completed a level V with physical therapy and was able to ambulate 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty and at that time had been cleared for discharge to home by physical therapy; however, due to the patient's drainage from his sternal incision, the patient remained in the hospital until postoperative day number eight at which time he was cleared from a cardiac surgery standpoint.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Sternal incision is clean and dry.
There is a small amount, less than one half centimeter, of erythema at the distal portion of the incision.
The left lower extremity vein harvest site has a small amount of serous drainage, no erythema and no pain on palpation.
