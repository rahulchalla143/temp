At the end of [**Month (only) 359**], she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after a laryngeal mass was found on imaging for evaluation of hoarseness.
Biopsy demonstrated invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
She had dysphagia and failed her swallow evaluation, so a PEG tube was placed.
Today, the covering MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was called because of an increased oxygen requirement.
On ROS, she endorses a cough productive of sputum and a sore throat that comes and goes.
No fevers or chills.
+20 pound weight loss prior to last hospitalization in [**Month (only) **].
On exam, she was noted to have some white-colored sputum.
Past Medical History: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, diagnosed [**2153-11-11**] s/p Trach and PEG [**2153-11-11**] Schizoaffective Disorder with concern for poor ability to make medical decisions - evaluated by psychiatry [**11/2153**] with plan to make decisions jointly between patient, her sister [**Name (NI) 382**] and her mother Coronary Artery Disease s/p MI at age 34 Hypertension Hyperlipidemia COPD, not on home oxygen Crohn's Disease Neurogenic Bladder Osteoarthritis with Back Pain   Social History: Prior to her illness, she lived with her mother, who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].
She used to work as a nurse's aide but stopped because of her psychiatric disease.
Smoked [**1-12**] PPD for 30+ years and quit at the time of diagnosis of her laryngeal cancer.
Father had heart disease.
Physical Exam: VS:   98.2   90/63    88    13   92% on 35% by Trach mask GENERAL: Pleasant, thin woman in no distress.
No scleral icterus.
No air leak appreciated on exhalation.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation without crackles or wheezes.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
4/5 strength in UE b/l, both distal and proximal and [**3-15**] in proximal LE b/l and [**4-15**] in distal LE.
CXR [**12-19**] Question retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration versus early pneumonia.
No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aneurysm.
Bibasilar consolidations seen dependently with scattered impacted airways.
This confluence of findings is most consistent with aspiration.
Prominent subcarinal lymph node (12mm), appearing new from [**Month (only) **].
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal septum and apex.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution).
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo woman with laryngeal cancer s/p trach but not ventilator dependent admitted with hypoxia and hypotension.
# HYPOXEMIA:  Felt to be most likely COPD exacerbation versus mucous plugging.
Aspiration pneumonitis was also considered, as patient may have difficulty managing secretions.
She also had a reported sputum culture from [**2153-12-12**] growing Pseudomonas, but her presentation was felt to be less consistent with pneumonia given her lack of fever and leukocytosis.
Based on the sensitivity results of the sputum culture, her antibiotics can be narrowed to a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as appropriate.
Other causes of hypoxia were ruled out as follows; CTA was negative for PE, physical exam and TTE were not consistent with heart failure, and influenza DFA was negative.
# HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Blood pressure in clinic last week was 128/75.
Most likely explanation for her hypotension is hypovolemia given that she did not receive receive tube feeds on the day of admission, and appeared dry clinically.
She had a normal lactate and remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission without any evidence of end organ dysfunction.
She was treated with IV fluid boluses and her hypotension resolved.
[**Month (only) 116**] be due to functional decline in setting of long hospitalization and new malignancy.
Electrolytes remained within normal limits and the patient had no focal neurologic deficits.
# HTN and possible h/o MI:  EKG at baseline and no evidence of any cardiac dysfunction at present.
# Anemia:  Baseline hct 30-33, hct at admission was 26.7.
Recent iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
No evidence of acute blood loss.
