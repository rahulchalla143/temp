Admission Date:  [**2171-12-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-12-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2128-7-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU/[**Location (un) **] MEDICINE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post V fibrillation arrest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma with course complicated by duodenal and pancreatic metastases causing biliary and small bowel obstruction requiring total parenteral nutrition who presented with worsening abdominal pain on the day prior to admission.
He complained of diffuse diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
On arrival to the Emergency Department the patient appeared pale and blue and then promptly when into ventricular tachycardia and V fibrillation arrest.
Metastatic melanoma status post DTIC times three, last echocardiogram two and a half weeks prior to admission.
Metastases to duodenum causing biliary and mechanical small bowel obstruction on total parenteral nutrition status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biliary stent.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for breast cancer in the family.
Abdomen was soft, mildly tender.
Electrocardiogram number one showed a wide complex tachycardia, number two showed a questionable sides and a wide complex tachycardia at 300 beats per minute.
Number three was sinus tach at 130 beats per minute with left axis deviation.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT of the torso showed worsening metastatic disease in liver, pancrease, small bowel and mesentery.
Pancreatic mass was compressing the IVC.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 43 year-old male with metastatic melanoma and abdominal pain status post V fibrillation arrest.
V fibrillation arrest status post resuscitation:  It was initially thought that the V fibrillation arrest was due to hypokalemia and may have been exacerbated by prolonged QT from Compazine.
Sepsis:  The patient became profoundly hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s and started on neo-synephrine after initially being tachycardic and hypotensive.
Since some of the hypotension was attributed to Propofol, but most likely it was due to septic physiology with a fever of 104, warm extremities and neutropenia.
A chest CT also showed new bilateral infiltrates not seen on chest x-ray and it was thought that the patient was beginning to develop ARDS.
Blood cultures were sent, which eventually grew out strep.
Hypoxic respiratory failure from early ARDS or aspiration pneumonia:  H was started on mechanical ventilation with a low volume regulation strategy.
Throughout the course of the night the patient became increasingly hemodynamically unstable.
A cordis catheter was emergently placed and the patient was still aggressively fluid resuscitated without resolution of his hypotension.
He then became bradycardic and had a PEA arrest.
After multiple discussions with the family we decided to stop CPR secondary to medical futility.
Metastatic melanoma.
Gram positive sepsis from unclear source most likely from PICC line.
Septic shock.
