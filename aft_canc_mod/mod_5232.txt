BONE SCAN  [**2120-4-4**] Whole body images of the skeleton obtained in anterior and posterior projections demonstrate intense tracer uptake at the right hip consistent with recent fracture.
There is also intense tracer uptake at T12, consistent with recent fracture (as a compression deformity was seen at this level on recent chest radiograph, age indeterminate).
A second small focus of uptake is seen just inferior to the large amount of uptake at T12, possibly within the right side of L1, indeterminate in etiology.
These may represent degenerative changes or traumatic injuries.

Her hospital course was also complicated by paroxysmal AV block, s/p pacemaker placement, pacer site infection and pacer removal.
She also had evidence of hungry bone syndrome.
# Primary Hyperparathyoidism: Elevated PTH at 217 and parathyroid MIBI suggestive of primary parathyroid adenoma although u/s did not localize parathyroid adenoma.
Maligancy w/u included negative SPEP/UPEP and no lytic lesions on imaging.
Calcium levels remained elevated despite IVFs, lasix prn, cinecalcet in an attempt to lower calcium levels.
Pathology from hemithyridectomy consistent with Cellular parathyroid gland, consistent with adenoma or hyperplasia.
Bisphosphonates were held per endocrine recs given risk for hypocalcemia post surgery.
s/p hemithroidectomy, patient showed signs of hungry bone syndrome and electrolytes were repleted as needed.
Per endocrine, bisphosphinates should be held for at least 1 year post surgery given risk for hypothyroidism.
The endocrine fellow will go over the labs and tell if the patients calcium repletion or not.
# Unilateral parotitis: Most likely obstruction [**3-8**] hypercalcemia and subsequently leading to infection.
CT scan shows diffuse inflammation.
A repeat thyroid US showed spongiform nodule.
Pathology from thryoid nodule is consistent with adenomatous goiter with focal cystic degeneration.
Renal US suggestive of medullary nephrocalcinosis.
#Paroxysmal AV block:pt s/p pacer placement.
EP placed a drain at pacer site and have been pulling it out a centimeter every day.
pt will be sent out on [**Doctor Last Name **] of heart monitor and will follow will Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 4 weeks .
# L ulnar fracture and R hip fx: s/p L ulna repair (POD #0 [**2120-4-8**]).
Ortho does not plan to do R hip repair in the immediate future [**3-8**] old fracture status.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Pathological L ulnar fracture and Right Hip Fracture - Primary hyperparathyroidism - Hypercalcemia - Vitamin D Deficiency - Thyroid nodules - Right hip fracture - Acute Parotitis - Diastolic Heart Failure - Glucose intolerance - Acute Renal Failure - Blood Loss Anemia - Anemia of Chronic Inflammation - Hyponatremia - Delirium - Gout  Secondary diagnosis: - Hypertension - Congestive heart failure - Hypercholesterolemia - Deafness - Gout - Depression - Obesity   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you broke your left arm.
You were also found to have a right hip fracture and the orthopedic doctor will see you in his clinic to determine the management.
Also while in the hospital, your calcium level in your blood was high because you have a parathyroid growth.
