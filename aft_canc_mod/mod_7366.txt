Yesterday morning patient started having back pain, dysuria and low grade fevers at home.
Patient presented to OSH on [**2158-6-16**] with fever, back pain, leukocytosis, and UTI and was initially admitted to medical floor.
He had a renal ultrasound showing bilateral hydronephrosis which is to a similar degree as a retrograde pyelogram in [**2156**].
While at OSH on [**2158-6-17**] at 1:00 AM patient became somnolent and hypoxic with O2 sats in 70s on medicine floor.
He had increased work of breathing and O2 sats of 45 - 55% on NRB.
A CXR showed a large right-sided infiltrate consistent with aspiration pneumonia vs. mucus plug.
He required frequent suctioning for copious secretions.
His back pain is somewhat better.
He complains of some cough and shortness of breath but this is also improved from earlier today.

[**2158-6-19**]  Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2158-6-20**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is a patchy area of increased opacity in the left lower lung.
It is unclear how much of this is due to overlapping rib shadows, but attention should be paid to this region on followup.
There is an intravenous access in the distal cephalic vein.
Small calcifications were noted in the brachial and radial arteries bilaterally.
[**2158-6-19**] TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly elongated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dilated ascending aorta.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified .
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year-old gentleman with history of bladder cancer with bilateral ureteral stents, CKD Stage IV, PVD s/p b/l LE amputations, CAD who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU from [**Hospital1 **] with MRSA pyelonephritis, likely aspiration pneumonia with acidosis and hypoxia, and NSTEMI thought to be due demand ischemia in setting of infection.
CXR showed RLL pneumonia (required Bipap at OSH, but discontinued on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]).
In the ICU, he was treated with vancomycin and zosyn (latter changed to cefepime) to cover both urinary and respiratory pathogens.
Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF >55% with dilated descending aorta, but no significant valvular disease or hypokinesis.
Concern was for complicated cystitis/pyelonephritis as patient has bladder cancer and ureteral stents.
Patient has previous history of VRE UTIs.
# aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis: This was likely the cause of his dyspnea/hypoxia, and R-sided infiltrate was seen on CXR at OSH.
Patient initially required non-invasive ventilation for respiratory acidosis and required frequent suctioning for secretions.
RESOLVING OR CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# NSTEMI: Had NSTEMI at OSH in setting of hypotension and infections.
Patient with h/o CAD s/p MI.
Patient does not know if he has had a previous cardiac catheterization/PCI.
Following acute decompensation at OSH, patient with elevated troponin at OSH to 6.46.
F/u ECHO showed no new wall motion abnormalities.
# CKD: Patient with CKD [**2-23**] diabetic nephropathy and obstruction (bladder cancer).
Prior to PICC placement, pt was eval'd by renal eval regarding possible HD access; renal requested b/l UE venous mapping and recommended PICC placement on dominant (pt's LEFT) arm.
# Diarrhea: Improved.
Pt had worsening diarrhea since being admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].
Flexiseal was placed due to high vol stool in non-ambulatory pt; loperamide given negative cdif, and diarrhea improved quickly thereafter.
Remained asymptomatic throughout even when having elevated BP's.
# Hypokalemia: Improved.
In MICU, had hypokalemia, potentially due to sudden increase in liquid stool output.
[**Month (only) 116**] be even more total body hypokalemic than think due to acidosis which should be shifting potassium out of cells.
# Metabolic acidosis: Improved.
In MICU, had hyperchloremic non-anion gap acidosis.
No hypercarbia.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have been due to worsening loose stool overnight with subsequent GI bicarb loss.
Patient was guaiac negative at OSH, no evidence of RP bleed on OSH CT abdomen.
Likely anemia of chronic disease vs. iron deficiency anemia (patient with chronic hematuria).
Fe studies showed low serum Fe, low TIBC, high ferritin; c/w anemia of inflammatory block/chronic dz.
*Per ID, if ureteral stents are not changed within a reasonable amount of time, pt will likely need to transition to an oral suppressive [**Doctor Last Name 360**] until stents may be changed (eg cephalexin).
