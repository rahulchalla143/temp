Admission Date:  [**2160-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-2-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-10-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4277**] Chief Complaint: Massive hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Pulmonary angiography, s/p bilateral bronchial artery embolization 3.
Curretage right proximal and distal femur lesions  History of Present Illness: 66 yo M with history of thyroid ca metastatic to lungs bilaterally and to brain and bone, presents to the ED after presenting to OSH with hemoptysis.
He was transferred immediately to [**Hospital1 18**] and once arrived had multiple cupfuls of hemoptysis.
Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-28**] with hemoptysis (two small episodes) for which he underwent bronchoscopic evaluation which demonstrated a likelihood of suspicious lesions in the right upper lobe and left superior lingula with no active bleeding.
Ortho was consulted to evaluate patient's current status of known lytic lesions in C1.
On review of his past oncologic history, he was diagnosed in [**2149**] when he developed significant snoring related problems that required seeking medical attention.
He saw an otorhinolaryngologist who at that time reported that he had neck swelling which was contributing to his snoring and which was likely related to a thyroid process.
He then reported that he had this swelling for about 10 years prior to this presentation, but a workup had not been performed at that time.
He subsequently received radioactive iodine therapy for this disease and appeared to have tolerated it well.
His treatment was complicated by atrial fibrillation, and was placed on atenolol.
He subsequently required repetition of his radioactive iodine treatments because of elevated thyroglobulin levels as well as because of the appearance of new lung metastases.
In the last few months, the patient developed right-sided chest discomfort on exertion localized to the right rib cage.
He was started on coumadin in [**1-28**] for a PE and in the summer of [**2159**], the patient had two episodes of hemoptysis during exertion, which required a bronchoscopic evaluation and ablation of the lesion.
Pathology from this lesion demonstrated metastatic carcinoma of a thyroid origin.
He was admitted to the MICU for further work-up and management after rigid bronchoscopy.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Thyroid Ca HTN Atrial Fibrillation Pulmonary Embolus [**1-28**] - Anticoagulated with coumadin; has two small lesions on MRI head c/w mets but not contraindications  to anticoag.
Hypothyroidism  Social History: Lives with wife.

IMAGING: CXR: Inumerable small nodules c/w mets with marked progression since [**7-28**], fluffy hilar infiltrates bilaterally c/w hemorrhage given clinical scenario of hemoptysis.
[**2160-1-18**] Pulmonary Angiography: No active extravasation but multiple hypervascular masses, likely metastases.
PET [**11-28**]: IMPRESSION: Diffuse abnormal FDG uptake in the lungs and bone consistent with metastatic disease, which compared to prior exam shows slight increase in disease burden.
Again noted are the large lytic lesions in the right femoral head/neck and C1 which remains high risk for fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hemoptysis: Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] was admitted from an outside hospital with massive hemoptysis.
Pulmonary angiogram on [**2160-1-18**] showed no active extravasation but multiple hypervascular masses, likely metastases.
Per Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt will likely not be a candidate for continued sorafenib therapy.
The patient underwent pulmonary angiogram [**2160-1-18**] which showed no active extravasation but was notable for multiple hypervascular masses, thought to likely represent metastases.
As his hematocrit remained stable and he was without further episodes of hemoptysis x 48 hours, he was transferred to OMED for consideration of chemotherapy.
On the floor, the patient began again to have small volume hemoptysis (dark blood mixed with sputum per report) and was noted to be hypoxic to 76-77% on 4L NC which improved to the 90% on NRB.
Labs notable for Hct decrease trend from 29.5->28.5->26.5.
CXR prelim read with slight increase in diffuse fluffy bilateral opacities but otherwise unchanged.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for close monitoring and consideration of repeat rigid bronchoscopy, which was ultimately not pursued (his more significant problem in the [**Name (NI) 153**] was [**Name (NI) 5509**] as below).
As his admission proceeded and he was otherwise stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he continued to have some low-volume hemoptysis which suggested that some portion of his prior hemoptysis was due to the malignancy itself rather than other factors.
Despite widespread and progressive metastasis, he has been able to maintain a fairly active lifestyle.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] has a history of AFib and was on atenolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control (as well as BP control).
Atenolol was held upon admission for relative hypotension in teh setting of hemoptysis.
It was restarted on [**2160-1-19**] when he developed tachycardia with HR > 200.
The pt remained asymptomatic during this time beyond complaints of palpitations and SBPs did not drop lower than 87.
When transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had a number of additional episodes of atrial fibrillation with [**Hospital Unit Name 5509**] which were controlled with IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol.
Metoprolol was discontinued because of some intermittent hypotension.
Anticoagulation was not started because of his hemoptysis.
# Cytopenia: Patient with anemia (baseline Hct 30) and thrombocytopenia, possibly from bone marrow supression from malignancy and chemo.
Low Hct is also likely due to marrow suppression, and prior hemoptysis.
#Pain - Seen by pain service.
He has significant pain secondary to bony mets and pathologic fracture of R femoral neck.
# Femoral fracture: Likely while undergoing attempts at electrical cardioversion, Mr [**Known lastname 20598**] [**Last Name (Titles) 18095**] a pathologic R femoral neck fracture.
For the patient, the most troubling issue with the fracture is that it caused him significant pain with any movement.
Hypotension: pt had multiple episodes of hypotension during his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay requiring fluid bolus, though has been stable x 72 hours.
Possible etiologies included sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or fentanyl/midazolam causing hypotension.
Sepsis seems less likely given negative BCx and no clear source.
Adrenal insufficiency has been evaluated with cortisol level, and given low albumin, endo feels a cortisol level of 20.5 rules out adrenal insufficiency.
Cervical spine metastasis followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] of Neurosurgery.
Patient was taken to the OR on [**2160-2-4**] for R hip long stem bipolar hemiarthroplasty, tolerated the procedure well without complications.
At discharge he was tolerating PO, voiding spontaneously, and his pain was well controlled.
He was hemodynamically stable and afebrile at discharge.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
