Admission Date:  [**2124-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-12-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Zantac / Ciprofloxacin / Taxol / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**] Chief Complaint: T4-5 Lesion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T4-T5 corpectomy/cage, T3-6 lami,post instrumented fusion T2-T7, iliac crest bone harvest   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75M electively admitted on [**8-24**] for planned thoracic fusion and resection of vertebral body lesion.
The patient was then found to be diaphoretic and unresponsive at 2 AM.
Patient currently denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, N/V/D, dysuria, [**Month/Day (2) **], chills, nightsweats, headache, focal weakness, numbness, change in vision or hearing.
She states that patient has had similar confusion symptoms during past hospitalization which resolves with discharge and going back home.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Prostate cancer in [**2120**] treated with resection and radiation Benign parotid tumor resected in [**2115**] Bladder diverticula requiring resection Nasal polyps Inguinal hernia   Social History: Heavy smoking until quit in [**2097**], occasional alcohol, no drug use.
Family History: Both parents with lung cancer, father with brain tumor as well.
Sclera anicteric.
OP clear, no exudates or ulceration.
CV: S1S2 irreg irreg, II/VI mid peaking systolic murmur at best at b/l sternal border Chest: Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use.
There is a small vacuum phenomenon anteriorly in the vertebral body, and tiny vacuum phenomenon in the T4-5 and T5-6 intervertebral discs.
Images of the remaining vertebral bodies included in this study demonstrate osteoporosis, but no evidence of fracture.
CONCLUSION: T5 compression fracture with kyphotic angulation and bone retropulsed into the spinal canal compressing the spinal cord.
CT T-spine [**8-24**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post recent posterior fusion of T2 to T7 with placement of posterior fusion construct and bony fusion material, and intervertebral cage placement at T4-T5, and extensive post-surgical changes in the region.
There is marked metallic streak artifact, significantly limiting the evaluation of the spinal canal.
There is subcutaneous emphysema, post- surgical.
At T2 level, there is tiny hyperdense focus within the spinal canal (2:[**12-28**]), which could relate to the streak artifact; however, hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Right lower lobe consolidation and effusion, incompletely imaged, and underlying emphysema are similar in overall appearance to the recent study.
IMPRESSION: Immediately status post posterior fusion, from the T2 to T7 level, with T4-T5 partial corpectomy and intervertebral cage placement, and significant streak artifact limiting evaluation for epidural hemorrhage, with: 1.
Focal hyperdensity in the right posterolateral aspect of the spinal canal, at about the level of T2, likely relates to the streak artifact; however, hemorrhage is difficult to exclude entirely.
Other than expected surgical result, no acute change in alignment.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
CTA of Chest [**8-29**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
There is evidence of prior right lower lobe lobectomy including shift of the mediastinal structures to the right with right lung volume loss and right upper lobe expansion.
There is less than expected enhancement of the inferior right upper lobe concerning for consolidation (3:74).
A moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the [**2124-7-25**] PET CT. Circumferential thickening of the pleural surface, particularly at the right lung base, likely reflects chronic pleural effusion.
There is evidence of advanced metastatic disease including an irregular area of nodular pleural thickening seen at the right lung apex posteriorly abutting lytic destruction of an adjacent thoracic vertebral body status post posterior fixation (3:32).
Multiple abnormal lymph nodes evident within the lower posterior mediastinum with the largest measuring 1.9 x 1.87 mm (3:100).
Multiple soft tissue metastatic nodules within the left upper and lower lobes have increased in size compared to the PET CT of [**2124-7-25**] concerning for disease progression.
For example, soft tissue nodule abutting the major fissure measures 1.5 x 1.5 cm, previously 1.1 x 1.1 cm (3:58).
There is a small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
The imaged portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate prominence of both adrenal glands better assessed by recent PET CT.
Patient is status post posterior fusion of multiple upper thoracic vertebral bodies and introduction of inner body spacers.
There is no CT evidence of hardware loosening.
No new lytic osseous metastases are present.
No pulmonary embolism.
Right upper lobe pneumonia, most evident at the right lung base.
Worsening widespread thoracic metastatic disease compared to the PET CT of [**2124-7-25**].
Chronic moderate right pleural effusion with smaller left pleural effusion, increased in size compared to the PET CT.
Surface Echo [**8-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-12-4**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
Biventricular systolic function is similar.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2121**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**2-18**] years.
**FINAL REPORT [**2124-9-6**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2124-9-2**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2124-9-6**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2124-9-6**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Post procedure course was complicated by AFRVR and transient hypotension, severe hypoglycemic course and RUL PNA on cefepime.
Altered Mental Status: after transfer to the floor patient developed an altered mental status with concern for seizures, brain mets, hypercapnia.
Head MRI [**9-6**] showed vasogenic edema, slightly worse, but no new mets.
Dyspnea/Pulmonary/Hypercapnia: Patient had a new increased oxygen requirement after surgery, which was most likely secondary to a RUL pneumonia on top of progressive metastatic lung disease.
No evidence of PE on CTA [**2124-8-29**], and repeated CXRs showed an evolving PNA on top of underlying neoplastic disease.
For his pneumonia he was started on broad coverage with Cefepime, Vancomycin with concern for hospital acquired pneumonia.
Towards the end of his hospitalization there was some concern over hypercapnia given the patient's mental status changes.
Blood gases showed CO2 retention with a mixed acid-base disorder.
Bacteremia: two weeks into his admission the patient developed acute mental status changes and hypotension concerning for sepsis.
He was started on broad coverage including Cefepime and Vancomycin with concern for pneumonia.
Blood cultures from [**9-1**] eventually grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus in [**3-22**] bottles, likely a contaminant.
DMII: Patient had a hypoglycemic episode shortly after surgery.
Endocrinology was consulted for assistance with management of the patient's blood sugar control including the use of insulin and hypoglycemic medications.
Anemia: The patient has had chronic anemia.
During his admission he had a brief episode of frank hematuria after attempting to remove his own catheter.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a history of chronic AF rate controlled on Metoprolol and Verapamil.
Shortly after surgery the patient went into AF with RVR and susequently became tachypnic, likely multifactorial in etiology, including post-operative state, metastatic NSLC and possible PNA.
