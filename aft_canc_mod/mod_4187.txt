Admission Date:  [**2136-2-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2042**] Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2135-2-20**] Pericardial window   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 48yo man with h/o RCC s/p right nephrectomy [**2133**], with known brain, lung, and cardiac mets, on Sutent chemotherapy and recently completed whole brain radiation, also with recent pericardial effusion and tamponade requiring emergent pericardial window, now p/w two weeks of nausea, vomiting, dry heaves, as well as progressively worsening generalized fatigue, weakness, and exertional dyspnea.
He has also had associated headache and palpitations.
He denies any abdominal pain or change in his bowel habits, or fevers or chills.
He has noted his skin to be yellowing, which he attributes to his Sutent; he also describes darkening yellow of his urine and lightening of the color of his stools, but denies acholic stools.
He also denies any dysuria or hematuria, or melena or BRBPR.
The symptoms started 1-2 days prior to [**Holiday **] [**2135**] and have been progressively worsening since.
However, given his continued symptoms, he was referred back to his local ED for evaluation of possible increased intracranial pressure, bowel obstruction, or infection, as the source of his symptoms.
Evaluation there revealed elevated LFTs with transaminases in the 300s, rising LDH to the 500s, new and enlarging frontal brain mets on head CT, and new lung mets on chest/abdominal CT.
His OSH Head CT was reviewed by Radiology, with preliminary read showing "Persistent but decreased right parietal edema and stable-appearing left frontal edema with interval resolution of right parietal post-operative changes.
No evidence for new acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MR is more sensitive for evaluation of known metastases and evaluation for new metastases."
Pt has no prior h/o liver disease, although he endorses a previous "nicked bile duct" at the time of his nephrectomy in [**2133**].
No recent sick contacts, travel, or uncooked food exposures.
He denies any recent acetaminophen or other ingestions, including prescription or recreational drugs, OTC meds, herbal meds, vitamin or hormone supplements.
No significant EtOH history, and denies ever using IVDU or intranasal drugs.
No tattoos or piercings, or sexual exposures.
No family history of liver disease.
Also endorses BLE swelling since stopping the Lasix he was prescribed after his pericardial window, and occasional epistaxis over the last 1-2 weeks, left > right.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell histology stage IV - [**7-/2133**] with right upper quadrant pain.
At that time he underwent an ultrasound consistent with cholecystitis and also identification of a renal mass.
At that time there was no evidence of distant metastatic disease.
- [**8-/2133**] He underwent cholecystectomy for his acute cholecystitis and roughly one month after cholecystectomy he underwent a right radical nephrectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87423**], which was complicated by injury to the bile duct necessitating transfer to [**Hospital3 2358**] for bile duct repair, which was successful.
- [**2133-10-28**] R. radical nephrectomy showed three separate lesions consistent with clear cell carcinoma.
Renal cell carcinoma grade [**4-15**].
- [**1-/2134**] when he developed symptoms of cough and exertional shortness of breath, improved with asthma tx, no imaging.
- [**2-/2134**] he presented with similar symptoms and was treated with prednisone and inhalers for a suspected possible asthma flare.
- [**2134-6-14**] surveillance CT showed the presence of a small amount of pleural fluid on the right side.
In addition, there was a lesion in the left kidney that had actually decreased in size from 2.7 to 2.1 cm and another lesion in the left kidney that had increased in size from 9 mm to 1.7 cm.
The nature of these lesions was not entirely clear.
Also, noted was pleural thickening and nodularity on the right lung.
- [**2134-9-5**] DOE and cough, CXR showed a large right pleural effusion.
- [**2134-9-9**] CT showed numerous pleural based masses as well as remaining pleural fluid and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13060**] in [**Location (un) 3844**].
Biopsies confirmed the presence of metastatic clear cell renal cancer positive for napsin-A, vimentin and pan-keratin.
- [**2134-11-15**] C1W1 HD IL-2, received [**11-25**] doses, complicated by shock, volume overload, asthma flare.
- [**2134-12-28**] Week 7 CT with stable disease - [**2135-1-25**] Week 11 CT with reduction in size of mets - [**2135-3-7**] C2W1 received [**9-25**] doses, with 6 doses held due to development of shock and hypotension requiring pressor support.
- [**2135-4-19**] C2W7 CT with decreased pleural based mets, new concern for RV mass.
- [**2135-8-2**]: CT showed progressive disease - [**2135-8-9**] C1 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, tolerated well with mild diarrhea only - [**2135-8-23**] C2 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, tolerated well with mild diarrhea and mild neuopathy - [**2135-10-18**] CT torso with stable to decreased size of the numerous pleural-based metastases.
Start C3 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off - [**2135-11-22**] Started sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off - [**2135-12-10**] Presented with intractable nasuea.
Found to have bleeding brain mets.
- [**2135-12-16**] Resection of bleeding mets revealed a focus of residual tumor within the hemorrhage - [**2136-1-2**] [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] showed progression of multiple additional metastatic lesions involving the bilateral frontal and left occipital lobe - [**2136-1-10**] CT torso with significant progression of disease.
Multiple pleural-based enhancing necrotic lesions have all increased in size.
All target lesions have increased in size.
Progression of multiple lung nodules with multiple new nodules seen.
New small pericardial effusion.
New mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Small nodule adjacent to the inferior portion of the liver which may represent peritoneal implant.
Multiple soft tissue nodules within the anterior abdominal wall, most consistent with metastatic disease.
- [**0-0-**] whole brain radiation - [**2136-1-19**] developed shortness of breath and palpatations, found to have moderate to large pericardial effusion, tamponade requiring emergent pericardial window.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Back surgery to L5-S1 in [**2124**], with no hardware, done at [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 5450**] - Tonsillitis as a child - History of pneumonia as a child - History of cholecystectomy in [**2133**] - History of questionable bronchitis in [**12/2133**] and [**1-/2134**], which may have reflected actual disease recurrence - Depression - GERD   Social History: Lives with his partner.

[**2136-2-16**]:CT head w/o contrast (from OSH)IMPRESSION: Persistent but decreased right parietal edema and stable-appearing left frontal edema with interval resolution of right parietal post-operative changes.
MR is more sensitive for evaluation of known metastases and evaluation for new metastases.
[**2136-2-16**] Abdominal u/s: No evidence of biliary dilation, solid metastases in the liver, or portal vein thrombus.
[**2136-2-20**] : Cardiac echo: Large circumferential pericardial effusion with echo findings suggestive of early tamponade physiology.
Large right ventricular mass causing a mild functional tricuspid stenosis.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Large left pleural effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-1-23**], the pericardial effusion is now large with findings suggestive of early tamponade physiology.
Again visualized is evidence of nodular pleural thickening bilaterally but more prominent on the right in keeping with pleural metastases.
Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and moderate on the left, persist.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains moderately enlarged and suggestive of a persistant pericardial effusion but stable.
Retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity persists and is likely representative of a combination of the left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis.
There is, however, no evidence of new [**Last Name (un) **]-dation or pneumothoraces.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 48yo man with metastatic RCC s/p nephrectomy, previously on Sutent for brain, lung, and cardiac mets, s/p WBXRT and recent emergent pericardial window, initially presented with two weeks of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness, found to have progressive disease and reaccumulation of pericardial effision s/p repeat window [**2136-2-20**].
#Pericardial effusion/tamponade s/p repeat window Large pericardial effusion seen on echo [**2-20**] with consideration for early tamponade.
Patient had repeat pericardial window on [**2136-2-20**] with subxyphoid approach.
The effusion was loculated, so all fluid could not be removed.
#RCC with Multiple metastasis including the brain with resulting cerebral edema.
Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Sutent discontinued as disease progression.On Lovenox and ASA for cardiac mass and prevention of thromboembolism.
# Right ventricular metastasis requiring anticoagulation: Enoxaparin & ASA held briefly for suture placement needed for oozing from his pericardial surgical wound.
#Transaminitis - Likely a congestive hepatitis due to the pericardial effusion and TR due to a known RV mass.
# Nausea/vomiting: Well-controlled currently with anti-emetics.
Reglan and compazine held due to interaction with citalopram.
#Hyperglycemia - Secondary to steroids.
His labs indicate possible iron deficiency so will start on trial of Ferrex oral supplement daily as an outpatient.
