# Anemia: Likely slow GI bleed given no history of BRBPR or melena, HCT dropped from 41.3 in [**2119-5-14**] to 24.1.
GI evaluated and determined no cause for emergent endoscopy.
On further discussion with patient and family, patient not interested in endoscopic evaluation or treatment of potential bleeding source.
# Shortness of breath: Likely combination of anemia, pleural effusions, and CHF.
Patient and family met with palliative care and decided not to pursue any interventions or further workup.
# Elevated Troponin: Patient without symptoms of myocardial ischemia, normal CK and CK-MB, and no acute ischemia on ECG.
Most likely represents demand ischemia from tachycardia vs false positive due to renal insufficiency.
# Hyponatremia: Likely due to intravascular volume depletion, improved 124-->130 with volume resuscitation with PRBCs.
# Pleural effusion: patient with chronic right pleural effusions s/p pleurex placement.
Undergoes weekly drainage of fluid from pleurex catheter.
No interventions made.
# Lung Cancer: patient has stated he does not desire treatment for his lung cancer and has opted for comfort measures only.
# CHF: Lasix held in setting of potential intravascular depletion, discharged home on half dose.
