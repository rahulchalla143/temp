Admission Date:  [**2143-9-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-1-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**] Chief Complaint: Failure to thrive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 80 yo female h/o HTN, osteoporosis, and emphysema who presents with progressive weight loss, early satiety, hoarseness and pedal edema.
She has also had early satiety which she describes as wanting to eat a meal, but stopping short [**2-21**] feeling that it will come up.
The hoarseness has also been progressing over the last year, with associated production of white "foam" that she has been coughing up more frequently with no blood or distinct colors other than white.
Of note, no difficulty swallowing, no constipation/diarrhea, no melena/BRBPR.
She had a recent E. coli UTI [**2143-8-28**] with hematuria which was treated with Bactrim for 3 days and resolved with f/u UA with no RBCs.
Finally, she has also had gradually increasing pedal edema over the past few weeks.
She has no chest pain, but has dyspnea after walking ~1 block that is stable.
ROS otherwise negative except for urinary stress incontinence that she has had for years which is stable.
(5) Ectopic pregnancy.
(8) Gastroesophageal reflux disease and heartburn.
An upper GI in [**2140**] showed hiatal hernia.
An EGD in [**2141**] showed moderate gastritis.
(9) Colonic polyps.
(11) Urinary stress incontinence.
(12) Coronary artery disease.
Family History: There is no family history of colorectal cancer.
III/VI holosystolic murmur best heard over the apex, radiating to axilla.
LUNGS: Bilateral coarse breath sounds with kyphoscoliotic spine  ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
Admission CXR: severe cardiomegaly; kyphoscoliosis .
Laryngoscopy: no vocal cord paralysis, no mass, presbylaryngis and signs of pharyngeal/laryngeal reflux.
Right apical 2-cm mass, consistent with appearance of carcinoma.
Bilateral pleural effusions, with adjacent atelectasis in both lower lobes.
Small left liver lobe as well as dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.
37 x 29 mm nonenhancing structure in the left liver lobe, not present on the MR study of [**2143-4-20**].
The differential diagnosis includes hematoma and pseudocyst.
[**9-16**] eccho: There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
CXR [**9-18**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved.
Left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have worsened.
A small collection of pleural air at the base of the right lung is stable.
No pneumothorax is seen elsewhere.
Echo [**9-18**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion most prominent inferolateral to the left ventricle, but also circumferential.
There is no 2D echocardiographic evidence for tamponade physiology.
[**9-20**] Echo: still with resolution of effusion .
EKG: NSR @ 93, borderline RAD, nl intervals, low voltages, no ischemic changes.
RUE US: patient with IVC sluggish flow, pre- compression state.
[**9-24**] Gastric emptying study: delayed at 1hr; nl at 2.5 hrs   Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 1104**] is an 80 yo F with h/o HTN and COPD who presented with failure to thrive, hoarseness, and peripheral edema.
She was initially admitted to facilitate further workup for these problems with plans for a laryngoscopy, gastric emptying study, and ecchocardiogram.
# Hoarseness - Laryngoscopy revealed presbylaryngis (failure of the vocal cords to completely collapse) and inflammation suggestive of pharyngeal/laryngeal reflux without any evidence for cancer or vocal cord paralysis.
# Pericardial effusion - patient was found to have new murmur initially and on subsequently Echo she was found to have a large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
The effusion was likely deemed to be chronic since she was tolerating it without hemodynamic instability.
It was decided that she would benifit from fluid drainage for symptomatic relief, and also to facilitate workup for the cause of her effusion and FTT.
This was attributed to the drainage of 500cc of bloody fluid, suspected from a venous structure, likely the azygous or splenic vein.
She continued to remain hemodynamically stable on the floor and was monitored on telemetry without evidence of tachycardia.
She has not had clinical evidence of fluid reaccumulation, however this is very likely to recurr and she should be seen by cardiology within a month (Dr.[**Name (NI) 94146**] saw her at [**Hospital1 18**]) .
With regard to the etiology of her pericardial effusion clinical suspicion was very high for malignancy, especially considering her extensive smoking history.
Otherwise, her PPD was negative, ESR nl, she had no uremia.
# Right Apical Mass: CT this admission showed 2cm right apical mass concerning for malignancy.
Pericardial fluid showed malignant appearing cells that were strongly + for CEA and considered most consistent with adenocarcinoma.
The overall clinical picture is most concerning for NSCLC.
With this assumption she would be considered an unresectable lung cancer and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] agreed that she would likely not be a chemotherapy candidate because of her very poor performance status.
Nonetheless we had been pursuing a tissue diagnosis.
Gastroenterology service considered trans-esophageal biopsy of the mass it was decided that she was too high risk especially in light of potential pneumothorax.
Interventional radiology was willing to perform the procedure next week but cited an approximate 30% risk of pneumothorax with 5-10% risk of needing a chest tube.
She had a crit drop with the bleeding from her pericardiocentesis which stabilized over one day.
She was none-theless transfused 2 U pRBCs on [**9-20**] with appropriate rise in hematocrit and has demonstrated stability since.
# Ms [**Known lastname 1104**] developed right arm swelling in the setting of IV placement.
Doppler did not reveal obvious clot but there was suggestion of sluggish flow in her R internal jugular vein which was further evaluated by an MRI.
# Weight loss/Early Satiety: Most likely related to malignancy.
# Hypoxia: Ms. [**Known lastname 1104**] developed hypoxia in the CCU which was felt to be partly COPD + heart failure, no signs of infection.
CXR revealed pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
# HTN: had been on lisinopril as outpt, was held for decreased BP in CCU.
She now has gastritis and evidence of laryngeal pharyngeal reflux.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stool.
Malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade 2.
Hypertension 6.
Symptoms of this would be worsening shortness of breath, leg swelling, or worsening weakness or light headedness.
You should also seek medical care if you have fever over 100.4, worsening swelling of your arm, [**Last Name (un) 2043**] pain, or for any other concerns  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your primary care physician within the next 1-2 weeks.
