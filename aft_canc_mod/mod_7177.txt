At 5AM on the morning of admission, the pt developed nausea and had voluminous bloody emesis x 2.

9 yrs ago, she had a similar episode of GI bleeding, and at that time, etiology was unknown.
Pt states that she does not take regular NSAID or ASA for her joint pain.
Stool was maroon and guaiac positive.
This showed a normal esophagus; evidence of a Bilroth II in the stomach body; a single acute cratered non-bleeding 10 mm ulcer in the gastric side of anastomosis; and a normal duodenum.
There was no stigmata of recent bleeding associated with the ulcer.
Since that time, the pt has not had any further bleeding and has not required any more PRBC.

Brief Hospital Course: 82 y/o female wtih PMH signficant for gastric ulcers s/p partial gastrectomy who was admitted [**7-14**] with a GI bleed.
EGD showed a single acute cratered non-bleeding 10 mm ulcer in the gastric side of the pt's anastamosis.
The GI bleeding was attributed to the ulcer and recent NSAID use for arthritis.
The pt had black formed stool, and vomiting but no blood, during her admission.
Pt's arthritis is most likely osteoarthritis, and is associated with Heberden nodes.
The arthritis is of recent onset (several months), but not associated with worsening stiffness/pain with use, or late in the day.
It is not associated with rashes, pleuritic chest pain, no temporal/scalp/jaw sensitivity/pain.
Thus, questioning bears negative for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.
