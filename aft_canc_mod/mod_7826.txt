Her course was complicated by GI bleed, though EGD and ileostomy in the ICU were remarkable for absence of varices and a non-bleeding ulcer at the GE junction with old blood in the stomach.
She did have significant peristomal bleeding, which was thought to be the major source, and found to have peristomal varices.
She uses silver nitrate for peristomal bleeding and is on PPI ppx.
Course was also complicated by strep viridans bacteremia (grew out on [**2132-10-15**] culture), for which no etiology was found.
Regarding her cirrhosis history, The patient states that she first experienced clinical manifestations of her liver disease in [**2129**] following her total colectomy.
A biopsy performed at that time revealed cirrhosis with extensive canalicular cholestasis.
The patient states that her cirrhosis was well compensated until [**8-/2132**], when she began to experience jaundice, leading to above admission for expedited transplant workup.
Today, the patient notes fatigue, nausea, and occasional shortness of breath.
She endorses continued mild swelling.
She denies fevers, chills, URI symptoms, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, hematochezia, melena, increased ostomy output, urinary frequency/urgency, or rash.

You initially came in with slight worsening in your renal function and increased swelling in your abdomen as well as to determine the etiology of the bacteria you had in your blood during the last admission.
During the admission, you developed a high fever and low blood pressure.
Because of the low blood pressure, you had acute kidney injury.
The source of the infection causing the fever was thought to be a pneumonia.
