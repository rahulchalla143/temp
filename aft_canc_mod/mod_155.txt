He had seen his cardiologist on the day of admission for this complaint and his cardiologist advised him to go to the hospital for evaluation because he felt his exam at the time was consistent with ischemia vs. cellulitis.
Given both his history of DM type II and CAD/PVD, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotics and further workup of his R toe pain.

Brief Hospital Course: 79yo M with MMP including DMII, CAD s/p MI, PVD, COPD, multiple malignancies, hypercholesterolemia, and HTN who was admitted to vascular with toe pain, but then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# ICU COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to his cardiologist's office with 7-10 days of increasing pain in his R foot, specifically his R second toe.
His exam at the time was felt to be consistent with ischemia or cellulitis.
XR showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Noninvasive vascular studies were performed as the patient was a known vasculopath and it was assumed that an intervention would need to be performed to preserve his toe.
Studies revealed that he had extensive plaques in the L common carotid artery, bilateral internal and external carotid arteries, as well as significant bilateral iliac, superficial femoral, and tibial disease.
On [**4-21**], while on the vascular service, he developed nausea and vomiting while moving around for all of his studies.
He did well until [**4-23**] when he began to have labored breathing and a decreased O2 sat to 81%.
He was given IV metoprolol for his tachycardia, but overnight, again developed respiratory distress.
He was given 20mg lasix IV and 80mg IV solumedrol, but he remained in respiratory distress so he was transferred to the SICU for intubation.
CT of his head revealed no intracranial pathology, and the CTA was negative for PE, but did reveal that he had pleural effusions.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated the following evening, with the hope that treatment for CHF and COPD would have improved his respiratory status.
He did well overnight, but again developed tachypnea acutely on the morning of [**2135-4-25**], associated with wheezing and hypoxia.
He was given nebulizer treatments x3, solumedrol, and lasix with no improvement.
On [**2135-4-25**], a TTE was performed which revealed left ventricular systolic function of ~40%, which was considered to be moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
An attempt was made at thoracentesis given his bilateral pleural effusions, however the IP team did not feel that they could get a good view through which to tap.
On [**2135-4-26**], the decision was made to discontinue the patient's beta-blocker because of increased wheezing.
The patient's cardiologist instead recommended using verapamil instead for rate control.
Attempt was made at his second extubation on [**2135-4-26**], but again he became acutely tachypneic, tachycardic and hypertensive, with his O2 sats again dropping into the 80s.
EP was consulted on [**2135-4-27**] and felt that the arrhythmias he was having were consistent with episodes of MAT/afib, with no episodes of sustained ventricular rhythms.
They also recommended continuing with diuresis and attempting extubation again only after his pulmonary edema had resolved.
BAL culture results were significant for gram negative rods, raising the concern for ventilator associated pneumonia.
He performed an SBT on [**4-28**], but developed tachypnea and tachycardia after just 2 hrs.
In the MICU, his antibiotics were broadened to cover for Pseudomonas in his sputum (with levaquin and ceftazidime) and he was given vancomycin for gram positive cocci from his R toe (which turned out to be MSSA).
# PNEUMONIA: He underwent a BAL on [**2135-4-28**] which grew a pansensitive Pseudomonas.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] completed an 8 day course of ceftazidime (along with 7 days of levaquin, for double coverage initially) for the treatment of Pseudomonas ventilator associated pneumonia on [**2135-5-7**].
He continued to have a productive cough, but his oxygenation improved.
He was able to maintain stable O2 sats of 100% on 2L by nc, but still was mildly hypoxemic on RA (91%).
CXR showed that he still has small residual pleural effusions that are resolving.
# COPD: Mr. [**Known lastname **] likely had a COPD exacerbation that contributed to his difficulty in weaning off of the ventilator.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Mr. [**Known lastname 5024**] WBC began to rise on the floor, at the same time that he began to have diarrhea.
Given that he was on several antibiotics at the time, there was concern for C diff infection.
# ARRHYTHMIA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have various sinus arrhythmias in the ICU, possibly MAT vs sinus tachycardia with ectopic beats.
Verapamil was tried instead, but Mr. [**Known lastname **] became very tachycardic without beta-blockade.
On transfer to the floor, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5025**] was continued on telemetry and appeared to have multiple different rhythms, including MAT, sinus tachycardia with ectopic beats (both ventricular and atrial) and ventricular bigeminy.
# PVD: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a long history of claudication.
On admission, there was concern for cellulitis vs. gangrene in his R toe.
MRA showed moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease, but no surgical intervention was planned during this admission due to his tenous respiratory status.
# DM type II: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had been on an insulin gtt in ICU, with labile fingersticks.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help control his hyperglycemia in the setting of acute illness and the administration of tube feeds.
On the floor, he was changed back to SC insulin, but became hypoglycemic on the recommended regimen.
His steroid use for his COPD exacerbation and discontinuation of tube feeds likely contributed to the lability of his glycemic control.
He did have a symptomatic episode of hypoglycemia on the morning of [**2135-5-7**] which quickly resolved with the administration of 1/2amp of D50.
