Mrs. [**Known lastname 99102**] presented to clinic today for an unscheduled urgent visit due to an inability to swallow and extreme fatigue.
She has chronic low-back pain and was also unable to take her Percocet today.
Otherwise, she has had no fevers at home, no chills or night sweats.
Rheumatoid Arthritis 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Family History: CAD in brother/sister [**Name (NI) **] brother w/ prostate cancer  Physical Exam: Vital signs:  Temperature 96.6, blood pressure 142/86, pulse 102, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, weight is 90 pounds, height is 61 inches.
In general, Ms. [**Known lastname 99102**] is a thin, pleasant 60- year-old woman in no acute distress.
Heart:  Tachycardic rate, regular rhythm with no appreciable murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or crackles.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  There is no edema, clubbing, or cyanosis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a large, circumfirential pericardial effusion with  pericardial thickening (2.0-3.0 cm anteriorly from subcostal view).
There is right atrial and right ventricular early diastolic invagination without definite collapse.
that likely represents early tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Large circumfirential pericardial effusion with probable early tamponade.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion subtending primarily the right atrial and right ventricular free wall.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
No right ventricular diastolic  collapse is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dysphagia: Pt with known significant LAD compressing the esophagus.
This has caused substantial weight loss and is likely contributing significantly to her weakness as she was unable to take PO's.
She was then started on cycling which was adjusted until she was able to tolerate with minimal residuals.
Pt continued to have problems with nausea and phlegm production.
# Pericardial effusion: Pt had a small pericardial effusion seen on recent CT scan.
She developed progressive SOB in the setting of aggressive hydration for her ARF due to dehydration.
CXR showed small bilateral effusion with pulmonary edema.
At this point she was diuresed with minimal effect.
Her SOB and O2 requirement continued to worsen.
Repeat CXR now showed moderate szized effusion on the left with increase size of silhoutte of heart.
She was then sent for ECHO which demonstrated large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Pt was tachycardic but BP stable at this time.
Follow up ECHOs showed no evidence of reacculmulation 5 days later.
# Volume status: Pt was very dry at admission & labs c/w prerenal.
Now with pleural effusion in the setting of pericardial effusion.
Pleural effusion was present on discharge.
Her FENA at this time was <1% and renal failure felt to be secondary to dehydration.
# Hypoxia: Pt with bilateral effusion left greater then right.
Also likely has lymphangetic spread of the tumor.
Disucussed possibility of tapping the effusion but the pt refused.
Pt sent home with O2 for comfort.
# CAD: No chest pain during stay.
Did not restart statin as would have no benefit to patient in short term.
# Hyponatremia: Was likely due to volume depletion, this resolved with IVF.
# Non-small-cell lung ca: Did not actively treat as inpatient.
# [**Name (NI) 25933**] Pt had isolated fever on [**2161-2-21**] after pericardiocentesis.
Since pt had been afebrile otherwise we stopped the abx.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Healthcare [**Hospital 94111**] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: non-small cell lung cancer dehydration dysphagia due to lymphadenopathy pericardial effusion with tamponade   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating tubefeeds and small amounts of POs, breathing comfortably  Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as instructed.
