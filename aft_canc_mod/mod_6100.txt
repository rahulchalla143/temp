Admission Date:  [**2130-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-8-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Tetracycline / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Bee Pollen / Gadolinium-Containing Agents  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Splenectomy   History of Present Illness: This 33 yo male with new diagnosis of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma who presented on day 11 status post CHOP with one day of fever to 101.4 F and chills.
The patient reported worsening of his chronic abdominal pain from [**2131-5-14**] to [**9-16**] over the preceding days but denied any other localizing symptoms particularly denying shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, or skin changes.
Generally, he reported feeling anxious and agitated on being back in the hospital.
Labs were notable for ANC of 36 and elevated liver enzymes with ALT 243, AST 78, AP 260, and a normal T Bili of 1.1 (stable from daily outpatient labs).
He underwent CXR which showed atelectasis and question of pneumonia per ED read.
CT abdomen/pelvis was performed given his chronic abdominal pain and demonstrated stable splenomegaly and LAD.
It also showed mildly dilated loops of small bowel which contained oral contrast, which could possibly represent early partial SBO vs early ileus.

Note: There is superimposed bacterial infection.
Spleen, Omentum, and Liver [**2130-4-11**]: DIAGNOSIS: I.  Splenule (A): Nodule of splenic tissue with extramedullary hematopoiesis and prominent interstitial histiocytes.
Splenic tissue, biopsy (L): Massive splenomegaly with extensive red pulp congestion, fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis (see note 1).
Multiple vascular thrombi.
Focal splenic infarction and geographic necrosis.
Lymphohistiocytic aggregates and necrotizing granulomas.
Hilar lymph node with atypical lymphoid infiltrate (see note 2).
There is extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis throughout with megakaryocytes as well as erythroid islands; erythroid precursors are markedly dyspoietic with asymmetric nuclear budding noted.
Additionally, sections from the grossly visible necrotic area shows a large area of geographic necrosis.
Scattered histiocytes with ingested hematopoietic precursors (hemophagocytic histiocytes) are seen.
Several scattered ill-defined lymphohistiocytic aggregates are seen with prominent central karyorrhectic debris (also noted in perihilar connective tissue).
CD3 highlights numerous reactive small T lymphocytes, which are a mixed population of CD4 and CD8 positive cells (ratio of [**1-10**]:1).
CD8 highlights dilated sinusoids, which are focally widely separated with extensive fibrosis in the intervening areas.
Overall, the findings are of congestive splenomegaly with extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis.
The exact etiology of the splenomegaly and vascular thromboses is uncertain but possibilities include chronic portal venous congestion either due to external compression from nodal masses, or alternatively the possibility of an underlying thrombophilic condition leading to vascular thromboemboli needs to be evaluated.
The finding of extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis, which along with fibrosis appears to be the dominant cause of splenomegaly, is unusual, and correlation with clinical, cytogenetic, and bone marrow findings to exclude a possible underlying myeloproliferative disorder is needed.
-Note 2: Sections of hilar lymph nodes show extensive sclerosis with only scattered lymphoid nodules remaining.
By immunohistochemical staining performed on lymph node block S, a focal are of large atypical cells with markedly convoluted nuclei and prominent nucleoli are noted on CD20 immunostaining.
Moderate portal and lobular lymphoid infiltrate with prominent sinusoidal pattern with cells consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Lobular regeneration with microscopic foci of necrosis with hemorrhage.
Minimal steatosis.
Trichrome stain shows mild portal fibrosis.
Iron stains shows moderate iron deposition in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.
Moderate portal and lobular lymphoid infiltrate with prominent sinusoidal pattern with cells consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Lobular regeneration with microscopic foci of necrosis with hemorrhage.
Minimal steatosis.
There are some atypical lymphoid cells which have been evaluated by (see hematopathology note).
Note:  Although several periportal and lobular lymphoid infiltrates are seen, no large cells or L&H variants are noted.
T cells comprise 97% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens.
-INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation  Bone Marrow Biospy [**2130-4-21**]: ==============    DIAGNOSIS     ============  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MYELOID AND MEGAKARYOCYTIC HYPERPLASIA AND FREQUENT HEMOPHAGOCYTIC HISTIOCYTES HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROME).
THERE IS NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF LYMPHOCYTE PREDOMINANT HODGKIN LYMPHOMA.
SEE NOTE  Native Renal Biopsy [**2130-4-27**]: DIAGNOSIS: Renal biopsy, needle: Consistent with acute tubular injury ("ATN"), see note.
Some [**Hospital1 **] show ischemic type changes, the remainder are within normal limits.
Patchy widespread interstitial edema is present.
There is minimal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.
Minimal chronic inflammation accompanies the scarring.
Tubules show vacuolar change, as well as intralumenal necrotic debris and red blood cells; other signs of acute injury, including occasional single-cell necrosis are also seen.
Arterioles show mild mural thickening, with prominent hyaline change.
-Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex, containing approximately 4 glomeruli, of which 0 are globally sclerotic.
The amount of deposition is too limited for a diagnosis of IgA nephropathy.
The degree of arteriolar hyalinosis is noteworthy.
OTHER STUDIES ============== Chest Radiograph [**2130-3-31**]: IMPRESSION: Linear area of increased opacity at the left lung base.
By morphology this is likely atelectasis though an early infectious process is not excluded and should be correlated to the clinical presentation  CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2130-3-31**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall, minimal change since [**2130-3-17**] with massive splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, which was better demonstrated on the previous study, compatible with lymphoma.
Mildly dilated loops of small bowel which contain oral contrast.
This finding may represent a pseudo- obstruction, but early or partial small bowel obstruction is not completely excluded.
Bibasilar atelectasis and interval development of new ground-glass nodular opacities in the right upper lobe which are worrisome for infection.
Viral or atypical bacterial pneumonia is favored.
Interval enlargement of 3-cm well-circumscribed fluid collection in the right axilla which may represent a necrotic lymph node versus a post-biopsy seroma.
No focal liver or splenic mass or evidence of abscess is seen.
Dropout of signal in both liver and spleen on longer echo gradient echo imaging, likely due to iron overload from blood transfusions.
Nodal mass surrounding portal vein and celiac access is as previously seen.
Left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis persist.
Given the patient's multiple other medication allergies as well as development of rash immediately after administration of gadolinium, premedication for allergic reaction would be recommended should the patient again receive IV gadolinium.
Diffuse soft tissue swelling about ankle.
Allowing for this, no fracture or suspicious bone lesion detected involving the left ankle.
Minimal spurring of the distal tibia without other evidence of degenerative change.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-2**], there is some progressive decrease in opacification at the left base.
Blunting of both costophrenic angles and bibasilar atelectasis persists in this patient with low lung volumes.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2130-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No lower extremity DVT.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-17**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-10**], there is now increasing opacification at the left base.
This appears to be consistent with pleural effusion and some underlying atelectasis.
The possibility of superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
Streak of atelectasis overlying the cardiac border on the lateral view is unchanged.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-17**]: Left lower lobe is still consolidated but volume loss is not as severe.
Mild pulmonary edema, progressive moderate cardiomegaly and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new indicating cardiac decompensation.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, new since the prior study.
Stable enlarged mediastinal, internal mammary, and right axillary lymph nodes consistent with the patient's history of Hodgkin's lymphoma.
3.3-cm fluid-filled structure in the right axilla, slightly enlarged compared to the prior study and may represent a necrotic lymph node versus a post-biopsy seroma.
Interval increase in abdominal ascites status post splenectomy.
New right pleural effusion and increased left pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis; pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Focal hypodense hepatic lesions likely secondary to lymphoma although another process such as disseminated fungal infection cannot be excluded.
Mildly dilated loops of contrast-filled small bowel likely due to pseudo- obstruction.
However, the extrahepatic common bile duct remains normal in caliber, measuring 6 mm, and there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation seen.
The gallbladder is unremarkable, without evidence of stones.
Trace perihepatic ascites.
Innumerable hypodense liver lesions not visualized son[**Name (NI) 5326**].
Slight improved aeration at the right lung base but no significant change in patchy and linear opacities at the left base.
These findings favor atelectasis as reported on recent chest CT.
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 year male with new diagnosis of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma now status post one cycle of CHOP presenting with fever and persistent abdominal pain now dramatically improved status post splenectomy.
1) Fevers of Unknown Origin: The patient presented with neutropenic fevers and worsening abdominal apin.
Given he was neutropenic at the time he was admitted to the oncology service and treated with multiple broad spectrum antimicrobials including cefepime, aztreonam ([**Date range (1) 27094**]), vancomycin([**Date range (1) 22023**]), metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 82515**]), azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 82516**]), and voriconazole ([**Date range (1) 82517**]) and never had abatement of his fevers.
Work up did reveal multiple liver hypodensities but work up for granulomatous diseases was similarly negative.
Therefore, the patient was started on a steroid taper and had a splenectomy as his splenomegaly was thought to be contributing to his persistent abdominal pain and intraoperative biopsies would help with diagnostic evaluation.
Following splenectomy and while on steroid taper the patient did well and from [**Date range (1) 82518**] he was afebrile (antibiotics had been stopped on [**2130-4-14**]).
Unfortunately, on [**2130-4-17**] he once again had fevers and was restarted on broad spectrum antibiotics (aztreonam/vancomycin then levofloxacin).
From [**2130-4-17**] to [**2130-4-21**] the patient once again was persistently febrile with no localizing signs of acute infection  and persistently negative cultures (though pneumonia was suspected due to his respiratory issues).
On [**2130-4-21**], however, the patient had an abrupt increase in his LFT's as well as acute kidney injury.
When he developed yet another episode of acute respiratory distress later in the day he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he had a repeat bone marrow biopsy, which along with the returning path from his splenectomy, and the results of his labs (including a greater than assay ferritin level) led to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
2) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis:  A presumptive diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made on [**2130-4-21**] from bone marrow biopsies showing hemophagocytosis and splenectomy results as well as fulminant hepatic injury and the elevated ferritin.
The patient was started on high dose steroids and etoposide per protocol and after first doses, which were adjusted for hepatic and renal dysfunction, was put on twice weekly etoposide and a steroid taper.
With initiation of therapy liver enzymes rapidly declined and fevers resolved.
Ultimately, most likely cause of HLH was considered to be due to a paraneoplastic process from his underlying Hodgkin's lymphoma.
3) Acute Kidney Injury: On the evening of [**2130-4-25**] the patient reported dark colored urine*1.
Subsequent urinalysis revealed large heme but no RBC's.
Initial concern was for rhabdomyolysis but CK was normal.
Presumed etiology was thought likely to be contrast induced nephropathy and/or pigment nephropathy from hemoglobinuria leading to acute tubular necrosis.
This was confirmed by urine sediment analysis, which showed muddy brown casts.
The patient did have some issues with hyperkalemia after developing renal failure but never any ECG changes and this resolved as renal function trended back toward normal and the patient was put on a low K diet.
Of note, the patient's initial urine studies did show an increased protein/Cr ratio suggesting significant proteinuria, which would be atypical for acute tubular necrosis.
Therefore, he had a renal biopsy but the results of this were pending as of discharge.
4)Respiratory Distress: The patient had two episodes of acute respiratory distress on the floor on [**4-17**] and [**2130-4-21**].
These were each in the context of rigoring from fever and reported anxiety.
During the first work up showed hypoxia and chest radiograph showed volume loss perhaps suggesting a collapsed lobe.
The patient improved from both these incidents with minimal direct management and his oxygen requirements simply decreased to baseline each time.
The ultimate etiology of his hypoxia remained unclear.
Initially, given that this is generally a rather indolent disease it was thought likely the cause of his splenomegaly but thought unlikely to be the cause of his fevers and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Ultimately, etoposide does have activity against Hodgkin's Lymphoma as well.
Further specific treatment for his Hodgkin's lymphoma will be pending treatment of his HLH.
6) Pain: The patient has a history of opioid abuse and chronic abdominal pain thus complicating his pain management.
With these interventions his pain steadily improved after his splenectomy and he was discharged just on scheduled morphine SR for his chronic abdominal pain.
7) Anxiety: The patient did complain of anxiety particularly with uncertainty about his plan of care or medical situation but also just in general from being hospitalized.
This responded well to standing and PRN clonazepam with minimal sedation or other side effects.
He received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: -Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis -Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma -Non-oliguric acute kidney injury (due to contrast nephropathy and/or hemoglobinuria) -Status post splenectomy -Acute on Chronic abdominal pain   Discharge Condition: Stable, not hypoxic on room air, with decreased abdominal pain, without fevers.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because your spleen was enlarged and you had fevers while your counts were low.
You went on to have a splenectomy and briefly improved before having fevers again and worsening liver enzymes.
Your kidneys were also damaged while you were in the hospital probably by a combination of the IV contrast dye you were given and the pigment hemoglobin, which was released in large amounts when your hemophagocytic syndrome was accelerating.
Please call your doctors and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] be seen in either the office or the ED if you have fevers, chills, night sweats, progressive abdominal pain, decreased urine output, shortness of breath, or any other concerning changes in your health.
