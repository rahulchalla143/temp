A Chest CT revealed a large left pleural effusion and LLL/lingular/portions of LUL collapse (worsened significantly compared to [**2168-10-22**]).

No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. large left pleural effusion and collapse of left lower lobe, lingula and portions of the left upper lobe have worsened significantly compared to [**2168-10-22**].
Occlusion of the left lower lobe and lingular bronchi 3.
Bulky mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy.
New pathological fracture of the left seventh rib.
Patchy opacity within the right lower lobe, likely reflecting an infectious or inflammatory process.
- CXR [**2168-11-16**]: Interval increased left pleural effusion, and increasing parenchymal opacities in left lower lobe and lingula.
Given the known lesions in the left hila, this is concerning for postobstructive pneumonia/atelectasis.
Left rib met.
- MRI head [**2168-11-5**]: Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy.
No enhancing lesions are seen.
No evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus.
The intensity of this uptake is greater than expected for postobstructive inflammatory change alone and is consistent with the given history of non-small cell lung cancer.
FDG-avid bilateral hilar adenopathy and widespread bilateral mediastinal adenopathy.
Multiple foci of FDG-avid lytic metastases involving the left scapula, the left lamina of T1, the right 5th rib (with pathologic fracture), the left 7th rib, the right sacrum and right acetabulum.
- Chest CT [**2168-10-22**]: bulky, bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as bilateral hilar adenopathy, the largest lymph nodes include a subcarinal node or mass measuring approximately 2.5 cm x 3.5 cm in diameter.
There are also bilateral calcified pleural plaques present.
The lower lobe is partially collapsed, and within the area of enhancing atelectatic lung, there is a low-density rounded area measuring 2.0 cm x 1.8 cm in diameter.
The lungs also demonstrate emphysematous changes, also was found to have a small-to-moderate pleural effusion and a small pericardial effusion.
Additional central peri-bronchovascular thickening in the left lower lobe was found which could be related to lymphatic obstruction or localized lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71 yo M with recently diagnosed metastatic non small cell lung cancer (unresectable stage IV) s/p first treatment of Taxol, Carboplatin, and Zometa on [**2168-11-15**] presents with worsening cough and fever.
Patient's shortness of breath, cough and fever were likely secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonia in setting of a known malignancy.
CT chest revealed a large left pleural effusion and collapse of left lower lobe, lingula and portions of the left upper lobe.
Shortly after transfer to the ICU patient became hypoxic and required intubation.
Tap of left pleural effusion on [**11-16**] was positive for non-small cell carcinoma.
Bronchial washings, subcarinal mass, and paratracheal lymph node obtained on [**11-19**] were again consistent with malignancy.
Repeated blood, sputum, and urine cultures did not identify etiology of infection; viral screen also negative.
Course was further complicated by developing neutropenia (s/p chemotherapy).
Despite the placement of a second chest tube, patient continued to have hypoxic respiratory failure, secondary to large malignant pleural effusion and left lung collapse.
Patient became hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis, and required pressors and fluid boluses to maintain his CVP and urine output.
