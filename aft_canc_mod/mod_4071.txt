At that time he had a CT scan done which found a nodule in the LLL.
Pt then had this nodule rescanned in [**Location (un) 86**] with subsequent scans that showed interval increase in size.
He then underwent bronchoscopy and sampling of pleural effusion  in [**11-11**] which demonstrated poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
Staging PET scan showed lesion in the sternum for metastatic disease.
He then began chemotherapy with 2 cycles  [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with no response.

These findings may be consistent with pulmonary edema or changes related to radiation therapy.
Lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
Interval development of new extensive ground glass opacities within the right upper lobe, patchy ground glass opacity within the right middle lobe, and interval worsening of consolidation within the left lower lobe with air bronchograms, findings all of which suggest worsening multifocal pneumonia.
Relatively stable appearance of loculated small left pleural effusion with enhancing and nodular thickening of the pleural rim.
Small right pleural effusion.
No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transfered to the ICU on HD #2 secondary to increased hypoxia.
Patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of pnuemonia even though no cultures came back positive.
At one point patient became hypotensive and had poor urine output.
He was proned, and mutiple alveolar recruitment efforts were tried for better oxygenation which only produced minimal improvement.
