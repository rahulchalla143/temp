No enteric contrast was administered and coronal and sagittal reformatted were than derived.
FINDINGS: There is no CT evidence for pulmonary emboli.
No aortic dissection is demonstrated and there is no evidence for intramural hematoma.
There are calcified pleural plaques.
Emphysematous changes are seen, and there is bibasilar dependent atelectasis with a small right pleural effusion.
There is no abnormal bowing of intraventricular septum or enlargement of the right heart.
The visualized portion of the spleen and right kidney appear normal.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are seen at numerous levels in the spine with some symmetric sclerosis of the posterior elements superiorly.
No pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2178-4-20**] 3:56 PM  ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  Reason: please further evaluate hypodensities in liver  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man with SOB, recent prostate biopsy and now here with NSTEMI with liver densities on CT chest REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please further evaluate hypodensities in liver HISTORY: 72-year-old male with recent prostate biopsy, now with hypodensities in the liver on CT chest.
Otherwise, the liver demonstrates normal echogenicity and no other focal lesions.
The gallbladder appears normal without evidence of stones.
The right kidney measures 12.0 cm and the left kidney measures 11.47 cm; there is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
There is no ascites.
While the distalmost aorta is obscured by overlying bowel gas there is focal aneurysmal dilatation of the distal aorta measuring 3.3 cm, compared to the aorta directly above it which measures 2.2 cm.
Hypodense lesions on the CT chest correspond to hepatic cysts.
Focal aneurysmal dilatation of distal aorta measuring 3.3 cm.
Echo ([**4-20**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments, severe hypokinesis of the mid inferior and inferolateral segments and mild hypokinesis of all other segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Global LV systolic dysfunction with the inferior wall being worst affected.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress which responded to stress dose steroids and inhaler therapy.
During a period of high blood pressure and tachycardia, the patient was noted to have a mild NSTEMI which was medically managed.
He was also noted to be in acute renal failure, which resonded to gentle hydration.
He was also noted to have a pyuria and started empirically on cefepime and ciprofloxacin.
His urine culture and sensitivities returned, and his antibiotic regimen was converted to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim twice daily for a total of 4 weeks given the reduced tissue penetration to the prostate of sulfa antibiotics.
Outpatient follow up for his new diagnosis of prostate cancer was to be arranged by his spouse.
