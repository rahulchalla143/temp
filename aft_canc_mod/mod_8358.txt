Admission Date:  [**2165-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-4-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-5-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Progressive memory loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left Temporal Craniotomy   History of Present Illness: This is a 67 year old gentleman who was brought into the hospital by his family after an MRI ordered by his PCP showed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] left temporal tumor.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Large, irregularly rim-enhancing and centrally necrotic 4-cm mass occupying much of the left temporal lobe with extensive vasogenic edema, mass effect and subfalcine herniation.
Evidence of subpial spread to involve the overlying extra-axial space, as well as possible extension along the fiber bundles of the [**Last Name (un) 46280**] portion of the anterior commissure, crossing the midline.
Discrete 11-mm mass at the most medial aspect of that temporal lobe, representing a "satellite" lesion with visible thin contiguous extension from the dominant mass.
COMMENT: The constellation of findings is quite concerning for primary high-grade glial neoplasm with direct spread into the subarachnoid space, extension to a "satellite nodule" and possibly along fiber bundles into the contralateral hemisphere; this would be a quite unusual appearance for metastatic disease.
CXR [**2165-4-20**]: No signs for acute cardiopulmonary process.
MRI Brain [**2165-4-20**]: Pre-operative planning study demonstrates irregularly enhancing lesion with rim enhancement in the left temporal region with a satellite nodule as discussed in detail previously on the MRI of [**2165-4-19**].
No change in appearance seen.
There remains mass effect on the left side of the brain stem and left lateral ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11952**] was evaluated in the Emergency room and given his MRI findings given 20mg of Decadron IV immediately along with 500mg of Keppra for seizure propholaxis.
He has both expressive and receptive aphasia which decadron is being used to help reduce severity.
His aphasia was improved with decadron, but still had some word finding difficulty.
