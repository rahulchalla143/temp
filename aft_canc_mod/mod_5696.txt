Studies: [**12-15**] CXR: Again noted is marked central pulmonary vascular congestion slightly diminished from the prior exam.
Mild interstitial edema is again evident with interlobular septal thickening and cephalization of flow.
No definite consolidation is evident.
No definite pleural effusion is seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is cardiomegaly with left atrial prominence.
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in volume status with mild residual interstitial edema likely from cardiogenic etiology noted.
[**12-15**] CT Head: Age-appropriate atrophy with chronic microvascular disease as noted previously.
Lytic lesions in skull consistent with known multiple myeloma.
No interval change.
[**12-17**] TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (PASP = 37).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-10-4**], no major change (aortic valve area underestimated on prior study).
# Altered mental status: She has dementia and at baseline her mental status is alert and oriented to name.
She has had multiple episodes of altered mental status associated with infection in the past, notably with urinary tract infections.
Thus it was felt that her altered mental status was most likely secondary to a UTI (see below).
# UTI: She has a history of recurrent resistant Klebsiella UTIs.
Her admission urinalysis was borderline positive but was treated as altered mental status is her usual presentation for UTI.
She was treated with meropenem (based on previous culture data) and vancomycin for broad coverage.
# Anemia: Her anemia is likely secondary to MM.
Last iron studies [**8-14**] suggested anemia of chronic disease.
Hemolysis labs mostly unremarkable.
She did have a minimal amount of bright red blood in her stool on the day prior to discharge.
This was most likely secondary to her coagulopathy.
# Elevated lactate: Initially there was concern urosepsis as she met SIRS criteria on presentation to the ED.
Elevated lactate can also be seen with MM, though not commonly.
It could also have been secondary to decreased liver clearance.
THough she has no known history of liver disease and LFTs were within normal limits, her INR were elevated and her albumin was low, suggesting decreased hepatic function.
# Congestive Heart Failure: EF 45% on recent ECHO w/ HK of LV, dilated RV w/ mod to severe TR, and mild to Mod MR.
Evidence of CHF on CXR and exam.
BNP elevated but not significantly above prior values.
Some concern for cardiac ischemia which could contribute to systolic and diastolic dysfunction although CKs negative.
TTE showed no major change from prior.
This was felt most likely to reflect demand-mediated ischemia in the setting of initial tachycardia with decreased clearance of troponin given CKD.
She is not on spirin as an outpatient and her daughter refused in the [**Name (NI) **] given the patient's bleeding history.
# Afib: She has a history of atrial fibrillation and has declined anticoagulation as an outpatient given her history of bleeding and coagulopathy.
Her heart rate was maintained within normal limits during this admission, though she remained in atrial fibrillation.
# Coagulopathy: She has a chronic coagulopathy, likely secondary to MM, with baseline INR 1.6-2.1.
Has a history of bleeding in her gums and nares.
She did have a minimal amount of bright red blood in her stool on the day prior to discharge.
This was most likely secondary to her coagulopathy.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: She has Stage IV chronic kidney disease secondary to MM.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Her DM is well-controlled with her last HbA1C 6.3.
She was continued on an insulin sliding scale and diabetic diet.
# RUE swelling: She had right upper extremity swelling on admission.
Had ultrasound of RUE in [**9-13**] which showed no DVT.
# Multiple Myeloma (IgG)- The patient/family has consistently declined treatment for this.
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease: She was continued on a PPI per her outpatient regimen.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) **] house  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Urinary tract infection Secondary: 1) Multiple myeloma 2) Coronary artery disease s/p CABG and NSTEMI 3) Chronic systolic congestive heart failure 4) Atrial fibrillation 5) Chronic kidney disease 6) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 7) Hypertension 8) Anemia 9) Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with altered mental status and a urinary tract infection.
You were treated with antibiotics and your mental status came back to your normal baseline.
If you develop change in mental status again, persistent fever > 101, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please return to the emergency room.
