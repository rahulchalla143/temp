OTHER DIAGNOSES:  Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, pneumothorax, gout, history of papillary and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of grade clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma on the left side in [**2158**], at which time the patient underwent a left nephrectomy and left adrenalectomy.
Followup in the ensuing years has revealed a lesion in the right kidney which - on MRI in [**2162-5-7**] - was a CNS enhancing lesion in the posterior mid portion.
Repeat MRI in [**2162-11-6**] showed an enlarging nodular enhancing complex cyst in the posterior right mid kidney.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes papillary and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, lower back pain, sciatica, history of elbow surgery, thyroid disorder, essential tremor, gout, cardiac stent in [**2162-5-7**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a male in no apparent distress room air who was normocephalic and atraumatic, with clear lungs bilaterally, and a regular rate and rhythm, with an abdomen that was soft and obese, with a well-healed scar on the left side and nontender belly, with a circumcised phallus and normal testes, and no extremity defects or neurological defects.
Postoperatively, the patient was difficult to extubate immediately postoperatively; most likely due to volume overload.
In addition, the patient was found to have a small right apical pneumothorax postoperatively following which was recognized intraoperatively; and a chest tube was placed intraoperatively.
Chest tube was placed to water seal which initially showed and increasing of the pneumothorax and went back on suction; but subsequent chest x-rays showed a decreasing pneumothorax, and by discharge pneumothorax was clinically insignificant.
The patient remained stable neurologically throughout with adequate pain control throughout the hospitalization and clear mentation.
Therefore, upon discharge, the patient was ambulating, producing adequate urine via Foley, passing flatus and tolerating a regular diabetic diet, and without significant pain or discomfort.
This JP fluid was sent for creatinine which was consistent with a urine leak.
Therefore, the patient is to be discharged home with Foley for bladder decompression and JP in place while the urine leak seals itself.
