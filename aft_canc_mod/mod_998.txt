Pt currently intubated and family present did not have any further history.
History taken from ED notes, Pt presented with increasing SOB today & increased work of breathing, difficulty getting a full breath.
+F/C but no N/V.
Past Oncology History: He was found to have an elevated AFP on routine screening in [**2196-4-20**] (normal in [**2193**]).
At that time, imaging revealed a large mass in his liver with smaller liver masses.
Prior to starting chemotherapy, he became short of breath and was found to have a pulmonary embolism as well as portal, hepatic, and IVC thrombosis.
Family History: He has four siblings who all have hepatitis B.
One brother died recently secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma.
He has another brother that is currently undergoing evaluation for likely diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Gen:  NAD, AAOx3 HEENT: MMM, OP-ETT in place, mild icterus Neck:  No LAD, Heart: Tachy unable to hear murmur Lungs:  coarse BS Abd: Markedly distended, severe hepatomegaly, tympanic, +BS Extr:  1+ LE edema Neuro: sedated  Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT C/A/P [**2-6**] (the day prior to admission): IMPRESSION:  Increase in the size and extent of multiple pulmonary nodules as well as liver masses.
An increase in the amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.
All of these findings are consistent with progression of disease.
Right middle and lower lobe atelectasis with adjacent predominantly subpulmonic right pleural effusion.
Widespread pulmonary metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the lung, complicated by PE, IVC, portal, and hepatic vein thrombosis on lovenox, who presented to the ED with tachypnea and hypotension.
# Sepsis/Respiratory distress: His initial presentation with hypotension was concerning for sepsis although no clear source was found.
His respiratory distress and increased work of breathing was thought to be compensation for his acidosis and he eventually required intubation.
His elevated LFTs and renal function were thought to be due to poor end-organ perfusion due to his hypotension and improved somewhat with IV fluid resuscitation.
# Anemia: He was noted to have coffee ground emesis in his NG tube and required support with multiple transfusions of red blood cells and FFP in an attempt to reverse his INR in the setting of active bleeding.
# Dispo: Due to his history of end-stage metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and his presentation to the ED with likely sepsis, there was discussion in the ED about the appropriateness of intubation and aggressive measures.
# H/o PE, portal, hepatic, and IVC thrombosis: -Continued lovenox until [**2-8**], when it was d'ced, as care was transitioned to comfort measures only per family wishes .
