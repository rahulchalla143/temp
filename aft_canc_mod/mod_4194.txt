There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-2-10**], no definite change.
Large right-sided pleural fluid collection with differential attenuation in apex.
Given recent preceding study demonstrating small pneumothorax and no intervening CXR demonstrating resolution, a small component of resideual pleural air cannot be excldued.
However, given there is no air-fluid level on upright view, if present, it is unlikely to be significant.
LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Partial occlusion of the right internal jugular vein from thrombus, left internal jugular vein is diminutive but patent.
Extensive right upper lobe mass, atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left.
Extensive necrotic mediastinal and right supraclavicular necrotic lymph node masses.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 W with history of lung adenocarcinoma complicated by brain metastases presenting with two days of dyspnea on exertion, found to have large right-sided pleural effusion .. # Right-sided Pleural Effusion: The patient presented with two days of increased dyspnea and worsening facial swelling since her recent discharge.
A large R-sided pleural effusion was seen on imaging and the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pleurex catheter placement by Interventional Pulmonology on [**2107-2-16**].
The pleural fluid culture returned with no growth.
The patient was discharged home with instructions to drain the pleurex catheter (on R) every other day or for symptoms until her follow-up with IP.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to a recent four day course of filgrastim.
In the Emergency Department she was given a dose of levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime; however, these agents were not immediately continued in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] because of the patient's lack of systemic symptoms and complaints supporting infection.
Pleural fluid, expectorated sputum culture, urine cultures revealed no growth.
She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course.
# Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: Patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung discovered in [**6-/2106**], metastatic to right temporal lobe and status-post stereotactic radiotherapy.
# Access: History of multiple DVTs including R IJ and cephalic, small non-occlusive residual clot in L lower IJ.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasonds were obtained in case of need for femoral line placement and revealed no clot.
# Thrush: Patient started on four day course of fluconozole given throat pain/discomfort and evidence of thrush on exam.
