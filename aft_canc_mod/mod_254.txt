On [**1-2**] patient had left hemiplegia and HA, was diagnosed with ICH from metastatic melanoma.
Underwent emergent craniotomy for evacuation of bleed and tumor rescetion, she was also started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
She then developed hydrocephalus and had VP shunt placed on [**1-6**] and repeat VP shunt operation on [**1-14**] secondary to her failure at clamping trials.
She also developed a diffuse morbiliform eruption rash after dilantin was started.
However, Dilantin was continued since the benefits of sizure prophylaxis outweighed risks of continuing medicaitons.
After discharge her fever resolved but the rash did not.
On day of admission ([**1-23**]) she developed a high fever with chills and was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**], and was then transfered here for further care.

Interval evolution of encephalomalacia and decrease of blood products at prior sites of hemorrhage.
Slight increase in right frontal subdural low density collection.
No new site of hemorrhage.
4-mm leftward midline shift.
Interval VP shunt placement, with no adjacent fluid collection.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
Small amount of pelvic free fluid, fluid in the endometrial cavity, and a small amount of air in the bladder may relate to recent LEEP procedure.
Increase in size of left buttock subcutaneous nodule, highly concerning for metastatic disease in this patient with known melanoma.
Right paramedian Bartholin gland cyst with tiny dependent stone; less likely urethral diverticulum.
EKG: Sinus tach  Brief Hospital Course: Initially transferred to MICU for closer monitoring for development vessicles/bullae or mucosal involvment.
#Rash: Most likely hypersensitivity reaction (DRESS) from dilantin vs famotidine.
Concerned for SJS initially, however rash did not appear to involve mucosa or palms/soles, and no bullae.
Also considered toxic shock syndrome initially w/ fever and rash, but no tampon use.
No evidence of meningitis given neck supple, no headache, CSF fluid does not appear infected, no fluid around abdominal portion of VP shunt.
LFTs trending down, Cr stable, but she had a persistant eosinophilia.
Infection considered, however no localizing signs of infection and no sick contacts.
No Abx given.
Likely [**3-15**] insensible losses from fever and rash.
No current e/o neurologic defict other than left facial droop likely residual from previous ICH.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO every 6-8 hours as needed for itching.
Hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Drug Related Esosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms  Secondary Diagnosis: Metastatic Melanoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital for a fever and rash that is likely due to the dilantin you were prescribed for seizure propalaxis.
The rash might worsene before it gets better and it is possible your skin will slough off as it heals.
Instead take Keppra as prescribed for seizure prophalaxis.
