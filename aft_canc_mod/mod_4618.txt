Given his recent history of deep vein thrombosis, a chest CT was considered, but was not pursued there given elevated creatinine.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his creatinine was noted to be normal and a chest CT revealed a filling defect in the right lower lobe that could be artifact versus thrombus.
He was also noted to have a right lower lobe pneumonia and received a dose of levofloxacin 750 mg daily.
In the ICU he was noted to have a drop in his Hct from 30 to 22.
He underwent a CT abdomen and pelvis which showed small clustered pockets of free air in the right mesenteric region concerning for microperforation.
Given his poor prognosis and response to therapy for glioblastoma and new bowel perforation a family meeting was held.
Right frontal glioblastoma multiforme involving the genu of the corpus calosum.

Pertinent Results: CBC: 5.4 > 10.5/30.5 < 237 Chem: 141 | 104 | 34 < 117       3.8 | 24 | 1.1  EKG: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, LAD, RBBB, LAFB, no significant change from prior EGD on [**2175-5-12**]  Head CT: Abnormal R frontal lobe, wiht likely combination of underlying neoplasm and edema.
Eval for ischemia in this setting is limited and MRI would be better to evaluate.
No hemorrhage  Chest CT: 1.
Right middle and lower lobe patchy opacities, likely pneumonia; however, document resolution on followup.
Apparent filling defect in the right lower lobe segmental vessel could represent old/adherent mural thrombus, with majority of the vessel being patent.
Given history of malignancy continued follow-up is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 86581**] is a 73-year-old [**Known lastname 595**] speaking male with a history of glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer, recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis admitted with altered mental status, hypoxia and tachycardia during radiation.
who presented with dyspnea likely due to a small pulmonary emboli from known DVT - also found to have microperforation of the bowel and is being transitioned to hospice/palliative care.
It was discussed with them in depth that his bowel perforation would be the likely cause of his passing away.
Given repeat reiterations from the family that they understood this but still wished his pneumonia symptoms to be managed, patient was given a three day course of Levofloxacin.
