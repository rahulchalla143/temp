HISTORY: 79-year-old male with recent subdural hemorrhage and decreased mobility, now presenting with fever, tachycardia, to rule out pulmonary embolism.
FINDINGS:  CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
There are small bibasal effusions with extensive consolidation in the left lower lobe most likely infectious or may be related to aspiration.
There is biapical pleural thickening and scarring.
There is a hiatus hernia containing food residue.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are extensive multilevel degenerative changes present in the spine.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Consolidation at the left lung base along with small bibasal effusions likely infectious or may be related to aspiration.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-3-18**] 3:49 PM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: pls eveal for worsening SDH or increased ICP  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old woman with hx SDH, now declined mental status REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: pls eveal for worsening SDH or increased ICP CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
FINDINGS: Redemonstrated is evolving hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe, unchanged in size.
The small mass effect along the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is also unchanged.
There is a small resolving subdural hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe that has slightly decreased in size.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
The appearance of the ventricular system is unchanged, remarkable for involutional change.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities and the osseous structures are unchanged, with redemonstration of a displaced right occipital and temporal bone fractures with opacification of the mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Overall, no significant interval change without acute hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo hx DM2 recently admitted for SDH and at rehab who now p/w fevers, tachycardia, emesis and likely aspiration PNA vs pneumonitis.
#ASPIRATION PNA: fever, leukocytosis & LLL consolidation on CT most likely due to aspiration PNA vs pneumonitis.
Pt was ruled out for influenza A/B.
She completed a course of Vancomycin and cefepime for aspiration pneumonia.
Respiratory status improved, she was breathing comfortably on room air without fever for several days prior to transfer back to nursing home.
Follow up CT chest showed resolving LLL pneumonia and atelectasis, no evidence of PE.
#h/o ?
C. Diff, -early in hospitalization she was continued on treatment for for C. Diff as she was recently positive & being treated with Flagyl at OSH.
# Subdural hemorrhage: family was concerned that pt was having MS changes on [**3-18**], non-con head CT was essentially unchanged.
Pt is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for SDH as outpt.
CSF cell counts were normal, no evidence of infection, cultures were negative.
She was continued on seizure prophylaxis, without evidence of seizure activity Amantadine was started per neurology recomendations to see if it would help improve her mental status.
Her baseline since her subdural hematoma is non-verbal, not following commands, sometimes opens eyes.
# Sinus Tachycardia: persistent chronic tachycardia without apparent etiology, but multiple possibilities including fever, hypovolemia, pe, or central process.
Tachycardia persisted after fever resolved, after volume resuscitation with ivfs ct chest was negative for PE.
Of note, had been on beta blocker on admit--was discontinued here initially with acute illness.
Could consider re-starting at rehab if ongoing tachycardia.
