Admission Date:  [**2163-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-4-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis in setting of radiation treatment.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is an 80-year-old man with a history of DM II, HTN, AS (valve area 1.1), medium-[**First Name3 (LF) 12425**] vasculitis and seronegative arthritis (on prednisone and hydroxy-chloroquine), 3-[**First Name3 (LF) 12425**]-disease (LM 70%, Mid LAD 60%, Ramus mild disease, OM1 100%, Distal RCA 100%.)
awaiting CABG, and atypical fibroxanthoma of the nose requiring radiation who presents to ED with chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting during radiation treatment.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] was subsequently transferred to the MICU with low BP, melena, Hct drop, ST depressions in V3-V6, and elevated troponin.
In ED, CXR showed new mild pulmonary edema, moderate right pleural effusion, mild cardiomegaly, L>R bibasilar atelectasis.
Cardiology consult in the ICU concluded that elevated troponins were likely reflective of demand ischemia/NSTEMI rather than plaque rupture.
Cardiac symptoms occurred in setting of pulmonary edema and anemia, putting added strain on an already diseased heart.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] could not be started on a heparin drip due to nasal bleeding and melena.
It was thought that anemia was most likely the result of a slow nasal bleed rather than an acute GI bleed.
ROS:  Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or any other concerning symptom.
Past Medical History: # large atypical fibroxanthoma involving the nasal dorsum # 3VD awaiting CABG: He was scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery in the last week of [**2163-1-28**].

Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including 3-[**Name2 (NI) 12425**] CAD awaiting CABG, bleeding nasal tumor, and DM II who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for demand ischemia vs. NSTEMI in the setting of low hematocrit and hypotension.
#CAD:  Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] has severe 3-[**Known lastname 12425**] disease and is awaiting CABG (and AVR) however, surgery has been delayed in light of bleeding nasal tumor.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] was admitted to the hospital after complaining of chest pain, SOB, and diaphoresis during a radiation treatment.
He was found to have ST depressions in V3-V6, elevated troponins, drop in hct, and low BP.
It was felt that this was demand ischemia in context of anemia (slowly bleeding nasal tumor).
Plavix was stopped in light of bleeding and in preparation for CABG.
Patient remained chest pain free throughout duration of admission.
NASAL CANCER:  Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] with atypical fibroxanthoma diagnosed in 5/[**2162**].
Currently being treated by radiation-oncology; treatment was extended through [**4-13**] as tumor was slow to regress.
SERONEGATIVE ARTHRITIS:  Patient carries a diagnosis of seronegative arthritis, managed by outpatient rheumatologist and seen at [**Hospital1 18**] rheumatology in 7/[**2162**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 12928**] did not have any acute drops in hct during admission.
CHF:  Patient appeared slightly volume overloaded on admission, but after diuresis remained euvolemic.
DELIRIUM:  Patient had one episode of delirium during admission at which time he reported "being in a furniture store" and seeing "butterflies" in the halls.
Outpatient doses may need to be adjusted in context of increased prednisone.
CONJUNCTIVITIS:  Secondary to radiation.

You came to the hospital because you were having chest pain and shortness of breath during your radiation treatment.
You will eventually need to go for cardiac bypass surgery.
Call you doctor or return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in your urine or stools, fevers, chills, sweats, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.
