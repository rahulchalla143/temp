ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 101686**] is a 45-year-old woman who has had metastatic breast cancer notably to the lung, bone, brain, endometrium, and the liver who was recently diagnosed with pelvic disease in [**2186-1-9**], after a biopsy secondary to vaginal bleeding.
She presented with persistent complaints for approximately 2 weeks of feeling bloated and obstipated with some crampy abdominal pain.
She had also had some bilious nausea and vomiting.
As her symptoms worsened, she sought medical attention several times, and finally was evaluated in the ED for an acute change in the pain.
She did not have any palpable cervical adenopathy.
Rectal exam did not have any stool in the vault, but otherwise no masses palpable.
The patient had a CT of the abdomen in order to further assess the etiology of the obstruction and was found to have distal large bowel obstruction from pelvic metastases with secondary ischemic infarction of the ascending colon, as per pneumatosis coli.
She also had some right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter from the distal obstruction, and several metastatic liver lesions were noted.
There were sclerotic metastases to the bone present.
Therefore, the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2186-4-8**] and underwent a total abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy, sigmoid colon mucous fistula, and omentectomy.
There was no note of intraoperative complication or excessive blood loss.
She remained intubated and spent the night in the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory support and management of fluid status.
This was evaluated, and as the patient's hematocrit was stable, and she was maintaining good O2 sats, it was felt this was secondary to a combination of dehydration and pain.
Therefore, she was aggressively rehydrated with lactated Ringer's, and pain control was achieved postoperatively with the use of PCA.
By postoperative day #3, it was apparent that the patient's pain was a combination of acute and chronic pain.
It was felt that the pain management service should be involved and; therefore, they were consulted to manage the patient's acute on chronic pain.
She did not really respond to the methadone PCA and required some dilaudid intermittently, but by postoperative day #4, she was showing evidence of bowel activity and, therefore, was started on her PO pain medications along with some additional Vioxx which actually did control her pain.
She always maintained stable pressures, and only had a low-grade temp of 101.6 which was thought to be secondary to atelectasis.
It was felt that by postoperative day #6, this patient was on a regular diet which she was tolerating without any difficulty, and that she had excellent pain control with PO medications, and was ambulating to the best of her ability, that she could be discharged to home in fair condition.
The acute pain management service recommendations were followed up for her pain.
