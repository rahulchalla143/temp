Admission Date:  [**2106-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-7-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-8-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29226**] Chief Complaint: pericardial effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis, drain placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 43 year old woman with no significant past medical history and is being transferred to the CCU s/p pericardiocentesis for recurrent pericardial effusion.
Patient was in her usual state of health up until [**2106-4-20**] when she developed RUQ abdominal pain.
An abdominal US showed abnormal thickening of the gallbladder and cholecystitis, w/o intra/extra hepatic dilatation, changes c/w fatty liver disease, and a small pleural effusion.
She underwent cholecystectomy and 1 week post op developed pericardial effusion.
She had a mammogram that showed benign microcalcifications, no radiographic evidence of malignancy.
A repeat echocardiogram [**5-26**] showed EF 60%, nl LV thickness and wall motion, normal RV/LA, no valvular dysfunction and no effusion.
1 week prior to this admission, patient developed swelling in her right neck which was thought to be reactive lymphadenopathy.
Over the past two days she developed DOE and went to [**Hospital6 **] where she was found to have redeveloped pericardial effusion w/o tamponade.
Upon arrival to the floor patient had a pulsus pf 15, and an echocardiogram that showed tamponade physiology and echodense mass in the R AV groove extending into the pericardial space that was not viewed on repeat echo.
She underwent CT neck/chest that preliminarily showed: bl pleural effusions, opacity in RUL w/o air bronchograms c/w pneumonia but cannot exclude underlying mass, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes on right, filling defects in svc and L brachiocephalic.
While getting CT scan she had several episodes of hemoptysis.
She also had a RUE US for RUE edema that showed DVT in R subclavian vein.

**FINAL REPORT [**2106-7-2**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2106-7-2**]):    No MRSA isolated.
**FINAL REPORT [**2106-7-1**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2106-7-1**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
DIAGNOSIS: Pericardial fluid, cell block: Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Note:  The tumor cells have enlarged nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.
Some of the tumor cells appear to display cytoplasmic mucin and admixed calcifications are identified.
Immunohistochemical studies show diffuse staining of the atypical cells with cytokeratin 7.
The atypical cells are nonreactive for calretinin.
WT-1 demonstrates non-specific cytoplasmic staining.
[**2106-6-29**] Cytology Pericardial fluid:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
There is an echodense structure/mass (~2.4 cm diameter) in the region of the right AV groove extending into the pericardial space.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Successful pericardiocentesis for large pericardial effusion.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No pericardial mass is seen.
The previously noted mass in the right atrioventricular groove is no longer evident (may have been fat in the AV groove that was unusually prominent due to the presence of effusion).
There is a non-occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein.
Peripheral right cephalic vein occluded, at around the location of the previous PICC line entry site.
Partially imaged opacity in the right upper lobe concerning for consolidation but underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded.
Bilateral lymph nodes seen at levels III, IV and V, with pathologic enlargement on the right.
Filling defects in the SVC and brachiocephalic veins, suggestive of focal thrombus versus artifact.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2106-6-30**]  CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: A focal consolidation within the right upper lobe (700B:32) exhibits multiple air bronchograms, compatible with pneumonia.
No mass effect is seen.
Neighboring mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present.
A ground-glass opacity at the left lower lobe (6:19) is likely inflammatory.
Moderate-sized pleural effusions are present, greater on the right, with associated compressive atelectasis.
A trace pericardial effusion is present (6:23).
A large filling defect is seen at the main left lower segmental pulmonary artery as well as multiple subsegmental branches (6:23, 27).
The assessment of the remaining subsegmental branches is limited due to non-optimized bolus timing.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A hypodense lesion within the right lobe of the liver (6:58) is most likely a hepatic cyst, however, this remains too small for further characterization.
The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air or free fluid.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon and intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There is no intrapelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
The distal ureters and urinary bladder are unremarkable.
No adnexal masses are present.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild multilevel degenerative changes are present throughout, most severe at L5/S1.
No acute fracture or dislocation is seen.
No concerning blastic or lytic lesions are detected.
Left segmental pulmonary embolism, involving multiple left lower subsegmental arterial branches.
Focal consolidation within the right upper lobe is concerning for pneumonia.
Followup to resolution is recommended, as an underlying mass cannot be excluded.
Moderate-sized pleural effusions, larger on the right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic pathology detected.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
No evidence of tamponade.
[**2106-7-1**] Abdominal X-ray: There is no evidence of free air.
There are no dilated small bowel loops.
There is no sign of pneumatosis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
Interval development of massive abdominal and pelvic hemoperitoneum.
Ruptured left adnexal cyst, as detailed above, is most likely the cause.
Small bowel mild distention, likely reactive ileus.
Interval development of tiny anterior pericardial effusion.
Slightly increased bilateral, right greater than left, pleural effusions.
Right upper lobe mass grossly unchanged.
Hemorrhagic material in pelvis as seen on the prior CT. A 2.7 cm corpus luteum cyst is seen within the left ovary.
No additional suspicious left ovarian mass is identified.
Fibroid uterus.
[**2106-7-5**] Bilateral LENIS: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F p/w recurrent pericardial effusion w/ tamponade and RUE swelling, found to have RUL opacity, lymphadenopathy on CT and R subclavian DVT US, now s/p pericardiocentesis w drain (dc'd).
# Pericardial effusion/Malignancy:  Recurrent pericardial effusion - 1st in [**2106-4-20**] at [**Hospital3 **].
Pt was admitted on [**6-29**], TTE suggested tamponade physiology with RV diastolic collapse and mod/large effusion.
She underwent pericardiocentesis with percardial drain placement, which drained serosanguinous fluid and was discontinued on [**6-30**].
Follow up ECHO showed trivial amount of pericardial fluid and serial pulsus wnl.
On admission she was hemodynamically stable, although she complained of some positional chest pain.
Cytology was found have malignant cells suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Also, could consider endoscopy looking for GI sources as she has a recent iron deficiency anemia.
She was guaiac negative and had mild hematemesis (coffee grounds vs. food).
Her vital signs were stable (HR unchanged at 105, BP 140/90 no orthostasis) and she states she felt dizzy.
Multiple episodes hemoptysis during CT neck/chest (obtained CT neck only).
No episodes of hemoptysis since admission.
CT chest showed RUL opacity with questionable underlying mass.
Pt also presented with an acute submandibular node: mildly tender, firm, rubbery, 2cm in size.
- was eventually biopsied and found to have lung adenocarcinoma.
Abd u/s performed at OSH [**5-/2106**] showing cholecystitis, w/o intra/extra hepatic dilatation, changes c/w fatty liver disease, and a small pleural effusion.
Pt does not appear to have obstructive process given non-elevated Tbili and benign abd exam.
#Access: Very poor access given b/l UE dvts and pitting edema.
LUE edema worsened today.
Has 2 PIVs but no venous access for labs, team has been art sticking for labs daily and PTT trending.
# Abd pain: Pt w new c/o abd pain x 2days, worsening overnight from [**1-27**] to [**6-29**] alleviated by morphine.
Pt w transaminitis on admission, coagulopathy and febrile yesterday at 8pm(currently afebrile).
# Tachycardia: Sinus rhythm.
Tachycardia attributed to anemia and pain.
Fe low, Ferritin v low, slight elevated TIBC/Transferrin indicate anemia likely [**12-22**] iron deficiency.
Abdominal distension - has been having abdominal distension and pain, unclear why.
She got a fleets enema which helped her pass a lot of gas, and a lot of relief of discomfort.
--------------- MICU [**Location (un) **] Course: The patient was transferred to the MICU for a 15 point hematocrit drop while on heparin.
A CT torso showed massive abdominal and pelvic hemoperitoneum from a ruptured left adnexal cyst with a reactive ileus.
Also noted were a small anterior pericardial effusion and interval development of bilateral pleural effusions.
A pelvic ultrasound confirmed a corpus luteum cyst without other suspicious GYN pathology.
Likely secondary to her ileus, increased intrabdominal pressure, and splinting the patient developed respiratory distress requiring supplemental oxygen from which she was weaned after abdominal decompression.
Bilateral LENI's showed no evidence of lower extremity DVT.
MRI detailed a punctate area of abnormal enhancement involving the right temporal lobe suspicious for metastasis.
IP took the patient for bronchoscopy and performed transbronchial biopsies, cytologic brushes, and bronchoalveolar lavage.
OMED Course  - patient was admitted to OMED service once it was discovered she had adenocarcinoma of the lung.
She had an episode of upper extremity swelling and Ultrasound showed clot extension in her upper extremities.
#DVT For her upper extremity clots she is bridged with lovenox prior to discharge.
# Pericardial Effusion - As for her pericardial effusion, which is likely to reaccumulate: Discussion with cardiothoracic surgery lend us to conclude that given her current status (in terms of prognosis) it is prudent to not do the pericardial window and the plan is to watch her to see if it reaccumulate.
Patient will need follow up ECHO to see if fluid reaccumulates.
#Transaminitis - patient's transaminitis that started while she was in the unit reoccured, with unclear etiology, nothing new on Ultrasound aside from NAFL.
Medications on Admission: MVI  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pericardial Effusion Adenocarcinoma of unknown source  Secondary Diagnosis:   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have metastatic adenocarcinoma.
