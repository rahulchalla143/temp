Admission Date:  [**2188-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-6-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: lower extremity weakness, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 8789**] is an 87-yo man with history of colon cancer (refusing treatment), PAF, CHF with chronic pleural effusions who presented with lower extremity weakness and was found to be hypoxic with O2 sat in the 80s requiring NRB and MICU admission.
The patient was mostly recently admitted on [**2188-6-20**] for hypotension likely from dehydration.
A day later, on the day of this admission, he felt as if his legs were "rubbery" and that he had difficulty ambulating even with his walker.
He denies dyspnea, chest pain, lightheadedness, or worsening of his leg edema.
CXR revealed worsening R pleural effusion.
Past Medical History: Colonoscopy [**2184-3-25**]: >Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy) - adenoma >Polyps in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)- Colonic mucosa with focal hyperplastic features >Polypoid, ulcerated mass in the hepatic flexure (biopsy) - Superficial fragments of colonic mucosa with ulceration, marked acute inflammation, and highly atypical glands, suspicious for carcinoma.
Past history: # Colon mass during colonoscopy for guaiac positive stools in [**2184**].
Pathology was worrisome for carcinoma.
Although the patient was offered resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he declined # hematuria/BPH - traumatic foley insertion and manipulation [**3-16**] lead to urosepsis and subsequent urinary retention # sick sinus syndrome and bifascicular block s/p pacemaker [**2184**]  # PAF - on amiodarone, not on coumadin d/t concern for malignancy # H/O SVT # Atrial flutter status post ablation [**2-/2186**] - not on anticoagulation d/t concern for malignancy # Anemia - on arenesp and iron # Echo [**2186**]: mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, RA and LA # BPH s/p TURMP [**2187**] # b/l edema with skin changes # hard of hearing # hx of guiaic positive stools/GI bleeding # osteoarthritis # osteoporosis # subclinical hypothyroid state as per record # [**Year (4 digits) **] insufficiency # right pleural effusion - Found on CT on [**2188-2-25**] for increasing DOE.
[**3-6**] and [**3-18**] thoracentesis c/w transudative.
Workup during last admission revealed RV diastolic dysfunction.
Concern was for PE as etiology, but unable to get CTA d/w ARF and V/Q not helpful.
Not anticoagulated due to h/o GIB, pleurodesis not an option d/t transudative.
# Tibial talar dislocation with comminuted distal tib fib fracture status post surgery [**2181**] # hx syncope in [**2181**], unclear etiology   Social History: living at lone at home with VNA, Former smoker with 35-pk-yrs, quit 50-55 yrs ago.
Also had an unknown cancer.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, conjunctiva pale, OP clear, no exudates or erythema.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs: Crackles at L base, decreased BS at R base.
Otherwise clear, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No masses, no HSM.
SKIN: No rash but chronic venous stasis changes to LE bilaterally.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, conjunctiva pale, OP clear, no exudates or erythema.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No masses, no HSM.
EXT: trace edema to mid-shins bilaterally.
SKIN: No rash but chronic venous stasis changes to LE bilaterally.
It is likely that he experienced a CHF exacerbation [**2-23**] to the IVF given on last admission and [**2-23**] to decreased lasix on discharge.
His "weakness" was consistent with deconditioning and poor cardiopulmonary status on admission rather than focal leg weakness.
His hypoxia continued to improve with 90-94% RA and on ambulation.
He did have rare desturations at night to 87% and may benefit from O2 at night in the future.
He was discharged without shortness of breath or hypoxia on his orginal home dose of lasix 40mg daily.
If you have difficulty breathing, light-headeness, chest pain or fever, you should return to the emergency room.
