Admission Date:  [**2142-4-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-4-21**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: code stroke  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 83 yo woman with only known vascular RF HTN "well controlled since starting cozaar" who presents with acute onset L weakness/ataxia starting at 8:30AM.
She had been in USOH with no recent illnesses, and ate breakfast this AM as usual.
She was working out, lifting weights at 8:30 when she noticed that she had trouble getting the weight above her head with the left hand.
She called her daughter at several minutes after 8:30, who traveled to her house to find that she was walking with a relative's walker, as she was having trouble with the left leg as well - the left arm still felt weak and clumsy.
No slurred speech, language difficulties, changes in facial appearance, visual c/o or other sx at that time, no HA (though she periodically gets posterior HA's, last one was last thursday).
NIHSS score was 3 for L arm and leg ataxia and subtle L leg drift.
A head CT was performed stat and showed no early signs of stroke.
CTA showed no vascular occlusion (recons pending), and CT perfusion was preliminarily normal as well.
She began to have semi-rhythmic shaking of the left leg and periodic tremulousness of the left arm with preserved consciousness - it was unclear whether this could be related to subcortical vascular lesion affecting basal ganglia versus seizure activity - due to the severity of deficits (couldn't walk) she was taken emergently to MRI (10:45AM on the table).
DWI sequences performed first revealed two punctate lesions suggestive of embolic infarcts - post frontal and parietal on R.  There was a white matter lesion on DWI that appeared confluent and was suspected to represent edema related to strokes, thus TPA given for weight of 140lbs (estimated based on appearance and information from daughter): total dose of 57.2 mg=mL, with initial bolus 5.7 mg administered by nursing at 11:14, infusion 51.5 mg at 11:26.
Past Medical History: PMH: HTN Hyperparathyroidism Recent "varicose vein injections" No known heart or kidney problems, no coumadin hx   Social History: Social History: Lives with sister, runs/walks [**2-17**] miles per day and does yoga, eats healthy diet, does not smoke or drink etoh   Family History: Family History: Sister with heart problems, no strokes in family   Physical Exam: Normal neurologic exam, except for mild dysmetria of the left arm and end-gaze nystagmus (the latter likely due to dilantin)  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurological ICU after being given tPA.
While in the scanner on admission, she had a left-sided seizure, where her leg convulsed.
No perfusion abnormality.
No evidence of significant stenosis within the circle of [**Last Name (LF) 431**], [**First Name3 (LF) 16423**] tributaries, or head and neck vessels.
Three-mm saccular, narrow necked aneurysm at the origin of the anterior temporal branch of the right middle cerebral artery.
Minimal hyperdensity within the right parietal subcortical white matter.
This is a nonspecific finding, but may be associated with mild calcifications.
Along with the imaging findings of the MR brain, these could represent fine calcifications associated with a low-grade glioma.
18 x 12 mm left parieto-occipital meningioma.
Bilateral thyroid nodules.
She sustained no complications of tPA and was transferred to the neurology floor service for further treatment and evaluation.
Small areas of slow diffusion within the right frontal and parietal cortex involves both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter regions.
The extent and involvement of the white matter is less consistent with infarction, and is more consistent with an infiltrating lesion -a low-grade glioma most likely.
Left parietooccipetal meningioma.
Repeat MRI showed "The enhancement pattern and the ASL perfusion findings are suggestive of an infiltrative brain neoplasm as compared to an infarct".
MRS [**Last Name (STitle) 654**] "spectroscopic findings are suggestive of a neoplastic lesion"  CT torso to rule out malignancy showed "1.
A 12-mm lesion in the left kidney, may represent a solid lesion versus a hyperdense cyst.
Further evaluation with ultrasound or MR is recommended.
Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
Prominent right axillary lymph nodes."
Of note, she clearly expressed the desire not to have medical information withheld from her, no matter what the diagnosis; this stood in contrast to her daughters' wishes, but the patient was deemed to have decisional capacity.
