She had a fever two days ago to 102, since then has had more low-grade temps.
No N/V, no dysuria.
Does have diffuse abdominal pain that has been stable since her umbilical hernia repair.
She started having serosanguinous drainage from the surgical site two days ago.
Hyponatremia to 120.
Transplant surgery aspirated 300ccs from the fluid collection and sent for gram stain and culture.
Family refused central line, though the patient is full code, given a fear of CVL placement not from personal experience, but from things she has heard about them.
After fluid resuscitation and normalization of blood pressure, the patient again became hypotensive to the 80s, asymptomatic, but the decision was made at that time to admit the patient to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is comfortable, reporting [**5-21**] pain at her surgical site, [**11-20**] with palpation.
Past Medical History: -Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by esophageal variceal bleeding s/p banding, encephalopathy, ascites, caput medusae, and hepatic hydrothorax.
-HCC (3cm liver lesion with AFP=16,322) s/p TACE with follow-up AFP=2.1 -Iron deficiency anemia, presumed secondary to GI loss from multiple AVMs and internal hemorrhoids (Baseline Hct 24-30) -CAD status post possible MI.
-Diastolic, right sided CHF with EF greater than 55% ([**3-/2153**]) -Hypertension -AAA s/p endovascular repair -Pulmonary hypertension (per ECHO) -CKI (Baseline Cr 1.0-1.4) -COPD on home O2 and bronchodilators in the past.
-GERD -Right ankle surgery following injury in [**2128**], which prevents her from being get MRIs.
-H/o Lower extremity cellulitis.
-[**2154-6-6**] umbilical hernia repair with mesh  Social History: The patient lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 1562**], MA.
She does not drink EtOH nor use illicit drugs   Family History: Father died of liver disease at age 40.

Redness around surgical site, not warm or indurated.
Otherwise soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  .
Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact  Discharge exam - unchanged from above, except as below: Abdomen: recent umbilical hernia repair site with opened wound below the umbilicus, approx 4cmx3cmx3cm.

Large non-hemorrhagic fluid collection in the anterior subcutaneous tissues at the site of prior hernia repair.
Unchanged abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular repair.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and abdominal varices are similar to prior.
LENI ([**2154-7-8**]): IMPRESSION:  No left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
TTE ([**2154-7-10**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dilated and hyokinetic right ventricle.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 69yo female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by HCC who is s/p mesh ventral hernia repair on [**2154-6-6**] presenting with increasing peri-incisional abdominal pain, drainage from her surgical site, and fever up to 102 two days ago presenting to the emergency department with hypotension refractory to fluid boluses  # Hypotension: Thought to be from volume depletion (she was fluid responsive at admission).
Sepsis was also considered in setting of fever and surgical site infection.
She was initially admitted to the MICU for her hypotension with SBPs as low as the 70s in the ED.
Repeat urinalysis was negative for infection.
Patient also experienced a short run of ventricular bigeminy on [**2154-7-9**], but was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
# Infected surgical site fluid collection: She was initially started on Zosyn in the MICU while culture data was pending.
# Hyponatremia: Likely hypovoluemic hyponatremia as her sodium improved with folume resuscitation.
# Acute on CKI: As above, likely due to volume depletion.
# Crypotgenic cirrhosis: LFTs remained at baseline and her MELD was 7 at discharge.
She was continued on lactulose this admission with no evidence of encephalopathy.
# Anemia: Likely due to chronic disease, no evidence of acute blood loss.
A TTE was obtained which showed only depressed free wall contracility in the right ventricle and pulmonary hypertension.
Dx: 571.5 Cirrhosis without alcohol.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 68042**],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for fever and low blood pressure.
You were found to have an infection in the area around your umbilical hernia repair which was treated with antibiotics.
