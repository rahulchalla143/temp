PEG tube placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 23110**] is a 53yo M with PMH of HIV on Atripla (most recent CD4 count 240 on [**9-/2140**]), and recent diagnosis of tongue cancer, who is s/p direct laryngoscopy with biopsies at the posterior base of the tongue, and EGD with PEG tube placement presents s/p OR for supraglottic edema.
He required awake intubation with some possible irritation to the vocal cords.
He had direct laryngoscopy with biopsies of the tongue (suspected source of squamous cell carcinoma) in addition to EGD and PEG tube placement.
PEG was placed with GI given planned chemo and radiation in the near future.
Besides the laryngeal edema, no other complications.
Pt was placed on Propofol in the OR, and is doing well with no hemodynamic instability.
PET scan on [**2141-2-14**] that showed marked FDG-avid mass near the base of the tongue that measured approximately 33 x 26 mm as well as some residual FDG-avid uptake at the site of the prior lymph node.
Primary site thought to be tongue - HLD .
Past Surgical History: - s/p excisional biopsy of left cervical Lymph node [**2141-2-10**] - EGD & PEG [**2141-2-23**] - laryngoscopy, bx tongue [**2141-2-23**]   Social History: He smoked for approximately 20 years.

There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Otherwise, normal chest radiograph, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema, no pulmonary nodules, no pneumonia.
There is a band of atelectasis developing at the left base.
However, there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 23110**] is a 53yo M with PMH of HIV on Atripla (most recent CD4 count 240 on [**9-/2140**]), and recent diagnosis of tongue cancer, who is s/p direct laryngoscopy with biopsies at the posterior base of the tongue, and EGD with PEG tube placement presents s/p OR for supraglottic edema.
ENT reassessed the patient the following morning and he was extubated without complication.
S/p extubation, ENT performed a larygnoscopy that showed mild edema of the base of the tongue and an open airway without edema of the vocal cords.
# Squamous cell carcinoma: Seen by cervical LN biopsy on [**2141-2-10**].
Likely primary is tongue and now s/p posterior tongue biopsies on [**2141-2-23**].
The Ear Nose and Throat specialists were concerned that you would not be able to breathe without the help of the breathing tube, and so you were monitored for a day in the ICU with the breathing tube in place.
