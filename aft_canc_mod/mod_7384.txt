No cough, odynophagia.
+nonbloody watery diarrhea since having tubes pulled on [**11-5**].
An emergent renal U/S showed worsening bilat hyrdonephrosis.
Past Medical History: OncHx: Paget's disease of anal canal dx by path [**12-2**].
Colon pathology demonstrated adenocarcinoma involving lymphatics, submucosa, and superficial part of muscularis propria.
This was same histology as previous anal Paget's disease from [**12-2**] biopsy.
Other PMHx: - Colon cancer s/p lap resection in [**2193**] at [**Hospital3 **].
Believed to be node-negative, no chemo or radiation at time.
- HTN - Extra-mammary Paget's disease s/p resection [**12-2**] - s/p partial hysterectomy - s/p breast reduction surgery - h/o ophthalmologic zoster [**2192**] .
S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly BACK: L nephrostomy tube placed on left.
[**2199-11-10**]: Urine Culture: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
Layering material in the right upper pole may represent sediment or old blood.
[**2199-11-10**]: L nephrostomy placement - Nephrostogram demonstrating moderate left-sided hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter.
Successful placement of an 8 French percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the left by way of a posterior mid pole renal calix.
[**2199-11-11**]: R nephrostomy placement - Successful placement of an 8 French nephrostomy tube in the right kidney attached to a bag for external drainage.
Severe hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 76 y/o F with anal CA/colon CA s/p resection, hx of hydro with bilateral nephrostomy tubes s/p removal [**11-5**] here with decreased UOP, anal leakage found to have new ARF and bilateral hydro.
Bilateral hydronephrosis: The patient presented with bilateral hydronephrosis following a recent removal of ureteral stents that had been placed for her known cancer mass that had been compressing her ureters.
She will need f/u with IR in 3 months to change tubes or earlier if decision made to eschange for ureteral stents.
On presentation the Cr had increased to 7.7 secondary to the bilateral hydronephrosis.
Her medications were dosed for her impaired renal clearance.
Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient developed sepsis following placement of R PCN tube UCx was positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
There was no evidence of acute end-organ hypoperfusion.
could be secondary to co-incident illness (hydro/pyelo).
The increased ostomy output began to slow prior to discharge.
Metabolic Acidosis: This was a mixed anion-gap, non-anion gap acidosis due to a combination of renal failure (incr AG), hyperphosphotemia (incr AG), increased ostomy output (low AG), and dilutional acidosis from IVF (low AG).
She did not have a lactic acidosis.
Anal CA s/p resection: no acute inpatient events other than the hydronephrosis above.
Hypertension - blood pressure now resolving to baseline after her brief period of hypotension following the nephrostomy tube placement.
Her home ACE inhibitor was discontinued in the setting of renal failure.
Nephrostomy Tube Bilateral Nephrostomy Tube care per protocol   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bilateral Hydronephrosis Pyelonephritis Acute Renal Failure .
Discharge Instructions: You have been evaluated and treated for an infection in your kidney and for an obstruction to the flow of urine.
If you develop any new or concerning symptom, particularly fever to greater than 100.5F, decreasing urine output into the tubes, persistent nausea, please seek medical attention.
