No pneumothorax.
Bilateral central venous access lines.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary edema.
Hip films/AP pelvix [**2153-6-20**]: There is again seen a very large expansile lesion within the left proximal femora: There is a cortical breakthrough along the more medial aspect in the region of the lesser trochanter.
There are also diffuse lucent lesions throughout the pelvis and findings and proximal femurs consistent with no myelomatous deposits.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Low-attenuating region within the left frontal cortex is concerning for chronic versus less likely subacute process.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who reported no evidence of focal neurological deficits in the patient's recent history.
Sequelae consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
Mucosal thickening within the left maxillary sinus as well as possible mucus retention cyst within the left portion of the sphenoid sinus.
Extensive ground-glass and consolidative parenchymal opacities, involving all lobes, with a nondependent-dependent gradient increased in severity, most compatible with ARDS.
Numerous destructive lytic osseous lesions, compatible with history of known multiple myeloma.
[**2153-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global systolic function.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
[**2153-6-9**]: Skeletal series: IMPRESSION: Diffuse lytic lesions throughout the appendicular and peripheral skeleton, consistent with myeloma or metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old male who was admited for hip pain found to have multiple myeloma.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: He was initially given aggressive intravenous fluids (5L) to correct severe hypercalcemia and developed pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure prompting intubation and ICU admission.
He was placed on a furosemide drip but urine output was minimal due to acutre renal failure secondary to light chain nephrotoxicity.
He required CVVH (started [**2153-6-12**]) which successfully removed fluid and allowed for extubation.
Multiple myeloma: He initially presented with calcium of 15 and acute renal failure.
Skeletal survey showed diffuse lytic lesions.
He received a bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-6-19**] that showed plasma cell myeloma with plasma cells comprising 33% of aspirate.
He was seen by ortho/oncology for his large lytic lesion in his left femur, but was deemed not a surgical candidate for hip fixation due to his poor functional status and multiple comorbidities.
He is touch down weight bearing on left lower extremity with full assist with left leg lift due to his high risk of femur fracture.
Acute Renal failure: Baseline creatinine from [**12/2152**] was <1.5.
Presented to ICU with creatinine of 5 to 6, with evidence of fluid overload and worsening hyperkalemia.
Initially as still making urine and able to diuresis with Lasix, however the patient became progressively anuric, with his creatinine peaking at 9.9.
He commenced dialysis and will continue with HD M/W/F as an outpatient.
He did not receive plasmapheresis per recommendations from the transfusion medicine team (data shows lack of benefit from plasmapheresis with elevated light chains due to extensive tissue/fat distribution and short half life of proteins).
NSTEMI:  Presented with ST depressions in lateral leads while extremely tachycardic during flash pulmonary edema.
Repeat ECG showed resolultion of ST changes.
Follow up cardiac enzymes showed up trending troponins with elevated but steady CK-MB.
Echo showed EF 55%, mild symmetric LVF, 2+ mitral regurg, 2+ tricuspid regurg, but no focal wall abnormalities.
The study was done in the setting of gross fluid overload.
CKMB trended down, although troponin T remained elevated likely secondary to renal insufficiency.
He developed non-sustained ventricular tachcardia (one episode of ~50 beats, asymptomatic) on the wards.
Likely related to bone marrow suppression from multiple myeloma and renal failure.
Thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to multiple myeloma causing bone marrow suppression.
He was started on heparin SQ DVT prophylaxis once platelets improved and should continue this upon discharge due to ongoing immobility.

You were found to have multiple myeloma.
You received intravenous fluids due to high calcium and temporarily required intubation because of fluid overload in your lungs.
Your kidneys were injured secondary to multiple myeloma.
You were seen by orthopedics who determined you have a high risk of left femur fracture, but unfortunately surgery is not safe at this point.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP simvastatin - STOP glipizide - STOP lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide - START senna 8.6mg twice daily as needed for constipation - START colace 100mg twice daily as needed for constipation - START miralax 17g daily as needed for constipation - START compazine 10mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea - START acyclovir 400mg daily - START insulin sliding scale as directed - START metoprolol 25mg three times daily - START nephrocaps 1 cap daily - START heparin SQ 5000 units three times daily - START calcium acetate 2668mg three times daily with meals, please crush - START bactrim SS 1 tab daily - START dexamethasone 20mg on [**6-29**] (with velcade) and [**6-30**] only - Velcade 2.1mg IV to be given on [**2153-6-29**] at oncology clinic appointment  It was a pleasure caring for you.
