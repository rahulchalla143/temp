For details of pt's presentation, please see [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note.
In brief, the pt was evaluated on [**3-23**] for fever and was diagnosed with a CAP for which she was tx'd with levaquin with improvement in sxs.
Last Saturday, the pt had sudden onset of fevers, chills, and rigors with fever up 103.4.
A CXR and CTA were significant for a multi-focal PNA without evidence of PE.
The pt does c/o dysphagia with solids that occurs at least once a week.
s/p nonmyeloablative peripheral stem cell transplant in [**7-/2126**] with multiple therapies since that time for recurrent disease.
F/u PET showed resolution of uterus uptake, but new uptake near inferior IVC so she is s/p 4 weeks Rituxan completed [**2132-12-24**].

IMAGING: CXR [**4-18**] - Since the prior study, there has been development of a vague opacity in the right mid lung.
There are no pleural effusions.
Osseous structures again demonstrate mild degenerative changes of the spine.
IMPRESSION:  New hazy opacity in the right mid lung is concerning for pneumonia.
CTA chest [**4-18**] - The right thyroid lobe is largely replaced by multiple nodules, the largest of which measures 18 x 18 mm, unchanged from [**2130-10-17**].
There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery, proximal, or distal branches to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
There is no significant mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
A subcarinal lymph node measures 7 mm in short axis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a tiny left pleural effusion with left lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
Scatterd areas of air space consolidation in the posterior right upper lobe, right middle lobe, left lung base and, most prominently, right lower lobe are consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Ground glass opacity in the right middle and anterior right upper lobes support an underlying infectious etiology.
A small hiatal hernia is again noted.
Multiple low attenuation lesions within the liver parenchyma are unchanged since [**2129**] and likely represent simple cysts.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
Small hiatal hernia.
Bronchial wash [**4-20**] - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Small hiatal hernia, unchanged compared to prior study, with narrowing at the level of gastroesophageal junction with holdup of 13-mm barium tablet.
No aspiration was noted at the time of exam.
EGD [**4-23**] - Small hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring (dilation),Erythema and granularity in the antrum compatible with chronic gastritis.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .

1) Fevers: Due to multifocal PNA seen on imaging on admission.
Given her prior failed treatment courses with levaquin, this was concerning for resistant organisms, atypical or fungal organism, or possible recurrent aspiration.
The following day, a blanching maculopapular rash was noted over the torso and upper thighs, which was concerning for a drug rash.
There was a question of TE fistula on the admission CT scan after further review with the MICU attending, but there no evidence of TE fistula was seen on bronch.
2) Lymphoma: With recurrence of disease.
3) Dysphagia: The pt reported worsening dysphagia over the past year with solids.
GI was consulted who recommended a barium swallow study which showed distal obstruction at the GE junction.
Findings in the antrum suggestive of chronic gastritis were also seen.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Itching.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Multi-focal pneumonia Dysphagia s/p dilation of Schatzski's ring .
Secondary Diagnosis: recurrent NHL HTN Hyperlipidemia GERD   Discharge Condition: Good, ambulating, breathing well on room air, eating well.
You also had an EGD to evaluate difficulty swallowing and had a dilation of your lower esophagus, where a stricture was found.
