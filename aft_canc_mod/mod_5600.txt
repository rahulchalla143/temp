Admission Date:  [**2102-3-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-3-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-7-29**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, ovarian carcinoma and hyponatremia who presents complaining of one month of hemoptysis with blood-streaked sputum, abdominal pain, shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
The patient states that she has some abdominal bloating and mild right lower quadrant pain.
She also notes some blood-streaked sputum with clots for the past month which is small volume.
The patient notes weakness, occasional back pain, occasional headache, no fevers or chills, no dysuria, no rash, no jaundice, no bilateral lower extremity edema.
She had a chest x-ray that was significant for compression of the right lower lobe bronchus and multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules.
She had a KUB which showed no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
She also had an abdominal CT which was significant for a subacute liver hematoma which was 6 x 10 cm in size.
The patient also had a chest CT which showed multiple pulmonary nodules and a small right-sided pleural effusion.
The patient was seen by the surgical consultation service who stated that there was no role for immediate intervention of the liver hematoma at this time.
Bipolar disorder, question of history of schizoaffective disorder on loxapine and Risperdal.
Ovarian carcinoma status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in [**2096**] and status post chemotherapy.
Excision of cul-de-sac and completion hysterectomy with partial vaginectomy.
Bright red blood per rectum with diverticulosis status post low anterior resection.
History of prolonged QT syndrome in the past secondary to Mellaril.
Hyponatremia in the past secondary to increased fluid intake, however the patient has had low sodium in the past without any symptoms.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Uncle with some sort of cancer which is unknown.
General:  Sleepy, confused, disheveled female in no apparent distress.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, poor respiratory effort.
Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nondistended, mild right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant tenderness, obese.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, rate of 100, QTC 414, right bundle branch block, slight left axis deviation.
Hyponatremia:  Patient with a history of psychogenic polydipsia in the past, however given that her urine osmolalities are high, question of syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone secondary to pulmonary metastases, however low urine sodium also points to potential prerenal or intravascular volume etiology.
status for multiple procedures.
The patient was asymptomatic and seemed to maintain a sodium between 125 and 135.
No further aggressive treatment of the hyponatremia was continued.
The etiology of her shortness of breath was likely secondary to a combination of her liver hematoma and abdominal extension and obesity causing elevation of her diaphragm and subjective shortness of breath as well as her diffuse pulmonary nodules.
The patient also had a small right-sided pleural effusion which then increased in size and formed a right hydropneumothorax.
The patient initially had a bronchoscopy by the interventional pulmonary service, however the biopsy results showed scant fragment sof bronchial mucosa and alveolated parenchyma without evidence of malignancy.
However this biopsy seemed to be insufficient for diagnosis.
The patient had good resolution of her shortness of breath secondary to drainage of the fluid.
The patient had her chest tubes pulled on [**2102-3-25**] and chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax or residual fluid.
Preliminary results of the pulmonary biopsy revealed a carcinoma that was likely not pulmonary in etiology and it was likely metastatic from her ovarian cancer.
This was per a preliminary discussion with the pathologist who had reviewed some of her prior biopsy results.
Pneumonia:  On the patient's initial chest x-ray and chest CT the patient had a question of a right lower lobe collapse versus consolidation.
She was initially treated with a five-day course of azithromycin (patient has a history of prolonged QT and we did not want to use levofloxacin).
The patient had multiple sputum Gram stains which were possibly contaminated with oral flora and which did not grow out any specific pathogens.
However, given the development of right hydropneumothorax it is possible that the patient redeveloped consolidation of the right lower lobe and thus she was treated with intravenous Zosyn for a full seven-day course.
Hemoptysis:  The patient had persistent small amounts of blood-streaked sputum at the beginning of her hospital course.
This gradually disappeared for some time and recurred around [**2102-3-27**] with small amounts of recurrent hemoptysis.
This was clearly thought to be secondary to her known diffuse metastatic pulmonary nodules.
Liver hematoma:  The patient's abdominal pain was secondary to her known liver hematoma.
She had a benign abdominal examination with only minimal amounts of right upper and right lower quadrant tenderness.
The patient had a repeat abdominal CT on [**2102-3-15**] which showed that the patient was actively bleeding from her hematoma into her peritoneum.
Of note, the patient did slip and fall which may have contributed to the rupture of the acute liver hematoma.
The patient did quite well from this perspective and had no further acute abdominal pain and had a stable hematocrit.
Bipolar disorder:  The patient was continued on her home dose of loxapine and Risperdal with no complications.
Infectious disease:  The patient initially grew out one out of four bottles of Gram positive cocci and a second set of one out of two bottles of Gram positive cocci, found to be coagulase negative staphylococcus and question of Port-a-Cath infection.
Her Port-a-Cath remained in place with no further complications.
There was concern for potential C. difficile infection even though the patient was not having diarrhea or any loose stools at that time.
She did have one stool for C. difficile which was sent subsequent to the initiation of antibiotics, which was negative for C. difficile.
for several days and on fluid restriction, the patient had an elevated creatinine of 1.6, was found to be prerenal.
If pulmonary biopsy revealed secondary primary metastatic cancer the patient would likely be made comfort care.
Metastatic ovarian carcinoma.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Coagulase-negative staphylococcus bacteremia.
Bipolar disorder.
Acute renal failure with resolution.
