HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 50214**] is a 48 year-old man who is generally healthy who presented as an outpatient with approximately a two month history of epigastric pain.
At this time he was ruled out for an myocardial infarction and upper endoscopy actually revealed a tumor in the cardia of the stomach, which extended into the distal esophagus.
He is able to eat soft foods and liquids without any trouble, but does report a small amount of solid dysphagia.
He does report that he ahs had approximately a 20 pound weight loss unintentionally over the past several months.
He denies fevers, nausea, vomiting or any recent respiratory illnesses.
History of cerebrovascular accident with mild residual left hemiparesis.
History of basal cell carcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
for his cerebrovascular accident.
Maternal grandfather died of esophageal cancer and his maternal uncle died of breast cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well developed man with obvious recent weight loss.
Abdomen is soft without any distention, tenderness, masses or organomegaly.
His extremities are without any clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologically he is basically intact, although there is a slight right facial droop.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After reviewing the endoscopic photos and discussing his options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the patient opted for an elective Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.
In brief, an Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy was performed with resection of the tumor at the junction of the stomach and distal esophagus.
The specimen was sent for pathology.
There is no lymphatic or venous invasion.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the floor on subcutaneous heparin twice a day and an epidural for his pain control.
The patient was noted to have respiratory distress with markedly decreasing oxygen saturation, tachypnea, tachycardia and significant confusion.
Workup for the respiratory distress included a CTA of the chest, which revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe.
The patient was started on a heparin drip and was soon having therapeutic anticoagulation.
On the morning of postoperative day four the patient had again another bout of significant hypoxia with a large AA gradient.
It was determined that he had a recurrent pulmonary emboli despite being on therapeutic heparin.
At this point it was decided that he should have an inferior vena cava filter placement.
On [**3-10**] a swallow study revealed no leak at the patient's esophagogastric anastomosis.
In addition he had his chest tubes removed without complications.
While on the unit he had been placed on antibiotics for several positive sputum cultures.
He was afebrile for the last several days and he was properly anticoagulated for his pneumothorax.
Roxicet one to two teaspoons as needed for pain every four to six hours.
Esophageal carcinoma status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.
History of cerebrovascular accident.
Pulmonary emboli status post inferior vena cava filter placement.
