Admission Date:  [**2132-3-23**]       Discharge Date: [**2132-4-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-5-11**]       Sex:  F  Service: Medicine HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with a past medical history significant for ALS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, recently admitted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation on [**2132-2-23**], responding to nebulizer admission with agonal breathing at home.
The patient was taken by EMS, and placed on 100% oxygen, with the patient subsequently with a respiratory rate of 40, and minimal responsive.
After intubation, the patient was noted to have paradoxical breathing and required significant sedation to synchronize with the rate.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management of her respiratory distress.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen (no PFTs available).
Atrial fibrillation diagnosed in [**2131-8-22**].
Lung nodule, which on [**2131-4-22**], was characterized as a right posterior lung mass, 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm x 2.5 cm, consistent with a hamartomata.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
Lungs: Poor air movement throughout.
Left lower lobe crackles.
Extremities:  No edema.
Chest x-ray showed hyperinflated, hyperaerated lungs, endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina, no infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 160 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, normal [**Last Name (LF) 1754**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depression at 1 mm in V5, no change compared to electrocardiogram from [**2132-2-23**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this was a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema with ALS, history of atrial fibrillation, presenting in respiratory distress status post intubation in the Emergency Department.
Pulmonary:  The patient had poor air movement, wheezing, hyperinflation, and respiratory failure with hypoxia.
The patient had been recently admitted for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation responding to nebulizers, steroids, and Levaquin.
The differential diagnosis on this admission for this patient's respiratory failure was a recurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease aspiration secondary to mucous plug or secondary to aspiration versus pulmonary embolism versus flash pulmonary edema secondary to rapid heart rate.
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism.
An echocardiogram was done to evaluate for congestive heart failure exacerbating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55% and no mitral regurgitation.
There was no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure during the MICU stay.
The trigger of this patient's acute respiratory failure was uncertain.
The patient was treated with steroids (Solu-Medrol switched to Prednisone with taper), Levaquin and Flagyl for a question of aspiration pneumonia, for a total of a 10-day course, Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, and diuresis to maintain the patient euvolemic.
The patient was initially intubated with high-pressure support and noted to have auto-PEEP with a slow long wean to extubation.
The patient required an oxygen requirement of [**2-24**] L nasal cannula during the hospital stay after transfer out of the MICU.
Right lung mass:  The patient had a right lung mass suspicious for cancer.
A Pulmonary consult was obtained with bronchoscopy and biopsy of the paratracheal lymph node.
Cardiac:  The patient had an episode of atrial tachycardia on admission to the Intensive Care Unit which had been well controlled on Diltiazem which was titrated up to 90 mg p.o.
The patient did not require intravenous Diltiazem for interim episodes of atrial tachycardia.
The etiology of this hematocrit drop was unclear.
The patient was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells.
The patient was restarted on Trazodone and Amitriptyline for depression upon transfer back to the floor.
It was uncertain if the patient was having any seizure activity before this episode.
The patient's heart rate was 108, and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
The etiology of this acute unresponsiveness was unclear.
As the patient had a right lung mass suspicious for cancer, an MRI of the head was ordered to rule out brain metastasis with a seizure focus.
Other items of a differential diagnosis included a central paraneoplastic syndrome.
The patient had no further episodes of unresponsiveness during the hospital stay.
Endocrine:  In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was on a regular Insulin sliding scale as she had been on steroids for treating her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
