Levoflox started as outpt 1d PTA at NEBH for low grade fevers and shaking chills.
He was transferred to the ICU on [**4-28**] for increasing shortness of breath and for initiation of hypertonic saline.
Work up (UCx and Bld Cx neg, stool neg for Cdiff, CMV antigen neg, EBV IgG pos but IgM neg, HepB immune, HepC neg) isolated only C albicans in stool and he was empirically broadened to flagyl/cefepime.
Pleural effusion on HD3, got some lasix--BNP was normal, though.
No improvement after lasix 80mg IV and so intubated with size 8 ETT and became hypotensive to 60s.
Past Medical History: CLL dx'd [**12-4**] with massive HSM and WBC 500,000. treated with chemo, last in [**3-5**] was fludarabine, prednisone, cytoxan.

ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS.
Gallstones with gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid raise the possibility of acute cholecystitis.
These findings may also be seen with underlying liver disease.
Marked enlargement of the right kidney, with no left kidney visualized.
Possible congenitally absent left kidney, although correlation with any previous (outside) studies would be useful.
The patient was intubated for hypoxia, and required CVVH to manage his acute renal failure.
He developed DIC and received multiple units of FFP and platelets.
Based on an abdominal ultrasound, it was thought that the source of his sepsis was cholecystitis.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of his gall bladder.
Despite all of the above medical management, he became progressively more acidemic and developed ventricular arrythmias.
