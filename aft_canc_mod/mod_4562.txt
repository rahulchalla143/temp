Unfortunately over the course of the night, despite max dose of neo on floor she was persistently hypotensive to 70s and the risk of arrhythmia with starting dopamine was thought too high so transferred to ICU for levophed instead.
Past Medical History: Metastatic melanoma with multiple widespread metastases, mainly in the adipose tissue of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bony lesion in the right occipital condyle as well as a 4-mm enhancing right cingulate gyrus lesion.
A possible mass of the intracranial segment of the left mandibular nerve was also seen.
Anxiety Acid reflux Osteopenia Cataract surgery [**9-3**]  Social History: She is married, but has no children.
Family History: Her mother had multiple myeloma and died at the age of 69.
Her paternal grandmother died from either gastric or pancreatic cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98 BP:92/37 (with doppler 110/60) P:108 R:18 18 O2: 98 on 100% FM pulsus 4 General: Alert, oriented to person only, agitated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, 6cm diameter purple raised papule on left shoulder, non tender Lungs: wheezes bilaterally, with no rales, rhonchi but unable to have thorough exam [**1-27**] patient moving CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, slight tender to palpation in epigastrium, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ edema bilaterally .
EKG: [**2133-3-9**]: sinus tachycardia with normal axis and intervals without ST/TW changes [**2133-3-15**] 5:11am: Wide complex tachycardia at ~130bpm with P wave after QRS, right axis deviation and RBB pattern, p wave after QRS  consistent with vtach vs SVT with aberrancy (likely AVNRT given short RP interval) [**2133-3-15**] 10:17am: NSR with low voltage, 2mm ST depressions V3-V6, 1mm STE V1 and V2.
Brief Hospital Course: 65yo F with h/o metastatic melanoma recently finished IL2 therapy with neurotoxicity, dermatitis, capillary leak, hypotension, and myocarditis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and found to have hypoxia as well.
Patient had not been febrile to suggest sepsis and hypoxia was thought to be due to capillary leak.
Other etiology might include heart failure given hypoxia and myocarditis with arrhythmia and echo on day of admission was consistent with this, showing global hypokinesis of the LV.
The patient was also noted to be increasingly hypoxic, likely [**1-27**] capillary leak and CHF, requiring intubation soon after admission.
She required increasing amounts of pressor support, and eventually was on maximum doses of three pressors with persistent hypotension noted on the evening of admission.
