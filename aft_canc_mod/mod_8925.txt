HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year-old female with history of non-small cell carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy whose course has been complicated by bronchopleural fistula and empyema.
She also had stenosis of the left main stem bronchus requiring stenting.
She has had multiple episodes of bronchitis / pneumonia with MRSA and most recently pseudomonas.
Over the past few days the patient noticed productive cough and worsening shortness of breath.
Over night she experienced persistent shortness of breath and increased secretions.
She was taken urgently for repeat bronchoscopy which showed the stent to remain patent with persistent moderate secretions.
The stent was removed and the 2 mm right bronchopleural fistula was covered with fibrin glue.
Following the procedure she continued with secretions and shortness of breath and was ultimately intubated and transferred to the MICU on [**2197-11-22**].
Stage III non-small cell carcinoma.
Status post chemotherapy, status post radiation therapy, status post right pneumonectomy five to six years ago.
Left main stem stent for bronchopleural fistula and stenosis in [**2197-5-5**].
COPD / emphysema.
Anxiety / depression.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is afebrile with a temperature of 98.9 F, heart rate 108, blood pressure 92/61.
Her chest is with loud upper airway noises but clear at the left base.
Her abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Her extremities are without cyanosis or edema.
Bronchial washings on [**11-21**] showed 3+ polymorphum nuclear lymphocytes and 4+ gram positive coccyx later identified to be methicillin resistant staph aereus.
Ceftazidine and Vancomycin were started to treat a questionable pneumonia / bronchitis.
Given the increased secretions and foreign body despite remaining afebrile with a stable white blood cell count.
Bronchoscopy was performed on two separate occasions to ascertain the extent of secretions, presence of mucus plugging or other explanation for respiratory difficulty.
Biopsies of the trachea revealed recurrent non-small cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated.
Within two hours she was in clear respiratory distress and was re-intubated.
On [**2197-12-4**] the patient self extubated during an apparent confused episode and became immediately stridorous, anxious and dropped her oxygen saturation to the 80, 70 and 60s despite Ativan, nebulizers and Racemic epinephrine.
On further discussion with the family it was apparent that her respiratory distress was not likely an acute problem, but rather more likely representing a progressive worsening of her baseline shortness of breath.
On the days following procedure she remained anxious requesting Ativan regularly to keep herself comfortable.
Ultimately on [**12-10**] with her breathing still uncomfortable and worsening secondary to increase need for sedating medications she was moved to comfort measures only status.
EGU was performed which showed esophagitis and linear ulcerations in the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma.
There were no further episodes of bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable.
