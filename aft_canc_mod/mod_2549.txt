Mild cardiomegaly and the mediastinal contours are unchanged.
Multiple small bilateral nodular densities are noted which appear to be new compared to [**2133-3-10**].
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Multiple small nodular densities of both lungs.
In a patient with an esophageal mass, these may represent metastatic foci.
Alternatively, if the patient has infectious symptoms, these could represent septic emboli or pseudomonal infection.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 91 W with multiple medical problems including CAD with 3VD, CHF with EF 15% and [**4-11**]+ MR, 1+ AR, HTN, anemia, dementia, who presents with GI bleeding.
Patient was admitted to ICU for EGD this AM, because of her active bleeding and multiple co-morbidities and medications which increase her risk of severe bleeding.
- 1 unit PRBC per GI request - EGD revealed 8cm, diffusely bleeding mass of esophagus concerning for squamous cell carcinoma.
Pathology confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.
This seems to be only source of GI bleed and is unfortunately not resectable or cauterizable.
No c/o chest pain so will not cycle enzymes.
