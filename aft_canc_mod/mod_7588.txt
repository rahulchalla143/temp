The crash occured at low speeds with no trauma noted to driver.
CT at OSH suggested a question of a brain aneurysm or mass.
She was hypotensive at the OSH and was started on phenylephrine; the thought was she had dropped her pressures because of sedation.
Upon arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], she had repeated imaging of her head which revealed no aneurysm or bleed, however there was noted left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma which is potentially chronic.
Given a question of an elevated TSH at the OSH, she received 500 mcg of T4 in the ED; she was then admitted to the MICU for unresponsiveness.
Of note, upon review of her history briefly with family in ED, they noted that she had increasing difficulty with walking, talking, and motor activities sub-acutely over the past two weeks.

These findings are indicative of severe diffuse encephalopathy which could be due to a variety of causes including severe hypoxic/ischemic injury and effects of sedative medications.
Close clinical monitoring and bedside EEG monitoring is recommended to evaluate for change or improvement.
No acute intracranial process or hemorrhage.
17 mm left planum sphenoidale meningioma.
Dense calcification identified below the level of the III ventricle and anterior to the cistern of the lamina terminalis the possibility of a partially thrombosed aneurysm in the ACA territory is a consideration, correlation with MRI and MRA of the with and without contrast is recommended.
[**2184-12-28**] CT C-SPINE No fracture or malalignment.
There is bibasilar atelectasis plus or minus consolidation.
There is a fracture of the T12 vertebral body superiorly with an approximately 10-15% loss of height.
Bilateral regions of cytotoxic edema, concerning for watershed infarctions.
There is no herniation or diffuse cerebral edema.
Dense calcification below the third ventricle raises the possibility of a partially thrombosed aneurysm unchanged from [**2184-12-28**].
Bilateral acute and subacute infarctions in a watershed and embolic pattern of distribution.
Calcified suprasellar lesion, which could represent a craniopharyngioma or a thrombosed aneurysm.
No definite connection to the circle of [**Location (un) **] is seen on the MRA.
Meningioma in the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].
Probable cavernoma in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule.
She did not have any severe injuries, but was noted to be in a coma despite weaning off sedation completely.
Neurology was consulted and felt that her exam was consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
MRI suggested watershed infarcts which support the theory of hypotensive damage, though no hypotension was documented prior to her transfer.
It was decided that in the case of severe hypoxic damage, she would not want to be kept alive artificially.
