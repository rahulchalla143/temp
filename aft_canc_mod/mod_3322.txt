Admission Date:  [**2153-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-8-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-3-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: SVC Syndrome  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**7-18**] tracheal bronchial stent placement [**7-19**] Svc stent placement: 6mm and 8mm Stent placed   History of Present Illness: 57 year old male from [**State 1727**] with CAD s/p MI x2 ([**2135**], [**2143**]), ?COPD (on 2L home O2, 3ppd smoking for years), atrial flutter on coumadin, found to have new lung mass with recent onset of SVC syndrome, s/p bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**], now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway protection prior to initiation of XRT.
W/u revealed a new mediastinal mass and he was transferred to Togus VA for further workup.
A f/u CT on [**2153-6-3**] revealed spread of the mass to the right lung.
He also developed pneumonia during this time and went into new-onset atrial flutter during another bronchoscopy which had to be aborted because of this event.
He underwent repeat bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 205**] but obtained tissue only revealed necrosis per the patient.
He became symptomatic after relative bradycardia to the 60s (nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and diarrhea).
His symptoms abated after CBB reversal and dopamine drip.
His course was c/b wheezing and SOB as well as increasing SVC syndrome with swelling of his face, both arms and ears.
The CT-guided biopsy showed sarcoma versus melanoma.
On ROS, the patient denies any fevers but nightsweats since [**2115**], weightloss (10 lbs in one month) with decreased appetite, and cough with clear sputum and occasional brownish clots coming up.
He denies frank hemoptysis, N/V or SOB in rest.
However, he did become more SOB over the last few months, most recently he can only walk to the bathroom w/o dyspnea.
He denies any CP, constipation, urinary symptoms or blood in the stool (although he does have bleeding hemorrhoids with occasional blood on top of the stool).

Persistent R paratracheal, suprahilar mass with post-obstructive PNA.
Wide-spread metastatic disease, mediastinal and hilar LAD.
Encroachment of lung mass on pericardium.
[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-16**] 7:23 PM: Opacification of the right upper lung likely represents lung collapse due to proximal obstruction.
It is associated with moderate sized right pleural effusion and compression of the lower trachea.
Multiple masses in the left lung field measure up to 3.7 cm.
Cardiac size is normal with prominence of the left atrial appendage.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-21**] 7:20 PM: There has been no appreciable radiographic change.
Right upper lobe is collapsed around a mass and multiple nodules are seen in the remaining portion of the right lung and left.
There is probably a small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-27**] 10:33 AM No change, given slight differences in technique, to the opacified right hemithorax reflective of effusion and right upper lobe collapse.
Using ultrasonographic guidance and a micropuncture sheath system, access was gained into the right basilic vein and a 0.018 guidewire and 5 Fr sheath was placed.
The Kumpe and Glidewire were then used to selectively catheterize the left brachiocephalic vein, and a left brachiocephalic venogram performed.
This showed mixed retrograde and antegrade flow, with mild narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein at its confluence with the right.The Kumpe catheter and a Bentson guidewire were then negotiated through the severely narrowed SVC into the right atrium.
Pull-back SVC-grams were performed delineating the anatomy and extent of the severe extrinsic SVC narrowing/encasement.
A 10 mm x 4 cm PTA balloon was then advanced over the wire in order to partially dilate the SVC prior to stent placement.
A 14 mm x 6 cm SMART stent was placed into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance, with its lower end at the SVC/RA junction and its upper end just below the left and right brachiocephalic confluence.
A followup venogram demonstrated narrowing with persistent retrograde flow in the right brachiocephalic, above the stent.
IMPRESSION: Severe extrinsic narrowing/encasement of the SVC, with moderate extrinsic narrowing of the right, and mild of the left, brachiocephalic veins.
Successful placement of two 14 mm SMART stents in the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein, with good angiographic results on the final venogram.
Midline venous access with placement of right basilic triple lumen catheter with tip in the right axillary vein.
FNA, Lung, Right Middle Lobe:   (Consult slides, [**Location 1268**] [**Hospital1 65180**] #: C07-4900):    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Note: The differential diagnosis includes metastatic sarcoma and   primary sarcomatoid carcinoma.
Review of immunohistochemical studies   performed at [**Location 1268**] [**Hospital1 65180**] shows positive staining of the tumor   cells with vimentin and CD68 and negative staining with desmin, actin,   smooth muscle actin, S-100, HMB-45, pankeratin and CD34.
Further immunohistochemical studies were performed at [**Hospital 61**]   ([**Hospital1 18**]) showing negative staining of the tumor cells with p63 and MNF116   and few scattered cells showing positive staining with CK903, favored to   be normal epithelial cells within the tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 57 yo old male from [**State 1727**] with CAD s/p MI x2 ([**2135**], [**2143**]), ?COPD (on 2L home O2, 3ppd smoking for years), atrial flutter on coumadin, found to have new lung mass with recent onset of SVC syndrome, s/p bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway protection prior to initiation of XRT, now s/p bronch and y-stent placement by IP and SVC stent by IR.
Due to poor prognosis and lack of clinical improvement he was made comfort measures only, underwent 9 cycles of palliative XRT.
# Increased dyspnea/wheezing: Patient was not aware of a diagnosis of COPD but had been on nebulizer treatments for several years, also on home oxygen.
Increased wheezing was thought secondary to COPD as well as large lung mass.
Pt presented with dypsnea and increased WOB that initially responded to diuresis with lasix, and then to albuterol nebs with heliox.
Dyspnea was thought related to combination of COPD, lung mass and small element of CHF.
EKG had questionable TWI in v4-6 but CE's were negative, making MI unlikely.
Pulmonary edema resolved with initial diuresis.
Little improvement was made with XRT and above treatments and he demonstrated increased lethargy with CO2 retention.
The patient completed 9 cycles of XRT for palliation and was treated with morphine to make breathing comfortable as well as nebulizer treatments, mucomyst, scopalamine for secretions, supplemental oxygen, prednisone and ativan prn.
# Rhythm: The patient had treatment-refractory atrial flutter since his second bronchoscopy in the VA at [**State 1727**].
Instead, suffered from relative bradycardia and did not respond to dilt drip.
Was initially switched to lovenox [**7-23**] for anticoagulation (had been difficult to get therapeutic on heparin) but anticoagulation was discontinued when he was made CMO.
However, also 150 year pack history of smoking, thus high risk for lung cancer.
Given widely spread tumor, it was determined that he likely had a poor prognosis.
The tumor obstructed the RUL so Y-stent was placed by IP, and SVC stent placed by IR.
Per onc, he is not a candidate for chemo given his tenuous respiratory status.
Was treated as above for respiratory comfort and palliation.
# SVC syndrome: On presentation was severe with significant swelling of face, neck, and ears with bluish discoloration and dyspnea on exertion, now s/p IVC stent by IR on [**7-19**] with improvement in facial swelling and discoloration.
The patient was treated with decadron followed by prednisone and kept the head of his bed elevated to reduce swelling and prevent aspiration.
# Hyperglycemia: No known history of DM but had elevated finger stick glucose levels here, likely secondary to steroids.
No acute issues.
ROMI'd as cause of pulmonary edema.
# Anemia: Hct baseline seems to be around 28 -32 given recent values from VA. HCT was stable at 25-26.
# WBC elevation: The patient presented with leukocytosis.
He was afebrile and this was thought secondary to IV steroids.
Had been started on azithroycin at the VA, but antibiotics were discontinued here as no convincing signs of pneumonia were found.
# PTSD: Patient's anxiety was managed with prn Ativan, used cautiously due to tenuous respiratory status.
