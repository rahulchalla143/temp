female with history of metastatic infiltrating ductal CA of the breast (metastases to lungs, liver and bones) admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for confusion and lethargy.
Per brother, she has not had any falls, no balance problems, no vision issues, no incontinence.
Her brother brought her to the [**Name (NI) **] where they did a head CT. Report showed metastatic lesions throughout brain.
Past Medical History: Breast Cancer history: [**Known firstname 80211**] was initially diagnosed while living in [**Country **] in [**2193**]  with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, stage II B T2 N1 M0 with a partial mastectomy.
In [**2196-4-3**] she was diagnosed with Metastatic disease.
Her torso CT revealed multiple liver and lung mets and  osseous lesion at L5.
[**4-11**]-CT and Bone scan - extensive metastatic disease now on Doxilx4.
Anemia Thoracic spondylosis Gastritis Status post uterine ptosis Osteopenia PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Partial mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and hysterectomy.

Difficult to assess complete neuro exam because she is confused and agitated and tearful.
Head CT [**2197-8-2**]: Multiple hyperdense lesions seen throughout the brain.
A large lesion in the  left thalamus has surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the third  ventricle without hydrocephalus.
Basal cisterns are patent, no evidence of herniation or midline shift.
Left frontal lucent lesion are concerning for metastatic disease.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 80212**] Reason: Please comment on the location of lesions in the brain Contrast: MAGNEVIST    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    49 year old woman with metastatic breast cancer to liver, lungs, brain who was    admitted with confusion and altered mental status experienced at an outpatient    scheduled CT scan.
Provisional Findings Impression: CXWc TUE [**2197-8-8**] 3:46 PM Large number of enhancing lesions throughout the brain as on the prior CT, with relatively little edema or mass effect.
Th largest is a 2 cm left thalamic lesion with mild mass effect on 3rd ventricle.
PFI AUDIT # 1   Final Report INDICATION: 49-year-old woman with confusion and altered mental status, history of metastatic breast cancer.
Many of these lesions, however, demonstrate only minimal to no surrounding edema.
The largest lesion is located in the left thalamus, measuring 1.8 x 2.1 cm, which exerts mild mass effect on the third ventricle.
Some lesions are situated along the subependymal surface along the lateral ventricles.
A few smaller lesions are present within the subcortical white matter.
Innumerable additional lesions are present within the cerebellar hemispheres.
Abnormal signal within the left frontal calvarium indicates a site of bony metastasis, as indicated on the [**2197-8-2**] head CT.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or large mass effect.
There is no infarction.
The globes are intact, without abnormal enhancement.
IMPRESSIONS: Innumerable enhancing lesions throughout the brain, as on the prior CT, with relatively little edema or mass effect.
Largest lesion is a 2-cm left thalamic lesion with mild mass effect on the third ventricle.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of bursts and runs of generalized slowing as well as a slow and disorganized background.
Encephalopathies represent non-specific diffuse cerebral dysfunction that may be caused by medications, metabolic disturbances, hypoxic ischemic injury, and other etiologies.

Wet Read: KKgc WED [**2197-8-2**] 4:36 PM Multiple hyperdense lesions seen throughout the brain.
A large lesion in the left thalamus has surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the third ventricle without hydrocephalus.
Basal cisterns are patent, no evidence of herniation or midline shift.
Left frontal lucent lesion are concerning for metastatic disease.
Final Report INDICATION: 49-year-old woman with confusion and altered mental status, has a history of metastatic breast cancer.
However, the patient has had contrast enhanced CT of the torso an hour ago, limiting evaluation for subarachnoid bleed.
Innumerable hyperdense lesions are seen diffusely distributed throughout the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum.
The largest of these lesions is present within the left thalamus (2:15), measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm, causing mass effect on the third ventricle.
Some vasogenic edema is seen surrounding this lesion.
No shift of midline structures or herniation is detected.
There is no hydrocephalus.
The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration, except for mild compression of the third ventricle.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUE: There is a lucent lesion in the left frontal vertex (2:25), which, given additinal findings is suspicious for metastatic disease.
Innumerable hyperdense lesions distributed throughout the brain with mild mass effect and edema surrounding the largest lesion in the left thalamus.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart and pericardium are without pericardial effusion.
A few scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are not significantly changed, and not enlarged by size criteria, measuring up to 6 mm in the paratracheal station.
A nodule within the left upper lobe measures 11 mm x 9 mm, previously measured 10 mm x 8 mm.
A nodule within the left lower lobe (2:33) measures 16 mm x 14 mm, previously measured 15 mm x 14 mm.
No new lesion is identified.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is a different enhancement pattern of the lesions compared to prior study, making direct comparison difficult.
For example, a lesion within the right lobe of the liver (2:51) measures 18-mm, previously measured approximately 10 mm.
There is also increasing capsular retraction of the liver.
The portal venous system is patent without evidence of thrombus.
There is no free air or free fluid.
A few scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria, with the aortocaval nodes measuring up to 5 mm in short axis.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Redemonstrated are innumerable sclerotic metastatic lesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine, sternum, femurs, and pelvis, which are not significantly changed from prior study.
There is no evidence for pathologic fracture.
Innumerable hepatic metastases, which are increased in number and slightly increased in size compared to prior study.
Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, which are also minimally larger in size, without evidence of new lesions.

Currently on cycle #4 Doxil Day #30 and recieving whole brain treatment.
# Altered Mental Status- most likely caused by the mutliple new brain massess from her breast cancer metastases.
Patient has been very depressed with confusion at times.Head CT scan showed-  1.
Innumerable hyperdense lesions distributed throughout the brain with mild mass effect and edema surrounding the largest lesion in the left thalamus.
Started whole brain radiation in house, recieved 5 treatments the last being [**8-11**].Did not place patient on anti seizure medications because she had no history of seizures  and there is no evidence in patients with brain mets prophylactic anti seizure meds are benficial.Continued Dexamethasone 4 mg Q6H IV to decrease intracranial pressure.
Husband was made the proxy via interpreter [**8-4**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] had seen the patient and recommended EEG which revealed no seizure activity(indicated moderate encephalopathy).
We got a head MRI to better stage her disease which showed :Innumerable enhancing lesions throughout the brain, as on the prior CT, with relatively little edema or mass effect.
Largest lesion is a 2-cm left thalamic lesion with mild mass effect on the third ventricle.
# Right arm and right leg weakness- most likely caused by her brain metastases, especially given large lesion in the left thalamus.
- the weakness is [**5-8**] power in the right upper and lower extremities compared to the left which is [**6-7**] power.

You were brought to the hospital with altered mental status and depression.
We found masses in your brain from your metastatic breast cancer.
We also conducted a EEG to assess the electircal activity of the brain, which showed no seizure activity, but signs of brain swelling.
