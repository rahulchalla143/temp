ACTIVE ISSUES: #Hyponatremia- the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for management of his hyponatremia to 119 which was symptomatic with some confusion, but no obtundation or seizures.
He was originally fluid resuscitated given his low blood pressures and appearance of intravascular depletion, and when his Na did not respond to this he was switched to diureses after it was found that he was 10 lbs over his baseline weight.
Given the suspicion of poor absorption from gut edema, the patient was switched to a PO dose of torsemide (40mg) equivalent to his former PO lasix dose (80mg).
#Ascites- The patient had new onset ascites on exam.
He denied abdominal pain.
Neither his clinical picture nor his paracentesis results were consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Given that the patient had no evidence of acute cardiac decompensation due to intrinsic disease, medication noncompliance, or dietary indiscretion, it was thought that this was largely due to the patient's intra-abdominal neoplasm.
#Pancreatic mass- this was noted on imaging from outside hospital and he was found to have a pancreatic tail mass.
Multiple hepatic nodules were found as well.
Cytology showed malignant cells consistent with a poorly differeniated carcinoma.
A core biopsy taken from the same nodule was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
#Leukocytosis- patient had elevated white blood cell count and was found to meet SIRS crieria so he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were stopped after transfer to the ICU, stabilization of vitals, and an unproductive search for source of infection.
#CHF- he has a history of paroxysmal afib with a known LBBB and EF of 20%.
He was not orthopneic or having PND on exam.
As you recall, you were transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] for a dangerously low sodium level.
We found that you had a great deal of excess fluid in your body, which likely was contributing to your low sodium level.
We also discovered masses in your liver and your lungs, in addition to the one known to be in your pancreas.
The following changes to your medication have been made: STOP furosemide (Lasix) START torsemide 40mg daily  You should also have your blood drawn on Monday [**2112-8-1**] at your doctor's office or at a commercial phlebotomist and have the results faxed to your PCP's office.
