Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in [**2166**] after bone marrow biopsy was performed secondary to iron deficiency anemia workup.
Her course was complicated by severe bilateral avascular necroses of the hips due to steroid use.
She also had multiple dental issues requiring extractions.
[**Known firstname **] remained in remission for several months but ultimately showed signs of disease recurrence in her marrow.
She did well until the summer of [**2168**] when she developed evidence of relapse.
This course was complicated by neutropenic fever, development of a coagulative negative staph bacteremia, left upper extremity DVT, aseptic necrosis of the bilateral hips, and septic emboli of the liver.
Her posttransplant course was complicated by the development of a sore throat and question of low level EBV infection.
There was some concern at that time by involvement with a lymphoproliferative disease.
She had no definite evidence for GVHD.
Since her relapse in [**8-/2171**], [**Known firstname **] received treatment with hyper-CVAD in [**9-/2171**] and a donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2171-11-5**].
She had persistent pain in the perirectal area with incontinence and was found to have CNS involvement of the cauda equina and received radiation therapy to her lower spine in 02/[**2171**].
Her day 14 bone marrow showed no residual leukemia and she received another DLI on [**2172-2-18**].
Because of her debilitated state, [**Known firstname **] was not given any further treatment and she was sent home with increased support and to follow up with her local oncologist with a concern that her disease would relapse or progress further.
However, since her discharge from the hospital in [**3-/2172**], [**Known firstname **] improved with normalization of her counts and no further evidence for disease recurrence.
She has required no further treatment, but has had many chronic complications.
She developed increasing problems with [**Name2 (NI) 7809**] with constipation and intermittent diarrhea, as well as increasing pain in the rectal area, as well as increasing pelvic and hip pain.
There have been no changes with MRI of the lower spine.
The feeling was that she developed issues with anal stricture after her cauda equina syndrome and radiation therapy along with a neurogenic rectum that did not empty fully.
She also has had issues of chronic hip pain due to osteonecrosis of the hip and she is status post left hip replacement.
In [**Month (only) 958**]/[**2175-2-28**], [**Known firstname **] was noted for increasing shortness of breath.
She underwent an echocardiogram, which was noted for a drop in her ejection fraction to 35-40%.
She underwent an adenosine stress test, which did not show any evidence for coronary artery disease.
It was felt that this may have been related to a viral illness.
[**Known firstname **] has been followed with continued normal counts until more recently when labs from an outside hospital have shown increased lymphocytes with atypical lymphocytes and decreasing neutrophils with ANC of 700.
There were no immature cells noted and white count, hematocrit and platelet count were normal.
Given the persistent change in her counts, [**Known firstname **] was seen today for further evaluation and was noted for 10% circulating blasts.
She underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and is being admitted for further evaluation and probable treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ALL, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, h/o paroxysmal supraventricular tachucardia and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, h/o of laryngeal spasm, irritable bowel syndrome w colostomy placed for chronic constipation,avascular necrosis of the hips in the left shoulder and s/p left hip replacement, left upper extremity clot, Sjogren's, Shingles (Spring [**2174**]), systolic CHF (EF in the 30s per patient)  Social History: Mrs. [**Known lastname 11513**] lives alone in her own home.
She has a personal home care assistant that helps with her cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene.
Family History: [**Name (NI) 1094**] mother died [**2172-3-7**] of lung cancer with brain mets at 80y/o.
Also had gallstones and hypothyroidism.
The patient's father had prostate cancer, hypertension, and diabetes.
At least one of her paternal aunts had breast cancer, and another had multiple myeloma.
Physical Exam: Vital Signs: T: 98.4 BP: 124/78 HR: 86 RR: 16 O2 sat: 95% RA Weight: 137.9 lbs Height: 60.5 in General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, chronically ill appearing HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, 1cm nontender, mobile L maxillary LN Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact.
Unsteady gait.
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with relapsed acute leukemia.
No masses, edema or infarct.
Nonspecific heterogeneous marrow which may represent hyperplasia or infiltration.
CSF [**2-29**]: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute leukemia.
CSF [**3-12**]: Cell marker analysis was performed, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells/insufficient amount of tissue for analysis and due to poor viability; however, morphologic assessment of the cytospin showed numerous blasts consistent with patient's known leukemia.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mitral regurgitation may have slightly increased.
No discrete enhancing epidural or other paraspinal soft tissue mass.
Diffusely abnormal bone marrow signal, consistent with extensive replacement by known recurrent ALL.
No spinal canal stenosis.
CSF GRAM STAIN (Final [**2176-3-8**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ALL: The patient was found to have recurrent bone marrow as well as CNS disease after presenting with dizziness.
The patient was unable to tolerate AraC due to severe nausea and vomiting.
Her CSF remained positive for blasts until tap on [**2176-4-1**].
She received part A as well as dexamethasone on D11-14 but vincristine was not given on D11 due to poor ostomy output and concern for further ileus.
Peripheral blood smears showed resolution of peripheral blasts after 1-2 days of systemic chemotherapy.
Her course was complicated by mucositis, poorly healing aphthous ulcers and poor po intake secondary to pain, which complicated healing and cause electrolyte abnormalities requiring significant repletion.
She was also started on TPN for nutrition and her electrolytes abnormalities resolved.
The patient became quite hypervolemic during hyperCVAD part A and required aggressive diuresis.
An attempt was made to start the patient on a low dose beta-blocker as well but she developed an episode of fluid-responsive hypotension most likely due to the addition of multiple anti-hypertensive medications so beta-blockade could not be initiated.
She was intermittently able to tolerate low dose lisinopril and lasix 20mg PO with maintenance of euvolemia, they were occasionally held in setting of low blood pressures.
She was intermittently hypotensive in the setting of poor po intake as above.
The patient was encouraged to continue to take her medications in order to prevent symptomatic hypothyroidism.
MICU course #1 ([**Date range (1) 31152**]):  Overnight [**4-13**], Ms. [**Known lastname 11513**] became increasingly tachypneic and tachycardic and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Her Omaya port was tapped and she was found to have infection in her CSF which later speciated as VRE.
Code blue event:  On [**4-14**], Ms. [**Known lastname 11513**] developed a supraventricular tachycardia at ~170-180 bpm, with tenuous blood pressures.
ECG was performed, and no obvious p-waves were noted.
She was noted to have a history of SVT/atrial tachycardia in the past.
There was difficulty obtaining [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] on the non-invasive blood pressure [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] phenylephrine was initiated to bring up the blood pressure.
The theory behind her cardiac arrest is calcium channel blocker poisoning from diltiazem given in the setting of hypocalcemia and alkalemia; thus she regained her pulse after admininstering calcium chloride.
She had no further episodes of bradycardia.
Would need 8 weeks of abx if vegetation present vs 4 week if only CNS infection s/p source removal.
Lactate also elevated, likely secondary to poor perfusion.
Differential includes sepsis, and her new leukocytosis would go along with this (although she is not neutropenic, on very broad abx coverage, and blood cx repeatedly negative).
[**Last Name (un) **] stim did not show evidence of adrenal insufficiency and infectious work-up was negative.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Mental status changes likely multifactorial including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS lymphoma.
Per BMT, will need further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
There is some concern for the risk of seizure with alkalemia, but we are not able to give opiates to depress her respiratory drive because of hypotension.
Respiratory alkalosis improved.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS:   Most likely secondary to counts recovering after chemo (many immature forms), however very sharp bump today is also concerning for an infectious etiology.
She has been afebrile since her evacuation procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.
# RASH:  Concerning for a drug allergy.
Although it has been on for a month, it is possible to develop a new rash after this time.
# ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.
INR climbing, which may be secondary to synthetic dysfunction after hepatic injury.
# S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  likely was secondary to CCB in the setting of a heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.
Recent echo showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2 weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
# Isolated elevation in PTT: Repeating, this is likely a spurious value, but if it remains high, would pursue mixing studies to eval for acquired coagulopathy.
[**1-1**] flash pulmonary edema from cardiogenic shock given elevated troponins.
On [**4-25**], her BMT intern found her to be in respiratory distress, tachypneic and hypoxic.
She required dobutamine and norepinephrine support for possible cardiogenic shock.
Urine osms suggested SIADH, thought to be secondary to her  recent known intracranial empyema vs pulmonary processes.
She also likely has a component of heart failure and lasix-associated exacerbation which are also contributing.
# VRE infection w CNS involvement, s/p Omaya removal: ID continued to follow her, linezolid was continued.
There were no further positive cultures.
Transferred temporarily to MICU on [**5-4**] after episode of vtach likely in the setting of baseline heart disease and low K, Mg. Vtach resulted in decreased peripheral perfusion w elevated lactate and demand ischemia.
Temporarily on amiodarone drip, but became bradycardic, so stopped.
Treated temporarily w abx for possible septic infxn, but discontinued as no evidence of active infection.
FLOOR: Since arriving back on the floor, pt has required 500 cc bolus of IVFs for hypotension and then this afternoon found to be more tachypneic.
Initial ABG 7.26/12/86/6 and written for ativan prn for anxiety.
Respiratory code called, pt intubated by anesthesia and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt transferred for acute respiratory failure (s/p intubation on [**5-6**]), thought to be [**1-1**] shock - cardiogenic vs septic vs combination.
Cardiogenic shock [**1-1**] acute on chronic CHF from chemo (repeat TTE showed LVEF 25%).
Sepsis [**1-1**] prior VRE infection (L femoral TLC still in on transfer, as pt has difficult access) vs Klebsiella PNA (based on sputum cx).
L femoral TLC d/c'd on [**5-7**], new L femoral aline and R femoral venous TLC placed.
Elevated lactate to 14 on transfer [**1-1**] hypoperfusion from shock, though ddx included linezolid side effect vs nutritional (thiamine deficiency), so linezolid switched to daptomycin and thiamine administered.
Stat labs notable for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Patient given stress dose steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics, started and quickly maxed out on 3 pressors,  bedside TTE revealed no significant pericardial effusion, and pt given several amps of HCO3.
Given profound hypoxemia, SBPs in 60s in spite of being maxed out on 3 pressors, pt's son was called who agreed with withdrawing care.
