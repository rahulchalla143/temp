The pain is located in the L shoulder scapular to humoral region, with no obvious radation, and was [**2156-9-14**] in severity.
He also describes other chronic pains, including leg and some chest pain with heavy coughing, but these have been stable.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] on [**1-16**], where he was also noted to have some L sided weakness, and was sent for an MRI to evaluate for metastatic disease, which as noted below showed no new changes.
He was attempting to increase his decadron as indicated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**], when he couldn't handle the pain this AM, and came to the ED.
Otherwise, he denies focal weakness, numbness, incontinence of stool or urine, urinary retention, HA, as well as any F/C/NS, LH, appetite changes, SOB, N/V, or abdominal pain.
He has a chronic cough [**3-9**] radiation, and also noted poor fluid intake over the past few days, although no apparent reason.
In the ED, given dilaudid 4mg IV x 2, with pain that was not completely revolved, but "tolerable."
Past Medical History: Thyroid ca s/p thyroidectomy [**2147**], with mets to bone and liver -s/p implanted epidural narcotics on prior admission; hx of infected Port-A-Cath system S/p carboplatin [**1-9**] S/p cyperknife to T1 [**7-10**] Clear cell ca of L kidney s/p L nephrectomy [**6-6**] S/p appy   Social History: History of smoking cigarettes, 1 pack-per-day, for 10 years--stopped in [**2126**].
Family History: His mother died of tuberculosis at age 36 in [**2085**].
His brother died of smoking-related lung cancer.
Strength UE [**6-9**] R, 4/5 L throughout--no pattern and pt denies pain limiting, [**6-9**] BL LE.
There is metastatic disease at C7-T1 and T2 with collapse of T1 and resultant kyphosis.
There have been posterior laminectomies and there is no spinal cord compression, although there is probably some myelomalacia and atrophy at the level of the surgery, unchanged.

metastatic involvement.
CXR [**1-22**]: Patchy opacities most prominent in the right lower lobe, worrisome for pneumonia.
CT spine [**1-23**]: Progression of the lytic osseous and epidural metastases, with progressed malalignment.
CTA [**1-23**]: 1) Right lower and right middle lobe air space consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
2) Left lower lobe atelectasis and patchy multifocal bilateral generalized foci of air space disease most likely reflecting consolidations though metastases are not excluded.
3) Progression of osseous vertebral and hepatic metastasis.
5) Possible cervical instability.
Bone scan [**1-23**]:  1) No abnormal uptake in the left upper extremity.
2) Uptakecorresponding to known metastases in the sternum, cervical spine as above.
Brief Hospital Course: 68M thyroid ca to bone + liver p/w increased pain L shoulder/ humerus.
# pneumonia: Patient had altered MS and low grade fevers [**1-22**] and CXR performed which suggested pna.
Started on levo/flagyl with concern for aspiration.
[**1-23**], patient had new hypoxia and hemoptysis.
CTA negative for PE but did confirm significant pneumonia.
No fevers since starting levo/flagyl.
#L shoulder/humerus pain: Evaluated by radiation oncology who felt that risks of radiation in setting of multiple prior episodes was quite high especially given instability.
Neurosurgery consulted for cervical spine.
His pain was initially difficult to control, but was ultimately dramatically improved when he was changed to a dilaudid PCA--he did not have relief from fentanyl patch, likely b/c of soft tissue wasting and future efforts at long acting medications should be PO.
# thrush: The patient was admitted with thrush which was succesfully treated with nystatin S&S.
Neurosurgery team asked to eval this pt on [**2153-1-23**]  and was transferred to our service for spinal deformity which was noted on upper level of images (CT chest) to r/o PE.
There was a lot of bleeding during the initial anterior approach / the case lasting approximately 7 hours.
Thoracic surgery assisted because of mediastinal mass / we needed sternotomy to control bleeding and complete ant.
Postoperatively he was started on Fondiparinox on [**2-13**] as he is HIT positive.
Medications on Admission: gabapentin 300/300/900, hydromorphone 4-8 mg Q8H PRN, tizanidine 2mg t.i.d., fentanyl patch 75 mcg per hour every three days, lidoderm patch 50, 3 patches a day lorazepam 0.5mg Q4-6H PRN levothyroxine 0.125 qd protonix 40 qd folic acid decadron 2mg [**Hospital1 **] (incr to 4mg in AM today)  Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: cervical spine harware failure s/p cervical spine stabilization metestatic disease   Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: N/A  Followup Instructions: N/A   Completed by:[**2153-2-19**
