Admission Date:  [**2145-9-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-10-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2084-4-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  THORACIC SURGERY/MICU/[**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 51497**] is a 61 year-old male with a one year history of nonsmall cell lung cancer who was transferred from an outside hospital to Cardiothoracic Surgery on [**2145-9-30**].
The patient originally presented to the outside hospital on [**9-18**] with nausea and vomiting and found to have a small bowel obstruction.
A CT of the chest also revealed a right sided pleural effusion as well as an obstructing right upper lobe mass.
CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel obstruction secondary to diffuse abdominal metastases and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection on [**9-23**].
His postoperative course was complicated by fevers and he was initially treated with Zosyn.
On admission the patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Small bowel obstruction secondary to abdominal mets status post small bowel resection.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO HOSPITAL ADMISSION:  Prednisone 20 mg po q day started by the patient's primary care physician for shortness of breath.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has never been married and has no children.
He drinks every once in a while and denies any intravenous or recreational drug use.
In general, the patient is awake, alert, appears his stated age and in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Chest examination coarse breath sounds on the right greater then left, no wheezing, no dullness to percussion with decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.
A well healing midline scar with mild erythema.
Chest x-ray shows large medial right upper lobe mass with opacification at the right heart border due to collapse or consolidation of the right lower lobe.
There is an irregular pleural thickening on the right apex as well as the chest wall.
There is a hydropneumothorax at the right apex.
The left lung is clear with gross interstitial markings.
On [**10-4**] the chest tube was removed following resolution of the pleural effusion.
Zosyn had also been started at the outside hospital for postoperative fever and the patient was continued on Zosyn intravenously.
His postoperative fever was believed to be due initially to postoperative pneumonia, however, the patient continued to have low grade fevers to 100 despite antibiotics.
It was believed that the continued fevers on antibiotics was possibly due to either tumor fever or a drug reaction to the antibiotics.
Following stent placement and chest tube removal the patient continued to have intermittent shortness of breath and worsening cough and he was taken by interventional pulmonary for a repeat bronchoscopy on [**10-12**] for removal of mucous plug.
On [**10-8**] he received his infusion of Photofrin followed by light treatment on [**10-12**] and finally a bronchoscopy to clean out necrotic tissue on [**10-13**].
The patient tolerated this procedure well without any complications.
At the time of discharge the patient's cough and shortness of breath had much improved and he was arranged to follow up with outpatient chest physical therapy.
Fever:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital on Zosyn intravenously for postoperative fever.
It was believed the cause of his fevers to be due to a post obstructive pneumonia.
The patient continued to have low grade fevers to 100 despite these antibiotics.
It was believed the cause of his continued fevers to be due to either tumor fever or drug reaction.
Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was detected at the outside hospital.
At [**Hospital1 69**] the patient had one brief 10 second episode of what appeared to be atrial fibrillation.
The patient was asymptomatic during this episode.
The patient had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation throughout the remainder of the hospital course.
Small bowel obstruction:  The patient had a small bowel resection on [**9-23**] at the outside hospital for small bowel obstruction due to lung metastases.
Diarrhea:  The patient complained of multiple loose bowel movements - up to four bowel movements a day.
Anemia studies were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease, although the patient was already on iron supplements.
An arterial blood gas showed 16% methemoglobinemia and the patient received Methylene blue times one dose empirically.
The cause for his methemoglobinemia was believed to be due to the Lidocaine with a possible contribution for Metoclopramide, which the patient had been taking for nausea and vomiting and from Benzonatate, which the patient had been taking for his cough.
His O2 sats remained stable and he developed no signs of symptoms of cyanosis, so the following day he was able to be transferred back to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **].
Malignant pleural effusion.
Stage four nonsmall cell lung cancer status post right bronch stent placement and photodynamic therapy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Anemia of chronic disease.
Small bowel obstruction status post small bowel resection.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety.
The patient was also given information concerning his outpatient chest rehab.
