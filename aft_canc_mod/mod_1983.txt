There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is borderline right ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Lungs are moderately hyperinflated, but aside from the left upper lobe mass, grossly clear.
No pleural abnormality or evidence of large central lymph nodes.
Intraluminal thrombus was not identified.
VQ scan: IMPRESSION: Very low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect.
Chronic small vessel ischemia.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
Please note that the MRI is more sensitive for the detection of small metastasis in this patient with lung cancer.
1.7 cm spiculated left lung cancer in the upper lobe, with associated opacities in the left upper lobe and lower lobe, not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
Smooth interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lungs, especially in apices and right lower lobe, with diffuse increase of interstitial opacity.
The findings can be due to pulmonary edema, however, lymphangitic spread of the tumor cannot be excluded in this patient with lung cancer.
Slightly increased peribronchial thickening in lower lobes.
Unchanged low-density lesion in the left kidney, most likely representing cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Repiratory Failure: She was initially rx'ed empirically with vanco/levo for possible pna, hep drip for possible PE, lasix for pulm edema and nebs for copd flare.
Lung scan low prob for PE and bilat lenis neg.
CT with evid of pulm edema and BNP in thousands.
Echo ordered showed normal LVSF and some pulmonary hypertension.
Hyponatremia on admission - resolved quickly with free water restriction.
This should be monitored as may develop into SIADH like picture given h/o lung cancer.
Stage 3B NSCLC s/p 3 cycles of Navelbine: Has a scheduled [**Hospital **] clinic follow up in [**12-10**].
CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2136-11-6**]: Remained chest pain free.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 1411**] VNA/[**Company 1519**] Phone  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Respiratory failure due to Pulmonary edema/ Congestive heart failure, diastolic 2) NSC lung cancer 3) thyroid nodules 4) Abnormal liver function tests 5) h/o CAD 6) Hyponatremia - resolved.
Return to the hospital or call your doctor if you notice worsening shortness of breath or any other symptoms.
Talk with your doctor about further testing for the thyroid nodules at your next visit.
