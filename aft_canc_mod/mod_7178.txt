Admission Date:  [**2174-5-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2174-6-5**]   Service:  General Surgery  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea and vomiting.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81 year-old gentleman with the history of bladder cancer with spread to the rectum who is currently being treated with chemotherapy who presents with two to three weeks of progressively worsened nausea nd vomiting.
The nausea and vomiting is worse after meals.
He has developed a dysphagia originally to solids and more recently now to liquids.
He describes a pressure in his chest after eating which lasts for several minutes to hours followed by vomiting which relieves that pressure.
He presented to an outside hospital for evaluation and it was thought that due an admission CT scan for bladder cancer follow up work he might have retained contrast in his gastrointestinal system.
The symptoms persisted and the patient then presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further work up.
Regarding the patient's bladder cancer it was discovered in [**2173**] when he presented with enuresis.
Prior to this patient had been followed for abnormal digital rectal examination and he underwent a transrectal biopsy which showed poorly differentiated carcinoma positive for CEA cytokeratin 7 and 20 but negative for PSA for PSAP.
Patient has had further work up including a negative bone scan and MRI which revealed an asymmetric bladder wall thickening and thickening of the rectum.
He was started on gemcitabine and Ciscarboplatin chemotherapy which has improved his symptoms and on follow up CT scan the disease appears stable on [**2174-5-4**].
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient just reports a ten pound weight loss over the last two to three weeks.
He denies any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for 1) hypertension, 2) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 3) bladder cancer.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
Oropharynx is clear, no lymphadenopathy in neck.
He is regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen is soft and nontender, no palpable hepatosplenomegaly, no abdominal distention.
There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Rectal examination revealed narrow canal with firmness on the left side of the prostate.
No peripheral edema.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 100, no acute ischemia.
Chest x-ray was significant for elevated left hemidiaphragm and minimal subsegmental atelectasis of the left lung.
CT scan done on [**2174-5-4**] was significant for no bladder wall or rectal wall thickening of any significance.
Bilateral moderate hydronephrosis which is stable and increased atrophy of the left kidney.
It showed irregular erosions of the esophageal wall, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and abnormal position of the stomach.
Patient then underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy by the gastrointestinal service on [**2174-5-16**] which was significant for grade 2 esophagitis of the lower third of the esophagus and open pylorus and an extrinsic stenosis of the second part of the duodenum.
Patient was restarted on liquid diet, was on Protonix for his gastritis and subsequently developed nausea and vomiting once again and intolerance to any p.o.
At this point patient had a PICC line placed.
A second esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies was performed.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy was significant for gastric inlet patch, gastritis of the stomach and extrinsic stenosis of the second part of the duodenum once again.
Surgery was consulted and once being cleared by cardiology due to his history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patient was taken to the operating room on [**2174-5-27**] for planned gastrojejunostomy.
During rapid induction for intubation patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 60s and the monitor showed an eight beat run of ventricular tachycardia.
He was weaned off pressors and extubated without incident.
There were no electrocardiographic changes post event.
Patient on [**2174-5-30**] underwent a gastrojejunostomy, anal dilatation and a biopsy of intraoperative finding of a retroperitoneal mass which was compressing the duodenum.
Postoperatively cardiology-wise patient remained stable with no postoperative electrocardiogram changes.
On postoperative day number one after being transferred to the floor patient received rapid atrial fibrillation with a stable blood pressure.
On postoperative two the patient once again had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled and patient converted back to normal sinus.
The biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass pathology has returned result of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, signet cell features, positive for keratin and cytokeratin 7 and 20.
This is the same staining properties as the mass biopsied from the bladder and is likely metastatic disease.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**] in one week and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2539**] in one week for Coumadin adjustment and atrial fibrillation management.
Duodenal obstruction secondary to metastatic bladder         cancer, status post gastrojejunostomy.
Anal stenosis, status post anal dilatation.
4.      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
