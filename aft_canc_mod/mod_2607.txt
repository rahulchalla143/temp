She also sustained a small right subdural s/p fall, which remained stable over multiple MRI scans and CT scans.
She was transferred back to the BMT service from the MICU once she was stable, and dilantin and phenobarb were continued for seizure prophylaxis.
This was decided as the patient was subtherapeutic on dilantin and phenobarb and also due to interference with tacrolimus levels.
