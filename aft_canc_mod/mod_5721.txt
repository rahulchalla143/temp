She had spoken to her friend around 8:40 this morning before getting into the shower and was found around 11 am with slurred speech.
On their arrival the patient had right sided weakness and developed respiratory distress and was intubated.
Upon arrival at the outside facility a CT was obtained that showed a large parietal tumor with significant midline shift.
Past Medical History: HTN, diabetes, Gastric bypass, history of a meningoma resected by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] five years ago.
Neuro: Unarousable to voice or deep stimuli, grimaces to pain only.
Hyperdense lesion in the trigone of the left lateral ventricle along with satellite lesions is consistent with meningiomas.
No evidence of uncal or transtentorial herniation.
[**3-31**] BRAIN MRI: Left atrial memingioma with trapped left temporal and occipital horns with periventricular edema  [**4-2**] Head CTA: IMPRESSION: 1.
Stable hyperdense lesions in the trigone of the left lateral ventricle compatible with meningiomas.
Unchanged dense, enhancing lesions in the trigone of the left lateral ventricle, likely meningiomas.
[**4-6**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited enhanced MR examination, re-demonstrating the uniformly-enhancing intraventricular mass centered in the left lateral ventricular atrium, with imaging characteristics most suggestive of meningioma.
Post-surgical changes, with enhancement of the left-sided dura as well as the surgical resection cavity margins.
Evaluation for residual tumor is limited.
Mild mass effect with shift of the midline structures to the right side, with a moderate-sized pneumocephalus, which is seen to indent the left cerebral hemisphere,as seen on the prior CT study.
Surgery was without complication and she tolerated it well.
Post op head CT revealed good placement of catheter and no hemorrhage.
On [**4-4**] she was deemed fit to extubate which was done so without complication.
On 3.2 she was taken to the OR for a left sided craniotomy for resection of her left intraventricular tumor.
Head CT revealed post op changes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-14**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
