Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.8 P: 156 P: 124/75 R: 29 O2: 91% on 3L General: Alert & oriented x3, comfortable, tearful at times HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pale conjunctiva, slightly dry mucus membranes, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP elevated to mandible CV: Tachy, irregular, S1, S2 Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorally Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no rebound/guarding, no masses GU: foley catheter in place Ext: warm, well perfused, left lower extremtiy shortened and externally rotated, left calf wrapped in dressing which is clean/dry/intact, no edema.
Neuro: CNII-XII intact   Pertinent Results: TTE [**1-23**]: Cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with an uncontrolled ventricular rate.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A very small pericardial effusion is present (no tamponade).
Multiple other significant structural and functional cardiac lesions persist as noted above.
Unremarkable selective superior and inferior mesenteric arteriograms.
Specifically, no angiographic evidence of active arterial bleeding.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y.o female with extensive pmhx including afib recently anticoagulated s/p L hip replacement on [**1-8**], chf, ckd, mpd, hemorrhoidectomy in [**6-/2139**], lower GIB in [**7-/2139**] s/p superior rectal artery embolization, now with lower GI bleeding, Cdiff infection, UTI and hip infection.
# Goals of care: Pt was transferred to the ICU on [**2140-2-2**] for worsening altered mental status.
Most medications, including antibiotics, were discontinued, with only continuation of medications for comfort, including antiemetics, pain medications.
The acute medical issues during her hospitalization were as follows: # GI Bleeding: Patient presented with massive amount of lower GI bleeding, passing massive amount of large bright red clots.
Patient had a history of diverticular disease and known hemorrhoidal disease as well as a lower GIB in [**2139-7-6**] requiring a total of 18 units pRBCs.
Patient underwent tagged RBC scan which identified the source of the bleeding as the sigmoid colon but no bleeding was seen on subsequent IR imaging so no interventions were performed.
Her bleeding improved and her stools became dark indicating old blood.
She had no further episodes of acute bleeding during her stay and her hematocrits remained stable .
The wound looked infected and was healing poorly so she was taken to the OR on [**1-24**] for wound dehiscence and two infected collections were seen, one superficial and one deep.
# Lethargy: Patient's mental status on transfer out of the MICU was interactive, awake, and generally oriented x3.
During her stay on the floor, her mental status deteriorated to the point of unresponsiveness on [**2-2**], despite not having been given any sedating medications for several days.
Toxic metabolic insults such as [**Last Name (un) **], multiple infections, and persistent tachycardia for days were thought to be potential precipitants for somnolence.
She developed signs of respiratory depression and hypopnea, which prompted transfer to the MICU.
# C. diff infection: Patient with report of c. diff infection from rehab.
Has had ongoing diarrhea over the past several weeks.
Patient was passing pseudomembranes in stool here so was started on IV flagyl on [**1-23**].
IV flagyl was d/c'ed for one day with return of her diarrhea so she was continued on double therapy through [**1-30**].
Flexiseal was removed, then later replaced on [**2-1**], when diarrhea became less formed and more liquid, to help protect the patient's unstageable decubitus ulcer.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient with baseline heart rates in the 110s but were more elevated here, persistently in the 120s - 140s.
# Urinary Tract Infection: Patient had no complaints of dysuria but had a history of Proteus UTI at rehab.
Found to have proteus and enterococcus in her urine here.
Per ID, her skin is likely colonized with these organisms.
Urine lytes were consistent with intravascular volume depletion.
# Diastolic CHF: Patient with history of diastolic CHF, previously on 120 mg of lasix daily, but has not been on lasix as per rehab records.
Patient initially very symptomatic from CHF with dyspnea and orthopnea.
TTE during this admission showed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and likely depressed systolic function, which was difficult to quantify, given rapid heart rate.
Patient with leukocytosis to 40,000 on admission, neutrophil predominant that rose to 50,000 during this hospital stay before trending down.
Leukocytosis was attributed to patient's many sources of infection including ongoing C.diff, UTI, and hip infection.
# CAD: Pt with known CAD s/p RCA stent.
Patient complained of chest pain on [**1-26**] and [**1-27**] without concurrent EKG changes.
Patient stated the pain was similar to her "heart attack" pain.
Her troponin was slightly elevated from baseline (0.05) but CK and CK MB remained flat and serial enzymes showed downtrending troponin.
