There is no mediastinal adenopathy.
The lungs demonstrate bilateral small pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis.
The lung apices demonstrate thickened interlobular septa, which may represent increased interstitial edema.
Patchy right upper lobe nodules (2:19) may represent an infectuous or inflammatory process.

There is extensive bulky retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy that is grossly unchanged since five days ago.
There is increased mesenteric free fluid.
There is no evidence of free air.
CT PELVIS: There is a moderate amount of pelvic free fluid measuring water density (7 [**Doctor Last Name **]).
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.
There is diffuse mild stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues that is consistent with anasarca.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Prominent lymphadenopathy that is unchanged since [**2185-7-25**].
Diffuse anasarca.
Patchy right upper lobe nodular opaities may represent developing pneumonia or inflammatory process.
Acute renal failure: prerenal transformed to ATN in the setting of high fevers, sweats and poor po intake prior to admission.
He did have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (mild, without ECG changes) and hyperphosphatemia which were treated until his creatinine normalized.
Cholestatic hepatitis: The patient had abnormal LFTs with marked elevation in bilirubin.
Pathology demonstrated portal involvement of his Hodgkin lymphoma with superimposed hepatitis, likely drug/chemotherapy related.
There was no evidence of encephalopathy on this admission.
Neutropenic sepsis: from E.coli and Viridans streptococci bacteremia in the setting of mucositis/colitis and neutropenia from chemotherapy.
CT abdomen without perforation or abscess.
He had a positive adenovirus in the stool.
Also probably related to mucositis vs. antibiotic associated vs. other.
Complicated by the above and pancytopenia requiring blood and platelet transfusion and granulocyte support with G-CSF.
Volume overload: the patient had acute pulmonary edema in the setting of multiple blood product transfusions in preparation for liver biopsy.
Coagulopathy: in the setting of acute liver injury, poor po intake and antibiotic use.
Disp:*120 Troche* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute Renal Failure, Acute Hepatic Failure, Bacteremia, HSV1 mucositis.
Secondary: Hodgkins lymphoma, HIV   Discharge Condition: Stable, improving liver function, stable renal function, improving blood counts, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with abdominal distension, no urine output for over 2 days and acute renal failure.
