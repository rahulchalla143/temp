Admission Date:  [**2120-11-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-1-9**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old female with a history of rectal cancer who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2120-11-9**] for a low anterior resection of her rectal cancer with ileostomy and omental flap placement over the stump.
Her initially course was complicated by necrosis of the omental pouch and a prolonged postoperative ileus.
Multiple CT scans of her abdomen revealed no evidence of obstruction and the ileus was thought to be secondary to inflammation and irritation from the necrotic omentum.
On [**12-18**], the patient was found to be less responsive with increasing respiratory effort.
At this point the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
From a respiratory standpoint, the patient was extubated on the following day, but required reintubation after three days secondary to increasing secretions and need for constant pulmonary toilet.
This was attributed to volume overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction as well as a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
From a gastrointestinal standpoint a CT of the abdomen on [**12-16**] revealed a communication between Hartmann's pouch and the peritoneal cavity with an abdominal fluid collection.
From an infectious disease standpoint four out of four blood culture bottles from [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] grew coag negative staphylococcus, which has been treated with Vancomycin.
The Infectious Disease Service was consulted and they believed the patient is colonized, particularly since she currently has no evidence of pneumonia.
From a cardiac standpoint there has been concern about volume overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
She had several episodes of atypical chest pain during her stay and was ruled out for myocardial infarction multiple times.
During her MICU stay the patient had frequent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
From a psychiatric standpoint the patient has been profoundly depressed and is being followed by the Psychiatry Service.
There was on episode of a self extubation attempt.
Rectal carcinoma status post radiation therapy and chemosensitization and low anterior resection on [**2120-11-15**].
Hypertension with a question diastolic dysfunction.
Coronary artery disease with a 30% left anterior descending coronary artery, 50% right coronary artery.
In general, the patient was a sad, but conversant older female in no acute distress.
Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory examination, the patient had decreased breath sounds bilaterally as well as soft bibasilar rales.
Her extremities are warm without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Studies, the patient had a chest x-ray on [**1-6**], which revealed interval improvement in upper zone redistribution with a small left pleural effusion and residual left lower lobe collapse with a questionable consolidation in the retrocardiac region thought to be secondary to atelectasis.
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**12-25**], which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen consistent with an abdominal abscess.
She had a CT of the adomen on [**12-16**], which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen with no identifiable Hartmann's pouch.
Her left atrium was mildly dilated.
She was found to have a moderate mitral annular calcification and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Infectious disease:  As was mentioned previously we treated the patient empirically for a Pseudomonas pneumonia with Ciprofloxacin.
There was no clear evidence of pneumonia, but given her history and tenuous status we opted to treat her empirically with a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Her white blood cell count and fever curve remained within normal limits.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has been noted to have an abdominal collection that is draining into the rectal stump.
Cardiovascular:  From a cardiovascular standpoint we did not have any evidence of acute ischemia, however, after her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient had several episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Despite this she did have several episodes during her stay on the general medicine floor.
During her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was felt to have a diastolic dysfunction, but was noted to be very fluid sensitive and responsive to Lasix.
