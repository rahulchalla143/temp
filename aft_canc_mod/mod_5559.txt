Prior to this on [**2145-12-17**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed VATS left upper lobe and left lower lobe nodules: one node positive for metastatic disease with clear margins and the other was negative.
He has seen oncology for possible sorafenib treatment.
However he complained of new back pain to his pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**].
At that time he had no neurologic symptoms.
An MRI obtained [**2-1**] showed a new pathologic fx of T4 and an epidural lesion at that level compressing the cord.
Plans were to stabilize the spine and radiate the lesion.However yesterday he developed b/l LE weakness and numbness.
He has been brought in to the hospital for more immediate management.He has had some drainage from his incision and this was opened at the bedside.
Past Medical History: PMH: hyperuricemia (no gout) dyspepsia hyperlipidemia diverticulosis osteoarthritis lumbar disc displacement basal cell CA face  PSH: L knee arthroscopy [**2116**] L VATS wedge resection x 2 [**11/2145**] [**2146-1-3**] Left hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.
Family History: Father: Coronary artery disease (died at age 47).

Interval development of multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases involving all lobes.
Enlarged metastatic left gastric lymph node.
Interval progression of the lytic T4 lesion with increased epidural extension and anterior vertebral body compression fracture.
Slight decrease in the perihepatic fluid collection, which now contains some air consistent with the recent aspiration.
Onset of radicular pain prompted MRI spine prior to this admission which showed a T4 epidural metastasis.
CT of the chest, abdoment and pelvis [**2-6**] was performed to further stage possible recurrent HCC.

- UTI: UA on admission was positive and subsequent urine culture drawn [**2-5**] showed enterococcus > 100k colonies.
- Fluid Collection: CT abdomen [**2-4**] without contrast showed a perihepatic fluid collection.
This was aspirated by IR [**2-5**] and fluid was sent for culture.
Patient participated in Reiki sessions and will follow with palliative care for future services.
