Admission Date:  [**2161-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-5-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levaquin / Azithromycin / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy Transfusion of 2 units of blood   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, admitted with febrile neutropenia.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was first diagnosed with squamous cell NSCLC in [**1-/2160**] when she presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and back pain, and was found to have a malignant pleural effusion.
She underwent pleural biopsy on [**2161-2-9**] at OSH that showed metastatic nonsmall carcinoma of pulmonary origin with suggestion of squamous differentiation.
In [**2161-1-15**] she developed neurologic symptoms of headache, dysarthria, and difficulty with fine motor skills, and brain imaging diagnosed multiple brain metastases.
She was hospitalized again [**Date range (1) 81108**]/09 with pulmonary embolism and was started on enoxaparin.
CT raised concern for progressive disease in her liver, and on [**2161-5-20**] she began treatment on erlotinib.
Past Medical History: * Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed via biopsy in [**2160-1-15**] with known metastasis to T11.
No neurosurgery intervention deemed appropriate and was set up for whole brain XRT by radiation oncology at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 81109**]/09.
She also had ~2 weeks of vinorelbine on [**3-23**], stopped for elevated LFTs.
Started erlotinib [**5-23**] * Malignant L pleural effusion, s/p multiple thoracenteses.
s/p chest tube, talc pleurodesis * Seizures secondary to brain mets.
Occurred [**2161-4-15**], while off keppra due to elevated LFTs.
She did not have recent travel, or change in diet.
Family History: There is no family history of cancer including lung, ovary, colon and breast.
There is no history of premature CAD or stroke or diabetes.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and noaortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No pericardial effusion.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Left-sided pleural thickening or tiny fluid in the fissure is not changed.
However, no new consolidation or pulmonary edema is seen.
The rounded sclerotic focus in T10 is redemonstrated, consistent with known metastasis.
IMPRESSION: No acute findings such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema seen.
MICRO: Blood cx [**6-3**]: NGTD Urine cx [**6-3**]: >100K lactobacillus Legionella Ag [**6-4**]: negative Sputum: viral neg  Bone Marrow Biopsy pending  Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo female with metastatic NSCLC on dexamethasone for brain mets, and recent admission for PE returned with febrile neutropenia.
No clear infectious source found on history or culture data.
The suddent onset could be compatible with influenza, however her urine cx showed >100K lactobacillus which is likely cotamination.
Her CXR showed no evidence of infection.
# Neutropenia: Patient found to become neutropenic in mid-[**Month (only) 116**].
Differential for her neutropenia included marrow suppression/infiltration from her disease vs medication effect vs infection affecting her bone marrow.
During her hospitalization  her keppra was stopped and she was started on topamax instead as keppra was also suspected of causing marrow suppression.
As her counts recovered so quickly, her neuropenia was likely secondary to medication-effect, likely bactrim as this was temporally related to the onset of neutropenia.
Though there was abnormalities on her differential, there was otherwise no obvious sign of hemolysis.
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease and vitamin B12 and folate have recently been normal.
# Metastatic NSCLC with brain mets: Patient has known brain mets s/p XRT which have resulted in seizures.
As above her keppra was stopped and she was started on Topiramate 100 mg PO BID for seizure prevention.
# EKG with inf/lateral TWI: Admission EKG showed TWI, but she had no clinical evidence of ischemia.
She was ruled out for MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
An echo was without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
# Lower extremity leg weakness: Patient has a known steroid myopathy.
Her weakness was stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Febrile neutropenia Acute on chronic anemia  Secondary - Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma History of seziures Recent pulmonary emboli Steroid myopathy   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to fevers.
You were also given blood transfusions due to low blood counts.
Your counts improved and you were changed to oral antibiotics and remained without evidence of infection.
It is thought that your low counts were due to an uncommon side effect of the antibiotic bactrim.
For pain you can take 1 percocet every 4 hours as needed.
For nausea you can take 10 mg of compazine every 6 hours as needed.
Call your primary doctor, or go to the emergency room if you experience fevers, chills, dizziniess, shortness of breath, inability to tolerate oral intake, blood in your stool, black stool, or other concerns.
