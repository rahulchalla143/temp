Admission Date: [**2187-8-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2187-8-26**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  ENT   CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46185**] is a 78-year-old man with a history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma status post x-ray therapy initially in [**2184**] with a subsequent left-sided partial laryngectomy due to local recurrence, ultimately receiving a total laryngectomy in [**2186-2-20**].
He did well from that point on prior to admission, and was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] his old laryngologist on [**2187-7-24**] for left neck pain believed to be due to TMJ, as well as a left external auditory canal insect bite.
He recently, however, was found to have a mediastinal mass noted on chest x-ray that was 5 x 6 cm.
A biopsy revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma similar to the biopsy from [**2186-1-28**].
He presented on [**2187-8-22**] with increasing dyspnea and a 1- to 2-day history of throat tightness.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.
History of DVT and PE.
Forehead squamous cell carcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He was alert and oriented x 3, aphasic, in no acute distress.
Tracheostomy site clean, dry and intact with tracheostomy collar, a large anterior mass inferior to the left tracheal wound.
No obvious mass in base of tongue or neopharynx.
Fiberoptic examination through the stoma shows diffuse bulge from left shifting to right, with some narrowing of the stoma, tapering trachea to 6 x 10 cm, the lower two-thirds of the trachea to the carina within normal limits.
A CT scan of the airway showed a 6 x 6 cm mass in the superoanterior mediastinum with tracheal deviation to the right, some narrowing near the superior trachea/laryngectomy stoma.
No fluid collection.
He had continuous pulse oximetry and close respiratory monitoring.
The impression was, likely some degree of coronary artery disease.
He had a tachy arrhythmia that was not atrial fibrillation and was continued on Verapamil and cleared for surgery.
On [**8-23**], he had a bronchoscopy showing an intact tracheostoma with a proximal tracheal lumen of [**9-11**] mm with erythematous friable mucosa.
Treatment options will include radiation with or without chemotherapy.
The location of the mass outside the original localized laryngeal radiation in [**2184**], may make him a candidate for additional radiation therapy to this mediastinal mass.
