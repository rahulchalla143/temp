No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Abnormal AVR.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
LV systolic function is slightly improved.
Episode of moderate to severe RV hypokinesis during sternal closure with moderate LV hypokinesis, improved with inotropes, Mild to Moderate RV hypokinesis persisting with inotropic and pressor support.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, alteration in the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, or new hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of a major vascular territorial infarct.
The known vascular anomaly in the left temporal region is not appreciated on this study.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
Troponin positive with EKG changes and signs of CHF.
Weight loss recently concerning for possibility of malignancy given lymphadenopathy/alcoholism.
Echo done as part of w/u which revealed severe prosthetic aortic valve stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.4 cm2, peak gradient 131/mean 83, EF 20%, [**Doctor Last Name **], 1+ AI, 1+ MR, 2+ TR, moderate MAC, ascending aorta 3.9 cm, and severe PA systolic hypertension.
Right lung mass/opacity also seen on CXR.
CT torso also revealed mesenteric /mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Neuro consult done for history of venous AVMs of the brain and they recommended avoiding long-term anti-coagulation which would be required for a mechanical valve.
Node biopsy specimen was nondiagnostic, and general surgery was consulted for possible laparascopic node biopsy.
Treated for epistaxis on [**11-30**].
Extubated that evening and weaned from drips the next day.Transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing his activity level.Developed some sternal drainage on POD #4 and vancomycin started.He remained afebrile.ACE restarted, but no beta blockade per cardiology also, and treated for UTI that developed on POD #6.
CT brain done for confusion which did not show any intracranial pathology.
He has had some diarrhea, without abdominal pain.
He had a brief episode (less than 1 hour) of A Fib today, with a ventricular rate of 80/minute, which converted spontaneously to NSR.
