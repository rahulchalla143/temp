The patient presented in 12/99 to [**Hospital3 27946**] complaining of 6 week history of progressive shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion and cough.
Chest x-ray at that time showed a right lower lobe nodule and increased cardiac shadow.
Chest CT, several lung nodules, carinal lymphadenopathy and a mass in her left neck with tracheal deviation.
Echocardiogram demonstrated large pericardial effusion and mild tamponade for which she underwent pericardiocentesis.
FNA and core needle biopsies of the left neck mass were positive for malignant cells consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma suggestive of neuro endocrine origin, subsequently shown to be a small cell carcinoma.
She had been relatively well since that time until about one month ago with the onset of shortness of breath gradually with development of a productive cough.
Over past week she notes increased shortness of breath, bilateral lower extremity edema and orthopnea/PND.
She reports no fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain or palpitations.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hyperthyroidism status post total thyroidectomy, cervical cancer status post conization and XRT in [**2106**], tuberculoma resection in [**2071**], status post Cesarean delivery, left neck mass with metastatic cancer of unknown primary.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She was in no acute distress.
She had no cervical lymphadenopathy.
She had faint bibasilar crackles with decreased breath sounds on the right side greater than on the left.
She had distant S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She had a well healed midline umbilical scar.
There were no masses.
She had 1+ pitting edema to the mid left calf.
EKG at the outside hospital showed sinus tachycardia at a heart rate of 103.
There were no ischemic changes.
Echocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated ejection fraction of approximately 60% and a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
There were no complications and she was recovered in the CSRU.
Her pain was well controlled with Percocet.
She was ambulating out of bed to chair well with minimal assistance.
Her chest tube was discontinued on postoperative day #3 without complications.
