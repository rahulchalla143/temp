Admission Date:  [**2137-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-11-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19193**] Chief Complaint: Seizure and IPH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation for airway protection.
Per the patient's daughters, the patient seemed fatigued with decreased appetite but otherwise normal self until just prior to presentation.
At 6:30 on the morning of presentation, her daughter heard her cough but no stirring.
Per EMS record, patient was noted to have GTC seizure but the daughter denied any shaking, LOC, gaze deviation and etc.
The family denies any prior history of seizure.
Upon presentation, the patient had head CT that demonstrated 2 discrete hemorrhages in L frontal and parietal lobes with no mass effect.
(Of note, the patient is known to have a left frontal meningioma discovered on CT done in [**2135**]).
HTN 2. hx of L breast tumor - ductal carcinoma in-situ s/p excisional bipsy in [**2131**] with 2 weeks of radiation.
R cataract s/p laser therapy   Social History: Lives at home with daughters - independent of all ADLs.
CV: RRR, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear anteriorly Abd: +BS, soft, nontender Ext: No edema  Neurologic examination: MSE: Intubated and sedated.
No spontaneous movements or opening of eyes.
Face appears symmetric but no blinking to visual threats.
Localizes to painful stimuli for both UEs but does not withdraw LEs to noxious stim.
Reflexes: 2s for biceps and [**Last Name (un) **] but none in LEs.
Exam was otherwise pertinent for bibasilar crackles and mild non-pitting lower extremity swelling slightly worse on the right as compared to the left.
Hemorrhagic lesion in the left parietal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
While no definite underlying mass lesion is identified, differential diagnosis includes a hemorrhagic metastatic focus versus hemorrhage secondary to hypertension.
Amyloid angiopathy is a less likely consideration given the lack of other susceptibility foci in the parenchyma.
There is no evidence of a developmental venous anomaly or other abnormal vessels, but an underlying vascular malformation could also be considered.
Meningioma overlying the left frontal lobe, stable in appearance and size compared to the prior CT from [**2135**], when accounting for differences in technique.
Areas of white matter hyperintensity are a nonspecific finding, but likely represent the sequela of chronic microangiopathy given the patient's age.
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2137-10-25**]): Enhancing heterogenous mass in right lower quadrant, may represent a conglomerate nodal mass, metastasis, less likely a primary mesenteric neoplasm such as carcinoid.
Bilateral pulmonary opacities and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Could reflect an infectious or inflammatory process, however given high risk for malignancy,dedicated follow-up chest CT within three months is recommended.
Coarse pancreatic calcifications, with mild dilation of the proximal pancreatic duct measuring up to 3.5 mm, chronic pancreatitis or calcified mucinous neoplasm are potential considerations.
Long-Term Monitoring EEG ([**2137-10-23**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due four electrographic seizures in the right occipital region consisting of rhythmic sharp waves and at times sharp and slow wave discharge for 1-2 minutes in duration without obvious clinical correlate on video.
The background rhythm is also noted to be of low voltage.
Would recommend further EEG monitoring given multiple subclinical seizures detected on this recording.
Long-Term Monitoring EEG ([**Date range (3) 25995**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Background EEG showed a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
No electrographic seizures were recorded.
Chest X-ray ([**2137-10-26**]): New left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation and ill-defined opacities in the remaining left lower lobe are new worrisome for infectious process Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
There is stable moderate cardiomegaly and stable mild pulmonary congestive pattern.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged examination; mild pulmonary congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 YO woman with hypertension, NIDDM, meningioma, and left ductal carcinoma in situ who presented to [**Hospital1 25991**]Hospital following a generalized tonic clonic seizure and was found to have a new intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
At the time of admission, an MRI of the head was performed to better characterize the lesion and identify contributory structural abnormalities.
The study revealed an acute hemorrhagic lesion in the left parietal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
While there were also findings consistent with chronic microangiopathy, there was no suggestion of amyloid angiopathy.
The hemorrhage was also though to be in a location atypical for hypertensive bleeds.
In the setting of the patient's history of malignancy, the appearance of the lesion raised concern for a hemorrhagic metastasis.
The imaging showed an enhancing heterogenous mass in right lower quadrant, bilateral pulmonary opacities with multiple pulmonary nodules, endometrial fluid and right adnexal fullness, subcentimeter hepatic lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, pancreatic calcifications with mild dilation of the proximal pancreatic duct, and possible bony lesions.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (along with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] of oncology felt that the visceral and bony lesions were consistent with metastatic disease, likely from a primary breast cancer.
The patient was transferred to the medicine team in order to arrange for CT-guided biopsy of the right lower quadrent lesion seen on CT.
The patient also complained of shortness of breath and cough.
Exam and CXR were consistent with pneumonia so the patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
This was discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**] with a plan to switch to trileptal as an outpatient after further discussion given increased risk of hyponatremia in the setting of likely lung lesions/malignancy seen on CT. .
During hospitalization, she was also noted to have asymmetric LE swelling.
She intermittently accepted finger sticks for blood sugar measurements as well as insulin.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Intra-cranial hemorrhage Parietal lobe mass of unknown etiology Right lower quadrent necrotic mass Multiple pulmonary nodules Endometrial and ovarian abnormalities seen on CT T5 and T7 lucent osseous lesions Subcentimeter hepatic lesions Hospital Acquired Pneumonia Hypertension Seizures  Secondary: Breast Cancer   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable with normal vitals.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after being found unresponsive at home.
One of these lesions was a meningioma which was seen on prior imaging in [**2135**].
It was not clear what this area was composed of but, given your history of breast cancer and the appearance of the area on head imaging, a CT scan of your torso was done.
The CT showed several concerning areas in your lungs, vertebrae and abdomen.
The abdominal lesion is the best candidate for sampling for diagnostic purposes.
After discussion, we came to the concensus that having the abdominal lesion sampled should be done after you regain some strength after this illness.
This has been ordered for you but cannot be scheduled yet for logistical reasons.
Should you decide not to pursue the biopsy at that time, please call the radiology department to cancel or reschedule.
Given your clinical presentation and concern for seizures, an EEG was done.
An alternative medication is called trileptal although this medication puts you at risk for low sodium.
You were also noted to have a pneumonia.
As this was acquired in the hospital after a brief intubation when you first arrived, we recommended that you take broad spectrum antibiotics.
You were noted to have asymetric lower extremity swelling on exam.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**] or return to the emergency room if you experience decreased alertness, confusion or unawareness, abnormal arm or leg movements, headache, change in vision speech or facial expression, weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs, chest pain, shortness of breath, increased sputum production, coughing up blood, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nightsweats, diarrhea, dark black stool or bloody stool.
Followup Instructions: A biopsy of your abdominal lesion has been ordered.
You should have a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial and ovarian abnormalities seen on CT.
