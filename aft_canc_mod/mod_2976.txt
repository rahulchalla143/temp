Last Wednesday (six days prior to admission, she noticed a rash on her face.
She went with her husband to his doctor's appointment, and he took a urine sample and diagnosed her with the flu.
She then developed chills and fevers to 101F, along with "excruciating" intermittent headaches, located over her right eye, for which she was prescribed Vicodin with good effect on both her headaches and ability to sleep.
She also reports muscle and joint aches, as well as diffuse body weakness.
She was not improving, and the day prior to admission, her daughter took her to an OSH (but she vomited in the car on the way to the hospital and traveled the rest of the way via ambulance), where she had an elevated white count, was diagnosed with a UTI, given IVF, ciprofloxacin and compazine, and sent home.
She denies sick contacts, genital ulcers or lesions, travel outside of the country, prolonged exposure in the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**] (although she does have to walk in high grass to and from the mailbox), tick or mosquito bites, pets, unusual foods, and raw seafood.
She denies new medications preceding the rash, and she denies use of new deodorants or lotions.
Per her family (daughter), she seemed to have trouble concentrating, but was not particularly altered in cognition.
Mental status worsened with fevers/rigors but improved after Tylenol.
Of note, her husband recently had quadruple bypass surgery two weeks ago at [**Hospital1 18**] and is currently recovering; she reports increased stress and minimal sleep since the operation.
Family History: Significant for diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: VS: T:102.1F, BP:148/76, HR:117, RR:22, O2:96%RA GEN: Uncomfortable appearing HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, dry mucus membranes NECK: Supple, no cervical lymphadenopathy, no meningismus CHEST: Bibasilar dry crackles at bases, no wheezes or rhonchi CV: Tachycardic, no m/r/g ABD: Soft, voluntary guarding, decreased (but present) bowel sounds, mild tenderness to palpation in RUQ EXT: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema NEURO: A&O x3, but easily distractable; speaking coherently in full sentences SKIN: Diffuse macular blanchable rash on trunk, extremities, back, and with partial involvement of palms and soles   Pertinent Results: U/A: Tr prot, 150 ket, otherwise unremarkable .
CXR: Mild edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is  presumed partially calcified mass lesion likely within the anterior mediastinum of indeterminate etiology.
Diagnostic considerations include prior granulomatous disease or possibly treated lymphoma.
A calcified mass possibly from thyroid origin is also in the differential diagnosis.
This lesion does not likely represent an acute finding.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 28412**] is a 56 year old woman with remote history of Hodgkin's disease, and history of diabetes, presenting with fever, intermittent headache, malaise, fatigue, arthralgias/myalgias, mild transaminitis, and diffuse macular blanching rash.
Fever and rash.
Pathology prelim with edema and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate (similar to urticaria, but not consistent with clinical picture).
No evidence of leukemic infiltrate.
Differential included post viral hypersensitivity reaction, drug reaction, less likely viral exanthem.
At discharge she had also been afebrile x >48hours.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Back into sinus with IV lopressor and fever control.
On [**6-6**] again persistently tachycardic to 140s with rhythm more consistent with atrial fibrillation, very difficult to rate control.
Normotensive during episodes but did drop briefly into upper 80s with receiving dilt.
She had repeat echo without significant change (normal LV function, no evidence of RV strain, normal atrial size).
No underlying pulmonary disease, though did have new pulmonary edema on CXR (despite normal LV function on echo) which may have triggered the arrhythmia.
Pulmonary edema and effusions on chest xray (?cardiogenic vs. noncardiogenic/inflammatory source).
Unclear why she developed pulmonary edema as above.
However, alk phos continued to rise through her discharge (353 at discharge) with elevated GGT as well.
Fe studies c/w inflammation.
No evidence of active bleeding.
# Thrombocytosis.
# Leukocytosis.
Neutrophilia without bandemia.
