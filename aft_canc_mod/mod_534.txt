Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY 79-year-old man with a history of COPD and a PET avid left upper lobe nodule that has has grown since [**2173**], in the setting of diffuse LAD.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] has had multiple conversations with several pulmonary and oncology providers in the last several years recommending tissue biopsy and bone marrow biopsy; but he refused on multiple occasions.
Noted to have LAD in [**2172**]; at that time Heme-Onc was concerned for primary lung cancer versus a potential lymphoma, less likely melanoma, and recommended a bone marrow biopsy and a surgical biopsy, both of which Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] declined.
Imaging revealed growth of the spiculated LUL nodule [**2172**]-[**2175**] to 2.4 cm, with osteolytic lesion in T5, T6, and posterior sixth left rib thought to be likely mets.
On [**2176-8-14**] CXR left upper lobe lung nodule has grown to nearly 7 cm, abuts the anterior surface of the left hilus; he refused biopsy again so his pulmonologist obtained sputum sample.On [**2176-8-28**] sputum cytology revealed highly atypical squamous cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
The patient has refused biopsy and therefore is not eligible for any potential treatments for this presumed malignancy  Past Medical History: melanoma excised from his right thumb removed in [**2172**], no pathology report COPD Bullous skin disease followed by Dermatology HTN CVA s/p R CEA  Social History: Lives alone.

No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine as detailed above.
CXR ([**6-5**]): FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a previously 5.8 x 3.6 cm left upper lobe lung mass, now measuring 8.7 x 6.5 cm with interval cavitation and a new air-fluid level, which presumably represents a cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
This lesion abuts the anterior left hilus.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
The aortic knob is partially calcified without dilatation.
CXR ([**6-7**]): IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-5**]:  Slight increase in the heart size and heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases could be due to dependent edema, but raises more concern for pneumonia.
The large cavitated mass in the left upper lobe contains a fair amount of fluid.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion is present.
ECHO ([**6-6**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 79 year-old gentleman with history of melanoma, presumptive squamous cell lung cancer with CXRay revealing enlargening cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents, and known osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions in the T-spine most likely from metastases presenting with pain, malaise, and falls at home, transferred to ICU for a. fib with RVR which resolved with amiodarone.
# Altered mental status/encephalopathy: Pt's mental status reportedly worsened in the setting of having his fentanyl patch increased from 25mcg to 50 mcg.
Moreover, the patient was found to be hypercalcemic and hypotensive on presentation.
All three factors likely resulted in his AMS, with resolution after decrease of his fentanyl patch, treatment and resolution of his hypercalcemia, and discontinuation of his home blood pressure medications.
The patient should refrain from having increased fentanyl patch doses.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient with no known history of atrial fibrillation, developed a. fib with RVR and rate related EKG changes.
Precipitant unclear, but possibly etiology includes chronic disease (pt with h/o HTN), pulmonary disease (patient with known COPD), irritation of left atria from left lung mass, and echo revealing mild LVH, mild MR and AS, so patient is good substrate.
Patient with rate related EKG changes that went away with better rate control.
No chest pain, no dyspnea.
In ER was started on diltiazem gtt but became hypotensive so was admitted to the MICU and started on an Amiodarone gtt with a loading dose.
ECHO with mild AS and small pericardial effusion without tamponade (likely malignancy related).
The patient may continue his aspirin 325 mg.  # Hypotension: Patient initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension (and Afib with RVR) which seemed to have developed in the setting of starting a Diltiazem drip.
The patient states he takes too many medications, does not want to take HTN medications, and his blood pressures were persistently in the 100s-140 range.
He states that he used to have SBPs in the 200s and felt fine.
He should not be treated for his hypertension unless he requests it, becomes symptomatic, or SBPs>200.
Initiating medications for htn should be discussed with the patient.
# Pain: Patient with increasing pain of his shoulders and neck, receiving increasing doses of fentanyl patches without adequate relief.
Pain possibly secondary to malignancy.
No evidence of fracture on CT c-spine.
RN at PCPs office said that patient had increasing issues with confusion and falls on this higher dose and they were concerned that it was too much narcotic for him.
Pain remained reasonably well controlled.
He should also be given ibuprofen 200-400 mg Q4-6h prn for pain before being given oxycodone as his renal function tolerates.
#Cavitary Lung Mass most likely from squamous cell carcinoma - Pt with history of melanoma but the lung mass appears to be primary squamous cell lung carcinoma.
The patient has past sputum cytology with highly atypical squamous cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma which in setting of appearence on imaging and hypercalcemia is most consistent with lung cancer.
# Hypercalcemia: Patient with elevated calcium to 12.3 (corrected Ca2+=13.1) and low phos.
Patient with known lytic and blastic lesions in thoracic spine.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine increased to 1.9, up from most recent baseline of 1.2.
Likely hypovolemic secondary to poor PO intake.
The patient was briefly diuresed for his lower extremity edema which resulted in a rise in his creatinine from 1.4 to 1.6.
The patient is very volume sensitive/preload dependent likely from his diastolic dysfunction from LVH and aortic stenosis.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Patient with 2+ swelling of lower extremities.
There is likely an element of decreased oncotic pressure as well given the patient's low albumin.
Patient's BNP was 6600 and echo revealed mild LVH, MR, and AS, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was tried on two doses of IV lasix with improvement in volume status but worsened renal function.
#Hypertension, benign: Patient with history of poorly controlled hypertension on six anti-hypertensives.
No evidence of hypertension here.
Patient states he previously had SBPs in 200s without any symptoms and not on medications.
#COPD: Patient with 40 pack year smoking history and history of COPD, but no dyspnea, no wheezing.
As such, we have started ibuprofen in order to help with pain without using opiates, but the patient's renal function should be monitored carefully with NSAID use.
2) The patient also wants his pain well controlled, but is more concerned about maintaining a clear mental status  3) Pamidraonte was given here on [**6-7**] for osteolysis of his spine from his malignancy.
6) Notable labs on last check: Hct 30.1, BUN 29, Cr 1.3.
7. senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
)s PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Aspirin 325 mg daily  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Altered mental status, Afib with RVR, Acute kidney injury, Hypercalcemia, Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure  Secondary: Presumptive squamous cell lung cancer, Pain, Mild AS  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for confusion and falls.
This resolved with decrease of fentanyl dose back to your previous dose and improvement of your calcium with a drug called a bisphosphonate.
You also developed atrial fibrillation.
The priority is on maintaining a clear mental status over controlling pain for now.
