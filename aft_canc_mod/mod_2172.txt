Her pain is primarily over her upper back and neck, as well as some bilateral anterior chest pain, all of which are worsened with movement.
These symptoms have been accompanied by worsening fatigue, anorexia and decreased functional status over the past several weeks.
She denies fevers, chills, or drenching sweats.
Denies tingling, numbness, paresthesias, bowel incontinence, or urinary retention.
Neuro exam was nonfocal, and pt had no focal or midline spinal tenderness.
Labs notable for leukocytosis with left shift, anemia (hct 34) and hyponatremia (129).
U/a demonstrated pyuria, bacteriuria, and hematuria.
CTA of torso revealed obstructing bladder mass with hydronephrosis and hydroureter, lytic T6 lesions extending posteriorly into spinal canal, L3 compression fracture, and other mottled appearing cervical vertebrae concerning for metastatic disease.
Spine was consulted and recommended MRI for further characterization of vertebral lesions and spinal cord pathology.
She continues to have significant back and neck pain with movement, but feels more comfortable when she is still.

No heart sounds or breathing while listening over precordium for 1 minute.
No pulses palpated in radial pulses or carotids bilaterally.
IMAGING STUDIES: [**2172-2-12**] MR CERVICAL, THORACIC, LUMBAR SPINE W/O C - Extensive bone marrow changes of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as detailed above, representing osseous metastatic disease.
Compression fractures are identified at T3 and T6, the latter with mild retropulsion and indentation on the spinal cord.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with spinal canal stenosis.
[**2172-2-12**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US - Distended gallbladder without stones or other sign of acute cholecystitis.
Mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Severe right hydronephrosis, fully discussed on the recent CTA torso from [**2172-2-11**], likely secondary to bladder cancer.
Trace perihepatic ascites.
[**2172-2-16**] MR PELVIS W&W/O CONTRAS - Urinary catheter is noted within the bladder with thrombus identified in relation to the right ureteric orifice.
Abnormal region enhancing mass noted in the right distal ureter causing proximal right hydronephrosis and hydroureter concerning for either a transitional carcinoma of the right distal ureter versus a bladder mass invading the right ureteric orifice.
Diffuse osseous metastatic disease noted of the axial pelvic skeleton.
[**2172-2-18**] CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA - No evidence of metastatic lesions to the brain or bones.
MRI would be more accurate in identifying metastatic lesions if not contraindicated.
[**2172-2-20**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Right hydroureter and hydronephrosis, with hyperdense material distending the right renal pelvis, ureter and the bladder, compatible with hemorrhage.
The biopsied periureteral mass likely responsible for the hemorrhage is not appreciated by non contrast CT. New low-density ascites, with small hyperdense component in the cul-de-sac.
The small hyperdense component in the cul-de-sac is attributable to the blood products seen within the bladder.
Left greater than right pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with fical mid anterior/anteroseptal hypokinesis, the remaining segments are hyperdynamic and thus the overall LVEF is preserved.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 9 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2172-2-23**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema.
This is reflected by increased interstitial markings, widening of the right aspect of the mediastinum, increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette and, potentially, a small left pleural effusion.
No other abnormalities are noted.
[**2172-2-27**] CXR: The left PICC line can be seen to the level of the mid portion of left brachiocephalic vein.
Widespread parenchymal opacities and bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o woman with significant vasculopathy, seizure history, hypothyroidism, chronic UTI presenting with back pain found to be spinal mets from an obstructing periureteral mass.
Underwent transvaginal biopsy which showed urothelial carcinoma.
Hospital course complicated by perforation of the bladder and significant hematuria requiring 4 units of RBCs and transfer to MICU.
She also required emergent cystoscopy and had hypoxic respiratory distress.
Patient was transferred to the oncology floor when her respiratory distress improved with diuresis, however, returned to the ICU after IV fluid administration for hypercalcemia worsened her respiratory status.
As patient was not deemed to be a candidate for a radiation or chemotherapy for her primary cancer given her poor functional status, multiple discussions with the family, ICU/medical team and palliative care team were had and patient was made comfort measures only.
She was started on aggressive comfort measures to control her pain from osseous metastases and also to ease her breathing and died on [**2172-3-2**].
# ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient presented following her repeat cystoscopy with worsening oxygen requirement and she has acute hypoxia with 2D-Echo showing systolic dysfunction with a prior anterolateral injury and evidence of hypokinesia that likely resulted in volume overload and flash pulmonary edema.
Her initial oxygen requirement was a non-rebreather and she quickly weaned to nasal cannula.
# DELIRIUM: The patient developed delirium concerns this admission which was considered multifactoral in origin.
Her infection concerns were treated, her metabolic derangements were addressed and we felt her pain control and ICU delirium was most likely contributing.
We optimized her medication regimen, controlled her pain with Dilaudid and optimized her sleep cycles.
A CT of the torso revealed an obstructing bladder mass with mets throughout the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine.
Urology was consulted and she underwent a cystoscopy on [**2-15**] which showed an extravesicular mass, pushing into the right ureter and bladder.
She was started on continuous bladder irrigation for hematuria.
An MRI showed that the mass was actually periureteral.
On [**2-20**], her Hct dropped from 28->18 and her stomach became tense and distended.
Urology repeated her cystoscopy and noted a bladder tear which was conservatively managed with continuous bladder irrigation.
# HYPERCALCEMIA: Transient elevation in serum calcium to 10-11 range in the setting of malignancy which improved with bisphosphonate administration, calcitonin and diuretic therapy; given her volume concern issues, fluids were deferred for calcium management.
# SPINAL METS: Her back pain was initially concerning for PMR and was treated by PCP with steroids.
She was discovered on CT torso to have diffuse mets to the spine.
Palliative care was called for assistance with pain management.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine bumped on [**2-20**] from baseline 0.9 up to 1.6.
This was initially concerning for obstruction from clots in the bladder.
# HYPERTENSION: HCTZ was stopped early on in hospital stay due to electrolyte abnormalities.
Metoprolol was restarted and uptitrated for hypertension and tachycardia given her episode of flash pulmonary edema and ongoing respiratory distress.
Her 2D-Echo demonstrated cardiac dysfunction with a diastolic component which was treated with ACEI and beta-blocker therapy.
# PVD: Status post aorto-carotid and aorto-bifemoral bypasses.
It was restarted after discussion with urology team, when bleeding from her bladder perforation stabilized .
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was asymptomatic but was treated for 7 days with ceftriaxone then dicloxacillin for urine culture showing staph epi.
