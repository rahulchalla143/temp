Admission Date:  [**2166-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-5-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**] Chief Complaint: STEMI (Chest Pain)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catherization Swan Ganz Catheter Arterial line   History of Present Illness: 54F HTN, tobacco abuse, h/o pulmonary embolism, neurofibromatosis, alcohol abuse, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath from OSH following diagnosis of STEMI.
Usual state of health until the morning prior to admission, had substernal chest pain, [**7-26**], with nausea and diaphoresis.
Patient waited 2-3 hours, however, pain persisted, and so she called EMS, who brought her to [**Hospital1 487**] and was found to have ST elevations in I,II, V2-3.
LAD was stented w/ heparin coated stents X 2 and Reopro such that Plavix could be DC'd if needed in the setting of acute GI bleed.
Heparin was stopped, and no additional IIB/IIIA inhibitor given due to history of BRBPR X few days and decreased hematocrit.
No blood in toilet bowl at home, no melena or hematemesis.
Does have nausea and vomiting but able to tolerate liquids.
Past Medical History: - Neurofibromatosis - Hypertension - Pulmonary embolism [**2158**] - Malignant nerve sheath tumor (s/p removal from left anterior chest wall [**6-19**] and radiation [**2166**]) - Depression - Hypothyroidism - Pneumonia in [**2-18**] - Hypercalcemia - Alcoholism - Schizoaffective disorder   Social History: Tobacco: 1PPD Alcohol: Quit 8 years ago, but history of abuse.
CV: S1, S2, regular, no murmurs rubs or gallops.
JVD not appreciable Lungs: CTAB, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi Abdomen: Active bowel sounds, Soft, NT, ND, no rebound or guarding.
Extremities: Warm, no clubbing cyanosis or edema.
Sinus rhythm.
Ventricular ectopy with ventricular couplets.
Anterior Q waves with a late transition consistent with prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed multi vessel disease.
The LCX was without flow limiting disease but gave off an OM3 branch with 90% lesion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean PCPW of 25mmHg with a low cardiac index of 2.3 l/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Distal aortography revealed severe bilateral iliac and common femoral disease procluding the potential placement of IABP.
A rectal exam revealed gross blood.
ECHO Study Date of [**2166-3-26**] EF 25- 30% There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the antero-septum and entire distal LV including the apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, with a superimposed trivial pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 54F neurofibromatosis, HTN, hypothyroidism, recent PNA, transferred here w/ ?STEMI, revasc LAD, hypotension post intervention.
Of note, CI was never low (>3.0) and SVR was intermittently 600s-700s during episodes of hypotension (SVR increased appropriately with uptitration of pressors).
Although this was physiology consistent with sepsis or adrenal insufficiency, patient was never febrile, CXR and pan-cultures were negative, and cosyntropin stimulation yielded appropriate secretion of cortisol.
Spontaneously weaned off of dopamine on hospital day 3 without complications.
Indeed, patient became hypertensive to SBP160s, and was started easily on carvedilol and lisinopril at that point.
Intermittently, however, patient continued to have episodes of asymptomatic hypotension while sleeping at night.
* ACID BASE DISTURBANCE: When patient arrived, had AG of 14, potassium of 3.1 and ABG 7.54/18/164 suggesting a respiratory alkalosis w/ mixed gap and non gap metabolic acidemia.
This may have been due in combination to cardiogenic shock and volume repletion with saline.
RTA Type II was felt to be a possibility, and bicarb load was considered- however, this was not attempted given patient's cardiac issues and need for euvolemic status.
As patient's clinical status improved, gap continued to close and bicarb normalized, and other than hypotension early during course, patient never had any signs or symptoms localizing metabolic disturbance.
Further, cosyntropin stim revealed no adrenal insufficiency that would explain patient's condition.
Although further intervention could be pursued, given high grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and multiple nodules noted on MRI and CT at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital3 1443**], it was felt that patient would be best served with workup and thorough staging and prognostic evaluation of malignancy to further determine utility of revascularization.
* PVD: Severe iliac disease seen on cath, as correlates with patient's baseline claudication (can walk 10ft).
Again, further intervention of these lesions would depend upon patient's malignancy and prognosis.
* BRBPR: Following catheterization, patient was noted to have BRBPR and required one unit of packed red cells.
However, following this acute episode, patient had guaiac negative stools and no longer required any further transfusions.
Patient was empirically started on 100mcg levothyroxine given history of noncompliance and unclear dose to reach euthyroid level (patient intermittenly on 50-200mcg levothyroxine [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 487**] records).
* COMMUNICATION: Extensive communication with son [**Name (NI) 915**] [**Name (NI) 805**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62116**]  At the time of discharge, patient was hemodynamically stable with no further episodes of chest pain or GI bleeding.
Patient was to followup with oncologist for PET/CT evaluation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath CA.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 3894**] Health VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor Hypothyroidism Neurofibromatosis Cardiogenic shock Anorectal bleeding   Discharge Condition: Good - no further episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath.
Continued to have episodes of asymptomatic hypotension at night while sleeping.
Followup Instructions: Colonoscopy - Recommend followup colonoscopy given anorectal bright red blood to rule out malignancy as outpatient.
Hypothyroidism - Recommend repeat thyroid function tests to monitor thyroid replacement.
