However, over the past 1 week, the patient has experienced generalized left-sided weakness in association with tingling of her left hand/fingers.

She was then  transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
No history of similar symptoms.
CT then showed evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as well as a splenic abnormality.
Underwent a CT guided core biopsy of the spleen on [**2141-5-25**] consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2141-6-12**] without disease.

Incision C/D/I with staples   Pertinent Results: MRI Brain w/and w/o contrast [**2142-8-3**]: 2.9 x 3.9 x 4.8 cm heterogenous ring enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe with associated extensive vasogenic edema and mass effect over the right lateral ventricle.
A 1.1 cm midline shift to the left is noted.
This finding likely represent a metastatic lesion.
CT Head [**2142-8-3**]: IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes with right temporal craniotomy, pneumocephalus, a small amount of hemorrhage surrounding the tumor resection site, and small amount of hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle.
Postoperative changes are seen with some residual enhancement, particularly at the posterior, as well as at the anterior margin of the surgical cavity.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or significant change in the mass effect.
Postoperative changes, with residual vasogenic edema and blood products.
She was started on decadron and dilantin, and continued her home medications except for aspirin.
She was on SQH for DVT/PE prophylaxis.
On [**8-2**], patient had an MRI of brain with and without contrast which showed large right frontal temporal mass.
This showed expected post-op changes and some residual tumor as expected.
Dilantin was increased as this epsidoe could have been a seizure but she started to develop a rash and she was swicthed to Keppra.
