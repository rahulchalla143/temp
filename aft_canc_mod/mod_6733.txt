Main portal difficult to see, but appears patent with hepatopetal flow.
Hepatic cirrhosis.
Known liver mass better assessed on prior studies.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2120-3-9**] 5:32 PM IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with patchy left base opacity which could relate to atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
Loop of bowel in the left mid abdomen measures 3.5 x 3.6 cm, if this is small bowel, it is dilated.
No large air-fluid levels are seen in the bowel.
Relative high density projecting over the mid abdomen on the upright view may relate to patient's known ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 53 Cantonese speaking male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and HCC on hospice who presents with abdominal pain, expired on [**2120-3-12**].
#Goals of Care: Patient is currently on home hospice yet pursued hospitalization for abdominal pain.
Will continue aggressive management of symptoms until clarification of goals of care.
No Antibioitcs.
No invasive procedures.
# Abdominal Pain: Patient with hx of HCC and cryptogenic cirrhosis now with abdominal pain, elevated lactate, moderate transaminitis with obstructive picture and significant hyperbilirubinemia with RUQ U/S with dopplers showing on prelim read evidence of gall bladder sludge and wall edema but no biliary dilatation and patent vasculature.
Concern also for bacterial peritonitis related to the pleurex catheter despite cipro prophylaxis although unfortunately unable to obtain peritoneal fluid studies prior to administration of abx due to mechanical issues.
Other possibilities include hemorrhage or infarction of the hepatoma itself.
Patient's pain was controlled with morphine and oxycodone.
# Hyperkalemia with EKG Changes/[**Last Name (un) **]: Patient with hyperkalemia to 7.3 and Cr of 1.8 up from prior baseline of 1.1.
No prior episodes of hyperkalemia in our system.
Widened BUN/Cr ratio suggesting pre-renal etiology to [**Last Name (un) **] perhaps related to poor PO intake.
Cause of hyperkalemia unclear, [**Name (NI) **] likely not of sufficient severity to cause such a rise.
Additional chemistry findings include non-anion gap metabolic acidosis which may suggest a hypoaldosteronemic state (perhaps type IV RTA).
Patient was initially aggressively managed for hyperkalemia with insulin, glucose and calcium, kayexylate however after clarification of goals, this was stopped and lytes stopped being checked.
Patient was initially placed on a sliding scale but per patient's wishes glucose was no longer monitored.
Has positive Hep C ab but no viral loads in our system.
