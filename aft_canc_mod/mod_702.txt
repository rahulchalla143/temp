[**2187-5-11**] KUB: Supine and left lateral decubitus views of the abdomen are obtained.
The bowel gas pattern demonstrates no evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Left lateral decubitus view is limited to detect free air given that the right lateral abdominal wall is excluded, thus limiting the evaluation for air layering along the edge of the liver.
Included lung bases appear clear.
The lungs appear clear bilaterally, demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
No free air was seen below the right hemidiaphragm .
[**2187-5-11**] Chest CTA: segmental pulmonary emboli in the RML, RLL and LLL.

Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo F h/o DVT s/p IVC filter, h/o PE, transfusion-dependent MDS, recent admission (discharged [**2187-5-7**]) for mechanical fall and UTI, presents from rehab with groin pain radiating to abd and chest, found to have new PE.
# PE: For PE, patient transitioned from heparin to lovenox for new segmental emboli on CTA chest.
No indication for thrombolysis.
She was discharged on lovenox due to benefit of easier reversibility compared to Coumadin given history of difficult to control INRs and setting of fall risk.
# Hypotension: In MICU, patient given additional 2L fluids.
# Chest pain: Transient episode of atypical pain.
Ruled out for MI and remaining chest pain free since admission.
# Pyuria: Pyuria on admission without any urinary sx; no urine cx sent but did receive one dose of ceftriaxone in ED.
# Migraines: Continued precocet and zofran as patient refusing outpatient imitrex citing decreased efficacy.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for abdominal pain.
Your abdominal imaging did not show any acute findings.
However, your chest CT scan was notable for new pulmonary emboli.
Please be aware that blood thinners put you at a higher risk of bleeding especially with any trauma or fall.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness, bleeding, inability to keep food down, inability to pass gas/stool, inability to urinate, or any other concerning symptoms.
