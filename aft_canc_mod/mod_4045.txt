He was referred to the Inpatient Psychiatry Unit by his clinical nurse specialist, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3968**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**], because of increasing symptoms of psychosis.
The patient has generally been decompensating over the course of the past year since he was taken off his Clozaril due to seizures in [**2102-5-7**].
More recently, in the past one to two weeks the patient has become more confused and disorganized and has been more behaviorally destructive.
On the day he was referred to the Emergency Department he had had a number of instances of behavioral dyscontrol.
His increasing psychotic behavior is also known for his inability to obtain the necessary medical care.
Outside records indicate that he also had a suicide attempt by jumping off a bridge in the remote past.
He has been on a variety of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing agents in the past and has had at least two sessions of electroconvulsive therapy.
Stage 3 lung cancer as well as a separate Stage 1 lesion,    status post incomplete round of [**Doctor Last Name **]-Taxol and is    currently undergoing radiation therapy.
Interstitial    nephritis secondary to Lithium toxicity.
His chronic    renal failure is currently stable.
History of seizures on Clozaril.
Klonopin causes mental status changes.
The patient reports that his father died of a amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in [**2065**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Maternal grandfather with alcohol abuse, he denies a family history of mental illness or suicide.
He had no psychomotor or speech abnormalities.
His mood was "confused" with anxious affect.
He denied any auditory or visual hallucinations.
He denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations.
On metabolic panel he had an elevated creatinine of 2.9 although this is not far from baseline.
Liver function tests were all within normal limits, although he did have a lipase that was mildly elevated at 75.
He did initially sign a conditional voluntary form but due to his confusion and disorganization this is not able to be accepted.
Over the first two days of his admission he did not take any of his medications, but when asked "How can I get out of this place?," he was told if he complies with treatment and takes his medications, he will soon be well enough to leave the hospital.
At that point he did start taking his medications which included Depakote and Seroquel and seemed to be doing fairly well in the unit.
The treatment team discussed the reinitiation of Clozaril as this is really the only medication he has done well on and considering the fact that his lung cancer is likely terminal it was thought that the benefits outweighed the risks.
On [**2103-5-31**], he was sent back from radiation therapy without getting treatment, because he seemed more confused than usual and had a low blood pressure.
