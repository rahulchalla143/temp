with a recent diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer who presents with worsening back pain and LE weakness.
She has had progressive worsening of her pain over the last several weeks, as well as LE weakness, but this seems to have worsened over the last 3 days in conjuction with being incontinent x 2 in the last 2 days.
The incontinence occurred when going from sitting to standing both times (one time associated with being hugged by her grandchild) and she has not had incontinence at rest.
She has also had increased LE edema due to steroids and wonders if this has hampered her mobility and feelings of worsening weakness.
Additionally, her increasing pain is limiting her mobility and may be contributing to the subjective sense of weakness in her LE's, although she does feel that her worsened weakness is not solely due to pain.
Her pain is located in her lower back and radiates around to her groin on both sides and down her anterior thigh, right > left.
Also with sharp shooting pain into bilateral hips.
She feels more fatigued since her radiation therapy ([**Date range (1) 83909**]) and does not believe that radiation helped her pain or weakness.
In the ED her VSS except for mild tachycardia to 104.
Because the vicodin did not improve her pain and she continued to require IV medications, she was admitted for pain control.
ROS: no HA, occ blurry vision, + nasal congestion, no cough, fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, melena, loss of sensation, myalgias, arthralgias, or dysuria.
incontinence in setting of increased abdominal pressure x 2, + hesitancy.
Past Medical History: Onc history: Metastatic breast cancer - Initial symptoms of lower back pain and leg weakness.
PCP recommended PT, but chiropractor obtained spine films that were abnormal and she was referred back to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
On [**2109-11-15**] she had lumbar MRI which was significant for multiple abnormalities including infiltration of L4 resulting in a compression fracture with retropulsion of fragments and moderately severe spinal stenosis, and infiltration of T11 with associated deformity of the right lateral aspect of the spinal cord.
On [**2109-11-20**] she had a core biopsy of L4 vertebra; malignant cells consistent with metastatic breast cancer.
On [**2109-11-20**] she also had body CT significant for widespread skeletal metastases, a 3cm left breast mass, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Severe pathologic compression fracture of T2 without cord compression or significant retropulsion.
Focal areas of marrow infiltration with associated expansile soft tissue masses on the left at T6 and on the right at T11 appears similar to the outside examination.
Severe pathologic compression fracture of L4 with retropulsion and small epidural soft tissue mass result in severe canal narrowing with cauda equina compression and associated redundancy.

MRI revealed multiple compression fractures, as above.
Upon arrival to the floor, she initally had slightly decreased strength with right hip flexion.
She was started on a long-acting narcotic, with PRN morphine for breakthrough pain, with excellent effect.
At the time of discharge, orthopedic surgery is considering surgical decompression after a few more weeks pass, as her risk of wound healing complications will be lower after some time passes from radiation treatment.
# Metastatic breast cancer - Known to have bony metastases with multilevel vertebral involvement.
# Fever: She spiked a fever on the morning prior to discharge.
She did not have subjective fevers, chills, or sweats.
Her fever came down quickly with acetaminophen.
# Urinary incontinence/retention: On admission, the patient reported 2-3 episodes of urinary incontinence, all in the setting of rising from a sitting to standing position or being hugged tightly.
In the ED, she had good rectal tone and no saddle paresthesias.
One day prior to discharge, she complained of an inability to urinate freely, but did not complain of feeling as though her bladder was full.
She was eventually able to urinate without intervention, but was found to have post-void residuals of ~300 cc.
Her urinary retention was believed to possibly be secondary to her increased narcotic regimen vs neurogenic bladder.
There were no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
She was initially unable to be extubated and she was found to have a pneumonia and was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for four days.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-2 Tablets PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for Breakthrough pain.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO three times a day as needed for constipation.
