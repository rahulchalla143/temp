Admission Date:  [**2114-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-11-19**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: fall, convulsions  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and mechanical ventilation EEG lumbar puncture attempted  History of Present Illness: 82 year-old right-handed woman with a history of prior stroke and dementia who presented with alteration in consciousness.
More significantly, however, the pt's daughters noted that she became progressively more somnolent and withdrawn.
She underwent CT of the head which revealed small right subdural hematoma (8 to 9mm).
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
The pt was unable to offer a review of systems, however her daughters noted that she had no recent complaints other than headache for the past two days.
At that time, she presented with inability to speak; daughter cannot remember if there was weakness as well.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: No JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs with transmitted upper airway sounds bilaterally Cardiac: difficult to auscultate over breath sounds, but apparently RRR, and no murmur heard Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 1+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Funduscopic exam was technically limited as pt resisted eye opening, but revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
EOMI difficult to assess secondary to forceful eye closure.
Tone mildly increased in lower extremities.
No myoclonus noted.
Right subdural hematoma in the temporal parietal region.
No midline shift or significant mass effect.
Encephalomalacic change in the left MCA distribution, consistent with an area of prior infarction.
Cavernous internal carotid artery calcification bilaterally.
There is asymmetric enlargement of the left ICA at this location, suggesting aneurysmal dilatation.
[**11-8**]:  CT head without contrast: A cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is present and is a normal variant.
Again noted is right-sided subdural hematoma extending along the right convexity in the temporoparietal region which is unchanged in size or character.
There is unchanged effacement of the surrounding sulci with associated mass effect.
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
A large area of low attenuation within the left posterior frontal and temporal lobes is visualized reflecting encephalomalacic changes from prior infarction.
There is no shift in normally midline structures.
Extensive calcification of the carotid arteries in their cavernous course is present.
No abnormalities are noted within the osseous structures or soft tissues.
There is a right subdural hematoma in the temporoparietal region with mild effacement of the adjacent sulci and mild regional mass effect without shift of normally midline structures.
Encephalomalacic change in the left middle cerebral artery distribution is consistent with prior infarction.
The patient has a pacemaker overlying the left hemithorax, with leads positioned within the right atrium and ventricle.
There is a lead overlying the right hemithorax, with the tip positioned within the ventricle.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
EEG [**11-6**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of frequent epileptiform sharp and slow wave discharges seen over the left parietal temporal aregion and due to right temporal sharp and slow wave discharges seen independently and less frequently.
The first two abnormalities  suggest cortical dysfunction in the left parietal temporal region as well as right temporal cortical dysfunction.
The third abnormality suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a mild encephalopathy.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**11-12**] Upper Extremity US: PICC line in the left basilic vein with no flow seen in the basilic, but good flow in the brachial, axillary and subclavian veins on the left, and normal flow in the deep veins of the right upper extremity.
[**11-12**] Cspine CT with contrast: 0.9 x 0.7 cm left extradural mass with displacement and mild indentation on the cord at C2-3 level.
Recommend to repeat at least six hours without IV contrast to evaluate the baseline appearance and assess for contrast enhancement.
[**11-13**] Cspine CT without contrast: Small extradural mass at the level of the C2-3 vertebrae.
This likely represents a calcific tumor such as a meningioma.
The presence of an epidural hematoma, although possible, is less likely due to the focal nature of this high-density area.
Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than on the right.
Tortuous abdominal aorta with extensive atherosclerotic calcification, no evidence of aortic aneurysm.
Multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, the largest of which is most likely a cyst.
[**11-15**] Lower extremity US: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
[**11-16**]  EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage slow  background with generalized bursts of slowing and background suppression and with multifocal areas of sharp wave discharges.
The slow background and generalized phenomena suggest a widespread encephalopathy.
There were also multifocal sharp waves seen frequently.
These suggest multifocal cortical areas of dysfunction with potential epileptogenesis.
Infection is one possible cause but multifocal vascular disease is another.
There were no prolonged discharges to suggest ongoing seizures, at least during the course of this recording.
Brief Hospital Course: 82yo woman with a history of stroke and dementia who presented with alteration in consciousness, exam notable for severe encephalopathy, intact brainstem reflexes, and bilateral lower extremity hyperreflexia with clonus.
Her history is very convincing for a fall with a seizure and resulting subdural hematoma.
It is most likely that she had a seizure, either focal in her lower extremities or generalized, which caused the fall; the fall caused the subdural.
Her fever likely due to an underlying infection which may have precipitated the seizure, but she does have a source for a seizure given her prior stroke, and she has evidence for bilateral epileptiform discharges on her EEG.
Her altered consciousness was likely due to CNS injury in a patient with a previous stroke and dementia.
She was treated with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
EEG was performed and showed bilateral frequent epileptiform sharp and slow wave discharges over the left parietal temporal region and right temporal region (less commonly), but no seizures.
HSV was thought to be very low probability so the acyclovir started on admission was discontinued.
Once transferred to the floor, she had the following medical problems:  1)  Neuro:  After transfer, she did not have clinical seizures but did have impaired alertness.
A cervical spine CT was obtained, which showed a calcified mass at C2/C3 thought likely to be due to a hematoma.
No intervention was performed.
On a CXR on [**11-14**] because of some symptoms of respiratory distress, there were concerns that there was a pericardial effusion; therefore, an echo was obtained which was showed no pericardial effusion and good EF.
Patient had low grade temperatures and CXR was hazy; therefore, Flagyl was started for possible aspiration pneumonia.
She continued to have fevers with a mild leukocytosis and elevated ESR and CRP.
Because of her generalised edema, ultrasounds of her upper and lower extremities were obtained to look for DVT and found to be negative.
On [**11-19**], she started having fevers again and was recultured.
4)  FEN/GI:  Patient had multiple electrolyte disturbances during her course incluing hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatmemia.
She had an elevated BUN/Cr as well as edema in all her extremities with high input compared to output.
5)  Pulm:  There were some concerns of aspiration pneumonia that was treated with a course of Flagyl.
6)  Heme:  Patient was anemic and labs were consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
