Admission Date:  [**2143-2-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-7-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor / Zocor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Please see admission note for full details of history.
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 102143**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma, status-post resection in [**2141**], treated with chemotherapy and thoracentesis in [**11/2142**], who brain radiation in [**12/2141**], and recent admission for pneumonia in [**12/2142**] treated with levofloxacin.
She presented to the ED [**2-16**] with dyspnea and increasing home O2 requirement.
No fevers, chills, or change in chronic productive cough.
There was concern for worsening metastatic disease or PE, so she underwent a chest CT.
It was negative for a pulmonary embolism, however it did demonstrate a worsening multifocal pneumonia and worsening metastatic disease as compared to PET/CT from [**2143-1-21**].
She was transfered to the ICU for further management given her hypotension and high oxygen requirement.
Goals of care were addressed and revised to include DNR and no invasive measures.
She will be transferred to the OMED team given no desire for ICU-level aggressive measures.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: T2 N1 squamous cell lung cancer in the right lower lobe s/p resection [**2142-6-11**].
Pathology notable for a positive margin, lymphatic, and venous invasion.
[**2142-11-27**] [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] of head with concern for metastatic disease with a 5-mm enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe and a new 6 x 6 x 5 mm enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe with mild associated edema concerning for cortical or leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
[**2142-12-7**] thoracentesis to drain left pleural effusion given symptomatic cough.
No evidence of malignancy with resolution of cough but continued shortness of breath with exertion.
CXR on [**2142-12-11**] showed a persistent small left pleural effusion.
[**2142-12-18**] whole brain radiation therapy and radiation therapy to her sacral metastasis with intermittent pain requiring dilaudid, nausea and dry heaves requring compazine.
She continued to have chronic lower extremity weakness which has not changed in severity.
Of note she has had increased sacral pain and worsening nausea and dry heaves.
She also reported slight worsening of her shortness of breath.
No pleuritic chest pain.
Family History: The patient's father died of CAD as did her mother.
A sister has had multiple TIAs.
Physical Exam: Vital Signs BP 110/53, HR 76, O2 Sat 96% on NRB GENERAL: pleasant woman, appears comfortable HEENT: slopecia, pupils small but reactive, no scleral icterus NECK: supple, JVP not appreciated LUNGS: decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over left base, diffuse bronchial breath sounds over b/l lung fields CARDIAC: regular, no murmurs ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended EXTR: warm, no edema, ecchymoses over right tibia.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Persistent diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe and worsened ground-glass within the lingula are concerning for worsening multifocal infection.
Increased size of pulmonary nodules concerning for worsening metastatic disease.
[**2143-2-18**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the basal half of the inferiorseptum, inferior, and inferolateral walls.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation suggestive of papillary muscle dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-6-13**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presented with dyspnea and was found to have multifocal pneumonia.
#) Multifocal pneumonia: Likely related to underlying cancer, possibly post-obstructive.
Thus she was transferred to OMED given no desire for aggressive measures.
She was given nebulizer treatments as needed for comfort.
Because there was a question of mild volume overload, she was also given lasix 20 mg IV as needed, which seemed to help.
A foley was placed to improve comfort of urination given that she was becoming short of breath with any transfer.
She was not anticoagulated secondary to history of GI bleed.
When goals of care were revised to comfort, metoprolol PO was continued to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Prior to discharge she again developed atrial fibrillation but was not uncomfortable.
Brain metastases have responded to XRT, but worsening pulmonary disease burden.
There were no plans for further chemotherapy, as the cancer was considered end-stage.
When goals of care were revised no futher labs were drawn.
#) Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine was initially below baseline 1.1-1.2.
#) Gout: No active symptoms.
#) Code: Code status at discharge was DNR, DNI, no ICU transfers or aggressive measures, with primary goal of care being comfort.
