69 y/o F w/ a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach placement and revision [**5-/2147**], recently admitted [**Date range (1) 102694**] with sepsis presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes in from [**Hospital3 **] with increasing abdominal distension, drainage from GJ tube site and fever.
On last admission pts sputum grew out pan sensitive serratia and two strains of psudomonas.
Recent ID course: Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**].
Tobramycin was added on [**6-19**] for double coverage of resistent pseudomonas given poor lung penetration of Cipro.
On last admission, sputum grew out pan sensitive serratia and two strains of pseudomonas.
ID course as above  -Pulm TB (pan sensitive) with liver/spleen granulomas - s/p R sided vats, r supraclavic LN, liver bx + - h/o +PPD w/o tx - AFB on BAL [**2147-1-2**] - tx continuous since 2/1 per prior dc summ - Diabetes mellitus - OSA - previously on BiPAP - Cataract left eye - CVA/TIA (positive MRI)[**11-27**] - right frontal with L arm/hand hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA, hx of watershed infarcts during acute illness in the setting of acute disease - Asthma - Hypercholesterolemia - Seizure- uncertain diagnosis - L arm involuntary movements [**2144**], not on anti-seizure medications - Chronic renal insufficiency due to recurrent exposures to nephrotocxic medications/ contrast and hemodynamic instability in the context of recurrent sepsis, Creat on last discharge 2.6.
- Likely anoxic brain injury: nonverbal, withdraws to pain, eyes open; presumptively from recurrent hypotensive insults - MDS: on bone marrow biopsy with borderline transformation to AML - hx of HIT   Social History: (Per last discharge summary) Has been living in [**Hospital **] rehab getting tx for disseminated TB.
[**Name (NI) **] brother with possible lung cancer.
ABD: s/nt/nd/scarse positive bowel sounds, PEG in place with bilious secretions, erythema surrounding.
No skin mottling.
KUB [**2147-8-19**] GJ-tube is present, the tip of which is probably in the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum.
There is a non- specific bowel gas pattern.
Heterotopic bone formation is seen involving the left hip.Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine are again noted.
CXR [**2147-8-19**] No pneumothorax is identified.
A right-sided subpulmonic effusion is unchanged.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Fluid and air tracking along the GJ tube site consistent with known clinical leak.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or extraluminal contrast extravasation.
No evidence of obstruction.
Bibasilar airspace opacity is likely consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate amount of ascites and severe anasarca.
Right renal hemorrhagic cyst.
Heterotopic bone formation associated with the left proximal femur may relate to myositis ossificans related to prior trauma.
This heterotopic bone has slowly increased in size and prominence since [**2147-1-2**], at which time there was an intramuscular hematoma in this region.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo female with a history of disseminated TB, GJ tube placement after CVA with recent replacement, Serratia and Pseudomonas PNA and persistent intermittent fevers presenting with abdominal distension and fever, increased drainage from adjacent to GJ tube site and bloody secretions from trach site.
#Pseudomonas pneumonia: Chronic low grade fever intermittently on multiple hospitalizations with unclear etiology.
Recent hx of pneumonia including pseudomonas, serratia - with recent ([**2147-7-23**]) sputum culture showing strain of pseudomonas resistant to meropenem and cefepime - sensitive only to tobramycin - received treatment at that time.
Now with new fever spike to 102, increased white sputum production and cough.
Subsequent sputum culture revealed pseudomonas pneumonia with sensitivities identical to prior hospitalizations.
Mild improvement, but the day prior to death, had an aspiration event after vomiting with likely resultant aspiration pneumonitis.
#G-J tube dysfunction - Admitted with nonfunctional G-J tubes, with copious draining from site (stomach secretions).
CT scan negative for abscess or ileus.
KUB with no evidence of pneumoperitoneam.
She was reimaged on [**2147-8-24**] with increased concern for an evolving intraabdominal process given worsening abdominal distension and sepsis.
CT Scan again revealed no intra-abdominal abscess or fluid collections.
The day she expired, she again became septic following aspiration necessitating multiple fluid boluses.
[**5-30**] with hemoptysis considered likely due to obstruction of the tracheostomy tube and hemoptysis most likely related to granulation tissue or tracheal stenosis at the tracheostomy site.
However, PLT level initially bumps with repeated platelet transfusion but comes back to teens.
#DMII-Initially hypoglycemic on admission after several days without tube feeds.
Intermittently throughout stay would be tachycardic to 130s during episodes of fever, pain or profound infection.
The day of death, her heart rate advanced to 150s but we were unable to slow her rate given concern for worsening hypotension.
#MDS: Thrombocytopenia and anemia persisted throughout her hospitalization.
Prior biopsy in [**2146-11-21**] showed progression with concern of impending AML conversion.
While inpatient, peripheral blood smear analysis gave no evidence for new leukemia.
Repeat CT Scan revealed progressive lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen and thorax.
The day of expiration, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was in septic shock, likely due to progressive pseudomonas pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis.
Addendum: Note: the patient had progressive abdominal distention the evening prior to her death.
Due to patient's critical condition, no diagnostic tests to assess for intra-abdominal pathology were feasible.
