Admission Date:  [**2160-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-1-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-12-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2161-1-2**] craniotomy for tumor resection   History of Present Illness: 70 y/o M with no significant past medical history presents today to OSH after falls and dizziness for a week and a half.
He states that he has been having difficulties with balance and grasping objects with his left hand.
He also reports listing to the L when ambulating and headache [**8-31**] in the R frontal region.
He denies any n/v, visual changes, or numbness and tingling.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after head CT showed a R occipital mass.
Past Medical History: seizures s/p MVA when he was 27, has not had seizures in >30yrs.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
L peripheral visual field cut.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Spiculated right upper lobe lesion measuring up to 1.3 cm.
Multiple enlarged and necrotic lymph nodes throughout the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Small left-sided hydrocele.
Right scrotal fluid collection appears to displace the testicle and may represent a spermatocele.
Scrotal ultrasound recommended.
MRI Brain [**2161-1-2**]: There are multiple rim-enhancing masses scattered throughout the brain, most compatible with metastatic disease.
For example, a rim-enhancing mass is demonstrated within the left cerebellar hemisphere, the bilateral frontal lobes and the left parietal lobe (series 2: image 78).
The dominant mass is demonstrated within the right parieto-occipital region (series 2: image 53) measuring 3.9 x 3.5 x 3.9 cm in the AP x TRV x SI dimensions.
There is a smaller satellite nodule demonstrated immediately adjacent to the dominant mass.
The dominant mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with a low T1 signal intensity central component most compatible with necrosis.
There is associated extensive edema surrounding this lesion.
There is no significant mass effect by these multiple lesions with no shift of the normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There is no gross bony metastasis.
IMPRESSION: Multiple rim-enhancing masses scattered throughout both the supratentorial and infratentorial brain with features most compatible with metastasis.
The dominant lesion is detailed as above located within the right parieto-occipital region with associated surrounding edema.
MRI Brain [**2161-1-3**]: Status post resection of right occipital mass with blood products and postoperative changes in the region without acute infarct.
Small area of residual enhancement is seen at the lateral aspect of the blood products from surgery.
No acute infarcts or midline shift seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 70M who presented to the ER with dizziness, a Head CT revealed a R occipital mass with extensive vasogenic edema.
A WAND MRI study was obtained which revealed multiple brain lesions.
He was taken to the OR on [**2161-1-2**] for tumor resection.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
