She denies any preceding palpitations or chest pain, and denies every feeling confused.
No incontinence.
She does state that in retrospect she had some urgency with urination over the last few days but no increased frequency or dysuria.
No fevers or chills at home.
Has had a dry cough for the past few weeks, non-productive.
Head CT was not done given no focal findings.
She developed hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of high-dose IL-2 biotherapy initiation.
She was transferred to the MICU after she devloped IL-2 myocarditis and ventricular tachycardia that progressed to pulseless VT. She was resuscitation but her post arrest ECHO showed depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
Of note, she was also treated for a pansensitive Klebsiella and E.Coli UTI during that admission with Cetriaxone and then Cefpodoxime.
She has also been following with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; they discontinued her amiodarone because of transaminitis and she was started on Toprol 3 days ago and her cardiolgists are considering ICD.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was comfortable, without any pain or complaints.
Past Medical History: Metastatic RCCA -- [**2117-7-28**] revealed metastatic RCC clear cell origin -- CT showed b/l pulmonary nodules -- Right nephrectomy [**2117-9-6**] -- right forearm mass resected on [**2117-10-26**] -- left clavicle soft tissue mass HTN Parathyroid Adenoma Hyperlipidemia Anxiety Internal Hemorrhoids   Social History: Married and lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) **].
No IVDU   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: BP 101/42, 70, 16 98% 2L-> RA GEN: Well appearing, awake and alert, A+Ox3 HEENT: Small abrasion with scab over L forehead with 3 cmx3cm area of swelling.
EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, dry MM.
Throat non-erythematous, no lesions or exudate NECK: No JVD CHEST: left clavicle soft tissue mass 5cm, Right IJ CVL COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses; small well healed surgical scars EXT: No LE edema, palpable pedal pulses.
SKIN: No jaundice, no rashes, no open lesions.
Occasional scarred acne-like lesions across back.
No ecchymoses.
IMAGING: [**2118-3-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique, mild interval increase in the known largest metastatic nodule in the right lung base.
No pulmonary embolism.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2118-3-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Slight increase in size of small right-sided pleural effusion with new consolidation at the base of the right lower lobe which could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented after a pre-syncopal event and hypotension in ED.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: # Hypotension: Initially thought to be urosepsis and exacerbated by recent initiation of B-blocker.
Of note, other possible explanations could be adrenal tumor invasion knowing metastatic RCC, but recent CT of Ab/Pelvis did not show any evidence of this and patient had a normal cortisol.
It is likely that her hypotension was in the setting of her initiation of metoprolol succinate 25mg PO Daily.
SHe was sent home on no medications for her underlying heart arrhythmias and will follow up in the outpatient setting for further management.
# CHF w/ hx VT: Patient developed O2 requirement in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in the context of fluid resuscitation.
# Pre-syncope: Likely due to hypotension given her history of pre-syncopal symptoms.
# Hx head trauma during syncope: The patient had a non focal neurological exam on admission, with no headache.
No imaging performed.
# Anemia: HCT dropped slightly after IVF administration but was stable.
Workup on last admission consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Transaminitis: LFTs elevated but trending down from prior.
# Hypoalbuminemia: Chronic, likely due to RCC.
Ambien 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.

Secondary Diagnosis: Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted after fainting and we found that you had very low blood pressure.
We think this was due to your heart failure and the administration of your metoprolol.
We also did an echo while you were here that showed that you continue to have heart failure.
While on the floor you had a fever and were found to have pneumonia.
