Admission Date:  [**2150-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-9-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: 1.
Small bowel obstruction 2.
Duodenal mass, metastatic breast cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2150-8-28**]: Biopsy of metastatic nodules and gastrojejunostomy.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 64-years-old woman with a history of breast cancer (metastatic to bone) who presented to an outside hospital on [**7-31**] with nausea, vomiting and 24 lb weight loss over the preceding 2 weeks (constant since prior admission for same).
She was found to have hypokalemia and acute on chronic renal failure.
She then developed a 7 second episode of Torsades shortly after admission on [**2150-8-1**] with spontaneous conversion, thought to be due to electrolyte abnormalities (Cr 3.1, K 2.5).
Neuro notes report that they think the seizure was due to acute metabolic encephalopathy due to acute illness.
She was stabilized and called out to the medical floor, but her persistent vomiting, inability to tolerate PO and abdominal discomfort continued.
It was a poor study and showed contrast remaining in stomach and duodenum c/w SBO.
EGD could not be passed beyond D3 due to a possible extrinsic mass, even with pedi scope.
At that point, reportedly, review of her CT suggested possible uncinate mass (per our GI team discussion with OSH GI team - I do not see this documented in OSH records however).
Past Medical History: CAD (3 vessel disease per cath [**2145**]) dCHF with preserved EF Diabetes type two complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, gastroparesis, started on insulin 1 month ago hypertension Metastatic breast CA - treated with surgery, chemo, radiation htn hyperlipidemia ?stage 3 ckd   Social History: Has 5 children; son is HCP, daughter is RN.
Family History: no history of GI malignancy  Physical Exam: Gen: obese, fatigued, ill appearing woman in bed, nad VS: 99.2, 154/72, 82, 18 97% RA HEENT: MM dry, EOMI, CV: RRR.
[**1-24**] blowing systolic murmur Pulm: clear but diminished at bases.
+ epigastric tenderness.
no palpable mass though exam limited by obesity EXT: warm.
[**11-22**]+ pitting edema b/l LE.
Pertinent Results: [**2150-9-6**]: CBC WBC-8.3 Hgb-8.9 Hct-27.1 Plt Ct-209  [**2150-9-7**] Chem: Glucose-39 UreaN-33 Creat-1.9 Na-140 K-3.9 Cl-109 HCO3-21 AnGap-14  [**2150-9-4**] LFTs: ALT-33 AST-48 AlkPhos-1019 TotBili-1.6  MRI Abdomen [**2150-8-16**]: Inadequately characterized 2 x 4 cm ill-defined mass involving the junction of second and third part of duodenum with mass effect on the pancreatic head and compression of the duodenal lumen resulting in mild upstream gastric distention.
This lesion may represent an intrinsic duodenal intramural mass, or extramural lesion.
While this lesion may possibly arise from the pancreatic head, this is considered less likely given the morphology of the lesion and apparent mass effect on the pancreatic head.
CT HEAD [**2150-8-28**]: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo woman with history of breast cancer - metastatic to bone, who presented to [**Hospital6 **] [**7-31**] with ARF and hypokalemia, course complicated by brief self limited episode of Torsades as well as seizure, now stabilized but with likely new pancreatic mass leading to duodenal obstruction and inability to take PO.
Oncw stable, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of duodenal obstruction.
Patient was admitted on [**2150-8-14**] for treatment of duodenal obstruction.
NG tube was placed with relief of abdominal pain and nausea.
Communications with patient's oncologist revealed poor prognosis from breast cancer.
Patient was given nutritional support with IVF and TPN and optimized medically through pulmonary toilet (nebs, oxygen, chest PT) and balanced with lasix diuresis for CHF and IV hydration for acute renal failure, in preparation for surgical intervention.
Patient underwent biopsy of metastatic nodules and gastrojejunostomy on [**2150-8-28**] without complications.
In PACU, patient found to be unresponsive and was reintubated for altered mental status.
CT head was negative for intracranial pathology and patient slowly regained neurological function spontaneously.
She was admitted overnight for observationa and successfully extubated on [**2150-8-29**] (POD1) without difficulty.
She had no residual neurological deficits and episode was attributed to anesthetic reaction.
Patient had episodes of emesis on POD#4 and POD#5 and was started on reglan with good effect.
LFTs increased mildly postop and TPN was held until they trended down, then restarted on POD#5.
Pathology revealed metastatic breast cancer in duodenum.
ID: Patient developed a wound infection of superior [**11-23**] of abdominal incision on POD#8.
Patient was afebrile throughout this period with normal WBC count.
CV: Patient's CHF was managed throughout preop and postop period with lasix diuresis and IV metoprolol.
Lasix was held several times due to increase in Cr (Max 2.4) but was resumed when ARF resolved.
Cardiology was consulted preop for perioperative recommendations.
Echo was done on [**8-25**] and demonstarted mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF= 45 %) consistent with coronary artery disease.
Renal: Patient's CRF was complicated with several instances of increased Cr with max 2.4.
Renal failure was pre-renal according to FNA and was treated with IV hydration balanced with lasix diuresis.
Endocrine: Patient's diabetes was managed with RISS throughout stay.
At the time of discharge on POD#10 to rehab, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Duodenal obstruction secondary to metastatic breast cancer.
Congestive heart failure, systolic 3.
Chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
