Admission Date:  [**2169-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-6-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, altered mental status   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - ERCP - Placement of PICC line  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a pleasant 83 year old female, followed by biliary service at [**Hospital1 18**] for biliary obstruction status-post stenting for likely malignancy, though not biopsy proven, as well as a history of cholangitis.
There, she was noted to have a white blood cell count of 26 with bands, a total bilirubin of 2.4, no acute chest process on chest x-ray, and a mildly positive urine analysis with 1+ LE.
She was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl over concern of cholangitis.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abdominal ultrasound was completed, which demonstrated no change in known intrahepatic dilatation, two common bile duct stents in place, and no obvious abscesses.
She was noted to be rigoring and was somnolent but somewhat arousable.
Of note, patient had recent admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for polymicrobial sepsis in setting of biliary stent obstruction due to tumor.
Her course was complicated by afib with RVR, DVT and liver abscesses not amenable to drainage.
Now with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
-Diabetes mellitus, type 2 -Hypertension -Coronary artery disease -Parkinson's disease -diastolic CHF -Vaginal Carcinoma -s/p Cholecystectomy -Urosepsis d/t E. coli and Proteus -Bacteremia due to VRE in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of Linezolid -Bacteremia due to E. coli in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of Ceftriaxone.
-Atrial fibrillation -Hyperlipidemia   Social History: She lives with husband in [**Name (NI) 3320**], and has no children.
Dependent for ADLs--has VNA and husband cares for her, no tobacco or drugs, occassional alcohol.
HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, OP clear Neck: No JVP Car: Tachycardic, irregular, no murmurs appreciated Resp: course BS bilaterally transmitted from O2.
Abd: soft, +BS, ND, unclear if tenderness pain in [**Name (NI) 25714**] - pt opens eyes wide.
Ext: strong distal pulses, bilateral edema Neuro: somnolent, unable to participate in neuro exam.
Skin: No rashes or lesions noted  Pertinent Results: Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: 1.
No significant interval change in intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, most severe within the left lobe.
Echogenic material within both common bile duct stents is nonspecific, and could represent debris, but tumor involvement is not excluded.
1.1-cm pancreatic mid body lesion, stable from the prior studies.
No new hepatic abscess identified.
Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Patchy opacity within the retrocardiac region is felt to represent atelectasis and/or scarring.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] is an 83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholantitis presenting with fever, altered mental status concerning for ascending cholangitis.
Sepsis: Pt presented with altered mental status, fevers, tachycardia and leukocytosis.
Symptoms were presumed to be due to cholangitis and obstruction of known biliary stent, given elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and elevated liver function tests.
There were no other clear sources of infection on admission.
A RUQ ultrasound showed no change in biliary dilitation but ERCP showed sludge and stones obstructing the stent which were successfully cleared out.
Pt was initially empirically treated linezolid, ceftriaxone and flagyl given prior h/o VRE and resistent bacteria, and transitioned to only high dose ceftriaxone once blood cultures grew Klebsiella.
She was also treated with IVF boluses via PICC and did not require a CVL or pressors.
The infectious disease team helped guide appropriate antibiotic choice: as she did not have evidence of active hepatic abscesses on abdominal CT, a 2 week course was deemed sufficient (last day [**3-28**]).
Coagulopathy: On presentation pt's INR was 8, likely in setting of poor hepatic clearance of coumadin.
She had no signs of active bleeding.
Coronary artery disease: Patient's last echo was in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2169**], which demonstrated an EF of >55%, normal systolic function, mild MR. She was continued on her home statin, while her home anti-hypertensives were initially held in the setting of concern of hypotension while septic.
This was not restarted due to ongoing discussions about goals of care.
Metoprolol was restarted and titrated up to 50mg tid given episodes of afib with RVR in the ICU.
Metoprolol was added back as above and lisinopril and HCTZ were added and titrated up after she became hypertensive on the floor.
Concern for aspiration/goals of care: the patient failed a video speech and swallow study after being called out of the ICU.
Goals of care should continue to be discussed at rehab and any concern for aspiration should be discussed with the patient and husband before she is sent to the hospital in the event that she does aspirate, to see if they may decide not to hospitalize her in that situation.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 169**] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: biliary obstruction, bacteremia Secondary: likely cholangiocarcinoma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus Type 2, coronary artery disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic diastolic CHF   Discharge Condition: good, stable, at baseline mental status, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated for fevers and lethargy and improved after ERCP.
You are being treated for a bloodstream infection and will continue IV antibiotics for a few more days.
If you have fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, episodes of loss of consciousness, or any other concerning symptoms, have the doctors at rehab [**Name5 (PTitle) 4656**] you.
