Known liver metastases.
Admitted from [**11-23**] to [**2153-11-28**] for ascending cholangitis.
History of ascending cholangitis; status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent on [**2153-11-26**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive family history of gastric cancer.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with a regular rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Very tender focally to palpation of the epigastric region.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Blood cultures revealed no growth.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased liver metastases, increased pancreatic head mass, old dilated pancreatic duct with stent to pancreatic duct in place, left liver pneumobilia (old).
New splenic masses; question of metastatic disease.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a history of advanced pancreatic cancer with known liver metastases - on Xeloda with known progression of disease.
The patient was admitted with fevers, chills, and increased abdominal pain following stent intervention; likely ascending cholangitis.
CHOLANGITIS ISSUES:  The patient admitted with fevers, chills, and right upper quadrant pain with a recent history of admission for ascending cholangitis; likely again an infectious process within the liver as the patient immediately started on ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl with a plan for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the morning.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted with no epigastric output obstruction secondary to the tumor.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient developed a gastrointestinal bleed following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; during which endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was prematurely held secondary to gastric outlet obstruction and inability to pass the scope with a notation made of oozing and bleeding at the obstruction site.
The patient then passed multiple bloody bowel movements.
The patient also received vitamin K for a supratherapeutic INR.
PANCREATIC CANCER ISSUES:  The patient previously on Xeloda.
DUODENAL OBSTRUCTION ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have gastric outlet obstruction on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography soon after admission.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (STATUS POST PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY) ISSUES:  Initially, the patient's Procardia was held secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed.
Metastatic pancreatic cancer.
