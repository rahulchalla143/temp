#ACUTE METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: Pt was initially found unresponsive by EMS with  pinpoint pupils, garbled speech and hypotensive.
Concern that this was due to possible opioid overdose given clinical improvement with narcan in the ED, however improvement was not immediate (took over an hour post narcan administration) and pt did not exhibit withdrawal symptoms after narcan.
Pt does have history of seizures and it is possible that she had a seizure and AMS was a post ictal state.
Most likely explanation is polypharmacy in the setting of ESRD.
EKG: SR at 78, NA/NI, TWI in III and aVF, TWI V1-V5, and CE were flat, repeat ekg was normal and repeat CE unchanged.
CXR, CT Head and CT abdomen showed no acute pathology.
#RENAL FAILURE/CKD V: Pt's BUN:Cr were extremely elevated on admission as would be expected for someone that missed dialysis the prior day.
#CHRONIC BACK/LEG PAIN: chronic back pain for years with multiple back surgeries.
Pt's pain and use of pain medications likely is contributing to her AMS.
Given that you are on dialysis, many of these medications can build up in your blood and cause confusion or oversedation.
Don't take clonazepam, trazodone or hydromorphone.
