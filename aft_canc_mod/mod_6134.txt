Admission Date:  [**2119-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-10-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-8-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12131**] Chief Complaint: Right leg weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - OPERATIONS: 1.
History of Present Illness: This is a 75 year old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to multiple ribs and lungs with associated pleural effusions s/p Genentech study drug who presents with right leg weakness, urinary retention, and constipation over the past several days.
Over the past few days, due to increasing weakness in his right leg, he has had difficulty with walking.
He has also described urinary retention over the past three months.
Otherwise, he denies any other extremity weakness, with no numbness or tingling.
Back pain is minimal at rest, although coughing does make it worse.
He recently had a pleurex catheter in place for pleural effusion during last admission.
An MRI was performed on day of admission which reveals multiple spinal mets with significant collapse of the T5 vertebral body with epidural extension and marked canal narrowing with cord impingement at this level.
The other areas of metastases are not associated with cord compression.
For the MRI, the patient was intubated for claustrophobia and anxiety treatment - he was immediately extubated thereafter without need for supplemental O2.
At time of transfer to floor, the patient was comfortable with no pain, but continued symptoms as described above.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -- On [**2117-7-22**], MRI revealed a 3.2 cm solid exophytic lesion arising from the lower pole of left kidney suspicious for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and a 1.6 cm solid lesion in the anterior left pole of the left kidney and a 2.4 cm lesion in the mid pole of the right kidney, both of which concerning for tumor cell carcinoma, papillary type.
-- On [**2118-1-13**], he underwent repeat MRI, which showed no significant change and bilaterally no masses.
-- On [**2118-9-28**], he underwent repeat MRI, which revealed significant interval increase in the lower pole of the left kidney obstructing mass, now measuring 4.9 x 3 cm from 3.1 x 2.7 cm and development of nodules in the perinephric fat, consistent with extrarenal spread suspicious for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and there were also two other lesions that were minimally increased in size.
On [**2118-11-15**], he underwent laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy, which revealed a 4.6 cm clear cell carcinoma and a 2.8 cm papillary renal cell carcinoma, grade 3 tumors with tumor extension into the perinephric tissue (T3a N0), 0/11.
Of note, the clear cell renal cell carcinoma shows no areas of signaling, no definitive sarcomatoid differentiation.
Renal cell carcinoma is diffusely positive CA9, negative for CK7 and patchy positivity for P504s.
The papillary renal cell carcinoma is again diffusely positive for CK7 and P504s and focally positive for CA9.
Packs two shows focal weak staining for both tumors with no after lymphovascular invasion as identified on CT31 staining.
-- on [**2118-11-16**] Splenectomy  showed vascular congestion with subcapsular hematoma.
-- On [**2118-1-29**], the lesion in the pole of the right kidney most consistent with papillary renal cell carcinoma is unchanged, and fluid collection consistent with pseudocyst of one of the pancreas is noted.
Specimen one in the belt of the cyst adjacent to the tumor, right margin with papillary carcinoma cauterized.
--On [**2119-4-15**], post-nephrectomy period complicated by fever and treated for  pneumonia.
He was noted to have a low O2 and underwent a chest x-ray, which noted a 5 cm elliptical opacity in the left upper hemi collapse with apparent adjacent local destruction, new since [**18**]/[**2118**].
--On [**2119-4-17**], CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a 5.1 x 2.2 soft tissue density lesion with destruction of the third posterior lateral rib, fluid collection in the right partial nephrectomy bed with a seroma.
Coronary and aortic valve calcifications, enlarged pulmonary artery, right lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
--On [**2119-10-1**] admitted for pleural effusion which was tapped by IP.

The largest of these lesions is at T5 where there is collapse of the vertebral body, to a considerably greater extent than present on the [**9-26**] CT scan.
There is extensive soft tissue extending from the posterior vertebral body into the spinal canal producing severe spinal cord compression at T5.
There is no evidence of cord or cauda equina compromise at the other metastatic levels.
At the level of most severe spinal compression, there is hyperintensity in the spinal cord on the long TR images, presumably edema related to severe compression.
No intradural tumor is identified.
Again noted are multiple other metastases in the chest wall, incompletely evaluated on this examination.
CONCLUSION:  Multiple spinal vertebral metastases with collapse of the T5 vertebral body and a soft tissue extending into the canal at this level producing severe spinal cord compression.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 54864**] is a 75M with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with known malignant right sided pleural effusion s/p recent drainage who presented with several days of right sided leg weakness, urinary retention for several weeks/months and constipation, with radiographic evidence of cord compression at the level of T5 as above.
1) Cord compression - Upon admission, Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 82581**] [**Last Name (Titles) 23156**] clinical signs of cord compression, including right leg paralysis and radiographic evidence of T8 cord invasion.
2) Pleural Effusion - Patient was recently discharged after drainage of a recurrent malignant right pleural effusion and placement of Pleurx catheter.
3) Hyponatremia - Stable sodium at 132 upon admission.
4) Hypercalcemia - Calcium at admission 10.4.
Previous admissions with suspicion of etiology secondary to combination of bony metastases and paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, though no definitive work-up for PTHrP performed.
4) Leukocytosis - Patient with persistent leukocytosis of several years - attributed on previous admissions to be secondary to his renal cell carcinoma.
5) Thrombocytosis - Patient's thrombocytosis attributed to previous splenectomy/hyposplenism.
6) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - Had been receiving Genetech study drug, but discontinued on recent admission secondary to dyspnea and progressive disease.
CHRONIC ISSUES: 7) Hyperlipidemia - continued simvastatin.
8) Hypertension - continued metoprolol.
