History of Present Illness:  86 yo male with mantle cell lymphoma (last chemo tx [**6-4**]), malignant bilateral pleural effusion with b/l indwelling pleurex catheters, afib and CAD who presented to the ED after a mechanical fall on [**6-22**].
The patient was able to recall the events before and after the event and did not loose consciousness or continance of bowel or bladder.
The patient suspects his fall was due to his weak right knee.
He denies loss of consciousness, CP or dizziness surrounding the event.
Pt did report chronic difficulty breathing and cough which are attributed to his pleural effusions.
He had a plain film of the hip which showed an intertrochanteric femoral fracture.
In the OR, patient was intubated and underwent general anesthesia, he became hypotensive to the 90?????
Post operatively, anesthesia was unable to wean the phenylephrine and he was admitted to the MICU.

(possibly due to poor lead placement)  Normal axis.
Low voltage study.
MICRO/PATH none  IMAGING CXR ([**6-23**]): FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular redistribution with small bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased compared to prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo male with mantle cell lymphoma, afib and CAD who presented with a mechanical fall requiring surgical repair.
He denied dizziness etc at that time.
Although he is known to have a SBP baseline from 90-100, we ruled out cardiogenic causes (negative cardiac enzymes and CXR), infectious etiologies (cultures negative, clinical signs absent) and hypovolemia due to blood loss (Hct stable).
Patient had episodes of hypotension at times triggered by draining his bilateral pleurex catheters.
#Pleural effusions: Pt has recurrent pleural effusions, etiology likely malignant vs effusion secondary to obstructive lymphadenopathy.
We continued drainage daily for comfort and gave fluid boluses PRN and montiored respiratory status.
#Thrombocytopenia: Pt noted to have low PLT since admission.
Aspirin was held, no signs of overt bleeding developed.
#Anemia:  Likely due to anemia of chronic disease with dilutional component, Hct remained stable throughout admission.
# CAD: Patient is s/p stent placement in [**2147**], low suspicion for acute ischemia.
Held ASA for thrombocytopenia  #Hypothyroidism: Patient remained clinically stable on Levothyroxine 112mcg po daily  #Oropharyngeal candidiasis-resolved:  Pt presented to oncologist 2 weeks ago with oral thrush, no longer showing showing clinical signs at this time.
Hospice made arrangements for home visits and patient was discharged in stable condition with poor prognosis.
