The patient has been followed longitudinally in the brain tumor clinics for a recently-diagnosed skull base lesion.
The patient had shown progressive neurological deterioration of her vision, and was, therefore, felt to be a candidate for surgical decompression albeit the degree of compression of the optic nerve from the diagnosed lesion remained unclear.
Past Medical History: MENINGIOMA, HYSTERECTOMY [**2101**], GLAUCOMA, INSOMNIA, DEPRESSION ASTHMA  Social History: non-contributory  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Discharge: AOx3, with a left [**Year (4 digits) **] field deficit, that is unchanged from pre-op.
No pronator drift.
Incision is clean, dry, and intact, without erythema, or drainage.
Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2120-6-26**] 01:12PM BLOOD WBC-11.8* RBC-4.04* Hgb-12.2 Hct-35.4* MCV-88 MCH-30.1 MCHC-34.3 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-334 [**2120-6-26**] 01:12PM BLOOD PT-12.6 PTT-25.0 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2120-6-26**] 01:12PM BLOOD Glucose-179* UreaN-16 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-3.8 Cl-102 HCO3-24 AnGap-15 [**2120-6-26**] 01:12PM BLOOD Calcium-8.3* Phos-2.3* Mg-2.2  IMAGING: MRI (Head)[**2120-6-27**](post-resection): FINDINGS: A comprehensive evaluation of the brain was not performed with this study, which was targeted for pre-operative planning.
There is a homogeneously enhancing extra-axial lesion arising from the left paramedian planum sphenoidale, medial to the pre-chiasmatic segment of the left optic nerve, unchanged since the previous study.
It measures 6 mm AP x 5 mm transverse x 3 mm craniocaudad.
There is no evidence of optic nerve displacement, although high-resolution imaging of the suprasellar region was not performed.
There is an ill-defined subcentimeter enhancing lesion in the left centrum semiovale, unchanged dating back to [**2119-6-20**] (series 5, image 19, and series 4, image 22).
Based on its signal characteristics on previous complete head MRIs, it may represent a vascular malformation such as a capillary telangiectasia.
Small extra-axial mass arising from the left paramedian centrum semiovale is again demonstrated for pre-operative planning.
Unchanged ill-defined contrast-enhancing lesion in the left centrum semiovale, most likely representing a vascular malformation such as a capillary telangiectasia.
The presence of hyperdense material in this region is concerning for pituitary hemorrhage.
No other areas concerning for acute hemorrhage are present.
Patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with a small volume right and moderate volume left frontal pneumocephalus and possible packing material along the left frontal convexity, causing mild degree of sulcal and gyral effacement.
There is no shift of normally-midline structures.
Ventricles and sulci appear unchanged in size or configuration compared to pre-operative MRI examination.
There are no foci concerning for acute territorial ischemia.
Surgical staples are noted along the left frontotemporal scalp with underlying subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues, not unexpected post-surgical finding.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid and ethmoid air cells are well aerated.
Hyperdensity in the sella in the region of the pituitary gland, concerning for pituitary hemorrhage.
No other findings concerning for acute hemorrhage are present.
Bifrontal pneumocephalus, left greater than right.
Left frontal pneumocephalus causes mild sulcal and gyral effacement.
There is no shift of midline structures and no herniation.
Left frontal craniectomy with overlying subcutaneous gas in the soft tissue.
She had no complications in the OR and went to the ICU post-operatively.
The following day the patient had nausea and vomiting as well as a severe headache.
Her post-op MRI showed no infarction and the resection appeared to be complete.
On [**6-28**] the patient had some drainage from the incision so there were staples added to the wound closure.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain .
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-26**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
