Pulmonary: Per the previous discharge summary the patient had an aspiration pneumonia.
The patient continues to show evidence of bilateral lower lobe processes on chest x-ray and had physical findings in those areas as well suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
On [**10-31**] the patient had a low grade fever.
Chest x-ray was rechecked, which showed the possibility of another aspiration event mostly seen in the right lower lobe.
He was continued on the Levo and Flagyl to cover what was thought to be a recurrent aspiration event.
