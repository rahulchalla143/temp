Admission Date:  [**2190-1-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: Cough, hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial Drain Angioseal to Right Ventricle s/p pericardial drain insertion into right ventricle Embolisation of right bronchial artery Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: This is a 71 year old woman with a 10 year history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung who is transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for care for a pericardial effusion as well as for potential treatment of hemoptysis.
She initially presented to the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED with increasing hemoptysis.
Per the ED note she reported having coughed up a large amount of blood 1.5 months prior to presentation, and then 4 days prior the bleeding increased again.
She also was having chest pain with coughing (and only with coughing), described by the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED report as intermittent and sharp and associated with shortness of breath.
She had a chest x-ray there and per report had a dense opacity in the right upper lobe with moderate airspace opacity in the right lower lobe with loss of lung volume; as well as mild mediastinal shift to the right and decreased aeration of the right lung.
Nonetheless, a review of systems suggested that hemoptysis and pain with coughing have been the most troubling symptoms; there has been no fever, chills, or sweats; she has had some white sputum when it is not bloody, but no other color of sputum; she denies troubling palpations although she says her heart beats much faster with exertion; she occasionally has chest tightness but distinct chest tightness or pain is not a prominent symptom; she does not have pain elsewhere.
Hypertension Anxiety Reflux Colonic polyps, partially removed   Social History: The patient grew up in mainland [**Country 651**] and then raised her children in [**Location (un) 6847**].
No tobacco or asbestos exposure.
Pulsus [**1-10**] GEN: Elderly woman in no acute distress, occasional paroxysms of coughing HEENT: Dry mucus membranes; clear OP; PERRL.
Left side: bronchial and rhonchorous low-pitched breathing sounds.
STUDIES: [**1-7**] ECHO Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of pericardial tamponade.
The heart is moving around within the effusion with the result that the minimal amount of fluid anteriorly can be as little as 0.7cm.
[**1-9**] ECHO Small organized pericardial effusion, without echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology .
[**1-11**] ECHO: There is a very small, primarily inferolateral echogenic pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 22 mm Hg.
This is consistent with tamponade physiology.
Following the drainage of 350 ml of sanguinous fluid, Pericardial pressure became neagtive with respiration.
However, after draining 60-100 ml of fluid, the patient became hypotensive, and contrast injection through the catheter revealed opacification of the pulmonary artery, suggesting entry into the RA.
Pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Intercostal artery inferior to the right bronchus and artery was identified, which was also supplying the tumor activity.
If the patient's hemoptysis does not stop, selective embolization of this intercostal artery can be offered.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old woman with non-small cell lung CA who presents with complaints of hemoptysis, ongoing cough, transferred from OSH with diagnosis of pericardial tamponade.
PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE Repeat ECHO revealed RV collapse and signs of pericardial tamponade.
During procedure patient went into SVT/Atrial fibrillation and was placed on an amiodarone drip.
Given subsequent hemodynamic compromise with atrial fibrillation in MICU, patient was maintained on amiodarone drip for 24 hours and converted to oral amiodarone.
Patient did not have significant bleeding post procedure into her pericardial drain.
Repeat ECHO on 12.13 and then 12.15 revealed evidence of small clot in pericardium without significant reaccumulation of fluid.
She had persistent atrial fibrillation to 120, rarely as high as 160 for brief periods of time.
HEMOPTYSIS Patient's submassive hemoptysis was treated with IR embolization of right bronchial artery for palliation of symptoms.
Flexible bronchoscopy on [**2190-1-11**] revealed tumor erosion of bronchi with near complete compression of the right bronchus intermedius.
LUNG CANCER Patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Patient was also given levofloxacin for empiric treatment of pneumonia given patient has new oxygen requirement and lung opacification with known bronchus compression.
Her oxygen requirement is also likely in part due to tumor progression and compression of right bronchus intermedius.
POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURES: Patient grew 3 different colonies of coag neg staph and a clostridium species on initial blood cultures.
Ultimately the patient's positive blood cultures were felt most likely consistent with contamination.
She was discharged on levofloxacin monotherapy for treatment of likely pneumonia as above.
She did have relative hypotension during the beginning of her hospitalization, requiring no antihypertensives to maintain good blood pressure control.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Pulse dose for portability.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Hemoptysis Pericardial tamponade  Metastatic lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with blood in the sputum.
You underwent several procedures to try to prevent further bleeding.
Complete a course of the antibiotic levofloxacin for 10 total days to treat a possible infection in your lungs.
Call your home hospice nurse for any new or concerning symptoms that you would like [**Location (un) **] with.
