Formal echo performed by cardiology: pericardial effusion (new, small, no tamponade physiology).
Troponin neg x1, EKG with no ST depressions or TWI, showed sinus tachycardia.
Reportedly, she does have a history of chronic tachycardia in the 120s, possibly from underlying malignancy.

Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: -presented with back & right sided flank pain & was found to have lung nodules on CXR, prompting chest CT that showed a LLL nodule and mediastinal & hilar lymphadenopathy.
Thoracic spine MRI showed expansile T9 lesion c/w metastatic disease.s/p palliative radiation to T7-11 spine & right ilium through [**2143-7-29**].
She underwent Brain MRI [**2143-7-30**] which was (-) for metastatic disease.
Esophageal nodule bx showed squamous cell CA.
Never required steroids -GERD -COPD -Esophageal stricture-dilation c/b tear requiring left thoracotomy and repair: [**2-/2141**], pt had dysphagia, which was further evaluated with EGD, which demonstrated patchy mild erythema in the duodenal bulb and in the 2nd part of the duodenum.
A mild Schatzi ring was found in the GE junction.
Dilation of the esophagus was attempted and complicated by acute perforation of distal esophagus, resulting in need for thoracic surgery for repair.
Pt with white plaques in posterior pharynx, hard palate, tongue, consistent with thrush Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: decreased breath sounds in bases, L>R, no crackles, no rhonchi CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, JVP 7 Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: LABS: On admission: [**2144-2-6**] 08:00AM BLOOD WBC-12.0* RBC-3.86* Hgb-11.1* Hct-34.9* MCV-90 MCH-28.7 MCHC-31.7 RDW-15.8* Plt Ct-174 [**2144-2-6**] 08:00AM BLOOD Neuts-88.6* Lymphs-6.3* Monos-2.7 Eos-2.1 Baso-0.2 [**2144-2-6**] 08:00AM BLOOD PT-11.5 PTT-26.6 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2144-2-6**] 08:00AM BLOOD Glucose-110* UreaN-8 Creat-0.4 Na-134 K-3.6 Cl-99 HCO3-23 AnGap-16 [**2144-2-6**] 08:18PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-16* [**2144-2-6**] 08:00AM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2144-2-6**] 08:18PM BLOOD CK-MB-2 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2144-2-6**] 08:00AM BLOOD TSH-1.5 [**2144-2-6**] 08:59AM BLOOD Lactate-1.9 .
There is a very small to small, circumferential pericardial effusion measuring up to 1 centimeter in greatest dimension.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Very small to small, circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
[**2-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion and worsening left basilar consolidation, the latter concerning for pneumonia.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, as questioned clinically.
Extensive mediastinal adenopathy and confluent hilar soft tissue have enlarged, as has a large soft tissue mass invading the esophagus in its mid portion, obliterating the lumen.
It is unclear if this represents metastatic disease or primary esophageal neoplasm and correlation with pathology is recommended.
Extensive perihilar and paramediastinal consolidation, which has progressed substantially from [**2143-11-9**] but is essentially unchanged from [**2144-1-18**].
More likely differential considerations include developing radiation pneumonitis, as suggested by the paramediastinal distribution, or alternatively direct extension of hilar metastases.
New occlusion of the left lower lobe bronchus, with persistent significant left lower lobe collapse.
Narrowing multiple pulmonary veins, with a focal filling defect compatible with thrombus, bland or tumor, in a branch of the left superior pulmonary vein.
Little change of bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions.
Redemonstration of apical-predominant emphysema with bullous change.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Although frank cardiac tamponade is not present, the findings of tachycardia, brief right atrial diastolic invagination, and small ventricles warrant close clinical and echocardiographic followup.
[**2-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Since [**2144-2-6**], moderate left pleural effusion which is partially loculated and left basilar consolidation is unchanged, right infrahilar consolidation and presumed small right pleural effusions have worsened.

# Dyspnea:  Etiology most likely from worsening of known pulmonary disease NSCLC and  COPD, and also lobar collapse from extrinsic compression or mucous plugging.
There was a question of post-obstructive pneumonia on CT from enlarging lung mass compressing left lower lobe bronchus.
ACS ruled out with no EKG changes and neg trop.
Small pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology on echo.
Patient was trasnferred to the floor after 2nd day of hospitalization, primary Oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by [**Name (NI) 153**] team, updated on patient's hospitalization who advised that patient should be moved towards palliation given extent of tumor burden and lack of options chemo/radiation.
Patient initialy with dry cough improved with codeine syrup, she was offered lidocaine inhaled but chose not to take as she did not want to have numbing in her throat.
# Sinus tachcyardia: Pt reportedly has baseline sinus tachy in 120s, minimally responsive to fluids.
Likely due to underlying malignancy, also anxiety regarding illness.
Metastatic NSCLC: CTA revealed mediastinal mass with multiple enlarging nodules.
Again showed new esophageal mass obliterating the lumen, unclear if this is a new primary to extension/mets of lung cancer (path on last biopsy was equivocal).
Increasing size of mass has now caused extrinsic compression of LLL bronchus, unclear if this is the cause of her dyspnea but certainly likely.
Controlled pain and anxiety with dilaudid.
Dysphagia/Thrush:  On admission, had trouble swallowing pills and was only able to tolerate small sips of clear fluids.
CT showed near complete obliteration of esophageal lumen from mass, even after recent dilation procedure.
Also found to have thrush on exam, raising concern for possible esophageal candidiasis, fluconazole was started.
Ulcerative colitis x8 years, well controlled on Asacol.
Patient without diarrhea while inpatient.

You were admitted due to shortness of breath.
After consultation with the pulmonary team, and evaluation with a CT scan we believe the most likely cause of your shortness of breath is progression of your lung cancer.
The following changes were made to your medications: - START dextromethorphan/guaifenesin for cough every 6 hours as needed - START senna as prescribed for constipation - START docusate as prescribed for constipation - START fluconazole as prescribed - START lorazepam for anxiety as prescribed - START ipratropium for breathing as prescribed - Finally, your pain medications have been adjusted in conjunction with the palliative care team.
