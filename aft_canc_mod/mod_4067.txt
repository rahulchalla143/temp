2) Occlusion of the portal vein as well as the superior mesenteric vein at its confluence with the splenic vein.
3) Increased intraabdominal ascites when compared to [**2168-2-26**].
4) The lesion within the gallbladder fundus that measured 3.0 x 2.5 cm on [**2168-2-26**], measures 2.7 x 2.5 cm.
Ascites and right pleural effusion.
There is some minimal gallbladder wall edema, though to be expected in the setting of high fluid states.
No perforation.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 31 yo M with metastatic gallbladder cancer who presented to the ED with fever, abdominal pain and sepsis; found to have enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis  .
Entercoccal bacteremia, endocarditis  He met criteria for sepsis by fever, tachycardia, elevated white count, and elevated lactate.
He has had early intervention/aggressive volume resuscitation and broad spectrum abx.
His infectious work up to date significant for pan-colitis on CT with c. diff negative, clean UA, clear CXR, and [**1-27**] bottles bloood cultures on [**4-27**] with gram + cocci/enterococcus, and paracentesis with no evidence of SBP.
RUQ US with no evidence of cholecystitis.
He clinically improved and remained stable; continued broad spectrum abx with Linezolid to cover for potential MRSA or VRE, levo for SBP prophylaxis, and po flagyl for empiric c. diff coverage.
Ultimately, he was maintained on Penicillin and gentamycin for treatment of his enterococcal bacteremia with TTE evidence of endocarditis - had valvular thickening and inferior wall hypokinesis.
TEE was considered, but was deemed too risky in the setting of known esophageal varices.
Plan is for 4-6 weeks of these antibiotics.
2. cholestasis/liver failure  Complicated by recurrent ascites and h/o esophageal varices s/p repeat banding - EGD in [**2-27**] with grade I varices - s/p paracentesis on admission with no evidence of SBP  His ascites, peripheral edema was manged with lasix/aldactone, and repeat paracentesis.
His nadolol was continued for secondary variceal bleeding prophylaxis.
Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma of the GB   With mets to liver and lungs, retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
It was discussed that these is no further role for chemotherapy, and also code status was discussed.
Microcytic, hypochromic anemia  History of past GI bleeding from esophageal varices.
Pan-colitis  Seen by abdominal CT; was c. diff negative x 3.
