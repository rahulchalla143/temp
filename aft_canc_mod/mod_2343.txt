Admission Date:  [**2184-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-8-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: OMED  Allergies: Fentanyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: SOB with cough x 2 days  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 76yo M with h/o nonsmall cell lung cancer, metastatic to chest wall, spinal cord, and brain p/w 2d h/o SOB, cough productive of yellow sputum.
is s/p a recent right frontal craniotomy and resection of metastatic tumor ([**5-19**]).
Was recently admitted to OMED service on [**6-20**] for 6days with exact similar presentation of cough and shortness of breath and had just completed his steroid taper for brain mets when symptoms recurred.
There does not seem to be increasing exertional dyspnea or a h/o orthopnea.
Pt also notes some chest pressure at rest which he has experienced before -- he took oxycodone which relieved the sx.
Started on levo/flagyl and solumedrol, CXR confirmed LLL opacity- seen on previous study one month ago with simlar presentation.
Also tachycardic to 123 and with low grade temps on admission to ED.
Pt was started on bactrim in addition to his ceftriaxone and azithromycin, as it was felt that his recent steroid taper might have predisposed him to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were started for COPD relief, however steroids were initially held given possible immunosuppressed state (recent steroids, possible PCP).
On the day following admission, in the AM pt looked better less respiratory distress and tachypnea.
However, as the day progressed, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly dyspneic and experienced desaturations into the mid-low 80's, and the patient was admitted to the ICU where his nebs were continued, steroids added on (inhaled and systemic, the latter for a 2-week course), and antibiotics changed to ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and vancomycin given possible postobstructive pneumonia with sputum cx growing out coag + staphylococci.
Pt stabilized in the ICU and was called out to the floor where he remained tachypneic but appeared less symptomatic, with main complaint being copious sputum production that was difficult to clear.
Final culture results revealed MRSA and no PCP; vancomycin was continued, and pt was placed on MRSA precautions.
