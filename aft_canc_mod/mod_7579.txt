Pt states he first noticed the shortness of breath after he had been walking on his treadmill for about 4 minutes.
He has had a cough for approx.
It is productive of mucus "like saliva" but not green or yellow in color.
No palpitations, F/C/S, or abdominal pain.
Says his BM a little loose today but no other change in bowel movements.
No h/o COPD or pulm disease.
CXR showed PNA in RLL.
Past Medical History: - Non-hodgkins lymphoma: mesenteric, axillary/epitrochlear recurrence (rituxin/leukeran/prednisone and radiation, rituxin monotx for recurrence) - HL - HTN - CAD (CABG x5v, pacer x13-15yrs) - GERD - Bilat total hip replacment c/b peripheral neuropathies - anemia (pt states he has long history of anemia that is "always near borderline") - renal failure (baseline cr 1.6-1.8)   Social History: Married to his wife [**Name (NI) **], 2nd marriage.
Family History: - 2 sisters deceased - Brother died 101 - Unknown cancer history   Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: coarse crackles in RLL but otherwise no crackles or wheezes.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CN2-12 intact bilat, decreased hearing on right (pt wears hearing aid bilat but was not wearing aid on right at time of exam), strength 5/5 in UE and LE bilat  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2113-11-15**] 05:35PM   WBC-7.3 RBC-3.42* HGB-11.6* HCT-34.2* MCV-100* MCH-33.9* MCHC-33.9 RDW-14.4 [**2113-11-15**] 05:35PM   NEUTS-60.6 LYMPHS-28.7 MONOS-5.3 EOS-4.7* BASOS-0.7 [**2113-11-15**] 05:35PM   PLT COUNT-208 [**2113-11-15**] 05:35PM   GLUCOSE-118* UREA N-27* CREAT-1.6* SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.5 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-19 [**2113-11-15**] 06:45PM   LACTATE-1.2  Imaging: CXR: [**2113-11-15**] Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Post-diuresis chest radiograph recommended to exclude underlying pneumonia in the lower lobes.
CXR: [**2113-11-16**] Resolution of temporary severe CHF episode with pulmonary congestion, remaining right lower lobe infiltrate which ought to be followed.
Echo: [**2113-11-16**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Pneumonia 2.
Acute diastolic CHF 3.
Non-hodgkins lymphoma 4.
Hypertension 6.
Mitral regurgitation 7.
Chronic kidney disease, stage III 10.
Anemia, likely secondary to CKD  Admitted with acute onset of dyspnea likely multifactorial from right lower lobe pneumonia and CHF.
As per acute on chronic CHF exacerbation, etiology was unclear and may have been precipitated by underlying infection and catecholamine surge during exertion.
He was ruled out for acute ischemia with cardiac enzymes x 2.
Echo showed biventricular hypertrophy and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Patient's breathing responded well to diuresis with decrease in oxygen requirement and significant improvement in CXR.
Given that he did not appear total body overloaded and that his creatine increased with initial diuresis, opted not discharge him on standing diuretics.
Acute diastolic CHF 3.
Non-hodgkins lymphoma 4.
Hypertension 6.
Mitral regurgitation 7.
Chronic kidney disease, stage III 10.
Anemia, likely secondary to CKD  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath, likely the result of both pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
