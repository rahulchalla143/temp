Admission Date:  [**2169-8-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2169-9-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-6-23**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old white male with a history of double vision and stinging of the eyes times approximately one month and a past medical history significant for renal cell carcinoma approximately 20 years ago (for which he underwent an nephrectomy on the left side in [**2147**]).
He had been free of any obvious disease since that time, and he further denied any change in constitutional signs or symptoms and reportedly had been well throughout the past 20 years.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He denies any chest pain, pressure, or palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting, or seizure activity.
The remainder of the previous medical history is essentially unremarkable.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  He was on no medications.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination at the time of admission revealed blood pressure was 129/86, heart rate was 56, and sinus bradycardia.
He was pleasant and cooperative with fluent speech, and he was in no acute distress.
Deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits bilaterally with the exception of bilaterally absent ankle jerks, and the plantar response was downgoing.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Due to the clinical findings the patient was admitted to the hospital on the morning of [**2169-8-16**]; at which time he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a transcallosal craniotomy for excision of a third ventricle tumor which was found on preoperative studies.
The frozen section final pathology reports showed the third ventricle tumor to be consistent with metastatic tumor (renal cell primary).
He was noted to be aphasic and essentially moot for the first several days; also with a mild hemiparesis.
However, on [**8-25**], he was readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit due to desaturations, and aspiration, and a recent change in mental status while out on the hospital floor.
Therefore, he spent the next several days in the Intensive Care Unit for management of aspiration and related complications.
Long discussions were taken with the wife due to the gravity of the metastatic disease.
Eventually, the decision was made to consider do not resuscitate/do not intubate orders due to the patient's lack of clinical progress after several more days in the Intensive Care Unit, and the gradual realization that his neurologic condition would not improve subsequently and he would not return to normal function or to his preoperative status, and that it would be against his wishes to continue to maintain intubation and further aggressive care in light of the prognosis and diagnosis.
He remained on comfort measures and supportive care throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, and the patient subsequently was found to be deceased at 2:05 a.m. on [**2169-9-13**] with no evidence of pupillary reaction.
There was no response to stimulation, no spontaneous respirations, no spontaneous pulse or heart sounds, and the patient was declared deceased at 2:05 a.m. on [**2169-9-13**].
