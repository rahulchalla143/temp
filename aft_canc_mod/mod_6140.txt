Interval decrease in the burden of the pulmonary embolus within the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
No other focus of pulmonary embolism is identified.
Multiple pulmonary nodules and multiple hypodense liver lesions which appear relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.
Small area of reversible ischemia in the left cerebellar hemisphere in the medial portion.
Please note that the accuracy of CTP in the detection of small acute infarcts in the posterior fossa.
In addition, acute infarcts in this location are elsewhere in the brain, not imaged, cannot be excluded.
Lack of enhancement in the tip of the basilar artery, as well as the posterior cerebral arteries on both sides, P1 and P2 segments on the right side and P1 segment on the left side, consistent with thrombosis.
Degenerative changes noted in the cervical spine at C4-5 level, not completely assessed on the present study.
Multiple acute infarcts, in the bilateral MCA, PCA territories, likely related to embolic etiology.
Evaluation for any acute hemorrhage may be limited.
CT Head [**2117-3-24**]: CONCLUSION: No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Beginning visibility of multiple infarcts noted on a prior MR study of [**3-23**], as described in detail above.
CXR [**2117-3-24**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process is identified\  Echo [**2117-3-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-3-9**], no major change is evident.
IMPRESSION: no mass or vegetations seen  CXR [**2117-3-26**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a Dobbhoff catheter has been placed.
Unchanged position of left-sided Port-A-Cath.
Mild pre-existing right suprabasilar atelectasis.
No new lung opacities.
Innumerable liver and pulmonary metastases.
Pancreatic head mass.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Femoral U/S [**2117-3-27**]: IMPRESSION: Large inguinal hematoma, no evidence of pseudoaneurysm  CT Head [**2117-3-28**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Evolving left MCA infarct involving the left frontal and parietal lobes with obliteration of the adjacent sulci and no hemorrhage.
Right cerebellar and right occipital infarctions, barely detectable on this CT.  CXR [**2117-3-28**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No signs of overhydration, no pleural effusions, no focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This 72 F was admitted for chest pain and was being managed for NSTEMI.
She experienced a tip of the basilar stroke as outlined in the HPI.
Her brain MRI overnight showed scattered infarcts in the cerebellum, midbrain, right thalamus, and cortex.
A repeat head CT showed no evidence of bleeding post-tPA, and she was started on a heparin gtt.
A repeat NCHCT showed evolution of her prior left MCA territory infarct.
Given her hx of metastatic pancreatic CA, Trousseau syndrome, and now scattered strokes, her family decided that hospice care would be most appropriate for her.
