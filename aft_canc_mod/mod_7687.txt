He had a severe frontal headache and went to his PCP and was found to be hypertensive (210/112 per father) and went to Good Samaratin [**Name (NI) **].
CT head revealed blood throughout the left lateral ventricle as well as 3rd and 4th ventricle with mild ventricular enlargement.
Family History: -no history of aneurysms.
Physical Exam: General: No acute distress HEENT: Conjuctival hemorrhage.
Pulmonary: rhonchi b/l CV: RRR no murmur appreciated Abd: Soft + bowel sounds Ext: No edema Neurologic: Alert, on Trach/Vent.
Clonus B/L at the ankles (4 beats) Was observed with PT and was able to stand unsuported and able to take small shuffling steps with support from a wheelchair.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
Extensive bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities persist.
There is no significant interval change.
CT chest/Abd/ Pelvis [**2163-2-11**] IMPRESSION: 1. lnterval improvement in extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidation and ground-glass opacities, which may represent multifocal infection or diffuse lung injury.
No pleural or pericardial effusions.
No adrenal tumors or abdominal pathology identified to explain the patient's hypertension.
Small left renal infarct or scar  [**2163-2-5**] CT head IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval decrease of intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No evidence of hydrocephalus, unchanged ventricular size compared to [**2-4**], [**2162**].
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram which did not demonstrate intracranial arterial or venous abnormality to explain the intraventricular hemorrhage.
On correlation with the MRI of the brain obtained same day at 2:47 a.m., this lack of filling of the left transverse sinus is consistent with a congenitally hypoplastic sinus vs chronic occlusion.
[**2163-1-24**] CTA head/neck IMPRESSION:  Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage and dilated third and lateral ventricles.
No evidence of intracranial aneurysm.
[**2163-1-27**] Right UE Doppler Deep vein thrombosis seen in one of the right brachial veins and  occlusive thrombus is also seen in the right basilic vein   Brief Hospital Course: Pt [**Name (NI) **] Was admitted as an OSH transfer after being found to have an extensive interventricular hemorrhage.
He was noted to be very hypertensive on admission and throughout his stay here requiring four antihypertensive agents for control.
He has serial CT heads and a cerebral Angio which failed to demonstrate an etiology in terms of underlying structural abnormalities.
In terms of his neurologic status he had interventricular tPA placed x 3 days with resolution of blood products.
He was also noted to have more weakness on the right side compared to his left side with brisker reflexes on the right that probably relates to his IVH starting off from the left lateral ventricle with some encephalomalacia noted around the motor fibers around this area (left).
Because he had high blood pressure a screening test for pheochromocytoma was initiated but an endocrine consult stated that the tests are not interpretable during this acute phase and recommended they get tested once he is no longer infected, stable, and off a beta blocker.
His renal function normalized, but there was slight increase in his BUN/Cr which is likely prerenal as he was diuresed by the ICU team.
He tolerated the PEG and tube feeds he developed diarrhea but failed to show infection in his stool.
he is recovering from a neurologic prospective and will need endocrine follow up.
Teams: Infectious Disease Endocrinology Neurology Neurosurgery ICU  Things to follow up: ARDS Work up for pheocromocytoma Completions of antibiotics Physcial therapy   Medications on Admission: none  Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
2. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
13. beclomethasone dipropionate 80 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for cough.
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Interventricular hemorrhage Hypertension Being worked up for a pheochromocytoma  Discharge Condition: Fair  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted as a transfer for a large bleed in your brain.
The reason for your bleed is believed to be from your high blood pressure.
You developed a serious lung infection and you required a tracheostomy and PEG tube.
