He also developed chills/rigors, but had no other symptoms.
There were no significant changes in BP, HR and RR during the transfusion.

Laboratory Data: Patient ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh positive Red Cell Product (21KQ[**Pager number 58759**]) ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh positve Post-transfusion serum: yellow, DAT negative  Transfusion History: Previous non-reactive red cell transfusions: 7 Previous non-reactive platelet transfusions: 4 Transfusion restriction met: Yes  DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 14558**] experienced a mild temperature increase of 1.4 degrees F after receiving 170 ml of a leukoreduced compatible red cell.
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of hemolysis.
The patient had a positive urine culture for Klebsiella Pneumonia upon admission.
Given that leukoreduction significantly decreases the incidence of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, the patient's fever is likely secondary to his underlying illness.
No change in transfusion practice is recommended at this time in this patient.
