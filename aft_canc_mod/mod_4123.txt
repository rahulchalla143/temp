Admission Date:  [**2179-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-9-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6180**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain and distention  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 67 year old female with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma to the liver and peritoneum status post multiple failed chemotherapeutic regimens, as well as disease progression despite palliative chemo and XRT, who initially presented yesterday with abdominal pain and distention.
A CT of her abdomen demonstrated free air as well as bowel wall edema.
She was noted to be oliguric and received 6 liters of IVF in the last 24 hours, with persistent oliguria.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post exploratory laparotomy, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy, and peritoneal nodule biopsy Status post TAH for uncontrollable bleeding during childbirth Status post laparotomy for lysis of adhesions for small bowel obstruction ([**2135**]) Status post appendectomy   Social History: The patient has two children and one grandchild.
ABD: NABS, tender to palpation diffusely but no rebound or guarding.
Bowel wall thickening, and stranding around the sigmoid colon in a region of multiple diverticula, as well as new foci of free intraperitoneal air and an increase in ascites, are consistent with microperforation from diverticulitis.
No drainable fluid collections.
Abnormal appearance to the duodenum and jejunum is likely related to underdistention.
Multiple splenic metastatic lesions.

She was managed conservatively with antibiotics, and pain control.
She remained afebrile, and her pain was controlled initially with a morphine PCA, she was transitioned to a fentanyl patch with good control of her pain, but also with associated sedation, which was acceptable to the patient in discussion prior to initiation.
Scopolamine was administered for increasing secretions.
She experienced contractures in her right arm, seizurelike activity, thought associated with the narcotic administration and she was given ativan, which resulted in somnolence.
The following day, she regained alertness, but had hallucinations and altered delerium at times.
In extensive discussion with the family, she was told that her mother was clinically and mentally deteriorated, and was offered both a skilled nursing and home hospice.
However, the patient continued to have increasing discomfort, so morphine PCA was titrated to no pain with abdominal compressions.
A voiding trial was attempted, but after six hours, she was noted to have bladder distention and the foley was replaced for comfort.
The patient had failed palliative chemotherapy for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.
