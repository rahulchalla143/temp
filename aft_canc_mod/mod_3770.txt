AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions Limited focussed examination  1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Small aneurysm in the descending aorta distal to the left subclavian is seen.
Post stent deployment unable to rule out endovascular leak due to poor imaging conditions.
There is minimal high attenuation where the saccular aneurysm was previously seen.
However, there is no evidence of frank contrast extravasation.
An enlarged right infrahilar lymph node remains.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are new small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, which appear simple.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications are again noted.
ABDOMEN: A subcentimeter low attenuation lesion at the junctions of segments VIII and VII in the liver (2, 39) is too small to characterize but believed to represent a cyst.
There has been no interval change in the appearance of heterogeneous left adrenal and right renal masses.
A simple 4.4 cm left interpolar renal cortical cyst persists.
There is a moderate amount of high-attenuation fluid in the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces, compatible with hemorrhage.
The aorta, celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries are patent, although there is moderate calcified plaque along the course of the aorta.
There is no bowel dilatation.
There is trace free fluid in the pericolic gutters.
There is an anterior abdominal scar in the midline with scattered subcutaneous air locules.
A 16 mm right adnexal cyst is again identified.
There is moderate soft tissue stranding in both groins, without evidence of discrete collection to suggest groin hematoma.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Moderate endplate osteophytes are seen at multiple levels.
Patient status post descending thoracic aortic stent graft placement with new small bilateral and pleural effusions, a new small-to-moderate amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage and new simple ascites.
Redemonstration of suspicious right renal and left adrenal masses.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 3996**] F was admitted on [**1-2**] with thoracic AAA.
She agreed to have an elective surgery.
It was decided that she would undergo a Endovascular stent graft repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm  She was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery.
She then underwent a left common iliac artery conduit and iliofemoral bypass, left common femoral endarterectomy.
Because of the drop in pressur, a cardiac consult was obatined.
The pt did r/o for MI  She did recieve blood products for anemia secondary to to the OR procedure.
When she was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care, she was transfered to floor status  On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled.
She continues to make steady progress without any incidents.
You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort  What to expect when you go home: It is normal to have slight swelling of the legs: ??????
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart (use [**2-19**] pillows or a recliner) every 2-3 hours throughout the day and at night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated It is normal to feel tired and have a decreased appetite, your appetite will return with time ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or incision) ??????
