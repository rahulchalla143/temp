Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hickman placement-changed over wire on [**2200-8-19**] Chemotherapy Stem cell infusion Bronchoscopy Intubation x2   History of Present Illness: This is a 65 year old woman with recurrent large cell lymphoma first diagnosed in [**6-10**], s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP in [**12-12**], recurrence in fall of [**2198**], s/p ICE x 3 and ESHAP ([**1-13**]).
She was recently discharged from our [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] for auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**3-13**] (CBV), but showed residual disease on PET with a large retroperiotneal mass (bx c/w follicular lymphoma).
The pt has been undergoing radiation to that area and is being admitted now to the [**Date Range 3242**] for allogenic transplant with a sibling matched donor (her brother [**5-13**] match).
She denied any fever, chill, night sweats, headache, visual changes, skin rashes, mucosities, chest pain, SOB, cough, abdominal pain, N/V/D, constipation or any other urinary symptoms, and claimed to be pretty healthy all her life other than her lymphoma.
ROS: per HPI, otherwise negative  Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Patient was initially diagnosed with lymphoma in [**2198-6-14**], when she noted a preauricular swelling.
Her disease responded initially, but in [**2199-9-7**], patient noted increase  in size of the lymph nodes in her neck and preauricular area, with a follow up PET scan positive for disease recurrence.
Her 2nd cycle of ICE was complicated by E. coli bacteremia.
After completion of her ICE, patient had a PET scan performed, which showed presence of persistent disease, with no change in aortocaval lymph nodes and increased uptake in the parotid area.
Her most recent chemotherapy was ESHAP in [**1-/2200**] with stem cell mobilization.
She tolerated chemotherapy treatments well, with no significant toxicity.
She received an auto-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**] in [**3-13**], and tolerated chemotherapy quite well with complications that included diarrhea, mucositis, bullae on hands, mild nausea, and febrile neutropenia (see below).
She received her cells on [**2200-3-4**] without complications.
She started G-CSF as scheduled on D+4 and she demonstrated improvement of counts around D8-9.
A repeat PET scan revealed a large retroperitoneal mass (bx c/w follicular lymphoma).
The patient has been undergoing radiation to that area and is admitted now for allogenic transplant.
Family History: Her mom died at the age of 87 of cerebral hemorrhage.
Her father died at the age of 48 of malignant hypertension.
Her brother died of a massive MI at the age of 66.
She has another brother with hypertension and emphysema.
VS: T 98.1, BP 130/70, HR 64, RR 18, O2 sat 99% on RA, wt 127lbs, ht 62" Gen: very pleasant women, lying comfortably in bed, in NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, OP clear w/o erythema or exudate.
No lymphadenopathy, no JVD, no carotid bruits CV: RRR, Nl s1 and s2.
Neuro: A&O x 3; 5/5 strength throughout, no focal neuro signs.
The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion.
No acute cardipulmonary process.
[**7-27**] CXR - Diffuse bilateral hazy patchy opacities with blunting of diaphragms and CP angles.
[**7-25**] CXR - There is increasing radio opacity generally overlying a background of micro nodular opacities suggesting some pulmonary edema.
As far as I can see, there has been no CT for the evaluation of questions of small lung nodules raised on prior interpretations of plain radiographs since [**7-7**].
Interval changes probably due to pulmonary edema, but the possibility of disseminated infection is still of concern.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
CT chest [**7-27**]: Diffuse confluent ground-glass and airspace opacities are seen within the entire lungs bilaterally, with peripheral sparing at the lung bases.
Diagnostic considerations include diffuse infectious process from fungal or atypical etiologies, ARDS, or alveolar hemorrhage.With the absence of effusions, failure is thought to be less likely.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion, without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-7-7**], mitral regurgitation is probably slightly increased.
Aortic regurgitation is unchanged.
Visualized intrarenal arteries show no parvus et tardus waveforms, with resistive indices mostly of approximately 0.69-0.74.
Mild right-sided hydronephrosis, presumably due to ureteral obstruction by known right-sided retroperitoneal mass.
Chest CT [**2200-8-13**]: Significant interval improvement of diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities; given the current CT findings and prior comparison studies, findings may represent partially resolving alveolar hemorrhage or ARDS.
An improving diffuse infectious process is less likely but remains in the differential.
Persisting small bilateral pleural effusions with possible mild component of volume overload.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: There are faint diffuse ground-glass opacities bilaterally, but much improved from [**2200-8-13**].
A discrete irregular pulmonary nodule is present within the left upper lobe measuring 10 mm of unclear etiology.
This may represent a small focus of persistent inflammatory disease, but malignancy is also a diagnostic consideration.
Bibasilar scarring is again identified.
No pathologic axillary, hilar, or mediastinal adenopathy is identified, though multiple small hilar lymph nodes are again noted, unchanged.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  No focal lesions are identified within the non-contrast liver.
Again seen is a soft tissue mass encasing the right renal hilum extending to the right psoas muscle, which is not well evaluated on this non-contrast study but has decreased in size compared to [**7-29**], [**2199**].
There are bilateral parapelvic renal cysts.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is diverticular disease of the sigmoid.
There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
No pathologic adenopathy, free air, or free fluid is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 year old woman with recurrent NHL, first diagnosed with large cell lymphoma in [**6-10**], s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP in [**12-12**], recurrence in fall of [**2198**], s/p ICE x 3 and ESHAP ([**1-13**]), s/p auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**3-13**], found to have new lymphoma by PET (bx c/w follicular lymphoma) and radiation, admitted to [**Date Range 3242**] unit for reduced intensity-allogenic [**Date Range 3242**].
# Lymphoma: Follicular type (less aggressive type than the one she had before Large cell lymphoma) by bx.
Patient was readmitted to the [**Date Range 3242**] unit [**2200-6-11**] for allogenic transplant with a sibling matched donor (her brother [**5-13**] match).
Eventually discontinued due to toxicity - MTX 10mg/m2 IVB day +1, +3, +5 - GCSF 300mcg/day started on day +6, discontinued when ANC was >1000 - Patient was on cyclosporin [**Hospital1 **] dosing, discontinued due to DAH thought to be [**1-9**] cyclosporin - ANC started trending up on [**7-5**], now engrafted ANC 3880 [**2200-8-29**] - CT on [**8-27**] showed interval decrease in size of mass.
# Fever- Her post-[**Name (NI) 3242**] course was relatively uneventful until [**6-27**], when she started spiking fevers with unclear source.
started Cefepime, continued on Fluconazole, and acyclovir; spiked again on [**7-1**], vanc started; spiked again on [**7-2**], vori started; spiked [**Last Name (un) 59331**] on [**7-2**] and [**7-3**] am, new non-blanching petechia noted on [**2200-7-3**],  flagyl started on [**7-3**]; continued to spike on [**7-4**] to 103.5, a hypotensive episode on [**7-4**] am, responsive to IV fluids (500ml resuscitation), BP stabilized throughout the day, received >4gm tylenol for fever, rash worsened, CXR clear, RUQ showed no evidence of VOD; [**7-5**]: Rash worse on the chest, face and arms, GVHD vs drug rash, d/C'ed cefepime, and started aztreonam; Cxs continued to be negative to date, CXR has been clear to date, currently on Aztreonam, vanc, acyclovir (PO per ID), vori, flagyl, chest CT (non contrast) on [**7-5**] showed no evidence of infections .
On [**7-7**] she became dyspnic and febrile, and CXR demonstrated new central bilateral ground glass and alveolar opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema vs. engraftment syndrome.
She became hypoxic and was transferred to the ICU where she was intubated.
She was then found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy on [**7-10**].
At the time she received solumedrol 100mg IV x 2d and lasix for possible engraftment syndrome, but had no improvement.
She initially did well and then again dropped her sats into the 70s and had increased mucous/secretions with hemoptysis.
She was transferred back to the ICU for hypoxia/hypercarbia where she was intubated for a second time.
She was extubated for a second time but continued to have a high oxygen requirement and intermittantly required BIPAP.
Currently denies SOB and O2 sats 95-98% on RA.
# HTN: While in the ICU Patient's BP began running very high into the 170s.
Because the patient's hypertension had been so refractory, there was a question of the possibility of renal artery stenosis secondary to past radiation versus extension of known retroperitoneal mass involving the right renal hilum.
Renal duplex to check for renal artery stenosis was performed [**8-10**] but was a suboptimal study and could not rule out the possibility of RAS.
Renal consult was obtained to evaluate for cause of malignant HTN.
Renal thought that the high blood pressure was more likely caused in the setting of ARF while in ICU.
She had a bump in her creatinine around the same time as her HTN started.
Additionally, renal thought that the presence of her mass near the renal hilum may have also contributed to her malignant hypertension.
Cyclosporin is also known to cause HTN but this had been off for 2 weeks.
MRA to evaluate the renal arteries was deferred as the renal team thought that ARF was more likely cause than stenosis of the renal arteries since her BP noprmalized.
# Deconditioning:  After a prolonged hospital course and long-term steroids the patient became very deconditioned and weak.
With the help of PT daily she was eventually able to walk and stand with minimal assistance.
# Thrombocytopenia:  After engraftment, the patient's counts came up, however she remained persistantly thrombocytopenic requiring platelet transfusion every 1-2 weeks when her platelets would decrease to less than 20 (she was kept highr than 20 given her h/o DAH).
The etiology of her thrombocytopenia was unclear, however BM biopsy on [**8-19**] did show reduced megakaryocytes in her marrow.
On dapsone the patient's LDH increased and her hct dropped, concerning for hemolysis so she was put back on Bactrim but on a M,W,F schedule.
