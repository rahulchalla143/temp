Admission Date:  [**2135-3-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-2-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: dysphagia and weight loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Total gastrectomy distal esophagectomy esophagojejunostomy tube jejunostomy   History of Present Illness: This is a 60-year-old [**Location 7972**] gentleman who reports a one-month history of dysphagia and weight loss.
At that time, he was reporting that both food and liquids were getting hung up in his throat and he was also complaining of some dyspepsia.
He noticed a fairly significant weight loss with his pant size going down two belt buckles.
She referred him for a barium upper GI swallow which showed a long segment of irregular narrowing in the distal esophagus with malignant features.
A follow-up upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3613**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2-21**] and this showed an infiltrative, villous circumferential 4-cm mass of malignant appearance at the cardia and fundus of the stomach.
There was evidence of a partial obstruction.
Biopsies were performed and show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.
Mr. [**Known lastname 15655**] reports that he is currently unable to eat meat or bread and is largely eating only soups.
He admits to a decreased appetite as well as an at least 20-pound weight loss over the last month.
He vomits on an almost daily basis without blood in the vomit.
He denies any abdominal pain per se, but does have some dyspepsia, especially when food seems to get stuck in his chest.
Dyspepsia, status post previous upper endoscopy in [**Country **] back in [**2127**], which reportedly showed no abnormality.
There was noted to be extensive scarring of the first part of his duodenum with a small ulcer crater at that site.
He has had a previous CT scan of the chest in [**7-/2132**] that showed multiple conglomerated ill-defined parenchymal opacities in the superior segment of the left lower lobe as well as in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
There was also left hilar lymphadenopathy up to 3 cm in size, which were all suggestive of tuberculosis.
Family History: remarkable for possible gastric cancer in a maternal uncle.
General: pleasant gentleman who shows evidence of recent weight loss.
Neck and supraclavicular fossae are supple without lymphadenopathy.
Abdomen: is scaphoid with evidence of weight loss.
It is soft and nontender without palpable mass.
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
Groins show no lymphadenopathy.
Small right apical pneumothorax.
No appreciable left pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Left cervical drain projects over region of persistent small subcutaneous emphysema.
Mild edema has developed at the left lung base and lung volumes are slightly smaller today than yesterday, but otherwise clear.
IMPRESSION: Development of focal density at the left base, suspicious for pneumonia.
A loculated left pleural effusion, small.
Denser than expected material within the left chest tube which may represent _____ anastomosis in the absence of high-density material in any other location.
Right lower and right middle lobe atelectasis due to mucus impaction of the bronchi.
Stable left lower and right lower lobe nodules.
Mildly dilated loops of small bowel proximal to jejunal-jejunal anastomotic site, with decompressed small bowel distal to this site.
However, contrast passes freely through this site, and no definite stricture or narrowing is seen.
These findings may suggest mild edema at the anastomotic site slightly limiting flow.
Left chest tube in place, with two residual foci of loculated pleural fluid.
Adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis.
The lumen of the chest tube appears dense although there is no evidence of oral contrast extravasation.
If clinically indicated, the fluid draining through this chest tube could be expose to x- ray to rule out leak.
Right lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation, and adjacent area of ground-glass opacity suggestive of active or ongoing infection.
Small amount of ascites and free fluid throughout the abdomen and tracking into the left paracolic gutter.
UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB  [**2135-3-21**] 10:41 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic leak at esophagojejunostomy.
Contrast passes freely through the jejunum, without evidence of obstruction.
The CT were placed to H2O seal on POD 2 and a CXR showed No pneumothorax.
A post-pull CXR revealed Small-to-moderate left pneumothorax following left chest tube removal.
Improving bibasilar atelectasis.
A loculated left pleural effusion, small.
Denser than expected material within the left chest tube which may represent _____ anastomosis in the absence of high-density material in any other location.
Right lower and right middle lobe atelectasis due to mucus impaction of the bronchi.
His respiratory status was improved and he was no longer requiring O2 nasal cannula.
The tube feedings were then held due to increased distention.
A CT was done on [**2135-3-15**] and showed Mildly dilated loops of small bowel proximal to jejunal-jejunal anastomotic site, with decompressed small bowel distal to this site.
However, contrast passes freely through this site, and no definite stricture or narrowing is seen.
These findings may suggest mild edema at the anastomotic site slightly limiting flow.
Left chest tube in place, with two residual foci of loculated pleural fluid.
Adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis.
The lumen of the chest tube appears dense although there is no evidence of oral contrast extravasation.
If clinically indicated, the fluid draining through this chest tube could be expose to x- ray to rule out leak.
Small amount of ascites and free fluid throughout the abdomen and tracking into the left paracolic gutter.
On POD 11, his abdomen was still distended and hypoactive bowel sound.
A SBFT was performed and showed no evidence of anastomotic leak at esophagojejunostomy.
Contrast passes freely through the jejunum, without evidence of obstruction.
Pain: He had an epidural for pain control.
Post-op Hypovolemia: He had low urine output on POD 1 and 2, and received several IV fluid boluses.
Oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: [**11-30**]  PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Pain for 3 weeks.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
