She was driving at 40 mph when she suddenly began feeling sweaty, nauseous and dizzy as if she was going to pass out.
She endorsed only mid-low-back pain, denying HA, dizziness, vision changes, focal weakness, paresthesias or numbness.
Past Medical History: Low back pain Headaches Right arm parasthesias  Social History: Lives with her mother and special-needs sister.
Family History: Notable for paternal prostate cancer and DM, maternal DM.
Multiple paternal aunts with breast cancer.
No M/R/G Abdomen: soft, non-tender, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No fractures or other acute traumatic injury seen.
Fibroid uterus.
CT HEAD IMPRESSION: 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm area of hyperdensity located within the posterior aspect of the right pons, likely hemorrhage, but an underlying vascular malformation (ie.
capillary telangiectasia) or mass is not excluded.
CT C-Spine IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative changes, most prominent at level C6-C7 with mild posterior disc bulge resulting in mild central canal stenosis.
MRI brain: Findings are most suggestive of a cavernoma with adjacent developmental venous anomaly.
No evidence of underlying nodular or mass-like enhancement.
Follow up MRI can be performed to assess for any change if clinical concern persists  Repeat CT head [**2111-1-30**]:  1.0cm hyperdense lesion in right superoposterior pons, likely a  cavernoma   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the trauma service on [**2111-1-29**] after a loss of consciousness which resulted in an MVC.
The only abnormality on [**Date Range 2742**] for traumatic injury found was a pontine cavernoma suspicious for slow hemorrhage.
Neurology thought it was likely that the cavernoma was bleeidng slowly, causing her symptoms and subsequent accident.
She did, however, maintain normal mental status for her entire hospitalization.
Additionally, the neurosurgery team recommended follow up with ENT as an out-patient for [**First Name (STitle) 2742**] of chronic vertigo symptoms.
Prior to discharge, she was verbally instructed not to drive by several parties, including the trauma team.
The patient will need to have an echocardiogram as an out-patient to evaluate for wall motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunction or chamber enlargement.
She had no murmurs on cardiac exam.
Prophylaxis: The patient not started on subcutaneous heparin during this stay, given the concern for bleeding cavernoma, but was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible, which she did on HD1.
MSK: The pt did complain of low back pain after the accident, with stable neurologic exam as noted above as well as no incontinence, LE weakness, fevers, decreased rectal tone or other concerning symptoms.
Additionally, her c-collar was cleared on HD#1 as she had no cervical tenderness and full painless ROM.
At the time of discharge on HD#3, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) syncope, 2) motor vehicle collision (loss of consciosness while driving causing MVC), 3) right pontine cavernoma, 4) vertigo  Secondary: 1) Low back pain, 2) headaches, 3) right arm parasthesias   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent VSS 97.4  67  93/60  16  95%RA GCS 15, neurologically intact for 2+ DTRs, 5/5 strength bilat, sensation grossly intact, PERRL.
*In [**Hospital1 2742**] after your accident, you were found to have a lesion in your brainstem called a Cavernoma (a malformed vein).
However, it is important to carefully monitor your condition and, if you develop any of the warning symptoms below, please call or return to the ED.
*Given the loss of consiousness prior to your accident, you were kept in the hospital to evaluate your heart with continuous monitoring (to look for any abnormal heart rhythms) and blood tests (to look for a heart attack).
