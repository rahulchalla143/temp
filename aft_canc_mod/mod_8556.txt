Wife states that he was complaining of abdominal pain 5-6d prior, which resolved on its own after 2 days.
Apparently reported vomiting x 1.
Patient did not have any complaints but has [**Known lastname 5348**] dementia.
On exam he was noted to have guaiac positive brown stool.
CTAP showed no acute issues.
NGL showed feculent material with small amounts of blood.
No evidence of obstruction from CT, and therefore NGT pulled out.
Levophed was drawn up, but never used, as pt was fluid responsive.
Pt was recently admitted in [**11/2145**] for preseptal cellulitis from [**Date range (1) 78748**].
That hospitalization was complicated by acute renal failure and UTI.

CXay [**2-26**]: Resolution of right basilar opacification  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19896**] is a 86 yo M w/ PMH intracranial hemorrhage with right-sided residual weakness, HTN, HLD, anemia, CKD, dementia who presented with fevers, vomiting, and diarrhea with course complicated by acute on chronic thrombocytopenia and persistent fevers.
# Hypotension: Patient was admitted to the ICU with hypovolemic shock.
Volume loss was due to vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days prior to admission, and potential sepsis.
# Fevers: On admission, patient had three days of vomiting and diarrhea, concerning for gastroenteritis.
U/A on admission did not show signs of infection and CXR was clear.
Patient was initially on ciprofloxacin/metronidazole as he was unstable to empirically treat bacterial gastroenteritis.
Patient continued to have low grade fevers on transfer to the floor.
On HD3, patient spiked a fever to 101.2.
Urinalysis showed moderate bacteria, with 13 WBCs, +nitrites.
Patient's foley catheter was removed and he was started on ciprofloxacin as he had pan-sensitive e.coli in the past.
CXR at that time showed mild consolidation in the right lower lobe.
Repeat CXR showed increased density in the right lower lobe.
Antibiotics were broadened to treat health-care acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
There was also concern for aspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia given patient's dementia and debilitated state.
He was evaluated by speech & swallow who saw no overt signs of aspiration, but recommend ground solids/thin liquid diet.
Video swallow also showed no signs of silent aspiration.
Patient continued to spike fevers, therefore it was felt that he was likely aspirating given RLL consolidations which rapidly resolved, consistent with pneumonitis.
# Thrombocytopenia: On admission, as above, patient's CBC was significantly hemoconcentrated and showed platelets of 100, dropping to 60s following volume resuscitation.
Patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, followed by hematology as an outpatient, which has been attributed to chronic illness and potentially medication effect.
Hematology was consulted to help better evaluate likely underlying cause of thrombocytopenia.
Further information from HIT antibody revealed an optical density of 0.55, only weakly positive so low probability of being true positive.
Peripheral smear showed evidence of abnormal WBCs and nucleated RBCs concerning for MDS.
Argatroban was discontinued in light of new information, and patient was placed on fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis, however given decreased renal function this was stopped and patient was placed on mechanical DVT prophylaxis.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: [**Last Name (STitle) **] Cr 1.5-1.6.
Bumped to 1.8 on admission in setting of hypovolemia, but was responsive to fluid resuscitation.
# HTN: On admission, amlodipine 10mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily, aliskiren 300mg daily, losartan 100mg daily were all held in the setting of hypotension.
Amlodipine was restarted following volume resuscitation once patient became hypertensive.
# Guaiac positive stool: Patient had guaiac positive stool on admission, and throughout admission.
Initial 10 point hematocrit drop was therefore not attributed to bleeding.
Patient has known history of polyps and diverticula on last colonoscopy in [**2143**].
# HIstory of seizure: Recent admission for witnessed seizure at rehab, placed on keppra and pyridoxine.
# Transitional issues: - serotonin release assay is still pending to confirm true heparin allergy - blood, urine cultures pending at the time of discharge - f/u scheduled with neurology, hematology, and GI - Alter blood pressure regimen as necessary  Medications on Admission: amlodipine 10mg daily aspirin 81mg daily ferrous sulfate 325mg daily hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily omega 3,6,9 1200 capsule [**Hospital1 **] KCl 10mEq qam and 20mEq qpm daily losartan 100mg daily multivitamin 1 tab daily [**Hospital1 **] (memantine) 10mg daily calcium-vitD 500-200 x 2 tabs daily simvastatin 20mg daily aliskiren 300mg daily vitamin b-6 pyridoxine 100mg daily vit d3 400 IU daily levetiracetam 500mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: 1. memantine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO daily ().
Thrombocytopenia 3.
Myelodysplastic syndrome 4.
Pneumonia  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: #  Dementia #  Hypertension #  History of seizure #  History of stroke #  History of intracranial hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
You were admitted because of vomiting and diarrhea causing your blood pressure to be very low.
Your vomiting and diarrhea improved on their own with time.
In addition, during the admission, you had inflammation in your lung which was thought to be due to food going down the wrong route, into your lung.
