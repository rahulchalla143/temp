Admission Date:  [**2134-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-11-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-11-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: fever and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: diagnositic and therapeutic paracentesis PICC line placement Skin biopsy Bronchoscopy Bone Marrow Biopsy Wound Care  History of Present Illness: 67 yo male w/ MDS with recent admission from [**Date range (1) 73061**] to surgical service for R. hemicolectomy with end ileostomoy and mucous fistula admitted on [**2134-10-14**] with SIRS/early sepsis with unknown source of infection.
Admission [**Date range (1) 73061**] was for evaluation for bilateral erythema/blisters on arms after injections/ treatment with IM vidaza for his MDS on [**9-20**].
His hospital course was complicated by necrotic bowel and an exp lap was performed with hemicolectomy and end ileostomy and mucous fistula ([**2134-9-28**]).
He required intubation for respiratory distress and cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.
Also developed VRE (sensitive to daptomycin) in peritoneal fluid, discharged on daptomycin.
ER visits [**10-12**] and [**10-13**]: Presented with concern of infected wound dehisence, evalutated by surgery, discharged with bactrim and keflex for presumed wound infection and concomittant UTI.
SICU admission [**10-14**]: Presentation notable for skin lesion, fever, hypotension, HCT drop, and elevated INR.
The patient has had volume responsive hypotension with no current pressor requirement.
He was found to have erythema surrounding his abd incision with an additional erythematous nodule on the R thigh.
The etiology of the patient's presentation has been unclear, however possible infectious sources include a secondary wound infection vs. hematogenous spread of an alternate underlying infection.
Prelim biopsy for hip and peri-incisional biopsies read as neutrophilic dermatosis (pyoderma gangrenosum), though cannout rule out infectious process.
Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] patient reports intermittent abdominal pain mid-abdomen fluctuating in intensity [**2134-4-24**], no radiation.
Occasional nausea, no vomitting.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Social History: Retired, used to work for a chemical company.
History of asbestos and other chemical exposure.
Lungs: coarse breath sounds, expiratory wheezing on right, rhonchi anteriorly, with bibasilar crackles bilaterally CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1 S2, no M/G/R.
R IJ site c/d/i BACK: no focal tenderness, no CVAT GI: abdomen with large midline open incision extended from pubic symphisis to subxiphoid with serosanguinous drainage.
MSK: no joint swelling or erythema EXT: trace pitting edema bilaterally SKIN: mucocutaneous fistula site with necrotic center.
2cm nodular lesion on lateral aspect of R thigh with surrounding erythema, warm, and tender to touch.
CXR [**2134-10-13**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Equivocal signs for mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Large volume ascites with mild peritoneal enhancement in the right paracolic gutter.
Overall appearance appears simple though given history of recent surgery, peritonitis cannot be excluded.
Post operative changes rel;ated to recent bowel resection without evidence of bower obstruction or perforation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
The overlying epidermis exhibits neutrophilic spongiosis with foci of spongiform pustulation; in specimen 2, frank cleavage is noted through the spinous layer.
No micro-organisms are identified within the inflamed tissue in PAS, GMS, and Gram stained sections .
Paracentesis:  Technically successful diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis yielding 2.7 liters of amber clear ascitic fluid, which was sent for microbiology and cell count.
No gallstones.
No dilated bile ducts.
No focal lesions seen in the liver.
Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Probable mild bilateral effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Multifocal ground-glass pulmonary opacities, most compatible with multifocal infectious process.
New left lower lobe collapse.
Unchanged moderate volume ascites, with mild peritoneal enhancement again seen in the right paracolic gutter.
Unremarkable appearance of the large and small bowel, status post right hemicolectomy, with end ileostomy and mucous fistula in the right abdomen.
No evidence of abscess formation.
Mild increase in size in moderate left pleural effusion.
Resolved left lower lobe collapse.
No interval change in the free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis but no abscess seen.
Pathology: R buttock skin biopsy: Superficial and deep perivascular, periappendageal and interstitial dermatitis with prominent neutrophils and overlying papillary dermal edema, epidermal hyperplasia, and spongiosis.
Note:  The depth of the infiltrate is suggestive of an infection such as bacterial cellulitis.
The histologic pattern is not typical of those observed with deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infections (unless inflammation is more prominent deep to the tissue sampled in this biopsy).
The depth of the infiltrate and lack of a more florid neutrophilic infiltrate are unusual for Sweet's syndrome, however, a variety of neutrophilic inflammatory patterns may be observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in association with G-CSF (if clinically applicable).
This finding raises consideration of a neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) in the differential diagnosis.
NEH may be observed in association with chemotherapeutic agents and G-CSF.
Special stains (Gram, [**Last Name (un) 18566**], PAS, and GMS) are negative for organisms.
In summary, if infection is excluded, the differential diagnosis includes a neutrophilic infiltrate associated with MDS or a drug associated NEH.

Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o male with MDS s/p R. hemicolectomy with end ileostomy/mucous fistula on [**2134-9-28**], who presented with fluid responsive hypotension and fever.
Possible etiologies included uperinfection of right thigh lesion with neutrophilic dermatosis, post-operative wound infection with wound dehiscence.
CT torso was completed without evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
He was started on daptomycin and zosyn, later stopped zosyn due to low platelets, switched to ciprofloxacin and flagyl, then finally broadened to meropenum.
ID followed the patient throughout his hospital course, and eventually recommended d/c his antibiotics after his new diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome.
Additionally, A workup was also completed including [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, and anti-cardiolipin out of concern for underlying autoimmune process that could explain the etiology of his fevers.
The most likely etiology for the hypotension was secondary to a wound infection and sepsis.
There was initial concern for leukemia in his bone marrow.
The differential diagnosis included worsening MDS, AML progression, or other hematopeoieic malignancy.
Hemolysis and Smear analysis did not suggest DIC.
- Please transfuse platelets for count < 10 or active signs of bleeding when < 30.
- He will need Bactrim, and Acyclovir for PPX due to his low WBC.
#Sweet's Syndrome/Neutrophilic dermatosis: He was found to have an erythematous nodule on his right leg and pain.
A skin biopsy was sent which was consistent with neutrophilic dermatosis.
Based upon the biopsy in addition to his clinical findings, a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome was proposed to explain his high grade fevers in addition to his skin lesions.
Corticosteroid treatment was not initiated until multiple imaging studies confirmed that there was no infectious process or abscess in his abdomen after his recent surgery.
The Pulmonology Consult team felt that the infiltrates and skin findings were consistent with Sweet's syndrome.
He also developed another sight of pain adjacent to his R sacrum that also had a neutrophilic infiltrate, but not to the degree of the R thigh skin biopsy.
The differential diagnosis was neutrophilic dermatosis vs. neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.
A non-contrast CT of the lungs demonstrated improvement of his multi-focal opacities, his skin lesions continue to heal, and he has been afebrile since the initiation of steroids.
# End ileostomy/mucous fistula s/p hemicolectomy: He presented with wound dehisence.
His intial presentation may have been secondary to infection of his wound.
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics with minimal improvement in his wound healing.
After the initiation of corticosteroids for Sweet's syndrome the erythema along the margins of his wound improved.
He subsequently developed granulation tissue, and his wound continues to demonstrate healing.
Hyponatremia: The patient had persistent hypnatremia that was secondary to Hypervolemia due to fluid resuscitation, and Sweet's syndrome with SIADH due to infilatrates in the lung.
His sodium level stabilized and he was no longer fluid restricted.
# Decreased hearing:  Patient had large cerumen plug in left ear.
He continues to have ascites without any evidence of infection.
It was thought that his ascites may have been secondary to his poor nutritional status upon presentation when his albumen was < 3.0.  .
# Stage II decubitus ulcer: Currently has a stage II decubitus ulcer.
# Incidential AVN (bilateral based upon MRI).
# History of AFIB w/RVR: Patient had atrial fibrillation during his last hospital admission.
