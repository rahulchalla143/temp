History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 25145**] is a 61 year old female with a PMH significant for mantel cell lymphoma C2D11 R-hyperCVAD admitted for fever and C.difficile colitis now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension.
The patient was initially admitted on [**2149-11-1**] for diarrhea and mucositis.
She was noted to be persistently tachycardic and febrile to 104, and had hypotension with SBP 80-90s that was fluid responsive that has since become fluid refractory.
Labs notable for neutropenia, acute renal failure, and a peak lactate of 3.4 that has since returned to 1.2.
Given persistent hemodynamic instabilty, the patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
She reports that she has had loose watery stools beginning on Monday, but this stopped yesterday prior to starting flagyl.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIST HISTORY: Mrs. [**Known lastname 25145**] is a 61 yo woman originally from [**Country 16573**] who developed fatigue, mild weakness and vague LUQ fullness over the summer.
The symptoms progressed in late [**Month (only) 216**]/early [**Month (only) **], with more prominent fatigue, weakness, and intermittent sharp, "knife-like" LUQ pain.
She also had new onset microcytic hypochromic anemia with Hgb 7.5, Hct 23.7, and MCV 76.
Flow cytometry showed a CD5+ clonal B cell lymphoproliferative disorder with lambda light-chain restriction.
It was a dry tap but revealed a hypercellular bone marrow (70-80% cellularity) with extensive infiltration by mantle cell lymphoma.
CT torso on [**2147-8-11**] showed several peripheral irregularly-shaped splenic hypodensities in the setting of an enlarged spleen, concerning for lymphomatous lesions versus infarctions.
There was a small amount of left paracolic and perisplenic free fluid, which may represent rupture of one of the splenic lesions.
Mediastinal and intra-abdominal paraaortic lymphadenopathy was also seen.
She tolerated chemotherapy well, except for the development of febrile neutropenia without a clear source.
Unfortunately, she continued to have an excessive number of peripheral atypical lymphocytes on her smear.
A bone marrow biopsy was repeated on [**2147-8-31**] and showed a hypercellular marrow with persistent involvement by mantle cell lymphoma, with atypical lymphoid infiltrates compromising 60-70% of marrow cellularity.
She was admitted for C2 part A of hyperCVAD on [**2147-9-29**] and did well, except for pancytopenia and frequent blood transfusions which delayed the start of part B.
She had a bone marrow biopsy prior to initiating therapy which showed no further lymphoma in her marrow.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY # Diabetes mellitus # HTN # s/p R knee surgery # s/p TAH/BSO for fibroid uterus and fam hx of ovarian cancer # s/p C-sections X 2 # s/p appendectomy  Social History: Patient is staying at the Hope Lodge and her husband is currently traveling in [**Country 16573**].
Sister died of alcoholic liver cirrhosis; antoher sister died of ovarian cancer at age 60 yrs.
No known history of blood disorders, hemoglobinopathies.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam at Admission:  VS: 99 116 105/51 25 100%RA Gen: Ill appearing female HEENT: MM dry, mucositis CV: Tachy S1+S2, no murmurs appreciated Pulm: CTAB Abd: S/ND, not firm, mild TTP throughout.
No rebound or guarding.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
No free air is present.
A moderate amount of stool is seen throughout the colon.
IMPRESSION: No free air or obstruction.
There is no evidence of complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 25145**] is a 61-year-old woman with a PMH significant for mantle cell lymphoma C2D11 R-hyperCVAD admitted to the BMT floor for fever and C.difficile colitis, then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension.
# Sepsis: Patient not fluid responsive after receiving 5L IVF prior to ICU transfer.
Most likely source is C.diff colitis, and given clinical worsening would be concerned for typhlitis or toxic megacolon.
There was no pressor requirement.
Discussed with Radiology, given KUB without distended colon or free air, no additional information to be gained by CTAP.
# Mantle cell lymphoma: No evidence of residual lymphoma on her most recent bone marrow biopsy.
Fever resolved with antibiotics and neutropenia resolved with G-CSF.
# Acute renal failure: Likely poor renal perfusion from hypotension.
# Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to chemotherapy with component of hemodilution from 5+L IVF.
Hemolysis and DIC labs negative.
# Mucositis: Likely secondary to chemotherapy (received high dose methotrexate and ara-C).
Improved with gelclair, magic mouthwash and pain control.
8. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea, insomnia.
[**Last Name (Titles) **]:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 10. alum-mag hydroxide-simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Febrile neutropenia 2.
Clostridium difficile infection 4.
Mantle cell lymphoma  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for neutropenic fever and treatment of your C. diffile infection.
You received multiple antibiotics; eventually your fever came down and you were transferred back to the BMT floor.
You also had some episodes of left flank pain, likely due to your spleen being enlarged and irritating your diaphragm.
