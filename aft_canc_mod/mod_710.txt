She denies fever, chills, sweats, cough, increased sputum production.
Of note, two days prior to admission, the pt had a CT scan of her torso that revealed progression of her disease throughout, including interval progression in abnormal pulmonary densities involving all lobes.
- History of mild asthma, inhalers not used for several years.
- recent pericardial effusion/tamponade - right pleural effusion - large common femoral DVT - adenocarcinoma of unclear primary   Social History: She worked as a nursing assistant.
Family History: Her father died of stomach cancer at age 72.
Mother died of colon cancer at age 63.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Tachypneic, speaking in [**3-16**] word sentences, pain well-controlled, lying in bed HEENT: dry MM, CARD: Tachycardic RESP: Using accessory mucles ABD: Mildly distended and tympanic, nontender, decreased bowel sounds EXT: Warm, well-perfused, 2+ DP pulses bilaterally; no pedal edema.
Reports: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2181-12-1**] 11:49 PM SINGLE AP UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: As seen on CT of the chest from one day prior, there are multiple large loculated pleural effusions, which appear roughly stable compared to one day prior.
There are bibasilar fluffy opacities, right greater than left, consistent with pneumonia as seen on CT from one day prior.
The pulmonary vasculature is engorged and there is perihilar haziness and increased interstitial markings, consistent with mild- to-moderate pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with prominence of the left hilum due to a component of loculated effusion.
Bibasilar opacities, consistent with pneumonia as seen on CT from one day prior.
Mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.
Persistent large loculated pleural effusions.
Low limb lead voltage.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change .
Sinus tachycardia.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
Non-specific T wave abnormalities.
Since previous tracing of [**2181-12-1**] no significant change.
No definite right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
female with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary first diagnosed in [**2181-5-10**] from percardiocentesis fluid cytology, recent cycle of capcitabine/irinotecan, history of PE/DVT s/P IVC filter and enoxparin therapy, and SVT secondary to malignancy, who was admitted from the ED to ICU for recurrent respiratory distress and tachycardia.
Given this, along with progression of disease on CT imaging in spite of receiving chemotherapy, it was eventually determined by primary oncology team and patient's family to pursue comfort measures only.
Secondary to disease progression, pleural & pericardial effusions.
She was continued nebulizers and Morphine elixir prn for comfort.
Continue lorazepam for anxiety .
# leaky foley, dysuria, and groin rash: She was briefly on cipro, but it was discontinued as her UCx was negative.
She was switched to a silicon foley and given urojet, pyridium, and antibiotic ointment which resulted in mild symptomatic improvement.
She was given ditropan with minimal improvement and the caliber of her foley was increased with no improvement.
The next step may be removing the foley, but she has been resistent to this so far both because of the dysuria and because of reluctance to wear adult diapers.
In addition, she has what looks like an incontinence rash in her groin, which should be treated with barrier cream (mupirocin [**Hospital1 **]), sarna prn, and keeping her as dry as possible.
She may need an antifungal if her rash begins to look fungal.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Secondary diagnosis: HTN Asthma DVT s/p IVC filter placement h/o pleural and pericardial effusions   Discharge Condition: Good.
Pain is under control.
Urethritis stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
You were in the ICU originally and were treated empirically for pneumonia, volume overload and COPD/asthma exacerbation as it was unclear what was causing your symptoms.
Your symptoms are most likely due to disease progression.
You were noted to have urethritis and pain, likely partially due to your foley cathether.
There was no evidence of infection.
