REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    please biopsy liver lesion for diagnosis    Final Report HISTORY: Colon cancer, now with suspicious hepatic masses on MRI, for biopsy.
Preliminary son[**Name (NI) 493**] interrogation demonstrates visualization of a somewhat subtle, heterogeneous lesion at the inferior right hepatic lobe which corresponds to the MRI findings.
Under son[**Name (NI) 493**] guidance, an 18-gauge Bard biopsy system was advanced to the lesion within the inferior right hepatic lobe, and a single core sample was obtained.
Pathology was present, and the sample demonstrated clusters of atypical cells.
There were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of an inferior right lobe hepatic mass previously seen on MRI.
Minute distorted focus of poorly differentiated carcinoma (see RC L1).
Focal mild portal and lobular mixed inflammation.
Focal bile ductule proliferation associated with neutrophils.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted to surgery with RUQ pain and leukocytosis.She was placed on IV antibiotics, made NPO and IVF.
Anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K. CT and MRI done to evaluate hepatic lesions, which were determined to be metastatic in appearance.
On HD5, liver biopsy was done to confirm diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer.
