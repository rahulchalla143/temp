Admission Date:  [**2191-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-12-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Warfarin / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: Patient being transferred with mediastinal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: FNA of mediastinal mass Bronchoscopy Intubation with mechanical ventilation Tracheostomy surgical biospy of mediastinal mass  History of Present Illness: 89F italian speaking woman with COPD, HTN, DM who presented to outside hospital on [**2191-11-3**] with increasing shortness of breath cough and wheezing.
As per outside records, she had a cough productive of yellow sputum associated with shortness of breath for approximately 2 months.
On CT Chest she was found to have a large mediastinal mass deviating the trachea to the right, heterogeneous in nature suggestive of goiter with left hilar LAD and left lower consolidation with air bronchograms suggestive of post obstructive pneumonia.
Course was complicated by afib requiring transient Dilt gtt and ARF with elevation fo Cr to 4.0 on [**2191-11-9**].
Patient had a renal US without evidence of renal stones and renal lytes suggestive of a pre-renal etiology.
Patient did not require intubation and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation   Past Medical History: NIDDM COPD HTN Dyslipidemia Bronchitis Gout   Social History: Nonsmoker, occassional EtOH  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals - T:96.6 BP:92/39 HR:101 RR:24 02 sat: VENT Setting: AC 24x400 Fio2 1.0 PEEP 5 GENERAL: intubated and sedated SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes HEENT: AT/NC, supple neck, no LAD, no JVD CARDIAC: irregularly irregular, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: wheezes in all lung fields, poor air movement.
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a large vascular left thyroid nodule without immediate complication.
No right thyroid lobe.
CXR admission: IMPRESSION: Improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
Incompletely imaged heterogenous soft tissue mass containing  calcifications extending along the left thoracic inlet and upper retrosternal region causing compression and rightward deviation of the trachea.
The mass does not appear to invade mediastinal structures.
Diagnostic considerations include a large thyroid mass or multinodular goiter with retrosternal component, much less likely a thymic lesion.
Peribronchiolar nodular opacities and ground-glass attenuation in the posterior right upper lobe may represent evolving infectious etiology or aspiration.
Left lower lobe collapse with opacification of the left lower lobe bronchus.
Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is advised to exclude an endobronchial lesion or extrinsic compression at the left hilum.
2.0 cm ill-defined low attenuation in the upper pole of the right kidney, which is incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Evaluation for metastatic disease limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
If there is high clinical concern, further characterization with contrast enhanced MRI or CT is recommended.
Moderate cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular ischemic change.
Left upper ex U/S [**11-18**]: DVT involving both brachial veins and the basilic vein along the catheter.
Discharge CXR: There is overall increase in perihilar haziness and vascular engorgement suggesting volume overload/pulmonary edema.
No change in the bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 89F with COPD, HTN, DM, with mediatinal mass s/p intubation on arrival for airway protection and s/p extubation on [**2191-11-22**] and reintubation for excessive secretions on [**2191-11-24**].
She has large mediastinal mass with is c/w papillary thyroid ca follicular type.
# Mediastinal Mass: Head/Torso CT negative for possible metastatic disease, although done without contrast.
Then, during trach placement, had biopsy which showed papillary thyroid cancer, follicular type.
She developed a MRSA pneumonia and had tracheitis with [**Female First Name (un) **].
She was also on a prednisone taper for COPD (last dose 11/8).
# DVT from LUEx PICC and right CVL IJ: treated with heparin gtt until platelets fell.
We monitored her for several days after coumadin given and saw no allx reaction.
# Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of heparin and vanc, and improving since Vanc has been discontinued.
# Pneumonia: She presented from the OSH with a diagnosis of post-obstructive pneumonia and in the midst of a 14 day course of levo/flagyl.
Also received fluconazole for tracheitis and vanco for MRSA PNA (8d).
Then had recurrent sputum pos for MRSA PNA so started on linezolid on [**11-27**].
# Afib: Patient with new afib since admission to OSH.
She intermittently was in afib with RVR requiring dilt gtt and increasing doses of dilt PO.
# Fluid overload: she developed increasing pulm edema just prior to d/c.
#ARF: Patient with ARF on admission, likely pre-renal and improved.
#COPD: Patient without PFTs in our system; Treated with nebs and a steroid taper.
We avoided albuterol for a few days prior to d/c given her afib with RVR .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: papillary thryoid cancer, follicular type pulmonary edema deep vein thrombosis atrial fibrillation pneumonia .
Secondary: hypertension COPD diabetes type 2   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer and will need to follow up with endocrine and thoracic surgery.
You had respiratory failure which required tracheotomy.
