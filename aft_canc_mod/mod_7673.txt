He notes that he has been feeling increasingly fatigued over the past few weeks.
He was visiting another priest at BC today and walked up the stairs, after which he felt very weak and short of breath.
On review of systems, he does note a weight loss of 25 pounds over the past year - he was trying to lose weight but feels that he lost too much.
Family History: Brother died of pancreatic cancer.
On EGD there was not significant bleeding noted but a large, fungating mass w/ulceration was found at the superior portion of the stomach and was thought to be the source of the bleeding.
He was given 3 units of pRBCs and his hct remained stable without further evidence of gross bleeding.
Subsequent CT scan of torso on [**2119-3-26**] revealed a large 7cm mass involving head/tail of pancreas, invading the posterior portion of the stomach and encasing the splenic artery.
There were also hypodense nodules noted in the left lower lobe of the lung and the liver, suspicious for mets.
GI recommended an IR guided biopsy of liver/lung masses to determine staging of presumed pancreatic cancer.
However, the questionable mets were considered too small for percutaneous biopsy.
While on the floor, he was followed by GI who decided to attemped an EUS-guided biopsy of the gastric lesion, since biopsy of the liver and lung lesions was not possible.
IR performed a RUQ US which showed that what was previously thought to be a metastatic lesion was actually a simple cyst, making metastasis unlikely, but also not yielding a tissue biopsy.
As a result, a repeat EUS-guided biopsy was attempted and was successful, with FNA of the gastric mass.
Per report, the appearance of the mass was suggestive of a GIST, though pancreatic malignancy couldn't be ruled out.
The patient received one additional unit of PRBCs before discharge for a slowly decreasing hematocrit and was discharged with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who performed the EUS-guided biopsy, for results and appropriate triage to surgery and or heme/onc.
