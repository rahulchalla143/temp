Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2157-4-23**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       YEAST.

[**Year/Month/Day **] CULTURE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: A 71yo F with PMH acute myelogenous leukemia, neutropenic fever, throid goiter, admitted to OMED service for neutropenic fever found to have right upper lobe infiltrate, she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, her course was complicated by acute renal failure after discussion with patient and family dialysis was declined and the decision was made to provide comfort care was made.
She developed uremia and expired with her family at the bedside.
# Goals of care: The patient developed acute renal failure and uremia.
She developed uremia, hyprekalemia, hyponatraimia and expired on the morning of hospital day 13 with her family at the bedside.
# Neutropenic fever: patient was admitted with neutorpenic fever and no clear source of infection she was initially continued on aztreonam/vanc with continuation of home acyclovir and fluconazole.
Fevers persisted; Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Given persistant fevers and lack of source, CT Torso was performed [**2157-4-19**] and showed a right upper lobe pneumonia that was new from her last scan in [**Month (only) 404**].
Bronchoscopy was attempted, but could not be done in the procedure suite as there was significant narrowing of the trachea from compression by her goiter.
Fever curve trended downwards, but serial chest xray showed interval increase in the size of the PNA.
Voriconazole was changed to ambisome, and levofloxacin was added for atypical coverage.
Gram stain showed gram positive rods which were likely [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13607**], negative for PCP.
She completed a course of levofloxacin for atypical pneumonia and antibiotics were narrowed to vanco/meropenem.
# Hyponatremia: Na began to trend downward on [**2157-4-19**].
Initially thought to be hypovolemia given diaphoresis and poor po intake, but after hydration Na continued to fall.
Her sodium improved mildly however she became anuric and free water could not be mobilized.
# Acute renal insufficiency: Creatinine trended up on [**2157-4-23**] believed to be related to a combination of AML and ATN from nephrotoxic antibiotics.
Hyponatremia worsened as she became increasingly  hypervolemic, she developed uremia and hyperkalemia.
Cause of death is attributed to acute renal failure.
# Pancytopenia: Patient was transfusion dependent related to AML and bone marrow failure.
