She says that she felt well when she developed gradual onset of shortness of breath which was worse with exertion and lying flat.
Denies any chest pain or palpitations.
Of note, she has a history of pericardial effusion found on Echo performed in [**Month (only) **] of this year as a prelude to a cardiac stress test.
At [**Last Name (un) 26580**], she had a repeat ECHO which showed a large pericardial effusion measuring 4cm posteriorly and 3cm anteriorly.
Her vital signs remained stable (124/70's and a HR 60-90's afib) and she was transferred for pericardiocentesis and further work-up of the effusion.
Given her elevated INR (4.1) she received 10mg of SQ Vit K as well as a repeat Echo prior to transfer.
Patient denies any BRBPR, or other abnormal bleeding.
She had a colonoscopy this year and had a polyp excised, but it was otherwise normal.
On review of systems, she does have a history of myalgias and joint pains (chronic, has hx of OA), black stools in the setting of iron supplementation, mild cough (non-productive), and syncope, last episode in [**2123**].
She also recently has some R leg swelling for which she had an U/S performed but she does not know the results.
The swelling has since resolved.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, recent syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: labile HTN chronic A fib (on coumadin) Hx of vasovagal syncope Non-Hogkin's Lymphoma (diagnosed in [**2122**], s/p XRT) Hx of compression fracture of the spine GERD diverticulosis chronic diarrhea (followed by GI, on lomotil) Osteoarthritis fractured R shoulder [**2122**] s/p abdominal hysterectomy at age 68 s/p tonsil and adenoid surgery in [**2054**] .
Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia (not on statin [**1-23**] myalgias), Hypertension  Social History: Widowed, lives with son and daughter-in-law.
There is no no history of alcohol abuse but + occaisional drinks.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Pulses paradoxus is ~8 Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or xanthomas.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion measuring 0.9cm around the inferior and inferolateral left ventricle with minimal effusion around the apex and anterior right ventricle.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Pulsis paradoxus is difficult to assess due to atrial fibrillation.
Right heart catheterization prior to pericardiocentesis shows elevated and equalized diastolic pressure which were equal to the pericardial pressure (for details see above).
Left ventricular filling pressure remains elevated and unchanged with (22mmHg) greater than RVEDP (14mmHg) suggesting underlying diastolic dysfunction.
Pulmonary hypertension with PA systolic pressure of 49mmHg prior to pericardiocentesis and 56mmHg after pericardiocentesis.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. pericardial tamponade.
4. possible co-existing constrictive physiology.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 82 [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 76663**] RN with hx of non-hodgkins lymphoma, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, labile HTN, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety who is transferred from [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital for pericardiocentesis of symptomatic pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.
Her INR was 1.8 when she was sent to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis with 1 unit of FFP to be given in the holding area.
Underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1100cc of bloody fluid with resolution of tamponade.
Residual 0.9mm effusion noted on post-procedure ECHO.
Drain in place overnight with minimal output.
Patient discharged to home shortness of breath resolved.
Urine culture + for pansensitive E. coli.
She has a history of recurrent yeast infections with antibiotics.
