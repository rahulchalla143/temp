Hematology/Oncology:  Given the patient's recent intracranial bleeds due to thrombocytopenia, there was a high level of concern for doing further consolidation chemotherapy, given the risk of thrombocytopenia associated with that, leading to further bleeding in the brain.
Lumbar puncture had been considered to rule out central leukemia and, prior to doing the lumbar puncture, re-imaging of the brain was performed to look for any central lesions, any increased intracranial pressure secondary to hydrocephalus, and also to look for any structural defects which may have predisposed to the bleeding.
This scan was performed on [**2154-12-3**], which revealed a "possibility of an abnormal vessel within the region of the mesencephalic hemorrhage."
This finding raised the question of a tiny vascular malformation, although the report said it was to be emphasized that no identification of such a lesion is achievable on the other pulse sequences.
If, in fact, a structural lesion was present as a cause of the bleed, repair of that lesion, if possible, was felt to reduce the risk of further chemotherapy.
Therefore, Interventional Neuroradiology as well as Neurosurgery were consulted to comment on the possibility of a vascular malformation and possible treatment options.
She had some side effects of nausea and vomiting on day two of that protocol, but had no other side effects from it.
Neurosurgery recommended keeping the patient's platelets greater than 25 at their nadir to help prevent further bleeding in the brain due to thrombocytopenia.
Her right pupil remained fixed and dilated, but her bilateral ptosis slowly improved, more so on the left than the right.
Because she was only seeing through one eye, she did have some problems with depth perception, and required assistance when walking, but she was able to ambulate independently.
She was able to copy complex diagrams and write her name legibly.
She was able to perform rapid alternating movements and rapid repetitive movements very well.
She did continue throughout to show signs of frontal disinhibition, in which she would speak aggressively at times without much care being taken with what she said, and she would often climb out of bed without assistance, requiring a sitter to be present in her room around the clock for safety purposes.
No lumbar puncture was ever performed to rule out CNS leukemia, as the suspicion for that was very low.
Again her platelets will be followed very closely with transfusions to keep them greater than 25,000 in the hopes of preventing further bleeding in the future.
Infectious Disease:  At the request of the Infectious Disease consult team, the abdomen was re-scanned with MRI and the chest was CT scanned to rule out or to look for interval change in the presumed fungal infection.
The abdomen MRI was performed on [**2154-12-4**] and revealed multiple rounded lesions within the spleen, not significantly changed in size or number or signal characteristics over the interval.
These lesions were felt to most likely represent hemangiomas vs leukemic infiltrates, although fungal infection remained a possibility.
The CT of the chest showed some dependent atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally, but no focal parenchymal consolidations.
There were no other abnormalities seen on the chest CT.  Infectious Disease continued to follow the patient throughout her hospitalization.
Infectious Disease ultimately recommended planning to complete a total of six weeks of AmBisome and then repeating MRI for interval change after that period of time.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  After coming out of the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's electrolytes became much more easy to manage and required very little repletion of either potassium or magnesium.
She tolerated an oral diet without any difficulty, and had no signs or symptoms of aspiration.
