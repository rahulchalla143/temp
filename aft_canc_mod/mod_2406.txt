Admission Date:  [**2136-1-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-2-14**]   Service:  Neurosurgery  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Decreased memory and difficulty finding words.
The patient denied any fevers, chills, headache, sore throat, ear pain, earache, visual blurring, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.
He further denied any dysuria, focal numbness, weakness or rash.
Aspirin  ALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies to medications.
He has a positive past history of cigarette smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL:  Well developed, well nourished Italian speaking white male in no acute distress.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythmic without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no evidence of wheeze, rales, rhonchi or accessory muscle use.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, soft with no guarding, rebound or mass appreciated.
An MRI showed heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left posterior frontal parietal lobe with a smaller satellite nodule at the left periatrial location abutting the left lateral ventricle.
There was mild mass effect with effacement of the left lateral ventricle, but no significant midline shift.
Due to these findings and the history of decreased memory, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital on the morning of [**2136-1-20**] at which time he was taken to the operating room where, under a general endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent a craniotomy and subtotal excision of the enhancing lesion.
A repeat head CT scan on the [**1-24**] showed a small amount of blood products in the area of the tumor bed and cavity of the tumor with some mild residual ring enhancement.
However, there was no indication for further surgery.
A neuro-oncology consult was obtained on the [**1-25**] and the patient exhibited a brief episode of unresponsiveness with a deep drop in his blood pressure to systolics of 70s while he was sitting on the bed pan for bowel movement.
An electrocardiogram was done which showed T-wave inversions in lead AVL.
He otherwise did fine from this and there were no further electrocardiogram changes.
On the morning of the 15th, the patient was noted to initially be afebrile with vital signs stable.
He had a mild to moderate persistence of a right hemiparesis that was first noted after surgery.
His lungs were clear, however a CTA of the chest was obtained which did reveal a saddle embolus and therefore the interventional radiology department was consulted and this lead to a thrombectomy and IVC filter.
On the morning of the 16th, he had a brief episode of decreased responsiveness.
A head CT was obtained, but showed no change in the tumor bed or condition of the brain and the patient became much more responsive later in the day and remained stable.
He was seen in consultation in the x-ray therapy department on the [**1-31**] for evaluation and initial planning and measurements for planned external beam radiotherapy to be begun in an outpatient manner.
The patient remained hospitalized with mildly waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] responsiveness and alertness.
However, on the [**2-6**], due to bouts of respiratory failure, the patient was intubated urgently and readmitted to the neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit in acute respiratory distress and after discussion with the family, the patient was then heparinized for prophylactic treatment to avoid further risk of deep venous thrombosis or embolus.
The patient had been given a PEG tube for tube feedings and nutritional support prior to discharge and on the morning of the [**1-16**], he was noted to be awake, alert, afebrile with vital signs stable.
He continued to show a right dense hemiparesis, had a slightly wet cough but with stable O2 saturations in the mid 90s.
Status post saddle emboli, status post embolectomy and inferior vena cava filter placement.
