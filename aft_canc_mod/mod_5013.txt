Admission Date:  [**2149-10-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-10-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-9-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Transesophageal echocardiography   History of Present Illness: 61 y M with a history of metastatic lung cancer to his right hip, liver (with question as to whether the lung is primary) being treated with carboplatin and gemcytabine (last dose 11/3) who was in his usual state of health until [**2149-10-8**] when he began to feel weak.
He felt progressively weaker and felt dizzy on [**2149-10-10**].
He had no shortness of breath or chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or other symptoms.
On [**2149-10-11**] he  had loose stool containing red blood clots.
No black or tarry stools, no hematemesis or hematuria.
He went to [**Hospital3 3583**], where he was found to have a Hct on presentation of 13.4 (one week earlier it had been 34.)
He underwent a tagged RBC scan which reportedly revealed blood in the R side of the abdomen, felt likely to be in the R colon, although not believed to be a brisk or large bleed.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for a discussion of possible IR embolization versus colonoscopy versus surgical options.
A tagged RBC scan showed no evidence of active gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
He received a colonoscopy once his neutropenia ([**1-2**] chemotherapy) resolved, which showed cecal ulcers (radiation vs. ischemia vs. Crohn's), sigmoid diverticulosis, internal hemmorhoids, but no bleeding.
An EGD showed patchy gastritis, few small erosions in duodenal bulb, believed to be unlikely to rebleed.
No other complaints.
Past Medical History: - lung ca metastatic to R hip/liver: Oncologist = [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 50949**] [**0-0-**] - lymphoma in R groin lymph node s/p resection in [**2146**] - s/p R lung lobectomy [**2146**] - PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Tagged RBC scan [**2149-10-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of active gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Additional delayed or repeat imaging may be useful if the patient later shows clinical signs of active bleeding.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Patchy erythema and granularity of the mucosa were noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with patchy gastritis.
Impression: Erythema and granularity in the antrum compatible with patchy gastritis A few small erosins in the distal bulb and anterior bulb Recommendations: Patient unlikely to rebleed from these lesions.
Check serology for H. pylori.
Colonoscopy: Findings:  Protruding Lesions Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Excavated Lesions A few diverticula with small openings were seen in the sigmoid colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Lesion could be secondary to ischemia, radiation damage or Crohn's disease .
CXR [**2149-10-15**]: FINDINGS: Compared with 11/13, there is a new vague opacity seen just lateral to the right hilar mass.
This could represent aspiration or infiltrate.
CT CHEST [**2152-10-18**]: Findings are most consistent with pulmonary, hepatic, and adrenal metastatic disease with concomittant pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Diffuse tiny lung nodules can also be seen with disseminated infection.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
There is partial collapse of the right middle lobe likely incident to airway compression and narrowing.
A tagged RBC scan suggested a right-sided colonic source.
An EGD showed patchy gastritis and a few small erosions in duodenal bulb, which did not appear to be a likely source of the bleeding.
Given the results of the tagged RBC scan, the most likely source of bleeding seemed to be the cecal ulcers ([**1-2**] radiation vs. ischemia vs. Crohn's).
Given his abnormal coagulation studies, we held heparin for DVT prophylaxis (he did wear pneumoboots).
# Pancytopenia.
By the time of discharge, the patient was no longer pancytopenic.
After endoscopy, the patient had a fever at 101.2.
He developed a mild cough productive of yellow sputum, and a CXR suggested an aspiration or infiltrate.
In addition, the patient had a Foley for several days and a U/A was mildly positive with trace leuks, [**2-2**] RBC, [**5-10**] WBC, and few bacteria.
A urine Cx taken [**2149-10-15**] grew enterococci and coag neg staph.
Overnight he became tachycardic and hypotensive with a few runs of NSVT.
His vital signs responded well to small fluid boluses.
There was a question of a post-obstructive pneumonia that was discussed with radiology and interventional pulmonology.
Upon further discussion, this was ruled out and deemed to be a small narrowing of the right middle lobe bronchus with subsegmental collapse of the lobe.
They recommended IV vancomycin and cefepime for 14 days and then subsequent blood cultures to ensure that the bacteria was cleared from the blood.
They also recommended echocardiography of the heart (most TTE and TEE) in order to make sure there were no vegetations on the heart valves.
Both a TTE and a TEE were performed which on preliminary read showed no vegetations on the valves.
He continued to have significant pain which impaired his ability to ambulate, so we increased his dose of oxycontin to and treated him with oxycodone prn.
By the time of discharge, he felt that his pain was at its baseline.
While at home, he will follow his temperatures and contact his PMD if his temperature elevates above 100.0.

Bacteremia .
Lung cancer with metastasis to right hip and liver 2.
Lymphoma s/p resection 3. s/p right lung lobectomy   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You have been hospitalized for gastrointestinal bleeding.
You initially had a low white count and low platelet count, but these counts recovered into the normal range after a few days.
Your bleeding was most likely from the right side of your colon.
A colonoscopy showed ulcers, diverticulosis (small weakenings of the colon wall), and hemorrhoids.
An upper endoscopy showed mild inflammation in your stomach and small erosions in your duodenum.
You also had a fever and a cough.
You were intially treated with an antibiotic, levaquin, for the concern that this might be an early lung infection, urinary tract infection, or infection in your blood.
You then developed signs of an infection of your blood and your blood cultures showed an infection.
***  Do call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have more bleeding, weakness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, or other concerning symptoms.
Discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 50949**] changing your pain management regimen.
