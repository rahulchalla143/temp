Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo male status post CCY/ileostomy takedown, MRSA/Klebsiella PNA status post completed treatment with vancomycin/meropenem returns with development of large left pleural effusion.
* PLEURAL EFFUSIONs:  Patient had on previous admission had known bilateral pleural effusions, R>L, and had undergone thoracentesis with removal of 2L of fluid from the right pleural space consistent with an exudate which was thought at the time to be secondary to parapneumonic effusion as the patient was still being treated for MRSA/Klebsiella pneumonia.
Left-sided pleural effusion was not intervened upon.
During this admission, patient underwent multiple procedures for removal of pleural effusions, however was immediately restarted on vancomycin/meropenem for empiric treatment of the previous klebsiella/MRSA pneumonia.
Serosanguinous fluid, although consistent with exudative effusion was sterile.
A second attempt made under ultrasound guidance was only able to obtain 250cc of fluid, and radiologists commented upon loculations noted in the effusion, and repeat CT chest revealed continued massive pleural effusion despite initial thoracentesis.
However, patient continued to have return of pleural effusions causing respiratory distress and returned to OR for two additional chest tubes, complicated again by hypotension requiring several liters of fluid and several units of blood.
* LACTIC ACIDOSIS/HYPOTENSION:  At the time of admission, patient's systolic blood pressure was approximately 100, which was significantly lower than his baseline, which normally required anti-hypertensives for control.
While patient was initially given fluids for and blood to improve perfusion, patient became acutely hypoxic and short of breath overnight, concerning for congestive heart failure.
Therefore, patient was then treated with diuresis and fluid restriction, which in turn induced hypotension and a rise in lactate, which peaked at 3.0.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy, with decreased filling, as well as possible decreased filling secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure due to the large left pleural effusion.
Consistent with this, following placement of chest tube and blood transfusion, patient's blood pressures improved dramatically (to SBP 130's), lactate dropped below 1, and creatinine improved, suggesting that pleural effusion was impairing appropriate cardiac output.
However, following administration of second dose of intrathoracic tPA and drainage of right upper quadrant abdominal abscess, patient became acutely hypotensive, concerning for sepsis.
There, patient was found to have an extremely low central venous pressure, and patient was repleted with blood and fluids and responded appropriately.
Of note, patient's FeNa at different times during initial admission suggested both pre- and intra- renal failure.
Given the fact that patient's lactate began to rise, it was felt that increased perfusion of tissues with fluid and blood support was necessary.
However, patient became hypotensive secondary to blood loss following chest tube placement, and patient's creatinine was elevated and became oliguric.
* ABDOMINAL ABSCESS: An air-fluid level was noted on multiple chest xrays at the time of admission, but was initially thought to be due to dilated loop of bowel on the right upper quadrant.
The fluid, however, was significant for only neutrophils, but no microorganisms.
Ultimately, however, cultures grew out Klebsiella and vancomycin resistant Enterococci, and patient was treated with meropenem and linezolid with good effect.
