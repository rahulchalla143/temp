Right lower lobe opacity is likely due to pneumonic consolidation.
Asymmetric interstitial prominence probably due to edema.
CTH:  No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Please note that MRI with gadolinium would be significantly more sensitive for metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 11480**] is an 87 year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on hospice who presents with altered mental status, fever, and leukocytosis likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
Patient became progressively hypotensive and hypoxic and expired shortly thereafter.
1.Altered mental status: Patient has underlying vascular dementia.
Given her fever and tacchycardia with CXR demonstrating a focal infiltrate, likely secondary to pneumonia.
Pt is also volume depleted which can contribute.
Head CT negative for midline shift, hemorrhage or metastatic disease.
Neuro exam not suggestive of acute stroke.
No e/o seizure.
Hypercarbia is only mild.
CXR concerning for worsening pleural effusion/infiltrate on right side.
Patient given levoflxoacin and clindamycin presumed aspiration pna given her mental status.
Hypoxia: Patient uses supplemental oxygen at home due to her underlying lung disease (lung cancer and copd).
Acute renal failure: In setting of infection and poor oral intake, likely pre-renal.
This is further supported by elevated BUN and hematocrit well above her baseline.
History of marginal zone lymphoma treated with fludarabine/Rituxan [**2168**]-[**2169**].
No active issues at this time.
History of hemolytic anemia status post splenectomy in [**2171**].
