States he easily loses his balance, has fallen almost daily, and has had increased difficulty with walking.
He has hit his head on 2 fall occasions, but no LOC.
Was seen at his PCP last evening who ordered a Head CT - this demonstrated a Right frontal rim enhancing lesion with hemorrhagic component and mass effect.
He currently has no complaints; specifically, no headache, nauea, double vision, or problems with speech.
Small Cell Lung CA [**2160**], s/p chemo and XRT 2.
[**2128**] with subtle left sided weakness 3.
Slight L facial droop.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No pronator drift.
Left nasolabial flattening.
A large hemorrhagic mass with vasogenic edema causing 5.4 mm leftward subfalcine herniation in the right frontal lobe measuring up to 3 cm.
Area of hypoattenuation compatible with vasogenic edema likely from a second metastasis in the left parieto-temporal region.
Right-sided hydropneumothorax with a small right apical pneumothorax and a moderate right-sided effusion.
Severe volume loss in the right lower lobe.
No definite evidence of persistent nodular enhancement in the resection cavity.
Focal area of nodular restricted diffusion along the posterior margin of the resection cavity may be related to surgery.
Extra-axial fluid layering along the convexities of both hemispheres.
Expected postoperative changes in the right frontal region as above.
A chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion/low lung volume and hydropneumothorax.
CT/CXR reports from [**12-24**] did not reveal history of pneurmothorax.
MRI Brain showed a large Right frontal lesion and left temporal parietal edema.
Ct torso showed adrenal thickening and lung abnormalities.
Subsequent work up revealed that the patient had developed a right pleural effusion.
Cytology from the pleural effusion did not reveal evidence of metastasis.
There was a cystic portion of the mass that was sent for cytology and the remaining portion was resected without difficulty.
Cytology from thoracentesis showed 2+ POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES- Infectious Disease recommended no further intervention as this was seen to be contaminate.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
