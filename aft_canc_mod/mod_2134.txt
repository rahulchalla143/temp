Given the patient's chronic steroid use and hypotension she was started on stress dose steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency.
Her symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain raised suspicion for an intrabdominal source, however her R PICC line was notably painful and erythematous and therefore thought to be the most likely source of infection.
And she was started on Vancomycin IV Serial blood cultures later grew coagulase positive Staphylococcus sp sensitive to vancomycin.
She was transferred to the BMT floor where an upper extremity doppler ultrasound revealed total occlusion of the axillary vein extending into the cephalic vein.
She conituned to have fevers to 103 thought secondary to poor antibiotic penetration into the infected thrombus.
TTE was obtained and did not reveal any valvular vegetations.
She was changed back to fluconazole for antifungal prophylaxis.
Etiology of ureteral obstruction was thought secondary to fibroid uterus vs. retroperitoneal fibrosis as paraneoplastic syndrome.
#) Diarrhea- Thought to be due to chemotherapy.
CT scan revealed perinephric fat stranding .
Bone marrow aspirate revealed wide spread infiltration with blast cells and peripheral smear prior to discharge revealed 10% blast cells.
#) Heme- found to have anti-HLA B7 and B27 antibodies and required matched platelet transfusions.
#) F/E/N- Started on TPN during admission + neutropenic diet.
