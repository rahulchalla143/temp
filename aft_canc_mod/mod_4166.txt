Admission Date:  [**2153-5-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-1-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefaclor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**] Chief Complaint: Confusion, fevers, right eye vision loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture TEE  History of Present Illness: This is a 60-year-old woman with CLL, recently hospitalized for anemia and fatigue, who presents today with severe headache, blurry vision, high fever, and confusion.
About 1-year-ago, blood work at PCP's office showed evidence of hematologic malignancy.
Patient decided to forgo traditional work-up and treatment at that time and instead pursued homeopathic remedies with a naturalist (including injections of [**7-18**]-X compound).
According to her husband, patient was doing well until about 1 month ago when she noticed profound shortness of breath and fatigue.
Patient still refused treatment (was seen by psychiatry to evaluate competence) but agreed to continue following with heme/onc service.
She took her temperatures on a few occasions, and had readings as high as 102.
On day of admission patient developed a profound headache and blurry vision/central vision loss in her right eye.
Also noticed crusted lesions on her lower lip.
However, according to ED notes, patient spiked a fever as high as 105.
A code stroke was called in context of acutely abnormal neuro exam; CTA head showed possible filling defect in MCA territory.
Neuro was also concerned about possibility of septic emboli on CT and recommended MRI.
ROS:  Unable to obtain, as patient is alternately agitated and somnolent and unable to answer questions appropriately.
Family History: Mother: Breast cancer Father: [**Name (NI) **] cancer Sister: [**Name (NI) **] cancer No family history of myeloproliferative/lymphproliferative disorders, easy bruising or easy bleeding.
No FH or leukemia or lymphoma  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 102.2 BP: 124/66 P: 113 R: 33 SPO2: 94% 3L General: lethargic, moderate respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, multiple crusted lesions on bottom lip.
CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  firm, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, +BS, non tender, nondistended.
GU: foley Ext: trace edema  Pertinent Results: EEG [**6-2**]:: This continuous record for a period of approximately five hours showed mild diffuse encephalopathy changes along with a focal abnormality over the right central region that was, at times, somewhat rhythmic suggesting there may be a convulsive component to it but also suggestive of structural pathology and rare independent slowing and sharp slow activity was noted from the left anterior sylvian region.
EEG [**6-1**]:: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta and delta frequencies reaching up to [**6-11**] Hz.
There were frequent periods of right hemispheric delta slowing as well as less frequent periods of bihemispheric delta activity.
Seizure detection files also showed artifact as well as rhythmic delta activity.
No electrographic seizures were seen on this recording and no epileptiform discharges were noted.
EEG [**5-31**]:  This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It captured one clear electrographic seizure correlated with twitches of the left arm and tremor of the head.
This seizure had an onset in the right parasagittal area and spread bilaterally.
In addition, there were long periods of right PLEDs with a parasagittal predominance during the first half of the recording.
During the second half of the recording, the activity was nearly normal during sleep and wakefulness with intermittent focal slowing in the right parasagittal region suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in that area.
No acute hemorrhage or ischemic stroke.
Possible pachymeningeal thickening/enhancement along the frontotemporal meninges and falx.
The differential for this is broad including infectious, autoimmune/inflammatory and more remote neoplastic etiology.
Questionable small fluid level in the left lateral ventricle which does not appear hemorrhagic, though other proteinaceous material may be present.
CSF [**2153-5-24**]: Abundant neutrophils, lymphocytes and some macrophages, consistent with acute menigitis.
ECHO [**2153-5-29**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen.
No PFO or ASD.
# FEVERS/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: # S. Pneumonia Meningitis # Necrotic Lymphadenopathy # Seizure Disorder   Clinical picture and lumbar puncture consistent with meningitis; this is an immunocompromised patient with high fevers, altered mental status, and abnormal neurologic exam.
Blood and CSF cultures were positive for strep pneumonia, while HSV was suspected (had herpetic lip lesion).
CT imaging of the neck revealed large, necrotic lymphadenopathy, presumably related to an intense lymphatic reaction to systemic disease.
TEE was negative for vegetations.
Continuous EEG, while at first unrevealing, ultimately found evidence of seizures.
RIGHT FACIAL DROOP/?RIGHT SIDED-NEGLECT:  Upon first presentation, a code stroke was called due to a right facial droop, right eye blindness, and question of right-sided neglect.
A CTA of patient's head showed a question of an MCA infarct.
However, a subsequent MRI showed no evidence of acute ischemia.
There was also concern for septic emboli to the brain from a valvular vegetation; however, this was ruled out by TEE.
As such, it was decided that Ms. [**Known lastname 85166**] did not have a stroke.
Multiple fundoscopic exams consistent with retinal hemorrhage.
On [**2153-6-6**], after having a stable eye exam over the course of her hospitalization, patient had acutely painful and injected eye.
Instead they have pursued herbal treatments that involved the daily injection of homeopathic preparations into the subcutaneous tissue of the groin (brand name 714-X).
Tachycardia resolved with treatment of infection and fluid resuscitation.
Alprazolam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for anxiety.
Right eye vision loss and possible endophthalmitis 3.
Seizures   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
We found an infection in your blood and cerebral spinal fluid.
You had problems with your right eye as well and had a procedure requiring close follow-up with an eye doctor.
Return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, pain with urination, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.
Please call them if you have any concerns or do not hear from them somehow.
