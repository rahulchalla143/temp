Admission Date:  [**2197-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2144-10-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma stage II, status post radiation in [**2187**] who was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma with fine-needle aspiration in [**2196-6-6**] after CT scan revealed a right lung mass in the setting of elevated tumor marker with CEA up to 16.4.
The CT revealed a mass of 2.5 cm by 5 cm in the right upper lobe.
She had a PET scan which staged cancer as stage III A or B at [**Hospital3 7778**].
She had three runs of chemo which was stopped in [**2196-8-7**] secondary to hemolytic anemia but she did complete a course of XRT.
She has been hospitalized at an outside hospital several times since [**2196-10-7**] for recurrent episodes of fevers, progressive pulmonary infiltrates and most recently intractable nausea and vomiting.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was initially thought to have radiation-induced pneumonitis for which she was treated with steroids, but she also received Levaquin for presumptive pneumonia.
She has been on steroids for chemo-induced hemolytic anemia and radiation-induced pneumonitis.
She also received several transfusions for hemolytic anemia.
On [**2196-12-15**], she had bronchioloalveolar lavage which revealed Aspergillus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and possible atypical Mycobacteria.
Hyphae was seen in cytology but the path was not sufficient for evaluation of invasive Aspergillus.
Her AFB studies had remained negative until bronchoalveolar lavage on [**2197-1-4**] which grew out positive atypical Mycobacteria (Gordonii) for which she was started on itraconazole on [**2196-12-17**] for possible invasive aspergillosis.
She was switched to Amphotericin B on [**2196-12-31**] secondary to failure to improve.
She was also started on triple regimen on [**2197-1-4**] for atypical Mycobacteria infection.
The triple regimen included Rifabutin, ethambutol, and Clarithromycin, but the CT scan showed progressive cavitary lesions in the upper right lower lobe and dense consolidation in the base of right lower lobe.
She was started on vancomycin on [**2196-12-31**] after acute aspiration episode but the vancomycin was discontinued on [**2197-1-2**].
Her most recent admission to the outside hospital on [**2196-12-25**] was notable for intractable nausea and vomiting.
She continued to have intermittent fevers and a persistent productive cough of greenish sputum with right-sided chest pain but without hemoptysis.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of the right lower lobe process including possible open lung biopsy.
She had repeated fine-needle aspiration of the right lower lobe cavitary lesion but the results were inconclusive.
She continued to have intermittent fevers and a persistent productive cough with right-sided chest pain.
voriconazole for possible invasive aspergillosis.
Unfortunately, the patient went into respiratory failure in the early morning of [**2197-1-20**].
However, the patient continued to deteriorate and required pressors for blood pressure support.
