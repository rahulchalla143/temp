HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: thick, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: center below umbilicus towards the left lower quadrant tense erythematous hot area extremely sensitive to even light touch.
Ostomy bag located in right lower quadrant with bright light green liquid stool no blood.
active bowel sounds GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
A limited noncontrast examination of the lower abdomen was performed which again demonstrated a 4.6 x 8.1 cm (axial)air and fluid collection in the anterior abdominal wall near the midline.
The collection has increased slightly from the CT of 24 hours previously.
Note is made of some curvinear hyperdense material lying dependently within the fluid collection.
A sample was sent for microbiological assesment.
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no early complications.
50cc of purulent fluid was removed and a sample was sent for laboratory assesment.
The collection contains hyperdense material which is of uncertain etiology but may represent delayed accumulation of oral contrast from the CT of 24 hours previously.
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well with no early complications.
This again showed an anterior abdominal wall collection with measuring 4.9 x 7.2 cm (series 2, image 32).
The small bowel stoma limb runs adjacent to this (series 2, image 32).
Trace free fluid is noted within the pelvis.
Moderate sedation was provided by the radiology nursing staff using divided doses of midazolam 1.5 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg with a total intraservice time of 10 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

# Abdominal wall fistula secondary to Crohns - prior admission c/f bowel herniation noted small amount of air in anterior abdominal wall; on current presentation this area had enlarged forming a large 5x6cm abscess cavity.
Likely from GI source, c/f enterocutaneous fistula as pt has history of crohns.
Pt presented in sepsis due to this infection see below.
Initially concern for necrotizing fasciitis and she was started on vanc/zosyn and clindamycin.
However, following this procedure the patient had leakage around the drain and thus the general surgery team exchanged this drain at the bedside.
The site is draining large amounts of loose fecal drainage.
A Coloplast pouch has been placed over the drain site and is intact.
# Sepsis/(leukocytosis and fever) -  Pt with leukocytosis, fever, tachypnea and tachycardia meeting all SIRS criteria, furthermore with known source (see abdominal wall abscess, above).
Pt also presented with hypotension see below.
For sepsis was started on vanc/zosyn/clinda see abscess above.
# Acute on chronic anemia - HCT is 35 up on presentation from last admission 28-32.
This was felt to be hemoconcentration in the setting of hypotension but must remain suspicious for bleeding particularly given hypotension and h/o BRB per ostomy during admission 1 month ago.
MCV is chronically in low 100s suggesting a large component of this is nutritional deficiency which seems logical in setting of diverting ileostomy and diarrhea.
Bilirubin was normal and it was felt hemolysis was less likely.
These elevations were felt attributable to the setting of acute infectious process; LFTs wnl with exception of slighly elevated alk phos.
# Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine 1.5 on admission from 0.9 at time of last discharge 1 month ago, from prior baseline approximately 0.6.
Felt to be likely prerenal or possibly ATN in setting of hypotension.
#hypomagnesemia - mg of 1.1 on arrival.
Likely [**3-11**] diarrhea longstanding.
In setting of persistent diarrhea likely decreased nutritional status also does not have colonic function.
# elevated alk phos at 141, other LFTs wnl.
# Reactive thrombocytosis - PLTs at 885 on admission up from 300s 1 month ago.
Decreased with fluid resuscitation and treatment of infection .
#DMII - on metformin at home and insulin lantus + SSI humalog.
Metformin was held as pt required contrast for CT guided abscess drainage.
# H/o asthma: No evidence for acute exacerbation, although slight expiratory wheeze at bases of lungs on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# HLD: Continued statin.
