Physical Exam: Physical Exam on ICU admission: Vitals: T: 97.1 BP:152/58 P: 87-97 R:12 18 O2: 100% 1L Gen: NAD, AAOx2-3 HEENT: moist mm, EOMI grossly, OP clear Neck: Supple CV: +s1+s2 RRR, II/VI SEM Resp: Mild crackles at bases bilaterally, no rales/wheezes Abd: +bs, well-healing midline incision, soft, NTND, no rebound or guarding, no palpable masses.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to knees, chronic venous statis changes, LE warm and well perfused, faint DP pulses bilaterally.
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
There are small bilateral pleural effusions which are stable.
S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar airspace opacities, slightly worse on the right, likely reflective of atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**2130-3-31**]: Evaluation of visceral organs is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis are unchanged.
Pleural based hyperdensity within the right lung base is unchanged.
Extensive coronary calcifications are noted.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Moderate amount of ascitesis unchanged from [**2130-3-21**] exam.
Focal calcifications of the liver and spleen, likely represent prior granulomatous disease.
The pancreas and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, most likely renal cysts, unchanged.
There is no evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Intra-abdominal aorta is notable for calcified atherosclerotic disease without aneurysmal changes.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
The rectum, bladder, and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
Moderate sized fat-containing right inguinal hernia appears unchanged.
There is no free air within the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
In comparison to [**2130-3-21**] exam, there are no significant change in moderate amount of ascites within the abdomen and pelvis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis, unchanged.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Calcific aortic valve disease with mild stenosis/mild regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Very small pericardial effusion.
On the left, the internal jugular vein is notable for isoechoic endoluminal contents and that vessel is incompletely compressible and shows only partial flow on color Doppler analysis, consistent with non-occlusive thrombus.
The second left brachial vein shows absent compressibility and no flow on color Doppler analysis.
The cephalic vein is not identified, though note is made of subcutaneous edema in the expected region of the cephalic vein.
IMPRESSION: Left deep venous thrombosis involving the internal jugular and brachial veins.
EKG: Old t wave inversion in I and AVL   Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old woman who presented from [**Hospital3 **] for high INR (5.3), HCT of 16.9, and no clear source of bleeding.
She had no clear GI bleeding.
She had recent laparotomy for perforation of duodenal ulcer at OSH on [**2130-3-10**] so initially there was concern for possible intraabdominal bleed.
CT torso showed no evidence of internal bleeding.
With normal bilirubin, elevated hapto and only marginally elevated LDH hemolysis seemed unlikely.
The exact cause of her presenting anemia remained unclear.
She received one dose of coumadin 2.5 mg on [**4-2**] while in the ICU for history of DVT.
They felt that the increase was due to coumadin, given recent antibiotics use and poor nutritional status.
In regards to her upper extremity DVT, it was line-associated and has been anticoagulated since then.
She had persistent pyuria in urine and several cultures showed yeast.
This admission our ICU initiated fluconazole, but we have since discontinued it due to above INR issues.
The patient had stage IV renal failure and hyperkalemia from Losartan.
Her discharge was delayed because of hyperkalemia and her discharge potassium was 5.0.
Her home lasix was held at nursing facility but we increased the dose as she had severe edema up to the chest wall and hypoalbuminemia (anasarca; bilateral pleural efusions and ascites).
We found no portal hypertesnion or thrombosis on ultrasound and no liver cirrhosis.
The patient has a recent history of pancreatitis/pancreatic head enlargement on ultrasound from prior admission 1/[**2130**].
Ultrasound mentions multiple pancreatic cystic structures which may be related to pseudocyst formation and/or previously characterized side branch IPMN.
Her PCP was also notified of these findings although she has been unable to see him lately because of her stays in rehab.
We also diagnosed her with stage III decubitus ulcer upon admission.
She had no clinical wound infection.
Potassium should be monitored with her low potassium diet.
8. calcium carbonate 200 mg (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for GI upset.
11. polyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**2-5**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
deep venous thrombosis of upper extremity Type II DM without treatment pancreatic lesion stage III decubitus ulcer hyperkalemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with anemia (low red blood count) and abnormal labs that showed your blood was too thin.
A CT scan showed no sign of bleeding in your abdomen, and your stool was also negative for blood.
A review of your prior imaging studies from  your [**2130-2-4**] admission for pancreatitis also showed an ultrasound with some cystic changes and enlargement in an area of your pancreas.
Please follow up with your PCP in regards to your potassium, Losartan, need for Aspirin, and anemia  Followup Instructions: The patient needs GI follow-up for pancreatic changes with possible IPMN (tumor) mentioned on ultrasound [**2-/2130**] if family and patient want to pursue it further.
