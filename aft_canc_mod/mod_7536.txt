Admission Date:  [**2200-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-4-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Terazosin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 107336**] is an 84 yo man with a high-grade cardiac B-cell lymphoma for which he is now undergoing R-[**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy and a history of COPD, DVT s/p IVC filter, and pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation in [**2-27**].
He explains that very light activity, such as changing his clothes or walking short distances, has resulted in significant shortness of breath.
He denies cough, sputum production, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and swelling/pain of the arms or legs.
During the first several minutesof is Emergency Department course, he developed rapidly increasing work of breathing.
A CXR demonstrated no evidence ofpneumonia or effusion; furthermore, an echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion.
Due to progressive respiratorydistress without hypoxia, he was started on BiPAP.
Despite a fairly normal blood gas and presumbaly secondary to worsening dyspnea and tachynpnea, pt was started on BIPAP which he tolerated during his transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY =================== -Presented [**12-30**] with right atrial mass, biopsy showed aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (CD20+, bcl-2 and bcl-6 positive in subset, and c-myc arrangement; negative for cytokeratins, CD138, bcl-1, bcl-6, and CD10; MIB fraction 95-100%.
No other sites of disease were identified by torso CT and bone marrow biopsy.
CT scans are suggestive of persisting disease.
Left Peroneal DVT s/p IVC filter placement [**1-27**] 3.
COPD 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Hypertension 6.
History of anxiety 7.
History of rib fracture 8.
History of silent MI [**7-29**] 9.
Left Shoulder Weakness 10.
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy  Social History: Retired after career in the airlines.
There is no focal pulmonary consolidation.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No pulmonary embolism.
New small consolidation at right lung base may represent pneumonic consolidation or, in the setting of airway secretions, aspiration.
Perhaps slight decrease in size of cardiac mass compared to CT from [**2200-3-26**], with persistent mass effect on superior vena cava.
No change in size of right adrenal mass and right lower lobe lung nodule.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year-old M with high-grade cardiac lymphoma (left atrial mass), currently receiving treatment (cycle 4,day 15) with R-[**Hospital1 **] who presented from home with low-grade fevers and progressive dyspnea.
# Dyspnea / Tachypnea:  Ruled out for PE with chest CTA.
However, these antibiotics were discontinued the following morning as the RRVS came back positive for parainfluenza type 3 and the patient remained afebrile overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without a significant leukocytosis.
The patient also ruled in for a cardiac event (see below) with a decrease in his EF, which may have also contributed to his sensation of dyspnea; however, his films were not impressive for pulmonary edema.
# Positive Cardiac Biomarkers: On admission, pt with troponin to 0.23, CK 123, MB 16, and MBI 13.0.
Cardiology was consulted and TTE revealed newly depressed LVEF 30-35% with akinesis of the apex and distal LV.
Per cardiology, this may be consistent with Takosubo's cardiomyopathy.
TTE was also notable for 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]R as well as depressed RV free wall contractility.
Heparin gtt was continued mostly secondary to pt's akinetic distal LV rather than out of concern for ACS.
ACE-I had not yet been initiated due to pt's borderline BPs.
Given slightly borderline systolic BPs in mid 90s, pt was given 250 cc IVF bolus with good response in SBPs to 110s.
# Cardiac lymphoma:  The patient appears to have had an excellent response to therapy to date, with a decline in his LDH and shrinkage of his cardiac mass on cardiac MRI.
# Hx of DVT: Per previous DC summary, pt has had a recent DVT in setting of ongoing malignancy and has IVC filter in place.
He is not anticoagulated as it is thought that his atrial mass may bleed and cause an acute hemmoraghic effusion.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST Eleveation Myocardial Infarction COPD exacerbation Parainfluena type 3 Cardiac Lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Medically stable for discharge home with close follow-up   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 107338**],  You were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with difficulty breathing and evidence of damage to your heart.
The difficulty breathing was probably from a respiratory virus which made your COPD worse.
If you have chest pain or any other symptoms which seriously concern you, please let your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 393**].
