Admission Date:  [**2165-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-10-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea x 8 days  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 75 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer to liver s/p lobectomy, CAD s/p MI, and CVA with residual weakness who presented to the ED with weakness.
Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**7-9**] to [**7-13**] with dx of diarrhea, NSTEMI in setting of hypovolemia and an enterococcal UTI.
He was then cardioverted with resumption of sinus rhythm and improvement of his SBP to 110s.
Past Medical History: -Colon cancer status post 5-FU and leucovorin [**1-15**] and s/p right liver lobectomy for three liver mets in [**1-16**], complicated by a bile leak with catheter removal in [**11-16**], persistent sinus tract drainage from the site.
-CAD s/p MI -Hypercholesterolemia -HTN x 10 years -CVA (left cerebellar stroke) -Glaucoma resulting in right eye blindness.
Family History: There are no strokes or neurological disorders in the family.
poor waveform Foley: 150cc Gen: NAD, slightly tachypneic HEENT: MM dry, no appreciable JVD, right eye cloudy (blind) CV: regular, with occasional ectopy Chest: decreased breath sounds at bases, no wheezes, no crackles; biliary drainage from between 8th and 9th ribs on right Abd: hypoactive bowel sounds, distended, tympanic on percussion, tender to deep palpation in RLQ Ext: 2+ edema, dopplerable pulses in all 4 extremities Neuro: moves all extremities on command, strength 4/5 throughout; AO x 2 (person, place) .
Compared to the prior, the left lung is stable but the right lung shows some density increasing towards the base and laterally suggestive of pleural fluid/thickening and increased atelectasis; followup is recommended to see if there is further progression.
Diffusely edematous small bowel is a nonspecific finding.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, perforation, or pneumatosis intestinalis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer to liver s/p lobectomy, CAD s/p MI, and CVA with residual weakness who presented to the ED on [**7-16**] with fever, weakness, diarrhea; found to have BPs in the 70s with HR in the 140s.
Of note, he had a CT abd in the ED which showed diffusely edematous bowel edema c/w enterocolitis.
On the floor, he was evaluated by GI who felt it was likely infectious vs ischemic and recommended adding cholestyramine +/- flex-sig if his diarrhea did not resolve.
He otherwise was started on a heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.
# Hypotension: Pt with increased stool output of >2L on readmission to MICU, with poor IV access and negative fluid balance.
Pt appeared hypovolemic per exam likely from combination of diarrhea, aggressive diuresis and antihypertensive medications.
# Diarrhea: Pt with persistant diarrhea that appeared to improve prior to arrival on the floor, with acute worsening prior to returning to MICU.
GI consulted on the floor; believed it represents infectious vs vascular colitis.
Despite (-) c.diff, suspicion remained high for c. diff colitis.
Ceftaz and Vanco were then started for better nosocomial gram (-), gram (+) coverage given recent hospitalizations.
GI had a high suspicion for c diff despite neg stool cultures and PO vanco was added for additional coverage.
Stool output tapered off but diarrhea did not completely resolve.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with known hx of atrial fibrillation in setting of prior dehydration and ?
pt started on anticoagulation on the floor but was held in ICU (pt with documented fall risk in prior d/c summaries).
# CAD s/p CABG: Hx of mild troponin leak during this admission in setting of hypotension and ?
ACEI was held due to hypotension and ARF.
TTE showed a small LV cavity and hyperdynamic LV with EF>75% Patient initially appeared slightly volume overloaded on CXR but was intravascularly dry given hypotension, CVP of 6cm and response to IVF.
# Acute renal failure: Likely [**2-14**] prerenal azotemia in setting of hypotension and diarrhea.
Urine lytes showed FeNa <1% consistent with prerenal azotemia.
On morning of [**7-26**] the MICU team was alerted that the patient was becoming SOB with tachypnea into 40s and hypotensive.
Throughout the morning, the patient had more frequent episodes of hypotension and respiratory distress.
After a long discussion, it was decided to make the patient CMO as he did not want to be intubated or resuscitated and he was quickly decompensating.
