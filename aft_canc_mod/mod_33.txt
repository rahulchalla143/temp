History of Present Illness: This is a 67 y.o male with bladder cancer with large pelvic masses, recent chemo tue (taxol, gemzar) now presenting with n/v/d/ new afib with RVR, metastatic disease.
HR 100-170's, not given any nodal agents for rate control.
Past Medical History: CAD HTN Hyperlipidemia ESRD on HD Bladder Cancer in [**2181**] Depression Restless Leg Syndrome   Social History: Patient lives at home with girlfriend; no smoking history, no etoh.
Family History: Dad died of CVA in his 90s, no hx of MI in family.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T. 98.2 BP 104/67, HR 115, RR 20, sat 92% on 4L GEN: lying in bed, somnolent, arousable to sternal rub, HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, s1s2 3/6 systolic flow murmur.
PULM: Lungs b/l coarse inspiratory rhonchi.
no w/r ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/2+E, no palpable cords NEURO: somnolent, squeezes hand to commands.
Multiple hepatic masses, the largest of which measures over 4 cm, and is suspicious for metastatic disease given the history.
Unchanged severe right hydronephrosis.
No gallbladder distention or CBD dilation.
Marked progression of metastatic disease, with new metastases in the liver as well as iliac and sacral bones.
Limited evaluation of the central abdomen due to marked streak artifact from numerous surgical clips.
Bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis, as well as incompletely imaged nodular opacities suspicious for metastatic disease given the history.
[**2197-11-27**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
[**2197-11-27**] LENI: IMPRESSION: Normal examination of the bilateral lower extremities.
No evidence of DVT.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are new.
Bilateral increase in interstitial markings and hilar haziness are consistent with pulmonary edema.
More confluent left lower lobe opacity could be due to pneumonia.
Incidentally, old left rib fractures are unchanged.
[**2197-11-28**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-11-27**] no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 67 y.o male with h.o bladder cancer now presenting with altered mental status and tachycardia.
No obvious explanation.
Assess for myocardial infarction.
With thrombocytopenia and prolonged INR and renal failure, a PE is less likely.
Would check A-a gradient on room air and obtain LENI's with peripheral edema.
2) Fever with neutropenia: concern about infection with neutropenia.
CXR not impressive for infiltrate but there may be slight increase in markings at right base and left base.
-neutropenic percautions.
No evidence of GI bleeding.
4) Thrombocytopenia: likely related to bone marrow suppression.
No evidence of bleeding now.
Has dry mucus membranes and decreased tissue turgor.
With renal failure, would watch bicarbonate with normal saline fluid resuscitation.
7) Altered mental status: ETiologies include intracranial mass/bleed but r/o with CT head.
Patient given narcan with some improvement.
He is on narcotics at home and may have taken extra doses or may now have delayed metabolism because of liver [**Month (only) 1364**] and abnormal LFT's.
Uremia may also be contributing to altered mental status.
-toxic metabolic w/u and correction -frequent neuro exams -antibiotics -infectious w/u -consult renal for HD.
8) Chronic renal failure: electrolytes and acid-base status acceptable.
No volume overload now.
No immediate need for dialysis.
9) Acidosis: combined anion gap acidosis, probably from uremia, and metabolic alkalosis, likely from volume depletion and vomiting.
Fen-NPO, lytes prn access-PIVs ppx-pneumoboots, PPI, bowel reg communication-pt's family code-DNR/DNI disp- ICU for now.
Will most likely go to comfort care but would like to wait a few days and see if the pt "comes out of this" ie change in MS - EKG without change -FFP 4u given in afternoon -Pt with very limited access.
Family not opposed to central access at this time but as it will excalate care at this time with risks of infxn and coagulopathy, will not place.
-CE trending down -Considered starting lactulose to possibly improve MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1364**] to liver and liver damage seen in coagulopathy but d/c'd as pt already having considerable diarrhea- C diff pending -Per renal, if family still wishes, will do HD in am -Got just 1L IVF bolus during evening.
O2 Sat 95% on 2LNC and pt putting out little uring by ostomy (must be cathed by nursing)  [**11-28**] - Family discussion -> decided to proceed with HD - bedside HD per renal yesterday - transfused 2 U with appropriate increase in Hct - Urine Cx with GNR >100K - Patient with pain in abd last night, given small dose morphine with good effect  [**11-29**] - Pt made CMO overnight.
He was also started on Ativan prn for agitation.
Secondary cause of death was metastatic bladder cancer.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Bladder Cancer.
