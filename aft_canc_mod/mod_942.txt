1)Dyspnea:  MI ruled out and CXR showed possible pneumonia.
Presentation likely multifactorial as this was typical of the patient's acute flares of mast cell degranulation syndrome exacerbations.
She does have some atalectasis vs. consolidation on cxr and reports subjective fevers, cough of green sputum recently which could be contributing.
In addition, likely combination of pain and anxiety.
She has a respiratory alkalosis which is consistent with this.
Treated mast cell degranulation with steroids, diphenhydramine, H2blockers, gastrocrom.
