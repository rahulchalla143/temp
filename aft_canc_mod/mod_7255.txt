Daughter reports that the patient had 3 falls prior to day of admission but no head trauma or LOC.
In ED neuro consulted and thought to have R midbrain CVA.
As patient was going to MRI for further evaluation of her neurological symptoms she began having an epsisode of hematemis x 1 and NGT returned red-tinged fluid.
Patient was taken for EGD and noted to have esophageal varices, gastropathy, and a variceal bleb was banded.

A neoplastic process might also be considered, but seems unlikely.
RUQ U/S: A small amount of ascites is seen in the abdomen and pelvis.
The loops of bowel are in this fluid with no convenient focus for paracentesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o female w/ HCC, ESLD, GAVE syndrome, DM2 who presented w/ L leg numbness, weakness, diploplia x 1 day who experienced 1 episode of hematemisis while being evaluated in the ER.
Weakness - patient evaluted in ER by neurology and noted to have left sided weakness and left sided facial droop consistent w/ R sided mid-brain stroke.
Head MRI demonstrated changes w/in the corpus collosum consistent w/ an ischemic or paraneoplastic process.
To further evaluate this neuro suggested an MRV or lumbar pucture.
In addition, it is unlikely that these interventions would have altered management.
GI bleed - Patient w/ one episode of GI bleeding in ER now s/p EGD w/ banding.
On the floor the patient's HCT slowly decreased secondary to slow gastric bleeding from GAVE syndrome and on HD #6 it had drifted down to 28.
She continued cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
Left sided weakness 2.
End stage liver disease   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary care doctor or go to the Emergency Room for fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, worsening mental status or for other concerns.
