Admission Date:  [**2117-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-9-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: fever.sob  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, intubation  History of Present Illness: This is a 55M with Mantle Cell Lymphoma , D+35 s/p an autologous stem cell transplant.
He was in his USOH until 2 days ago when he developed worsening non-productive cough, SOB and low grade fever.
Last week he had diarrhea which improved after he was started on Lomotil.
Last week he was also noted to have transaminitis and his fluconazole was held.
Lipoid nephrosis at age 27, resolved with prednisone 2.
Lichen Planus, resolved after chemotherapy, no h/o Hep C 3.
Past Oncology History: He was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma by bone marrow biopsy [**10-12**] when he was found to have an elevated white count on routine labs.
He has been treated with 3 cycles of hyperCVAD, first two were complicated by volume overload and hyponatremia.
His course was also complicated by splenic laceration ([**2116-12-20**]) from splenomegally secondary to neulasta and hyperleukocytosis.
There is no known family history of blood disorders or actual cancers.
No scleral icterus.
MMdry OP clear without thrush or lesions.
Lungs: +diffuse fine crackles, L>R with diffuse inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi CV: RRR S1 and S2 barely audible (above rhonchi) w/out m/r/g Abd: Soft, NT, ND, NABS, No masses.
Pertinent Results: CXR ([**7-15**]): New diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings suggestive  of an atypical infection of viral etiology in this neutropenic patient .
Diffuse bilateral consolidation of all lobes with relative sparing of the apices consistent with multifocal pneumonia or possibly ARDS.
Moderate right and small left layering pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o male on s/p autoSCT for mantle cell lymphoma who was initially admitted with fever and hypoxemia with bilateral infiltrates and effusions.
Hypoxemia On arrival to the floor, patient was sating about 90% on 4 liters.
X ray showed new diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings suggestive of an atypical infection of viral etiology.
Pulmonary was consulted who felt that the process was more likely a viral or atypical pneumonia.
CT scan showed diffuse bilateral consolidation of all lobes with relative sparing of the apices consistent with multifocal pneumonia or possibly ARDS and moderate right and small left layering pleural effusions.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**7-18**] to [**7-22**]: The pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation after developing progressive hypoxia, likely secondary to ARDS vs multifocal PNA.
An TTE with bubble study was negative for any PFO or ASD that was causing persistent hypoxemia despite adequate ventilation.
His daily CXR continued to be consistent with ARDS of unknown etiology combined with DAH.
Night prior to transfer to the floor patient spiked fevers and it was decided to continue with empiric antibiotic coverage.
of new infiltrates in x ray prior to transfer a CT was ordered.
It showed marked improvement of consolidations and septal wall thickening in comparison to the previous CT, but rapid worsening during the last three days in comparison to the chest x-ray suggest pulmonary edema.
Infectious process should also be included in the Dx.
On [**2117-7-27**] he had an episode of low sats to 88% and increase shortness of breath.
Chest X ray showed worsening bilateral pulmonary opacities with progression to frank alveolar consolidation.
Report suggested recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage or pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram was also done that showed no change LVEF >55%, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Given his persistent fevers and unclear etiology of pulmonary infiltrates pulmonary was re-consulted and Infectious disease service.
Given lack of clear of positive data from Blood cx, urine cx and BAL, it was decided to continue treating empirically for CAP, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage.
Given this rapid changes on x ray infiltrates, ID and pulmonary feel at this point that is less likely to be infectious.
Unclear what was causing his episodes of respiratory distress.
CT revealed worsening disease, B/L airspace opacities.
Pt became bradycardic and hypotensive during bronchoscopy.
Elevated LFT/Alk phosph: slightly elevated on admission.
