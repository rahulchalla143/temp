The patient has had two hospitalizations in the past week for hemoptysis, during which he was treated for right lower lobar PNA.
He was admitted on [**2131-10-7**]/11 with CT chest showing new right lower lobe opacification abutting the paraesophageal mediastinum.
There was increased right paraesophageal, hilar and left retrocural lymphadenopathy.
He underwent bronchoscopy which showed purulence in the right lower lobe, no evidence of obstruction or bleeding, culture growing gram positive cocci, and cytology negative for malignant cells.
Chest CT on [**10-10**] showed right lower lobar consolidation with central area of hypoattenuation which could reflect necrosis.
During this time, he reports having low-grade fevers, with occasional cough.
No shaking chills or drenching sweats.
CXR (PA/LAT) showed persistent but slight improved aeration of opacity with no new opacities.
On [**10-15**], the patient reportedly had ~500cc of hemoptysis while ambulating with a concomitant desaturation to the 70%s.
His hemoptysis resolved without intervention.
He was extubated without complication on [**2132-10-16**] and transferrred down to the floor on [**2132-10-17**].
Pt currently denies any shortness of breath.
Reports having a sore throat from being intubated.
Denies any lung or chest pain, but reports chronic neck pain.
States that he has had chronic neck pain since a motor vehicle accident in [**2130**], after which he has become dependent on high dose opiates (oxycontin 20mg plus hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325 tid).

ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2132-10-14**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  [**2132-10-14**] BLOOD CULTURE negative x 2  [**2132-10-18**] RAPID PLASMA REAGIN negative  [**2132-10-14**]  	Radiology	CHEST (PA & LAT) FINDINGS: There is slight improved aeration of the superior segment right lower lobe opacity previously noted.
No new focal consolidations evident.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the lower thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Persistent focal opacity involving the superior segment of the right lower lobe with slight improved aeration suggesting interval improvement.
Right pulmonary artery angiography in multiple projections.
Selective right lower lobe, third and fourth pulmonary artery branch angiography in multiple projections.
Selective bronchial artery angiography and particle embolization.
Initially under ultrasound guidance, access was obtained using a micropuncture needle into the right internal jugular vein, and pre- and post-access hard copy ultrasound images were obtained.
Next, right lower lobe branches in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe, corresponding to recent CT findings were accessed and selective third and fourth order pulmonary angiography was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French catheter and ultimately a Transcend wire and STC catheter.
Next, a 5-French angled glide catheter was advanced into the left subclavian artery, and was used to identify feeding of a dominant right bronchial artery.
Next, particle embolization with 300-500 micron Embospheres was performed to stasis.
Pulmonary artery angiography demonstrated slightly abnormal tortuous branches within the right lower lobe in the area of consolidation and inflammation.
However, no correlative finding consistent with the pseudoaneurysm seen on recent CTA was identified.
Bronchial artery angiography demonstrated a dominant right bronchial artery arising in an aberrant/variant anatomical location arising from the main left subclavian artery (also seen on prior CTA).
This was accessed, and demonstrated a dilated hypertrophied appearance consistent with this being the dominant branch supplying the area of infection/inflammation.
No definite pseudoaneurysm was identified in this branch, or evidence of extravasation.
However, given the hypertrophied appearance, this is likely the source of bleeding and this was embolized with 300-500 micron particles.
Bronchial artery angiography also identified a second, diminutive common bronchial trunk giving rise to right and left branches supplying the lower lungs.
No definite correlative finding representing that pseudoaneurysm was noted.
Of note, no contributors to the anterior spinal artery were identified on any of the angiograms performed.
Successful access and particle embolization of the dominant right bronchial artery supplying the right lower lobe.
Right hilar mass and right lower lobe opacities and left basal opacities appear to be unchanged as compared to the most recent chest radiograph.
[**2132-10-21**]	Video Swallow Evaluation  ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Pt had penetration with nectar thick liquids x 1 on a cup sip of nectar thick liquids, cleared at the height of the swallow.
He had multiple episodes of trace to mild penetration with thin liquids by cup which appeared to be related to a mild swallow delay.
On consecutive sips of thin liquid, he had reduced coordination / increase in swallow delay and had resultant mild- moderate aspiration before the swallow.
Pt was without an immediate cough but with delayed cough (question if spontaneous or cued) that was not effective at clearing the aspirate material.
He also benefits from repeat swallows to clear oral and pharyngeal residue.
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with a mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with penetration of thin and nectar thick liquids and one episode of aspiration on consecutive sips of thin liquid with ineffective spontaneous vs cued cough.
If is unclear if this is the only contributing factor to his recurrent PNAs, as he also reports occasional episodes of emesis overnight and frequent reflux for which he is medicated.
Medications whole with apple sauce or pudding   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2132-10-14**] with persistent hemoptysis (his third episode), this time he c/o ~2 cups of bright red blood witnessed in the ED.
He was taken to IR where no definite source of bleeding was found.
After IR, bronchoscopy was performed and no obvious site of bleeding was observed.
On the morning of the [**10-16**], the patient was extubated without difficulty.
Presumably due to pneumonia but malignancy cannot be ruled out.
CT chest showed a question of necrosis in R lower lobe given repeated infections / pneumonias and perhaps inflammation induced erosion through a bronchial vessel.
Ddx also includes vascular malformations or vasculitis, especially in light of chronic poorly explained history of long-term glomerulonephritis.
Pt also had a workup for chronic RLL pneumonias, including negative HIV, a speech and swallow eval that showed only minimal aspiration w/ taking large gulps.
Our speech and swallow specialists recommended some behavioral modification but no dietary restrictions (see previous sheet for details).
They also agreed with utility of gastric motility study, which Pt will need to have scheduled as an outpatient, to be arranged by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] his prior intermittent episodes of vomiting during sleep.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
No evidence of active cardiac ischemia, ECG unchanged.
Holding aspirin in setting of acute bleed.
Began tapering sertraline by 50mg q4-7 days per psych recs for bleeding risk, currently on 100mg daily since [**10-16**].
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable.
# Chronic pain:  continued on home oxycontin and vicodin.
No pain on discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Further work-up as dictated by pulmonary specialists to continue to evaluate for possible underlying malignancy.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -hemoptysis -right lower lobe pulmonary consolidation -mild aspiration   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had several diagnostic tests, which showed that you continued to have a disease process in the lower lobe of your right lung.
You had a rigid bronchoscopy and pulmonary artery angiography and embolization procedure to find and stop the bleeding in your lung.
Your red blood cell counts remained stable for several days and you did not show any signs of acute bleeding.
The exact cause of your symptoms remains unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 100401**] include severe recurrent right lower lobe pneumonia, the inflammation from which may have caused erosion through a lung blood vessel.
Other possibilities include a lung cancer or blood vessel disease.
Your recurrent pneumonias may also be related to aspiration when you eat or to regurgitation of food from you stomach due to poor motility.
They recommended a normal diet with the following precautions: a) single sips of liquids only- no consecutive sips b) swallow 2 x's for each bite and sip c) follow solids with a sip of liquid if you feel residue in your throat d) limit mixed consistencies w/ liquids and solids (cereal with milk, chicken noodle soup)- if eating them, drain the liquid from the spoon and eat solids first, followed by liquids, and medications whole with apple sauce or pudding.
You will need to have a gastric motility study arranged by your primary care physician since you state that you have been intermittently vomiting up food at night onto your pillow.
