The patient was originally admitted last week for her pneumonia, at which point her only abdominal complaint was diarrhea.
The patient had had persistent fevers and chills and was planned for a CT A/P this am.
This morning the patient had acute onset severe abdominal pain, worsening throughout the day.
She has continued to have some diarrhea.
She had a previous lactate of 1.0, and has not had significant recent weight loss.
Her last colonoscopy was 3 years ago with diverticulosis, but no other major findings.
The CT scan obtained showed free air in the abdomen with a possible perforation in the transverse colon.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2103-11-29**]):    NO GROWTH.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2103-11-28**]):  POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
Left      basilar atelectasis or consolidation and small pleural effusions are      again demonstrated.
Additional small patchy pulmonary opacities are      improved.
Widely scattered atherosclerotic calcification      including coronary artery calcification is again demonstrated.
ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: There is interval development of free air with a moderate amount of gas beneath the right hemidiaphragm and scattered small pockets of gas      in the mesentery.
The patient is status-post cholecystectomy.
There      is no focal hepatic lesion.
There is an inhomogeneous mass-like density off of      the posterior aspect of the right kidney.
There are      prominent retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes as well as      clearly enlarged left iliac lymph nodes.
There are degenerative changes in the spine.
No suspicious osteolytic or      osteoblastic lesion is identified.
IMPRESSION:      # PNEUMOPERITONEUM.
IN THE ABSENCE OF A HISTORY OF RECENT SURGERY OR      INVASIVE PROCEDURE, THIS SUGGESTS BOWEL PERFORATION.
# THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME THICKENING OF THE COLONIC WALL ALTHOUGH  THIS [**Month (only) **] BE DUE TO UNDERDISTENTION.
IS THERE CLINICAL EVIDENCE FOR COLITIS ?
# MILD ASCITES.
# SPLENOMEGALY.
# RIGHT RENAL MASS SUSPICIOUS FOR TUMOR.
ENLARGEMENT OF THE RIGHT RENAL VEIN [**Month (only) **] BE DUE TO TUMOR THROMBUS.
# RETROPERITONEAL AND LEFT ILIAC LYMPHADENOPATHY.
# SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.
BILATERAL SUBSEGMENTAL ATELECTASIS AND      POSSIBLE PULMONARY CONSOLIDATION CONSISTENT WITH PNEUMONIA.
Right renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus in the right renal vein and IVC as was seen on the torso CT of [**Location (un) 620**] of [**2103-11-15**].
No hydronephrosis is seen bilaterally.
There are abnormal bilateral arterial waveforms of uncertain significance as there is absent antegrade flow in diastole seen throughout.
It is unclear whether this is due to technical factors.
Preserved gross arterial and venous flow is seen within each kidney.
Bilateral lower extremity venous dopplers ([**2103-11-20**])- No DVT in both lower extremities.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is (at least) mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular function appears to be preserved but is difficult to assess given poor acoustic windows.
Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic funcction.
Probable mass in IVC at 4.5 cm from junction with right atrium.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion and minimal left pleural effusion associated with lower lung atelectasis are unchanged and hilar contours are stable.
No new lung opacities concerning for pneumonia.
New right PICC line terminates at mid SVC, no pneumothorax.
Mild-to-moderate right and minimal left pleural effusions are unchanged.
Allowing for this, heart size is borderline with left ventricular configuration.
There is patchy opacity at the left base and a small left effusion, raising concern for a left base pneumonic infiltrate.
IMPRESSION: Small left effusion and increased opacity over the left lower lobe, suspicious for a left lower lobe infiltrate.
LABS on discharge: WBC 10.9 Hgb 8.3 Hct 26.1 Plts 123 Na 139 K 4.1 Cl 102 CO2 26 BUN 71 Cr 1.5 Gluc 108   AGap=15 Ca: 7.6 Mg: 2.2 P: 3.7  Studies on Discharge: None   Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo F with coronary artery disease, s/p CABG x 4, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronic diastolic heart failure, initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] with recurrent multilobar pneumonia.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and course was complicated by acute diverticulitis with sigmoid perforation requring sigmoidectomy and Hartmann's pouch, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and supraventricular tachycardia.
Supraventricular tachycardia: Patient was tachycardic following procedure.
Patient was evaluated for pulmonary embolism with LENIs (negative for DVT) and TTE (negative for right heart strain).
A CTA was deferred in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
Tachycardia persisted, and was noted to be supraventricular tachycardia.
Patient was given bolus doses of adenosine and labetolol without improvement.
Following cardioversion, patient was in sinus rhythm with frequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
In addition, she was also having episodes of bradycardia down to 30s, which appeared to be both sinus and junctional escape.
Carvedilol was discontinued on [**11-29**], due to concern for heart block.
She was asymptomatic during both tachy and bradycardic episodes, and blood pressures remained stable.
Supraventricular tachycardia resolved, and patient was discharged on metoprolol 25mg TID and amiodarone 200mg daily.
Diverticulitis c/b perforation requring sigmoidectomy and Hartmann's pouch: Patient recovered well from initial procedure, and was tolerating diet at the time of discharge with good stool/flatus output into ostomy.
Laparotomy scar did not fully close, and had pus requiring irrigation.
The wound appeared clean without further drainage or surrounding erythema.
RENAL MASS: Patient had an incidental finding of a renal mass with concern for extension into the SVC.
Urology was consulted and suggested better investigation with MRI, which was deferred in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure.
She and her husband discussed this at length with the palliative care team, and continued to agree for no further investigation.
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: This occurred following surgery and was treated with aggressive diuresis with lasix drip.
She had a transudative pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis with improvement in oxygenation.
Patient has a history of recurrent multilobar pneumonias, for which she was initially admitted to the hospital and treated with vanc/zosyn.
She also had three weeks of diarrhea prior to admission, treated empirically with flagyl.
Patient had a new LLL opacity on CXR, and was started on vancomycin and zosyn on [**2103-12-3**] to treat health care associated pneumonia for 8 days.
