Overall patient had an uncomplicated laparoscopic/thoracoscopic esophagogastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy that was complicated by a pseudomonas pneumonia requiring prolonged intubation, antibiotics and chest tubes; atrial fibrillation requiring diltiazem drip; as well as persistent delirium.
At the time of discharge delirium, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation had resolved.
Procedure went well without complications.
Initially unable to extubate due to thick sputum and increased secretions.
Then extubation continued due to pseudomonas pneumonia.
CT scan [**9-17**] showed RLL and LL consolidation and bilateral pleural effusion.
A left chest tube was placed on [**2115-9-24**] for respiratory distress and persistent left sided pleural effusion and removed on [**2115-10-1**].
Right chest tube placed on [**2115-10-5**] for a pleural effusion.
Patient readmitted to SICU on [**2115-10-30**] (POD#49) for respiratory distress.
Chest CT demonstrated no acute change.
Upon transfer to floor patient remained very agitated, disoriented, and unable to sleep.
Psychiatry was consulted on [**2115-10-28**](POD#47) and formally diagnosed patient with delirium and recommended checking TSH, B12, folate, and head CT. All of these tests were unremarkable except for TSH which showed patient to be hypothyroid.
Sensorium began to clear on the night of [**2115-11-14**] (POD#64) with patient no longer requiring a sitter and increasing orientation.
They recommended continued 150 mg [**Date Range **] Seroquel with possible wean starting next week.
Bedside swallowing evaluations on [**2115-10-24**] demonstrated aspiration of thin and thick liquids and video swallow test also showed patient to be at risk for aspiration.
6) Cardiac: Developed atrial fibrillation in the early post-operative period which was treated with diltiazem gtt and Lopressor.
Patient developed prolonged QT most likely secondary to Haldol and had at least one run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Patient had episode of lateral wall ischemia and RBBB on [**2115-11-2**] POD#52 with small rise in troponin.
Cardiology, however, believed that patient suffered only mild heart damage.
Changed to Zosyn on [**2115-9-14**] for pseudomonas positive sputum cultures on [**9-13**] and [**9-14**] with gentamycin added on [**2115-9-18**].
Sputum cultures continued to grow pseudomonas on [**2115-9-23**] and bronchoalveolar lavage culture from [**2115-9-26**] also grew pseudomonas.
Flagyl was started on [**9-21**] empirically for possible C. difficile colitis and was subsequently stopped on [**2115-9-24**] following three negative C. difficile stool toxin tests.
Vancomycin and meropenem were restarted on [**2115-10-30**] (POD#50) empirically for respiratory distress.
8) Tubes/Lines/Drains: Patient had multiple central lines, arterial lines, PICC lines, chest tubes, and JP drains.
Patient diagnosed with dry eyes.
1)) Endocrine: Patient diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started on Synthroid on [**2115-11-14**] (POD#64).
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
ML(s)   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Barrett's esophagus pseudomonas pneumonia pleural effusion delirium atrial fibrillation hypothryoidism  Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Please continue keeping the patient NPO until it is determined via swallow study that he is not aspirating.
