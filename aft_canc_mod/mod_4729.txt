Admission Date:  [**2117-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-1-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lorazepam  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Worsening abdominal pain, poor PO intake, worsening back pain, right vision loss  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: 00Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old male with a history of metastatic NSCLC with KRAS mutation, metastatic to bone.
He is s/p Carboplatin and Pemetrexed [**Date range (3) 88828**], maintenance Pemetrexed (s/p 5 cycles, POD [**2117-2-24**] CT), s/p DF/HCC protocol 11-302 randomized to the arm receiving GSK1120212 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2 activation and kinase activity) and is also s/p palliative radiation to low back for metastatic disease of the vertebra.
He presents with increasing lower back pain despite attempts to control with fentanyl patch and narcotics at home.
Previous PET scans have shown increased FDG avidity in the right ischial tuberosity and left L5 vertebral body and pedicle compatible with known metastases.
Pain frequently radiates down his legs.
He also presents with poor PO intake over the last several weeks (he thinks he has lost 10 lbs over this time period) and a burning, epigastric sensation after eating.
He denies vomiting but states that his PO intake has decreased dramatically secondary to the epigastric pain.
Otherwise, he also has discovered a progressive loss of vision in his right eye.
He does not describe an acute event but feels he's had a gradual loss over the week.
No pain or erythema associated with this event.
Otherwise, review of systems is positive for a mildly productive cough.
No chest pain, chest pressure.
Pain was controlled in house with fentanyl patch and dialudid.
Patiet had an aspiration event following a bout of cough.
Pt had three triggers for hypoxia and required 10L of face mask for some time to maintain sats.
Past Surgical history: [**2116-6-22**]: VATS with RUL biopsy and wedge resection of right lung mass  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**12/2115**] developed hacking productive cough, [**4-/2116**] became worse, occasional hemoptysis and Patient presented to [**Hospital3 35296**] Hospital ED where he underwent CXR [**2116-5-22**] revealing a RUL mass lesion with central cavitation.
There is extensive right hilar and pericarinal adenopathy with circumferential compression of the bronchus intermedius and RUL bronchus.
Besides an isolated nonspecific 3 mm nodule in the LUL and extensive coronary artery calcifications, the restof the chest is unremarkable.
- [**2116-6-22**] underwent OSH bronchoscopy showing fullness in the area bt the RUL and the right main stem bronchus near the carina with initial biopsies nondiagnostic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 88829**]).
- [**2116-6-22**] OSH VATS with RUL biopsy and wedge resection of right lung mass (4 X 2 X 1.5 cm fragmented lung tissue with soft necrotic tumor mass that is about 2.5 cm in greatest diameter) diagnosed as well-differentiated bronchoalveolar carcinoma (no lymph nodes assessed, positive margins), EGFR mutation testing byIHC, EGFR not detected - [**2116-6-24**] Saw Dr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 33667**], Oncologist, at [**Hospital 27034**] Hospital in consultation for NSCLC but was unable to continue following with him for insurance issues.
Pleural fluid was + for malignant cells.
Interval decrease in the size and FDG uptake in the right apical lung mass and right hilar mass.
No new FDG avid bony metastatic disease.
- Restaging MRI of the brain [**2116-10-13**]: Unchanged size and appearance of enhancing small left frontal lobe lesion corresponding to an area with a punctate calcification seen on the recent head CT.
-Restaging PET CT [**2117-12-30**]: Overall increase in FDG-avidity of known right lung mass, hilar mass and subcarinal lymph node compatible with progression of disease.
Social History: Patient is of Italian heritage; his father is first generation and his mother emigrated to the U.S.
Single with no children.
Family History: His sister died of brain cancer at 32 yo.
Maternal Grandmother died of liver cancer at 69 yo.
Physical Exam: Admission exam VS: temp 98, HR 77, BP 100/80, RR 12, 98 % RA Gen: Caucasian male, pleasant, mildly anxious secondary to pain Neurologic:  Significantly diminished right vision loss, with poor resolution beyond [**2-12**] feet of right eye, left eye vision intact.
No loss in peripheral vision.
Neck: supple Cardiac: Nl s1/s2 RRR no murmurs appreciable Pulm: lungs clear bilaterally Abd: soft and nontender with no palpable masses Ext: no edema noted  Discharge exam Tmax: 36.3 ?????
Increase in size of the mass-like consolidation in the right upper lobe which encases and severely narrows the right main pulmonary artery as well as the right main stem bronchus and almost obliterates the superior vena cava.
Increase in size in left cavitary pulmonary nodules and right middle lobe nodules.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
[**11-5**] CXR: There is a new large right pleural effusion which has probably developed chronically since there is no contralateral mediastinal shift.
At the base of the left lung is a large region of new infiltration consisting of tiny and small lung nodules, irregular small opacities as well as a generalized increase in background density of the lung.
This may well be acute aspiration pneumonia.
New focal small lesion identified on the right parietal lobe as described above, measuring approximately 3 x 4 mm in size, with no evidence of significant edema or mass effect, suggestive of a new metastatic lesion.
The previously described punctate enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe is not clearly identified and has been decreased in size.
No other lesions are seen.

The cause was thought to be multifactorial, related to worsening invasion of metastatic NSCLC with right lobe collapse and right pleural effusion.
In addition he was thought to have a left sided aspiration pneumonia based on chest xray and increased secretions.
Prn nebs were given for any COPD component.
The patient began to desaturate and experience air hunger on [**11-7**] and was treated with hydromorphone drip at the suggestion of palliative care.
He became apneic and died on the morning of [**2117-11-9**].
# WORSENING BACK PAIN:  Likely due to worsening metastatic disease to the L spine.
He showed no signs of cord compression.
# SVC SYNDROME/SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR:  Pt on warfarin due to migration of SVC stent that was placed for SVC syndrome.
Supratherapeutic INR likely in the setting of coumadin and levofloxacin.
# POOR PO INTAKE:  Patient described significant pain with food.
No evidence of bowel obstruction on CT, however constipation seen.
# RIGHT VISUAL LOSS:  Opthalmology team did not see evidence of anatomic abnormality.
Brain MR was performed, showing new 3x4mm right parietal metastatic lesion.
# METASTATIC NSCLC: KRAS mutation positive, with mets to bone.
CT chest showing increased size and worsening invasion of the right upper lobe mass.
Known metastatic L spine disease.
MR L spine held due to pt respiratory distress.
