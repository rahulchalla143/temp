Ground-glass opacification in both lungs, right greater than left is certainly consistent with pulmonary edema.
Although heart size is normal, the configuration suggests left atrial enlargement and central pulmonary vasculature is engorged suggesting elevated left atrial pressure.
Pleural effusion is small, on the right.
No pneumothorax.
#Hypoxia - Hypoxia was felt to most likely be reflective of flash edema in the setting of breathing against a closed glottis (hydrostatic pulmonary edema).
There was signs or symptoms of infection on imaging.
This was felt to most likely represent an anesthesia effect.
As above no clear evidence of infection on exam.
Procedure went well without complication.
