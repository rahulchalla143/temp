He denied melena, diarrha, fevers or chills.
Lasix given for diuresis and nephrology consulted.

Tumor Markers: CA19-9: 37, CEA 5.7, PSA 0.4   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo m with etoh cirrhosis on regular paracentesis at baseline, presented to OSH with presumed worsened Cr (unknown baseline), hyperkalemia and worsening mental status.
In brief the patient arrived in hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and was later found to have strept viridans sbp and bacteremia.
His acute presentation slowly resolved with octreotide/midodrine/albumin, lactulose/rifaximin, and antibiotics, respectively.
In addition, he continued to have elevated blood sugars requiring insulin therapy.
He was evaluated in collaboration between the hepatology team and the transplant surgery to determine his candidacy for transplant.
His pre-transplant evaluation included multiple infectious disease serologies, non-invasive cardiac imaging, MRI/MRA of the liver, serial paracenteses, colonoscopy and EGD, tumor markers, and dental evaluation.
# Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH.
He was very confused and had displayed prominent asterixis on exam c/w hepatic encephalopathy.
# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient has a history of refractory ascites which had been managed with weekly paracenteses.
The patient had been taking levofloxacin as sbp prophylaxis at home so the <250 PMN count was still thought to represent sbp and thus merit treatment - initially with vancomycin/zosyn.
Serial diagnostic/therapeutic paracenteses were performed to follow clearance of the infection which was ultimately confirmed on [**6-28**].
Each paracentesis was accompanied with appropriate colloid replacement.
# Bacteremia:  Blood cultures drawn on admission also grew viridans streptococci.
The patient had a TTE to evaluate for endocarditis which was negative.
No oral abscess or infectious nidus was found, but 2 teeth were recommended to be removed (see "Teeth" section below).
By the time he was stabilized and transferred to the medical floor he was afebrile and remained so for the duration of his hospital stay.
The hyperkalemia was thought secondary to renal failure (see below).
# Renal Failure: The patient has a history of hepatorenal syndrome and although his baseline creatinine was unknown prior to admission, his dropping UOP, euvolemic status, and pre-renal ARF were consistent with hepatorenal syndrome.
This diagnosis was further supported by low urinary protein/creatinine ratio, bland urine sediment, negative for hepatis serologies, negative cryoglobulin and no hydronephrosis by u/s.
However, his creatinine showed some lability and concern persisted for the need for combined liver-kidney transplant.
The pre-transplant evaluation revealed no contra-indications to transplant, and the patient was placed on the transplant list.
# Hyperglycemia: The patient has no history of diabetes although he did have persistent elevated blood sugars.
A glycosylated hemoglobin was normal at 6% and the hyperglycemia was managed with insulin.
[**Name (NI) **] received extensive teaching with nursing regarding insulin administration and blood glucose measurements.
There was no evidence of blood loss or hemolysis by smear examination.
His anemia was largely attributed to his hypersplenism and underlying liver disease.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a baseline thrombocytopenia secondary to hypersplenism.
There were no precipitous declines in the platelet count to suggest HIT, but heparin products were limited in their use nonetheless.
