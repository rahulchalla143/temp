Respiratory failure - the patient was transfered from the floor to the intesive care unit s/p intubation for increased work of breathing.
Chest CT was consistent with CHF and possible pneumonia.
Lymphoma - The patient was diagnosed with primary effusion lymphoma by peritoneal cytology.
ARF - The patients Cr slowly elevated over the course of his hospital stay.
The etiology is multifactorial likely secondary to pre-renal, ATN, and hepatorenal.
Pancytopenia:  Pt has had an extensive prior workup for pancytopenia and this has been attributed to HIV itself.
Hct and Platelet count were closely monitored for signs of bleeding.
HIV/AIDS:  Pt was previously on HAART with good success but has been off HAART due to complications.
