Admission Date:  [**2112-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-3-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-11-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Ciprofloxacin / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Mechanical Ventilation.
Lumbar puncture x 2  History of Present Illness: 75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital course.
Concerning her tachycardia, patient had no known history of atrial fibrillation prior to this hospitalization, though has been having episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR starting on Friday [**2112-1-22**].
Cardiology consult was obtained on [**2112-1-27**] due to ongoing paroxysms of RVR through the weekend that were becoming difficult to control in setting of patient's mucositis.
Cardiology recommended increased frequency of IV metoprolol as well as a TTE.
Presumed atrial fibrillation with RVR to 180s this morning which responded well to a push of 10 mg IV diltiazem.
BMT team is reporting that patient is becoming symptomatic during the tachycardia with complaints of dyspnea.
They additionally are concerned that her mental status changes may be related to her tachycardia; however, she has no documented hypotension.
Her MM was initially treated with Revlimid, stopped due to question of some worsening of renal dysfunction.
She was then treated with Velcade and Decadron and had significant drop in her paraprotein.
Bone marrow on [**2111-11-30**] showed 60-70% involvement and a follow-up marrow shows 3-5% marrow involvement representing an excellent partial response.
her course in regards to her MM has been complicated by a febrile neutropenia with urine culture positive for VRE on [**2112-1-23**].
Patient has limited interaction with examiner, though denies chest pain or pressure.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: *limited due to limited patient participation in history* (+)ve: cough, mouth pain, headache (-)ve: chest pain, palpitations, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sputum production, hemoptysis, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, melena, dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, focal numbness, focal weakness, myalgias, arthralgias   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (per OMR note [**2111-5-11**], updated [**2111-12-18**] based on OMR notes and history from pt): Pt has history of multiple myeloma referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for an opinion regarding myeloma therapy in the setting of renal dysfunction by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**].
She was ultimately referred for further evaluation to hematology and was found to have an elevated immunoglobulin level with an IgG of 2638 and depression of the IgA at 16 and IgM of less than 4.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed 50% infiltration with IgG kappa restricted plasma cells.
Skeletal survey showed osteopenia without evidence of focal lytic lesions and a kappa lambda ratio of free chain assay was 22.
The patient ultimately underwent a kidney biopsy that was suggestive of myeloma kidney with evidence of light chain cast nephropathy and tubular damage, some of which was felt to be subacute.
The patient was changed to a Velcade based regimen initially with her first cycle receiving 75% of the dose in the setting of her renal dysfunction along with dexamethasone.
Although she is older than typical transplant candidate, she received high cytoxan [**2111-12-18**] in preparation for autogenic stem cell transplant.

Tobacco: None EtOH: occassional wine Illicits: Denies   Family History: She had one brother who died of [**Name (NI) 27287**] illness and one sister with a history of a blood disorder.
There is interval development of left basal opacity most likely consistent with atelectasis with potentially present small amount of pleural effusion.
No focal consolidation is demonstrated to suggest infectious process, although close monitoring of this area is recommended.
There is no evidence of volume overload.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no appreciable right pleural effusion noted.
Findings compatible with pulmonary edema likely related to recent stem cell transplant are new since prior exam.
No definite evidence of infection.
Upper extremity U/S [**2112-1-26**]: No evidence of DVT .
Moderate right, and small left layering pleural effusions, increased since the prior chest CT. 2.
Relatively symmetric bilateral airspace opacities, perihilar predominant, which may reflect infection or pulmonary edema, worse since the prior study.
Small pericardial effusion.
Nonspecific mesenteric and perinephric stranding.
MRI [**1-29**] Multiple small areas of elevated T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres and left temporal cortex.
In a patient of this age, these findings could represent prior small vessel infarcts.
If a gadolinium- enhanced examination is undertaken (provided there are no contraindications to its performance) the absence of contrast enhancement would favor infarction over infection.
Findings suggesting chronic ischemia with no findings to suggest recent infarction.
No evidence of infection.
No evidence of acute PE with limitations of study.
Moderate bilateral simple fluid pleural effusions not significantly changed from prior, with associated atelectasis and/or.
Segmental jejunal wall thickening in the left upper quadrant.
Differential diagnosis includes infection or graft versus host disease.
If there has been an episode of hypotension, ischemia should be considered.
TTE [**2112-2-18**] Left ventricular hypertrophy with small cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function.
Mild LV outflow tract obstruction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Large bilateral pleural effusions and a very small pericardial effusion.

Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient had both atrial flutter and fibrillation on telemetry.
Underlying etiology was volume overload, with worsened RVR in setting of agitation, fever, and suspected infection over course of weeks.
TTE showed mild atrial enlargement and small LV size, likely stiff and contributing to poor forward flow and volume overload.
Her digoxin was stopped because the patient had altered mental status.
One day after her digoxin was stopped, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate during a period of agitation.
Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 2 and loading the patient with Metoprolol 100 mg TID brought the patient's rate down, however, her periods of agitation caused her heart rate to increase to 150s again.
She was continued on metoprolol tartrate 100 mg TID, diltiazem, and amiodarone with maintenance of sinus rhythm.
Altered mental status: With increasing respiratory distress, the patient became very agitated.
On initial presentation to ICU, patient was agitated and she became increased agitated and delirious, to the extent that intubation was required to proceed with testing.
Ddx included infectious etiology since pt was neutropenic and febrile, medication related delirium, cerebral hemorrhage.
Head CT was negative for bleed and follow up MRI's showed small vessel infarcts but no acute process or infectious process.
When extubated, patient remained altered, although improved, and this was eventually attributed to ICU delirium.
The patient was transferred back to the oncology floors with altered mental status and agitation.
An EEG showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
Neurology felt that the patient could have suffered an anoxic brain injury.
Her delirium was likely multifactorial: drug-induced, ICU induced and possibly anoxic brain injury.
Fevers and febrile neutropenia: Patient presented with febrile neutropenia.
She received cefepime then meropenem, micafungin, acyclovir, azithromycin for febrile neutropenia.
Hypoxia: Patient with new oxygen requirement upon admission.
She required intubation on [**1-29**] for hypoxia and worsened mental status.
Patient had bilateral pleural effusions, likely due to severe diastolic dysfunction in setting of small and stiff left ventricle and volume overload.
Pt continued to fail PSV trials, likely due to AF with RVR, volume overload with pleural effusions, and poor mental status.
Acute exacerbation of diastolic dysfunction and hemodynamics: Patient had LVH on EKG and h/o hypertension.
Given difficulty assessing volume status and cardiac function, Swan-ganz catheter was placed.
Multiple Myeloma s/p autologous stem cell transplant: the patient underwent high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue.
She also had hypertension which was well controlled on diltiazem and metoprolol.
# Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea while in the ICU.
The patient continued to have diarrhea until discharge, though in smaller amounts.
Medications on Admission: -Docusate Sodium 100mg [**Hospital1 **]: PRN constipation -Lansoprazole 30 mg Tablet,Rapid Dissolve, DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 80670**] Succinate XL 25mg daily -Multivitamin daily -vitamin B6 50mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital Inpt  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Multiple myeloma -atrial fibrillation -delirium -respiratory distress .
Secondary -hypertension -urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].
You had a fast irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) which caused water to build up in your lungs.
You developed a urinary tract infection during that time treated with daptomycin.
While on the oncology floor, you developed atrial fibrillation again.
