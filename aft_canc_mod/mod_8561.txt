Admission Date:  [**2153-6-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-3-24**]   Service:  MEDICINE - [**Hospital1 **] FIRM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old white male with multiple medical problems who presents from [**Hospital6 13846**] with increasing abdominal distention and respiratory distress.
By nursing home report, the patient had been noted to have increased abdominal distention for the last 24 hours prior to admission.
Their reports deny nausea, vomiting or anorexia.

Electrocardiogram atrial fibrillation at 124 beats per minute with left axis deviation, new T-wave inversions in 1 and L.  SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In brief, the patient is an 85-year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve manipulation of unclear nature, recent Enterococcal subacute bacterial endocarditis currently on intravenous ampicillin, recent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection, currently on vancomycin intravenous, dementia, presenting with abdominal distention secondary to sigmoid volvulus and respiratory distress.
Patient transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring overnight given metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress and extreme leukocytosis concerning for pending sepsis.
The patient was followed closely with serial abdominal exams and remained with soft non tympanitic abdomen without any evidence of tenderness.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by persistent watery voluminous diarrhea.
At time of dictation, the patient has Clostridium difficile toxin x2 which are negative and third Clostridium difficile toxin pending.
The patient required large volume intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion secondary to voluminous diarrhea.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has been on intravenous vancomycin and intravenous ampicillin the last three to four weeks for a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection in [**2153-4-23**] as well as Enterococcal faecium, endocarditis (question prosthetic aortic valve versus annuloplasty of aortic valve).
The patient was markedly febrile with impressive leukocytosis at admission.
Source of infection unclear at time of admission, however highly suspect source from gastrointestinal tract, although cannot rule out line infection, genitourinary infection or other endovascular source such as prosthetic valve endocarditis given recent history.
The patient had multiple blood and urine cultures drawn during this hospital admission.
Patient had indwelling Foley for greater than two weeks at time of admission and thus Foley was discontinued and repeat urinalysis was sent which was consistent with bacterial urinary tract infection.
Vancomycin was subsequently discontinued and blood cultures remained negative for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as urinary cultures.
The patient was subsequently switched over to po Flagyl 500 mg po tid to cover possible Clostridium difficile colitis, as well as abdominal anaerobes.
The patient was continued on levofloxacin 500 mg po for coverage of gram negative urinary tract infection as well as possible intraabdominal source.
The patient was also continued on intravenous ampicillin for Enterococcal bacteremia documented in [**2153-4-23**] with question endocarditis.
As stated above, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by voluminous, watery, heme negative diarrhea with severe electrolyte disturbances.
It is unclear what the cause of this diarrhea, as all of patient's cultures and toxins have remained negative thus far.
As patient showed significant clinical improvement, he was continued on the above antibiotic regimen.
PULMONARY:  The patient's respiratory distress was likely multifactorial, including metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, congestive heart failure, abdominal distention.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient with history of coronary artery disease, status post bypass grafting of unknown anatomy.
He exhibited electrocardiogram changes, most notably rapid atrial fibrillation upon admission.
This is likely precipitated by acute infection.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarct with negative cardiac enzymes x3 with negative troponin I.
He had no further episodes of congestive heart failure.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 60s to 80s.
Anticoagulation was discussed and initially declined given patient's tenuous status and extreme fall risk.
However, long term anticoagulation should patient remain in atrial fibrillation needs to be finalized per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient is a high fall risk and this must be considered when deciding whether or not to anticoagulate patient for cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
Electrical cardioversion should be considered as patient without history of prior atrial fibrillation.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient exhibited multiple electrolyte disturbances during this admission, likely secondary to voluminous watery diarrhea.
There is also a question history of psychogenic polydipsia per patient's daughter-in-law.
Despite large volume intravenous fluid repletion with free water and half normal saline, the patient continued to exhibit hypernatremia at time of dictation.
He also exhibited severe hypokalemia which required persistent and large volume repletion, with up to 200 milliequivalents per day to maintain potassium within normal limits.
It was felt that the electrolyte disturbances were secondary to large volume diarrhea, however with questionable history of polydipsia, urine osms were sent off to evaluate for possible diabetes insipidus.
Urine osms were appropriate at approximately 500, thus not consistent with diabetes insipidus.
The patient also had severe hypophosphatemia which required intravenous repletion.
RENAL:  The patient was in acute renal failure with elevated BUN and creatinine of 1.6 at time of admission.
This subsequently resolved with intravenous fluid repletion and resolution of metabolic acidosis.
There is a history of urinary retention, especially with patient's history of prostate CA, status post radiation therapy.
It is likely there is a mechanical obstruction of some sort.
Given urinary tract infection, the patient was left without placement of Foley catheter, however the patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored for possible urinary retention in future given his history and history of multiple urinary tract infections.
ACCESS:  The patient had single lumen right subclavian central line at time of admission, of unclear duration.
However, line site was without erythema or evidence of infection and what remained in place.
The patient will require another 7 to 10 days of intravenous ampicillin for treatment of subacute bacterial endocarditis.
Also, close observation of line site is recommended for monitoring of possible line infection.
Family requires no intubation, no shocks or no CPR.
He should follow up with infectious disease clinic at [**Hospital6 11896**] prior to continuation of these antibiotics or central line, given his questionable history of subacute bacterial endocarditis with Enterococcus faecium.
Respiratory distress of multifactorial etiology including metabolic acidosis and congestive heart failure 4.
Coronary artery disease, status post bypass grafting 5.
Congestive heart failure 7.
Dementia 9.
Anemia 11.
History of Enterococcal subacute bacterial endocarditis diagnosed [**2153-4-23**] at [**Hospital6 2910**], currently on intravenous ampicillin.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection [**2153-4-23**].
Atrial fibrillation  DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to [**Hospital6 **] at time of discharge due to need for intravenous antibiotics and physical therapy.
NOTE:  There will be a discharge summary addendum following prior to discharge to qualify resolution of patient's electrolyte disturbances and diarrhea prior to discharge.
