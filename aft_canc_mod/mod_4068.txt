Admission Date:  [**2168-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-6-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-3-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a very unfortunate 31 yo male who had an initial diagnosis of metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma w/lesions in the gallbladder, biliary tree, and hepatic metastasis in [**2167-8-26**].
Initial workup demonstrated an abnormal pancreatic drainage, which likely lead to the development of his malignancy.
Patient was treated initially w/ 5 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin (last dose [**2168-1-26**]), requiring dose reductions due to cytopenias.
Imaging from [**2-/2168**] showed increased disease.
The patient was switched to Xeloda in [**2168-2-23**] x1, complicated by ascites and sbp.
[**2168-4-24**] CT showed new pulmonary nodules, increased size and number of multiple hepatic metastasis with occlusion of the portal vein as well as the superior mesenteric vein due to lymphadenopathy and worsening ascites.
Over his chemotherapy course, he had evidence of progressive portal hypertension, esophageal varices, requiring multiple banding and at least three admissions for upper GI bleeds and hyponatremia.
Last admit was [**2168-5-7**] for sepsis and positive blood cultures w/enterococcus.
TEE showed thickening of the aortic valve and endocarditis.
At [**Hospital1 **], pain progressed and patient placed on PCA pump.
He also developed worsening renal failure with a Cr over 5 concerning for hepatorenal syndrome.
Had diarrhea today for first time.
In the ED got cx, FFP and paracentesis (diagnostic only).
Abdominal US done, per radiology there is so much tumor they cannot assess liver or portal vein.
Lab data concerning for wbc of 33, lactate of 9, INR 2.5, greatly elevated LFTs, Cr of 5.4, albumin 1.9. .
Metastatic GB cancer as above, with mets to liver, retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Complications of esophageal varices, s/p multiple bandings (most  recently [**2168-1-21**]).
Malaria in past 3. s/p Appendectomy 4.

RUQ US:Heterogeneous and nodular liver consistent with metastatic disease.
No definite intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Sepsis:  This 31 yo M with poorly differentiated metastatic GB carcinoma presents with progressive liver failure, acute renal failure, active GI bleeding, SBP, bacteremia, possible endocarditis, and profound 3rd spacing.
At presentation he was in Sepsis with a lactate of 9, the etiology was thought to be secondary to peritonitis (~400 polys in peritoneal fluid) from erosions of mets into bowel.
Pt also had diarrhea concerning for C. diff given recent ABX and severe leukocytosis.
Recent endocarditis and new bacteremia make it likely patient may have endocarditis again.
He was continued on Vanco dosed by levels given severe renal failure, ceftaz, levo, and flagyl.
IV hydration was held overnight given the concern for severe third spacing into his abdomen.
The morning after admission he was hypotensive and appeared moribund.
He was treated with IV fluids with no improvement.
Several family meetings were held to discuss prognosis and it was explained that he was extremely ill and prognosis was extremely poor.
The family and medical team agreed that CPR was not medically indicated with advanced carcinoma and organ failurs.
He was started on a PCA for pain control.
He developed increased hypotension and bradycardia.
Renal failure: This was felt to be secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
GIB:  BRBPR likely secondary to known varices and tumor eroding through stomach.
Liver failure/possible biliary obstruction: U/S done in the ED unable to asses portal vein or ducts given extensive tumor burden as per radiology.
Hypervolemic Hyponatremia secondary to liver failure/ascites.
He was bolused as needed for hypotension.
