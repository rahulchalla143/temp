Admission Date:  [**2138-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-3-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: 49 year old male with HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma with mass in segment VII of the liver.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2138-8-1**]: Segment VII mass resection, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound thoracentesis x2 ([**2138-9-4**], [**2138-8-22**]) TIPS [**2138-9-8**] VATS pleurodesis [**9-12**] [**2138-9-14**] Doxycycline pleurodesis   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 49-year-old male with chronic HCV, Child B cirrhosis and history of alcohol abuse who presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital emergency room with abdominal pain approximately 2 months ago.
He presented to the emergency department again later that day with recurrent pain, and underwent a liver ultrasound on [**2138-5-11**], which demonstrated cholelithiasis, splenomegaly, several calcified splenic granulomas, and the liver parenchyma was heterogeneous, likely due to hepatocellular dysfunction.
CT scan of the abdomen on [**5-11**] demonstrated a subtle lesion measuring 2.7 x 3.5 cm in segment VII of the liver, with a 1.7 x 1.2-cm hypodense cystic component that was incompletely characterized.
There was also 3.6 x 1.5-cm lymph node adjacent to the common hepatic artery, as well as increased number of a subcentimeter porta hepatis and gastrohepatic ligament lymph nodes.
An MRI of the abdomen on [**5-12**] demonstrated a 3.5 x 3.0-cm mass in the right lower liver, most consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
An EUS on [**5-15**] demonstrated 1 abnormal lymph node in the celiac region, and FNA was negative.
The patient was not a liver transplant candidate, since he was actively drinking and does not having any social support.
A triphasic CT scan of the abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-11**] demonstrated a 3.8-cm lesion in segment VII consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Intra-operatively, because of the large size of the patient's liver and the posterior and superior location of the tumor mass, a Pringle maneuver was unable to be performed and significant bleeding from large hepatic veins under increased pressure along the cut surface was encountered.
The patient experienced some periods of hypotension during the case which responded to volume and Neo-Synephrine.
On post-operative day 1 he received transfusions of another 2 units of PRBCs for a hematocrit of 23.6  On post-operative day 3 the patient had a fever to 101 with chest X-ray that failed to demonstrate focal pneumonia.
A portal vein duplex was obtained which demonstrated: patent main, right and left portal veins, but also with reversal of flow in the main portal vein and its branches (now hepatofugal).
The high JP out-put persisted, and the peritoneal fluid was sent for cytology on post-op day 7, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and failed to demonstrate micro-organism growth on culture.
Portal ultrasound was obtained and negative for acute change.
The patient was otherwise stable and by post-operative day 10 he was transferred out of the intensive care unit to the floors for continued management of his fluid status.
The patient's lateral JP drain continued to have minimal output while the medial JP drain continued to have high output of acetic fluid (several liters per 24hrs).
On post-operative day 11 the patient was tolerating a regular diet and the lateral JP drain was removed with no significant increase in output from the medial JP, although immediately prior to removal of the drain the patient was noted to have some drainage of acetic fluid from his incision.
Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily was begun for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis.
On post-operative day 15 the patient was noted to have some sustained sinus tachycardia to the 110's (elevated from post-operative baseline of 90's to low 100's) and low-grade fever spike to 101 with decreased breath sounds in his R. lower lobe.
Chest X-ray was significant for R. lower lobe collapse.
Following this incident the patient remained afebrile with stable oxygen saturations and stable WBC count.
The following day the patient's creatnine was noted to abruptly increase (from 0.7 to 1.6) with hypotensive episodes to systolic blood pressures <90mmHg following Lasix/Aldactone administration and accompanying tachycardia.
The following day (hospital day 22) the patient's clinical picture again deteriorated as he began complaining of increasing shortness of breath despite multiple nebulizer treatments.
A STAT chest X-ray was performed when the patient was noted to have oxygen desaturation on exertion.
Both this and a chest CT demonstrated a large R. pleural effusion.
The patient's symptoms improved following the procedure, however the pleural effusion quickly re-accumulated.
As the patient was refusing further thoracenteses at the time, remained asymptomatic, and given the risks associated with repeated thoracentesis, both the primary team and interventional pulmonology team agreed that it would be in the patient's best interests to manage conservatively with diuretics and reserve thoracentesis for only when the patient became symptomatic.
Serial chest X-rays demonstrated persisten R. pleural effusion, however the patient remained stable clinically and without shortness of breath or desaturation.
Psychiatric evaluation was obtained at that time, in addition to another evaluation on post-operative day 33 when the patient began reporting racing thoughts, "bad thoughts," and increasing insomnia.
The patient was not deemed to be a an immediate harm to self, although there was sufficient concern for risk of mania that his Seroquel doses were adjusted (increased to 300mg QHS from 150mg QHS with an additional 150mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN concerning symptoms).
Seroquel was decreased prior to discharge for excessive somolence  On hospital day 32 discussion between the hepatobiliary surgical and medical teams concluded in the decision to proceed with TIPS as the patient's hepatic hydrothorax was failing to demonstrate any improvement with conservative management and his renal function was not tolerant of higher doses of diuretic therapy.
However, the patient was unable to tolerate the MRI, reporting severe anxiety and shortness of breath while in the machine.
This was reviewed by the Attending faculty radiologists who observed patent hepatic vessels with antegrade flow, and felt comfortable proceeding with the TIPS procedure.
Post TIPS procedure patient developed significant right pleural effusion that drained by thoracocentesis x 2.
Chest tube drainage decreased over the following 2 days and they were removed without significant accumulation of fluid or oxygen requirement.
Patient also suffered a significant ileus at this time with associated mental status changes thought to be associated with hepatic encephalopathy and was placed NPO with ivf support and bowel rest for 3 days.
When patient was having flatus milk of magnesium was adminstered along with lactulose enemas and when patient was having bowel movements, po lactulose was restared and tolerated well with significant improvment in mental status.
11. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for discomfort.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: HCV HCV and alcohol related cirrhosis Hepatocellular carcinoma Cholelithiasis Lg R pleural effusion High output ascites postop encephalopathy Posttraumatic stress disorder Paranoid schizophrenia Alcohol abuse IV drug use TB treated with INH   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
