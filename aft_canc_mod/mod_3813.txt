Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o w/ DM2, HTN/HLD, afib on coumadin, end stage renal disease (not yet on HD), presents  w/ nausea, vomitting, reported hematemesis and maroon stool, and was found to have a cecum AVM .
EGD did not review active source of bleed other than possible NGT trauma.
She received a total of 8 units of pRBC, and 3 units of frozen plasma for hemodynamic stability.
She continued to require mechanical ventilation for 5 days, most likely secondary to fluid overload from transfusion.
Contributing factors leading to her hypoxemia include OSA, reactive airway disease and possible Vent Assoc Pneumonia for which she received Vancomycin for 8 days total.
# Fever: Pt spiked a fever to 101.3 while she was on the ventilator.
Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.
Hemodialysis were performed at bedside for fluid removal.
# HTN: Pt has documented history of hypertension.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt had documented history of atrial fibrillation, and on coumadin at home.
# DM2: was hypoglycemic at times, and thus initially held her home 75/25 standing insulin but then retarted this of roughly half of her home dose.
# Depression: continued paroxetine .
Transitions of care: - GI appointment to address polyps and future C-scope as well as to address decision about anticoagualation with pradaxa vs. asa vs. coumadin.
- As she was hypoglycemic at times during the admission, we initially held her home 75/25 standing insulin but then retarted this of roughly half of her home dose.
- Several days before discharge, she had difficulty retaining urine and thus a foley was left in place for a voiding trial to take place once she arrives at rehab.
VOIDING TRIAL Patient was discharged with foley catheter because of urinary retention.
Give her 8 hours to void and check bladder scan if hasn't voided at that   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Lower GI bleed Pneumonia  Secondary: Diabetes End-stage renal disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital for concern of gastrointestinal bleed and that your INR was too high at 6.
A bleeding artery was clipped in the colon and you were treated for a pneumonia.
