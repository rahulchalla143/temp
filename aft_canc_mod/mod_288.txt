if active multiple myeloma (known disease throughout bilateral femurs, hips, sacrum, cervico-thoraco-lumbar spine, ribs) who sustained a fall this morning and has a displaced spiral oblique fracture of his left proximal [**12-17**] femur.
No injuries elsewhere per report.In the emergency room the patient is hemodynamically stable, alert and oriented, and he has moderate pain in his left thigh.
Mother: type II diabetes mellitus [**Name (NI) **]: multiple myeloma Uncle: [**Name (NI) 4278**] disease  Physical Exam: Admission physical AFVSS NAD RRR CTA S/NT/ND RLE: SILT, Motor intact.
No concern for compartment syndrome.

**FINAL REPORT [**2132-5-21**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2132-5-21**]):    NO GROWTH.
Radiology L ext fluoro FINDINGS: Multiple fluoroscopic images of the left femur demonstrate interval placement of an intramedullary rod with distal interlocking screw and a proximal pin fixating a fracture involving the proximal shaft of the left femur.
The lytic lesions seen throughout the pelvis and femur is less well seen due to the technique.
Chest xray No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
There is hazy opacification over both lateral chest walls, is probably due to soft tissue involvement of the pleural space in region of multiple myelomatous ribs.
LENI IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
Repeat chest xray FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-15**], there is little change.
No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Diffuse myelomatous changes within the ribs and other bony structures are again seen.
He was evaluated by the orthopaedic surgery service and found to have a left femur fracture.
He had to be admitted to the ICU for a low hematocrit (16), where he was transfused and monitored hemodynamically.
BMT course [**Date range (3) 8080**]: This is a 49y M w h/o recurrent IgG multiple myeloma following his allogeneic transplant currently on Revlimid and cyclophosphamide (last dose [**2132-4-2**] w known disease throughout bilateral femurs, hips, sacrum, cervico-thoraco-lumbar spine, ribs) presented to an OSH s/p mechanical fall with L femur fracture.
He denies other injury including head strike or loss of consciousness.
Now s/p ORIF on [**5-13**] with persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia and transferred from Ortho to BMT.
Plan per ortho is TDWB on LLE with transfer to BMT service for management of hematologic disturbance.
# Fever: Ddx includes PE, infectious etiology, post-op complication, ateletasis, or post-transfusion rxn.
Hickman looks erythematous wo purulence or tenderness and improved appearance after initiation of abx.
Vanco trough on [**5-17**] = 11 but team elected to keep dose same to avoid nephrotoxicity give low suspicion for infection.
Pt continued to have low grade temps on the abx but was HD stable and appeared to be clinically improving.
His fever curve improved after abx and was afebrile off antibiotics.
He continued to have low grade temps but never hemodynamically unstable.
# Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Concern is for persistent bleed into the LLE and possible risk for compartment syndrome however intact pulses on both sides and per ortho recs, compartment syndrome is a near impossibility in thigh.
Would also consider other hematologic consumptive processes such as (DIC/HUS-TTP/ITP), decrease production (baseline MM) and/or sequestration process but most likely is oozing related to thrombocytopenia on lovenox.
He was continued on lovenox while bed bound given high risk for DVT.
# LLE fracture: s/p fall at home w decreased bony integrity [**1-16**] diffuse multiple myeloma.
# Multiple myeloma: On rivlimid and cytoxan (last dose 4/20).
Prophylaxis with acyclovir, bactrim from home regimen.
He was unable to tolerate a skeletal survey in house given his severe leg pain and current instability.
