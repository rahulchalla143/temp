Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after your hematocrit dropped after you had a bleed from a tumor in your GI tract at an outside hospital.
The following changes were made to your medications: INCREASE imatinib to twice daily START ferrous sulfate (iron) daily- our pharmacists do not see an interaction of this with your imatinib but to be safe you can take this 2 hrs after your morning medications.
You can stop this medications if you are having loose stools or diarrhea.
STOP Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure as they were not needed while you were here.
START pantoprazole- it decreases the acid in your stomach and may help decrease your risk of bleeding again.
