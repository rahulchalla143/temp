He had been doing well over the weekend, however, on the morning of the 21st, he was found by family to be unresponsive and incontinent of stool.
Hepatitis C virus.
Esophageal varices status post banding.
Suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Recent admissions for fevers, mental status changes, and encephalopathy.
Chronic renal failure.
Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs.
Extremities:  He had [**2-16**]+ pitting edema in his ankles up to his calves.
Urinalysis was negative for nitrates and leukocyte esterase.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  From the previous admission showed a small nodular liver with appropriate direction of blood flow.
Small ascites, splenomegaly, no hydronephrosis, plus cholelithiasis, but no bile duct dilatation.
There were no localizing symptoms, no fever, white blood cell count.
Increased white blood cell count suggests infection as an inciting factor.
The patient has been compliant with his diet, but it was possible that he had increased protein intake, although it was difficult to get this history on admission.
Again, there is a possibility that there was a GI bleed or that the patient had decreased lactulose intake.
He was kept NPO while he had decreased mental status.
The patient's mental status continued to improve while in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was sent for a bone scan, which showed he had increased activity diffusely within his abdomen likely secondary to ascites.
More focal tracer activity in the region of his liver representing acute inflammatory process (hepatitis C), posttraumatic activity in the left 7th rib.
No evidence of osseous metastases.
The patient also had a CT scan of the chest, which showed no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
Again, it was noted that the patient does have a gallstone.
On the 24th, the patient had colonoscopy which showed that he had rectal varices, and a small sessile 5 mm nonbleeding polyp.
There was no biopsy done secondary to his platelets being 54 and his INR of 1.7.
He had erythema, and congestion, and nodularity, and a normal vascularity in the antrum, which is consistent with gastropathy.
Renal:  The patient had acute on chronic renal failure on admission.
Their recommendations were to hold the Lasix and to address the issue of questionable GI bleed and optimize his volume status which was done.
Anemia secondary to blood loss versus dilutional effect: There was no active bleeding once the patient arrived to Medicine from the Intensive Care Unit.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was to continue taking lactulose 30 cc as often as needed to have a goal of [**3-17**] bowel Emergency Room if becoming increasingly confused, having difficulty speaking, if he was experiencing lightheadedness or dizziness when he got up from a sitting to standing low, to followup with Urology on his appointment, [**8-10**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42189**] for his evaluation of microscopic hematuria.
Esophageal varices status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy, no evidence of bleeding.
Rectal varices status post colonoscopy, no bleeding.
Anemia secondary to blood loss versus dilutional effect, status post transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Chronic renal failure.
