Admission Date:  [**2168-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-12-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-9-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Reglan / Seroquel  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Peritoneal Dialysis  History of Present Illness: 44 yo M w/ PMH of metastatic testicular germinoma, PCKD on PD, b/l PE, presents with SOB.
Pt was driving with his wife to [**Name (NI) 2860**] for an appointment when he began to develop rapid shallow breathing and felt short of breath.
The patient was unable to alleviate his shortness of breath and felt it was progressively getting worse over 45 minutes.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: 96.2 100 138/99 22 100/5l NC GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules.
Central line in place for administering chemo RESP: bibasilar crackles CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
There is, however prominence of pulmonary vasculature, with indistinct pulmonary hila.
Findings are compatible with congestive heart failure.
There may be right basilar atelectasis and small effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure.
[**2168-12-6**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Borderline left ventricular cavity dilation with moderate to severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude multivessel CAD).
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 44 yo M w/ PMH of metastatic testicular Ca, PCKD on PD, PE p/w pulm edema in the setting of volume overload from inappropriate .
#SOB: The patient's CXR showed bilateral infiltrates.
Once his PD was restarted, greater than 3L fluid was removed in 24 hrs with marked improvement of his respiratory status.
This could have been due to CHF exacerbation vs volume overload from lack of PD.
An ECHO showed an EF of 25-30%, though this could be depressed with massive volume overload from lack of PD.
# PCKD: Pt has h/o PCKD and is on PD chronically.
No ST changes.
He had no prior available to compare.
He was chest pain free during this hospitaliziation.
He will bring these up with his PCP since he is on neither of these medications with a h/o diabetes and a low EF.
Alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for insomnia.
Peritoneal Dialysis Please go to your [**Hospital **] clinic for dialysis as scheduled.
Outpatient Lab Work repeat CBC by your PCP   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Volume Overload secondary to Renal Disease Polycystic Kidney Disease on Peritoneal Dialysis Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Diabetes Testicular Cancer/Germinoma history of Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: stable, good O2 sats on room air, ambulating without difficulty   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for difficulty breathing.
This was likely due to improper peritoneal dialysis.
Please discuss with him about repeating an Echocardiogram, possibly a stress test, and whether starting an Aspirin or Ace-inhibitor is appropriate.
