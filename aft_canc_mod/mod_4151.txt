Admission Date:  [**2152-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: weakness, SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD s/p clip placed in second part of duodenum colonoscopy s/p polyp removal in hepatic flexure paracentesis s/p removal 7L fluid   History of Present Illness: A 76-year-old male with history of hypertension, AFIB, CAD, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, CHF, hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, GI bleed, colon polyps, arthritis, and anemia presents with 2 weeks of weakness, fatigue, SOB and chest pain.
Pt was recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2152-3-5**] for increased ascites where he had an 11 liter paracentesis.
He states that since his discharge he has had increased fatigue, SOB, weakness and upper chest pain.
Has never had these symptoms in the past.
He felt that he was "having a heart attack and dying."
Feels that his abd girth has increased but he is not uncomfortable and has had no abd pain.
ROS positive for dizziness, constipation, one episode of vomiting at dentist's office yesterday.
Has not noted blood in stool or change in color.
GUAIAC positive but no melena.
ECHO done for hypotension and no pericardial effusion seen.
Pt was noted to have guaiac positive stools on recent admission in [**2-3**], when he had Hct of 21.6.
HTN 2.
CAD -- s/p 3v-cabg 3.
GIB -- H/o colon polyps, EGD with vascular ectasia (cauterized) 6.
Ascites -- Secondary to Right-sided CHF 7.
Anemia 9.
Hypothyroidism s/p goiter excision at age 30 10.
Reducible umbilical hernia.
EXT: [**1-31**]+ pitting bilateral lower extremity edema to the distal thighs.
Pertinent Results: Cspy results: polyps in the distal sigmoid colon not removed; ulceration, erythema and congestion in the hepatic flexure and ascending colon concerning for ischemia; polyp in the hepatic flexure removed; stool in the cecum, ascending colon and hepatic flexure limiting the views of the mucosa.
EGD results: polyps in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum; angioectasias in the second part of the duodenum - likely etiology of iron deficiency anemia and guaiac positive stool.

Anemia: Hct at admission was 14 with associated symptoms such as SOB, CP, weakness; his Hct increased appropriately after receiving transfusions.
He was guaiac positive in the ED, and given his history of GI bleeds, most likely source of blood loss was from his GI tract.
He was monitored in the ICU for possible hemodynamic instability while awaiting EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate the source of his bleeding.
EGD demonstrated angioectasias in the 2nd part of the duodenum which was the likely source of blood loss - a clip was placed in this region.
On the colonoscopy, an area of ulceration, erythema and congestion was seen in the hepatic flexure and ascending colon which was concerning for ischemia.
CV: a) CAD: h/o 3VD; He was ruled out by enzymes given his complaint of chest pain.
It was recommended that he avoid ASA secondary to bleeding; his BB and ACEI were also held given his low blood pressure and active GIB.
b) Afib: Continued Amiodarone, follow QT intervals with serial EKGs; held anti-coag given active bleeding c) CHF/hypotension: Pt has been evaluated in the past for TVR though he was not felt to be a candidate given comorbidities.
d) PPx: as above, and continued statin  Abdominal ascites: This was evaluated in the past and was felt to be secondary to R-sided CHF from 4+TR rather than cirrhosis.
He received an uncomplicated paracentesis during which 7 liters of fluid were removed - this was mainly performed for the patient's comfort.
He remained hemodynamically stable, and there was no evidence of fluid reaccumulation following the procedure.
ARF on CKD: His renal failure was most ikely attributable to poor forward flow.
This remained stable as we avoided overdiuresis or nephrotoxic medications.
PPx: He was given pneumoboots and PPI [**Hospital1 **] for prophylaxis.
