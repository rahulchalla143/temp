He has a 15 pack year smoking history (quit 20 years ago) presenting with worsening shortness of breath and cough for the past few months.
He explains that he has had worsening dyspnea with exertion for the past few months which has now progressed to shortness of breath even at rest.
He has also noticed a worsening cough during this time.
No hemoptysis but occassionally lightly  brown tinged sputum.
He denies any chest pain, fevers or chills.
He reports a mild lost of weight and with decreased appetite over the past few months.
A chest x-ray on [**2119-3-14**] showed two large pulmonary masses in the right upper lobe (6.7 x 5.9 and 3.9 x 2.6 cm) as well as several additional nodular opacities in both lower lobes.
A subsequent CT showed stage IV lung cancer with right upper lobe primary, satellite nodules, bibasilar metastases, and bilateral effusions right greater than left.
He initially felt better however in the last few days he started having worsening shortness of breath and difficulty lying flat.
No chest pain and no fever.
A chest x-ray showed worsening pleural effusions.
Per report during the CTA, while lying flat and receiving the contrast, he became more acutely short of breath with increasingly labored breathing, tachypneic to 30, and desaturating to 86% on 3L NC.
Expiratory wheezes and crackles bilaterally were appreciated.
An EKG showed atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction but no ischemic changes.
On arrival to the MICU the patient appeared to be in no acute distress and was breathing comfortably with sats of 93% on 5L NC.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2112**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
[**2119-3-21**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There continues to be a large opacity overlying the right upper lung which is the known mass.

Pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Pt ruled out for MI via enzymes.
Repeat echo (last [**2113**]) showed LVEF 55% and was largely unchanged other than that the severity of mitral regurgitation increased.
# Adencocarcinoma of the Lung: Pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells, but CT was suggestive of metastatic disease.
He underwent bronchoscopic lung biopsy on [**3-23**] with lymph node bx confirming adenoCA.
Hypertension: BP initially controlled in ICU with a nitro drip.
The patient and family are aware that he has lung cancer and that it will likely be the cause of his death.

Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized due to shortness of breath from pleural effusions and CHF along with masses in the chest that on preliminary report appear to be adenocarcinoma.

It is helpful to minimize sodium (salt) intake to minimize fluid retention or reaccumulation.
