Admission Date:  [**2171-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-3-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-5-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: vancomycin / daptomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3963**] Chief Complaint: cough, dyspnea, O2 requirement, tranaminitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: liver biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4580**] is a 59 year old male with monoclonal gammopathy, severe oral lichen planus, recent GIST tumor s/p surgical resection [**2170-12-27**], possible neuromuscular disorder who presents with cough and fever X 3 days.
His symptoms began three days ago beginning with one day of low grade fever to 100.4, cough, and fatigue.
He was noted to have increased O2 requirement and transaminitis and was referred to the ED.
Patient has had no abdominal or GI symptoms.
Of note patient has had a long and complicated medical history beginning in [**2169-8-20**] when he suddenly lost his sense of taste after treatement of social anxiety with proproanolol.
He developed respiratory problems including a number of sinus infections in the summer of [**2170**] requiring treatmetn with antibitotics.
He began to develop rashes, and worsening of his oral lichen planus with mouth, pain and thrush.
Biopsy of plaques on the dorum of his knuckles were suggestive of Gottren's papules, making diagnosis concerning for dermatomyositis.
Given patient had not had weakness consistent with this, it was suggested that he had a diagnosis of sine dermatomyositis.
Furthermore, as dermatomyositis was raised, patient underwent an exhausive workup for malignancy including colonsocopy and endoscopy.
A gastric mass was discovered, found to be a benign GIST tumor.
Throughout these hospitalization, patient became malnourished as workup for his symptoms continued.
He developed several pneumonia .
During his most recent hospitalization for low grade temperature, cough, and hypoxia, he was found to have a possible aspiration and/or bronchiectasis/bronchiolitis with resultant transpulmonary shunt.
Sputum cultures grew MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
A cause of his weakness has not been discovered.
Neurology has recommended a voltage gated calcium channel antibiody [**Hospital1 **] nicotinic receptor binding antibody which must be ordered as outpatient.
Weakness was also thought to be the cuase of his aspiration risk and NIF of -40.
It was unclear whether this was a neuromuscular process or rheumatologic condition.
Of note, skin biopsy recently showed overlap between lichen planus and connective tissue disorder (lichen planus with immune  deposition).
He triggered for hypoxia 84% on RA.
On the floor, patient has no new complaints.

There is really no change in the appearance of the frontal views as recently as [**1-16**].
Generalized hyperinflation is due to emphysema.
There is no pulmonary edema, consolidation.
A tiny right pleural effusion may be new, but probably not clinically significant.
Findings would therefore be attributed to decompensation of emphysema and bronchiectasis.
No pericholecystic fluid or wall thickening.
Bibasilar bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging of several bronchi.
Normal morphologic-looking liver with a single hamartoma in segment III of the liver.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Liver Bx: Liver, needle core biopsy:  1.Marked peri-centrivenular, mild portal and periportal inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils and macrophages with apoptotic hepatocytes and peri-centrivenular hepatocyte drop out (confirmed by reticulin stain).
2.Associated foci of central endothelialitis with peri-centrivenular hemorrhagic necrosis identified.
3.No significant steatosis seen.
4.Trichrome stain highlights central vein damage; no definitive increase in fibrosis identified.
5.Iron stain shows mild iron within predominantly peri-centrivenular hepatocytes.
[**Country 7018**] red stains are negative for amyloid, with satisfactory control.
Note:  The features are those of a marked active hepatitis with a predominantly centrivenular pattern of injury.
Given the patient's history of monoclonal gammopathy and the presence of rare binucleate plasma cells, the case will be further reviewed by hematopathology and their findings issued separately in an addendum.
Video Swallow: Penetration, but no gross aspiration, with thin and nectar thick  liquids, similar to prior study.
, EKG [**2171-3-4**]: Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared with previoui tracing of [**2171-2-23**].
Variation in precordial lead placement.
No evidence for PE.
Improved nodular opacities in the right lower lobe consistent with resolving infection.
Unchanged bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and mucous plugging in the lower lobes.
Right lower lobe and left lower lobe bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and endobronchial impaction overall appear unchanged since the prior examination with no evidence of interval progression of the infectious process.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not completely identified but positioned within the stomach proximally.
Bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis is stable.
No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest an acute pneumonia.
No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
CXR [**2171-3-13**]: Bronchial wall thickening or peribronchial infiltration in the lower lungs where most pronounced bronchiectasis is have worsened since [**3-11**] consistent either with a flare of bronchiectasis or development of peribronchial pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion, no pneumothorax.
Moderate-to-severe overinflation with known areas of bronchiectasis and perifocal parenchymal opacities.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal changes.
CXR [**2171-3-17**]: 1) Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 59 year old gentleman with systemic disease of unclear etiology now with fever, cough, hypoxia, and transaminitis who eventually decompensated on [**2171-3-16**] with respiratory failure (multifactorial, pls see below) and was made CMO on [**2171-3-17**] and passed away on [**2171-3-18**].
Sputum with moderate pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Had a desaturation episode on [**2-22**] in the setting of a prolonged attempt at dobhoff placement.
Repeat CT at that time suggested no abscess but RLL nodular densities concerning for spread of infx (aspergillosis or fungal) vs inflammatory nodules.
Pulmonary deferred on bronch vs VATS to bx the peripheral nodule given the patient's strong preference and his aspiration risk.
On the afternoon of [**3-4**] the patient had a desaturation episode in the setting of a fever to 102F.
He improved gradually and his O2 requirement remained stable 2-3L.
On [**3-13**] a CXR performed in the setting of persistent tachycardia demonstrated a flare of his bronchiectasis vs a peri-bronchial PNA.
By [**2171-3-16**], Patient was having trouble clearing secretions, with known pseduomonas colonization of his sputum.
Patient was kept on cefepime, with daily aggressive chest PT and frequent reminders to take guaifenisen for mucolytic therapy, as he has significant difficulty clearing secretions.
# Lichen planus: Worst in mouth but also has diffuse skin lesions.
Appreciate dermatology c/s who discussed case w/ multiple colleagues and has been incredibly helpful throughout his course.
BM bx suggested possible mastocytosis, but derm felt that skin biopsies were less consistent with this possibility, and a tryptase was negative.
Paraneoplastic pemphigus send-out returned negative.
The rest of his skin regimen includes clobetasol + plastic wrapping, mupirocin for his lower face and neck, and topical tacrolimus (mixed 1:1 with vaseline) for around his eyes.
# Bacteremia: Grew out MSSA from blood cultures 2/03 in the setting of persistent fevers.
Started on cefepime (narrowed to nafcillin on [**2-28**]), and was afebrile until [**3-4**].
Pt had poor quality TTE that did not reveal vegetations but a TEE was deferred given aspiration risk and pt preference.
On [**3-13**] an infectious workup for tachycardia yielded blood cultures that grew MRSA, and on [**3-14**] he was broadened to cefepime/linezolid.
# Nutrition/deconditioning: Pt's weight down to ~115 from pre-illness weight 170.
Poor PO intake [**2-21**] mouth pain a/w eating (due to oral lichen planus).
# Transaminitis: Pt had mild transaminitis since [**Month (only) **] of [**2170**].
This increased in [**Month (only) 1096**] to 100s range, thought to be secondary to antibiotic effect.
He underwent liver biopsy which was suggestive of drug induced immune reaction vs autoimmune hepatitis.
He was continued on prednisone (40-60 mg daily) and started on azathioprine with continued worsening of his transaminitis.
# Hyponatremia - Na was persistently low despite IVF with NS, withholding free water from tube feeds, etc.
However, pt was without symptoms per se and strongly preferred that his IVF be maintained (due to perceived dryness/cracking in mouth that prevents him from sleeping).
# Thyroid nodule: 1.1 cm thyroid nodule discovered incidentally on chest CT on [**2-22**].
Given a potential connection between the patient's presumed autoimmune disorder and underlying malignancy, it was thought that this nodule merited further workup.
# Leukopenia: Has been present since last admission.
# PLASMA CELL DYSCRASIA/MGUS: Patient has 10% plasma cells, negative skeletal survey, normal calcium and no renal insufficiency.
Given other hemotologic abnormalities repeat bone marrow biopsy may be indicated.
Ophthalmology consulted re possible ocular involvement of lichen planus and additional options for eye care.
They suggested gel vs frequent artificial tears.
# Anxiety: History of severe anxiety/panic attacks at his prior admission.
On low-dose xanax for anxiety and clonazepam for sleep.
14. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO every 4-6 hours  as needed for insomnia 16. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: patient expired  Discharge Condition: patient expired resp failure likely [**2-21**] bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, deconditioning, muscle weakness, and atelectasis.
