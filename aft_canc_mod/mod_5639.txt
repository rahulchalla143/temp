A tiny area of high attenuation projecting in the area of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, most likely representing a small area of calcification from chroid plexus.
However, small amount of acute hemorrhage in this area cannot be excluded, but considered extremely less likely.
- Scan was repeated on [**2111-2-1**] without new findings.
[**2111-1-31**] CXR - (PA and LAT) IMPRESSION: Left upper lobe pneumonia.
[**2111-1-31**] EKG Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Incomplete right bundle branch block Premature ventricular contractions Inferior T wave changes are nonspecific Repolarization changes may be partly due to rate/rhythm Since previous tracing, ventricular response faster  [**2111-2-1**] - CT chest without contrast.
Severe left upper lobe consolidation, nonobstructive, of uncertain chronicity, except that it was not present on [**1-30**], [**2110**].
Mild distal tracheomalacia.
[**2111-2-1**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-2-1**] 11:50 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of epidural abscess in the lumbar region.
Signal changes at L2-3 disc most likely due to degenerative change.
Degenerative changes at other levels with compression of the exiting right L4 nerve root at L4-5 level as described in the full report.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for worsening left upper lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course: As this patient presented with a complex clinical picture his problems will be dealt with individually in this Brief Hospital course.
The likely source of these were the patient's pneumonia based on the radiograph findings and physical exam which was significant for rhales.
Furthermore, he was treated with levofloxacin which led to resolution of his symptoms.
2 Shortness of Breath.
The cause of this symptom was likely multifactorial.
Possible etiologies included pneumonia as discussed above as well as rapid ventricular rate.
Happily ischemia was ruled out by serial sets of cardic enzymes.
Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
# Back pain.
The patient intially presented with focal pain over his left flank and mid thoracic spine.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient's back pain was ultimately attributed to prolonged bed rest and it resolved spontaneously.
# CML.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing: Please note that this medication can increase your heart rate.
Also, please note that there are other causes for shortness of breath and should this medication not help you should seek medical care immediately.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for headache.
1.5cm incidental left kidney mass seen on renal ultrasound will need MRI follow up.
