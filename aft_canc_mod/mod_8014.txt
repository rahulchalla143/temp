Pelvic lymph node dissection   History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 75 year-old gentleman who has been followed for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer for several years.
Most recent urine cytology in [**Month (only) 205**] of [**2169**] was positive for malignant cells.
Biopsy revealed high grade urothelial carcinoma with lamina propria invasion but without muscle invasive disease.
However, there was a significant degree of micropapillary invasion which was noted to be high risk for invasion.
Given that risk factor the patient was counseled as to the risks and benefits of surgery versus watchful waiting and the decided to opt for surgical intervention prior to development of muscle invasive disease.
Elevated cholesterol (LDL 122).
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Degenerative joint disease.
Family History: FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother with hypertension, father with a history of a myocardial infarction at the age of 75.

Multifocal pulmonary consolidation seen diffusely throughout both lungs appear more confluent compared to prior film.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.
There may be small bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pulmonary consolidation, appearing more confluent compared to last film, however, similar to appearance to [**8-22**] film acquired at 05:28 hours, which is likely secondary to a combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

Bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest radiograph.
Patient is not a candidate for CTA given elevated creatinine.
INTERPRETATION:  Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate  considerable central airway deposition of tracer and several areas of reduced tracer deposition within the parenchyma of both lungs.
There are subsegemental scattered areas of reduced tracer activity.
Given the chest radiograph appearance, the above findings are consistent with an intermediate probability of pulmonary embolism.
Given the multiple bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest radiograph and corresponding areas of reduced tracer deposition on the ventilation portion of the study, perfusion appears relatively preserved in comparison.

His chest film on [**8-15**] read as: "Heart is mildly enlarged.
left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis are unchanged .
On [**8-16**], a chest film was read as: "There is a left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis with large consolidation.
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drainage continued to be high, and hence, a JP creatinine level and a Urine creatinine level was sought in order to rule-out a urine leak within the abdomen.
There is a left subclavian line, with the tip in the lower SVC.
There is an NG tube, with the tip in the stomach.
He also had a urine culture today, for febrile episodes during the day, which was negative.
1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
Retrocardiac opacity consistent with airspace disease is unchanged.
There does, however, now appear to be increased opacity in the left mid lung zone and the right lower lung zone consistent with worsening airspace disease."
Again is seen patchy multifocal airspace disease which appears unchanged on the left side but it is worse on the right side.
No large pleural effusion is present."
Multifocal areas of consolidation are again demonstrated with slight worsening in the right upper and left lower lobes, concerning for multifocal pneumonia, although a component of pulmonary edema is also possible."
A cardiology consult was called, and en echo done which showed: "The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of  [**2163-12-20**], mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now suggested.
Biventricular systolic function appears similar."
Overnight, Mr [**Known lastname **] had some episodes of respiratory distress.
He also had episodes of chest pain - a 12-lead EKG was done which did not show any abnormalities.
Mr [**Known lastname **] was given 2.5mg of Vitamin K overnight due to his INR level.
On [**8-23**], Mr [**Known lastname **] was given another 2.5mg PO of Vitamin K. His chest pain had resolved and he was no longer having breathing difficulties.
Overnight, he had some episodes of respiratory distress for which his oxygen level was increased.
He had a video surveillance study to assess his risk for gastric aspiration, and it was determined he would require a thickened diet due to some risk of aspiration.
Mr [**Known lastname **] had no other complaints and was seen by a physical therapist.
After starting administration, he had an allergic reaction to the product and his blood pressure elevated and his temperature went up to 103.
Overnight, he had no other issues.
He had no new medical issues today.
Neuro: Off all pain meds.
ABG and PM lytes c/w metabolic acidosis w/ respiratory compensation as well as some degree of primary respiratory hypoxemia.
Pulmonary previously consulted and felt hypoxemia likely due to multifocal aspiration PNA (no ABx treatment if no fever spikes).
Renal and pulm felt that fluid overload from IVF over weekend might have helped trigger events today PM.
Will also obtain VQ Scan overnight per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to assess for PE (although radiologist states that utility w/ inderlying parenchymal disease is minimal).
Pulmonary following.
If poor prognosis for PO intake ability, we should consider PICC for peripheral nutrition/boluses or J-tube for feeds.
GU: Severely hypernatremic and intravascularly contracted Saturday AM.
Renal reconsulted.
Presumed ATN and intravascular depletion from poor oncotic pressure with low albumin (secondary to poor nutrition) and previous lasix for days while in SICU.
Renal following.
CT A/P Sunday w/o evidence of obstruction.
CT A/P Sunday shows evidence of known PNA.
E: Blessedly, no issues.
He wife comment that his breathing was no different since he left the ICU.
The V/Q scan from the previous day did not show a pulmonary embolism, but it was indeterminant.
Speech and swallow were consulted again about his swallowing status.
His pain is well controlled.
He had no pain and has no other major issues.
Overnight, the patient had some difficulty sleeping and was very frustrated with his current situation at hand.
Speech and swallow were [**Hospital Ward Name 653**] again and asked specifically when his swallowing would recover.
He tolerated clear fluids very well with no coughing.
Staples to come out tomorrow am and due for dischgare if things are well.
Overnight, there were no issues.
The nurse communicated her concern about the lower part of the wound as it maybe infected.
The wound is erythematous, but there was no purulent discharge or tenderness.
He will recive 1 unit of blood for low hematocrit this afternoon.
Medications on Admission: Nolol,nifedipine, flonase, lovastatin, zoloft, asprin, rabeprazole, nitrostat prn  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every [**4-13**] hours as needed for pain: hold if O2 sat less than 93% or oversedated.
Contact a physician for fever >100.5, bleeding or increasing redness from incisions, difficulty swallowing or breathing, headache, nausea or vomiting, double or blurry vision, or any other concerns.
