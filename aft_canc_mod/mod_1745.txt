The patient has an extensive history of dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and abnormal EKGs dating back to at least [**2120-10-4**].
Follow-up cardiac catheterization in [**2122-12-4**] demonstrated persistent and advancing coronary artery disease; at this point, the patient again declined bypass surgery, stating that he preferred to wait for the introduction of coated stents.
Repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2123-6-17**] demonstrated once again persistent three vessel coronary artery disease with 60-70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery at its origin, 40% proximal narrowing in the obtuse marginal, up to 70% stenosis in the midvessel portion of the right coronary artery.
Coronary artery disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Diabetic retinopathy.
Extremity arthritis.
Anastomosis included from the LIMA to the LAD, from the aorta via saphenous vein graft to the right PDA, and saphenous vein graft to the distal LAD and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
The patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; both mediastinal and left pleural tubes were placed.
Shortly following arrival in the CSRU, the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication and was subsequently advanced to oral intake without incident.
The patient thereafter demonstrated a gradually increasing platelet count for the duration of his stay without any further dips in his values.
On postoperative day number two, the patient's lines and chest tubes were removed without complication and the patient was subsequently cleared for transfer to the floor.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy, who cleared the patient for eventual discharge to home following resolution of the acute medical issues.
The patient's Foley catheter was removed without complication and he was subsequently noted to be independently productive of urine for the duration of his stay.
The patient's pacer wires were removed without incident and the patient was noted to have adequate pain control via oral pain medications following a consultation from the Chronic Pain Service.
The patient subsequently demonstrated an adequate bump in his hematocrit and demonstrated no evidence of active bleeding.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to home with instructions for follow-up.
