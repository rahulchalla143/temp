She complained of intermittent epigastric pain and nausea and was found to have epigastric tenderness on exam with guaiac positive stool.
She recalls taking some pain medications for neck pain a few days ago but does not know which one.
She only drinks decaf coffee and denies any acidic or fatty foods.
She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, appetite changes, early satiety, or abdominal bloating.
She denies any recent changes in her stools, although they are dark at times and often hard; she is on iron supplements.
Of note, on her last admission, there was concern for occult GI malignancy given her iron deficiency anemia and monocytosis, but her last colonoscopy on [**2161-12-28**] showed only internal hemorrhoids.
No family history of GI malignancy.
Exam was notable for epigastric tenderness but guaiac negative stools.
INR was 4; the decision was made not to reverse given her recent large burden PE.
GI was consulted and initially recommended NG lavage, but this deferred given her elevated INR.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Iron deficiency anemia Monocytosis S/p H. pylori treatment in [**10-25**]   Social History: She is a nonsmoker, does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.
Family History: No FH of CAD/MI, no history of malignancy  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98, BP 143/75, P 66, RR 18, O2sat 95% on 2L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: BS+, soft, mild tenderness over epigastrium without guarding or rebound, non-distended, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: AAO x 3, CN II-XII intact, strength 5/5, toes downgoing on Babinski, gait not assessed.
Large mass involving the gastric body and antrum with associated perigastric lymphadenopathy.
Abrupt caliber change of right pulmonary artery, which may relate to prior PE.
Large gastric mass, more fully characterized on recent CT. 3.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 89 year old female with hx of PE, iron deficiency anemia, and monocytosis on peripheral smear admitted for abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools and newly diagnosed with a 10cm gastric adenocarcinoma with hospital course complicated by acute cholecystitis requiring percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement, now with RUQ abscesses vs. biloma from a likely gallbladder perforation and C Diff colitis.
RUQ biloma:  The patient developed increasing RUQ abdominal pain throughout the day on [**3-20**].
A CT abdomen was performed and revealed interval formation and enlargement of two likely abscesses vs biloma seen immediately posterior and medial to the gallbladder.
The fluid removed was not frankly purulent and it is likely that the patient's gallbladder has perforated and is leaking bile into her peritoneum and RUQ causing peritoneal irritation and pain.
C Diff colitis: The patient developed diarrhea with 10 bowel movements and increased abdominal pain on [**3-22**] and a stool sample at that time was positive for C Diff toxin.
This is the likely explanation for her increased WBC count to a peak of 19.2 on [**3-22**].
Gastric Adenocarcinoma: The patient has a new diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma with a large 10cm mass in her gastric antrum found on EGD.
A staging CT showed only perigastric lymphadenopathy.
Hem/onc says that gastric adenocarcinoma is surgically staged and gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy would be potentially curative if the tumor is localized.
GI would not proceed with an EGD for debulking purposes due to concern for bleeding and is no longer following.
A family meeting on [**3-19**] was held and the decision was to proceed with surgical management with no post-op chemotherapy.
Ethics was consulted on [**3-22**] to address the ethics surrounding not telling a competent patient their true diagnosis secondary to cultural beliefs.
GI Bleeding: Likely upper GI bleed given history of normal colonoscopy and EGD with 10cm gastric adenocarcinoma.
Acute cholecystitis: The patient developed leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and radiological evidence of cholecystitis on [**3-15**].
Her Coumadin was initially held in the setting of a GI bleed and she was placed on a heparin gtt.
Her anticoagulation and TPN was discontinued and her pain was controlled with Morphine and a Fentanyl patch.
She has had some nausea which is relieved with Zofran but potentially it could be from the Fentanyl and or Morphine so that will need to be watched and assessed.
