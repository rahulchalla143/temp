HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted today to begin cycle 1 week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
His oncologic history began in [**2197-8-10**] when a torso CT performed due to dyspnea was noted to have large right renal mass and multiple lung nodules.
PET CT on [**2199-3-11**] showed multiple pulmonary nodules and mildly prominent mesenteric nodes.
On [**2199-3-5**], he underwent left lower lobe wedge resection with pathology from an 8 mm nodule consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma noted.
Followup torso CT [**2199-6-10**] revealed stable lung nodules but a new pancreatic mass.
His course was complicated by mild toxic encephalopathy and acute renal failure.
ALLERGIES:  Previously reported myalgia secondary to statins, now tolerating low-dose simvastatin.
Omeprazole 20 mg daily as needed for indigestion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male in no acute distress.
LYMPH NODES:  No cervical, supraclavicular or bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
On treatment day number 4, he was noted to be become hypotensive to systolic blood pressure of mid 80s without response to fluid boluses.
Hypotension was treated with capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy.
While on dopamine, he was noted to go into rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate between 160 and 180.
He was transitioned off dopamine and changed to Neo-Synephrine but had a persistent rapid ventricular response and persistent hypotension noted.
He transferred to the ICU and was initially treated with diltiazem without response and persistent hypotension.
Other side effects during this week included chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which resolved at the time of discharge.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 4.4 with associated oliguria.
Metabolic acidosis was noted with a minimum bicarb of 12 and improved with bicarb repletion up to 19.
He had no transaminitis, myocarditis, or coagulopathy noted.
He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 3.3, improved to 3.2 at the time of discharge.
He developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low 75,000 without evidence of bleeding.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post cycle 1 week 2 __________ therapy complicated by shock, atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure.
as needed for loose stools.
Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg 3 times daily as needed for nausea     and vomiting.
as needed for nausea and     vomiting.
