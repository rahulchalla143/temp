Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

CAth [**2180-7-24**] Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2180-7-24**]    BRIEF HISTORY:   Patient is a 73 year old woman with metastatic liposarcoma, type 2 DM, HTN and high cholesterol.
She has known CAD and had an LAD stent placed on [**2173-10-31**].
The patient presented today with chest and shoulder pain and was found to have ST elevations in leads I and AVL.

(Y/N) Y Y  PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a 90% mid LAD stenosis involving the proximal portion with the bifurcation to the D2 and a hazy lesion of the proximal LXC.
Final angiography revealed 10% residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
The lesion was crossed with a Fortte wire without difficulty.
Final angiography revealed no resdiual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed two vessel CAD.
The LMCA had a mild distal tapering but was without critical lesions.
Beyond the stent there was a 90% mid LAD lesion.
The remaining LAD had mild diffuse disease.
The RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures, pulmonaryy hypertension and a preserved cardiac output.
Moderate to severe diastolic dysfunction.
Acute anterolateral MI treated with PCI/stenting of the mid LAD using Drug Eluting Stent.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) CAD - Pt sent to cath lab and had stent placed in LAD and LCX.
Pt was started on [**Name (NI) 30474**] and ACEI, but medication was held after pt became hypotensive.
3) Pain - Pt continued to have pain to her right hip, buttock area throughout hospitalization.
Pain service was consulted and pt was first given oxycontin and IV morphine which was switched to oxycontin and MSIR for breakthrough pain.
4) Acute Renal Failure - Pt has h/o of chronic renal insufficiency and after hospital day #4 pt Cre bumped up from 1.0 to 2.3 to 3.0.
Pt ARF may have been contributed to dye load as well as poor fluid intake.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
If continue to have chest pain call 911 or go to the emergency room.
Anterior Myocardial Infarction 2.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Please call your primary care physcian if you have increased pain.
Please call 911 and go to the emergency room if you develop persistent chest pain, difficulty breathing or other worrisome symtpoms.
