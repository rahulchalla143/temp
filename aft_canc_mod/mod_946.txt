Briefly, per admission note, "this is a 59 yo F with NSCLC dx in [**3-22**], COPD, CAD s/p MI, has 2 recent admissions one with PNA and the other with hemoptysis in [**3-22**], who presented with tremors and HR 150.
The pt was asymptomatic and admitted to stopping her metoprolol the day PTA for low BP.
CTA was neg for PE, but showed a possible adrenal met and a lytic/sclerotic density in a compression fracture of T7 with probable posterior epidural extension of mass into spinal canal (seen on MRI [**3-22**]).
At that time she was found to have a 8x8x9cm mass in the RUL displacing segmental bronchi of the RML but no clear invasion.
CT guided biopsy showed non small cell lung CA.
She had a PET and an MRI and found to have a T7 likely metastatic lesion.
She underwent radiation treatment of both her spine mets and lung mass in [**4-21**].
-Strep pneumoniae pneumonia and sepsis and a prolonged intensive  care unit stay complicated by difficulty extubating, delirium, and right internal carotid artery cannulization.
-HTN -hyperlipidemia -COPD -panic disorder -CAD with a MI infarction in [**2144**].
Family History: She has no siblings.
Her mother passed away at age 76 of osteoporosis and severe emphysema.
She has no children.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Tm 98.5 Tc 98.5 BP 95-127/53-78 HR 99-123 R 25 Sat 99%RA I: 1027 O: 1850 Gen: well appearing female lying in bed in NAD HEENT: NC/AT, anicteric, OP clear, MMM NECK: supple, no LAD CV: tachy, s1 s2 distant heart sound, no murmur appreciated.
LUNG: +diffuse end expiratory wheezes, poor air mvt.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**4-25**]: There is a large lobulated mass in the right upper lobe measuring about 9 cm in greatest dimension and without change from the prior radiograph.
No acute new pulmonary abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent large neoplastic right upper lobe mass, in keeping with lung cancer.
No new pulmonary abnormalities.
No evidence for pulmonary arterial embolus.
There is a filling defect within a right upper lobe pulmonary vein at the inferior margin of the large RUL mass which may represent venous tumor invasion or thrombus.
Lytic/sclerotic density in a compression fracture of T7 with probable posterior epidural extension of mass into spinal canal at this level.
An MRI exam would provide better evaluation for cord compression.
Unchanged large right upper lung lobe mass consistent with the patient's history of lung cancer.
New left adrenal lesion measuring 9 mm concerning for further metastatic disease.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 59 yo F with newly diagnosed NSCLC who presented with hypotension and tachycardia.
# Tachycardia:  The pt was started on metoprolol in the ICU at a low dose given her hypotension.
EKG was most c/w sinus tachycardia.
She was hydrated with 2L normal saline on admission with mild decrease in pulse.
The cause of her sinus tachycardia is unclear, but from prior [**Name (NI) 21831**] over the past several years, the pts HR has varied from 60s-105.
The pt was hydrated with 2 more L of NS on the floor with no decrease in her pulse.
TTE was negative for a pericardial effusion.
# Hypotension: The pts initial hypotension on admission improved after IVF.
The pts metoprolol could not be increased back up to her prior dose of 100 [**Hospital1 **] given that her blood pressure remained low (SBP 90-100).
Pt becomes hypotensive in the setting of increase heart rate and receiving .
# Filling defect on right upper lobe pulmonary vein: CT chest shows a RUL pulm vein filling defect at the inferior margin of the large RUL mass which may represent venous tumor invasion or thrombus.
It is possible pt has an in situ thrombus from a malignancy-related hypercoaguable state.
Once transferred to the floor she was started on coumadin 5 mg po qd with a Lovenox bridge.
# Fever: The pt had a low grade fever on [**4-27**].
She had no clear sign of infection or elevated WBC.
She only had a mild cough.
# CAD s/p MI s/p RCA stent in '[**44**]; preserved EF.
Pt had some ST depressions on admission EKG, likely in the setting of demand ischemia.
# COPD (FEV1 0.56, 25% predicted; FEV1/FVC 34 (46% predicted); Continued albuterol/atrovent/flovent   Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 100 mg po bid Imipramine 50 mg p.o.
Anzemet 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for nausea for 5 days: may susbtitute equivalent 12.5 mg tablets.
Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Possible pulmonary vein thrombus vs tumor extension Sinus tachycardia Non small cell lung cancer   Discharge Condition: stable, HR 110 with BP of 120/80   Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescribed.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER for worsening shortness of breath, heart racing, dizziness, feeling like you are going to faint, fever, or any other concerning symptoms.
