HISTORY: Splenomegaly and acute left upper quadrant pain.
Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to protocol.
There has been interval development of a small amount of perisplenic fluid, predominantly posteriorly and inferiorly with respect to the spleen, with internal density values ranging from 37-43 Hounsfield units.
Additionally, there is a subtle low attenuation linear lesion noted within the anterior inferior spleen, which is not seen on the prior examination, which could represent a tiny area of rupture.
No focal masses are demonstrated with the spleen, there is no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
The liver appears normal without evidence of focal hepatic masses or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
The left kidney is markedly compressed by the enlarged spleen, which is unchanged since the prior exam, and again demonstrates a low- density lesion within the interpolar region, stable since the prior exam.
There is no free air.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are demonstrated.
The prostate, loops of bowel, distal ureters, and bladder are all within normal limits.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
Interval development of high-density fluid adjacent to the spleen, suggestive of a small amount of perisplenic blood with a low density linear lesion noted within the anterior and inferior aspect of spleen, suggestive of a small splenic rupture.
There is continued marked splenomegaly with compression of the adjacent left kidney.
Stable appearance of low-density lesion within the kidney, likely representing a simple cyst.
His pain improved, no further signs of bleeding, he was able to tolerate PO diet with no complications.
