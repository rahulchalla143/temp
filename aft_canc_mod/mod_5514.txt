Admission Date:  [**2178-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-11-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril / Tetracycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**Hospital3 66910**] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: 71-year-old male who was transfered from NWH for septic shock with neutropenia, gram negative rod bacteremia, acute DIC, and multiple organ system dysfunction.
He was recently diagnosed with Stage II Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and had undergone chemotherapy with 5-FU and Cisplatin at NECM in later [**2178-3-28**].
He was discharged home, but failed at home due to falls and dehydration so he was sent to a rehab facility.
On [**2178-5-3**] he was sent to NWH for acute onset shortness of breath, and in the emergency department there he was hypoxic in the 70's on a non-rebreather and he was hypotensive from septic shock.
He quickly developed anuric renal failure (35 cc urine output over 24 hours) with evidence for "muddy brown casts" in his urine.
He was neutropenic with a WBC of 0.2.
He also was noted to have bilateral leg swelling and LENIs revealed bilateral DVTs with the left leg occluded from calf to upper thigh, and the right with clot below the knee.
In addition, he was noted to have 700cc's of coffee grounds suctioned from his OG Tube with guaiac positive stool (he also has radiation injury to the rectum with some small bleeding).
Due to his anuric renal failure, he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with the possibility that he may require dialysis (CVVH).
Hypertension 3.
H/o previous MVA with head trauma and residual right-sided weakness 4.
Stage II anal squamous cell cancer - s/p 5-FU and Cisplatin in [**3-/2178**]  Social History: SOCHX:  He is reportedly independent at home and with his ADLs.
Unresponsive to pain or voice.
Pupils 3-4 mm and minimally responsive to light.
Dry MM membranes.
CV:  Regular tachycardia, no murmurs.
LUNGS: Diffuse rhonchi bilaterally on anterior exam.
Loss of occulocephalic reflexes.
No shunts or effusion.
MICRO DATA: [**1-31**] Blood cultures with GNR  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71-year-old male s/p chemotherapy for local anal squamous cell carcinoma who is now neutropenic in severe septic shock with multiple organ system dysfunction.
Septic Shock with neutropenia, gram negative rod bacteremia, possible acute DIC, and multiple organ system dysfunction - The presumed source is pulmonary with GNR bacteremia.
However, given his neutropenia he could have multiple sources and could be fungemic as well.
He had no signs of reversing his shock, though his pressor requirement had decreased somewhat.
Coagulopathy - He has a complicated picture that includes ischemic hepatitis possibly resulting in synthetic liver dysfunction.
He also has thrombocytopenia that may be due to sepsis vs. DIC vs. pancytopenia from chemotherapy.
Given the lack of schistocytes acute DIC seems less likely, and hepatic failure more likely.
The pt remained transfusion dependent to prevent massive bleeding.
Anuric Renal Failure - not a HD candidate and no sign of return of kidney function .
Upper GI Bleed - transfusion dependent with melena and unstable HCT.
Respiratory Failure - Possible aspiration plus pulmonary edema.
Mental status - He is non-responsive and has lost occulo-cephalic reflexes.
CT showed diffuse hypodense lesions throughout the brain.
Code Status - CPR not indicated due to the futility of CPR given his severe critical illness and multi-organ system dysfunction (including evidence for neurological dysfunction).
After a complicated hospital course, when the patient's prognosis appeared very grim, conversations with the patient's brother regarding end of life care and decision making were initiated.
