Two weeks she developed the acute onset of right shoulder pain and was found on CXR to have diffuse pulmonary mets thought to be due to a recurrence of her pancreatic CA.
She was to follow up with her oncologist when she noticed the progressive onset of SOB and fatigue.
She went into [**Hospital1 2436**] today and had a CTA which showed a PE in her RUL PA as well as her L pulmonary vein.
No scleral icterus.
No significant JVD RESP: Crackles present at mid left lung field.
Using accessory muscles but no abd breathing noted.
CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT: no edema, erythema SKIN: No jaundice.
Moves all ext throughout   Pertinent Results: LENIs [**6-4**]: No evidence of DVT  CXR [**6-4**]: Limited examination demonstrating left pleural effusion with atelectasis, as well as possible right lung "pseudotumor" versus true parenchymal mass and possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion, with the greatest amount of fluid apically.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse and early (brief) RV diastolic invagination.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o F with a PMHx of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**2133**] with recent metastatic recurrence to liver, lungs, bone found to bilateral PEs and pericardial effusion.
PE: Pt with a recent diagnosis of metastatic recurrence of pancreatic CA to bone, liver, lungs, pleura.
Has developed progressive DOE; found to have bilateral PEs as well as pericardial effusion.
Given the concern for a likely hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in the setting of her pancreatic CA, was not anticoagulated.
Had negative LENIs which did not show any evidence of large clot burden in LEs.
Pericardial Effusion: Likely malignant effusion from pancreatic CA.
Was evaluated by CT surgery and cardiology and given concern for recurrent pericardial effusion from likely malignant effusion, was taken for a pericardial window on [**6-6**].
Pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells.
HTN: The patient antihypertensives were held on admission given concern for pericardial effusion.
PNA: The patient developed a RML PNA and was treated with a 14 day course of levofloxacin/flagyl.
Pancreatic CA s/p Whipple now recurred: Metastatic pancreatic CA to bone, liver, lungs.
Was not a candidate for palliative chemo given diffuse metastatic disease.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Anxiety.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 269**] Hospice [**Location (un) 270**] East  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Metastatic pancreatic cancer 2) Bilateral pleural effusion 3) Pericardial effusion 4) Bilateral pulmonary embolisms 5) NIDDM 6) GERD 7) HTN 8) Hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
In addition, you were found to have bilateral pleural effusion (which is fluid between the two linings of your lungs), as well as a pericardial effusion (which is fluid between the two linings of your heart).
Later, you developed a fever, which was likely due to an infection in your lungs, which we treated with antibiotics.
We are giving you a medication called oxycodone and hydromorphone that you can take as instucted on the bottle for pain control.
You can also take lorazepam 0.5mg as needed for anxiety.
Please go to the Emergency Department of the hospital and call your doctor's office if you experience any of the following:  * Fever (>101 F) or chills * New and continuing nausea or vomiting * Abdominal or chest pain * Shortness of breath * Redness or drainage, swelling, warmth, or pus around your chest tube site * Any other concerns  If you experience clear drainage from your wounds, cover them with a clean dressing and stop showering until the drainage stops for at least two days.
Please take an over-the-counter stool softener such as Colace or a gentle laxative such as Milk of Magnesia if you experience constipation.
