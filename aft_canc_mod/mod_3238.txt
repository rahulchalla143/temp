History of Present Illness: 61 year old female with past medical history significant for low-grade follicular lymphoma diagnosed approximately 14 years ago now transformed to B-cell lymphoma s/p Cycle 1 of [**Hospital1 **] ([**2190-3-17**]).
The patient was admitted [**2190-4-19**] through [**2190-4-23**] for Cycle 2 [**Hospital1 **], which was deferred as the patient was complaining of diarrhea and was noted to be C. difficile positive.
On admission, the patient complains of sharp pain throughout her abdomen.
The pain does not radiate and has been present over the past day.
The patient has been intermittently nauseous but denies vomiting.
The patient had an abdominal X-ray from clinic the day of admission that was negative for obstruction.
The patient also complains of right flank pain.
The patient describes this pain as cramping but not radiating.
The patient states she has had this pain before and it has been ascribed to pleural irritation from tumor.
The pain began two days prior to admission and has been relieved by oxycodone.
The patient denies dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency.
The patient denies pleuritic pain, shortness of breath.
The patient has had several recent admissions for pleural effusions and was hospitalized from [**2190-3-27**] to [**2190-4-6**] with BRBPR.
She required transfusions; the bleeding resolved over time and the patient has not had colonoscopy since then.
Past Medical History: Non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma: diagnosis of lymphoma in [**2173**], initially low grade that transformed to large cell - Status post autologous stem cell transplant - Relapsed s/p Rituxan ('[**86**]-'[**89**]) - Subsequent progression, s/p bendamustin (5 cycles, discontinued due to nausea & vomiting) [**2189**] - Persistent pleural effusions and right-sided chest mass (local radiation) now s/p pleuridesis [**2-17**] - Pleural biopsy showing B cell lymphoma--> [**Hospital1 **] cycle #1: [**2190-3-17**] - Received Rituxan on [**2190-4-15**] .
Atrial fibrillation with RVR on previous admissions 2.
Hypertension 3.
Recurrent pleural effusions 6.
Has no children.
Family History: Aunt with colorectal cancer.
Physical Exam: VS T 97.3 P 84 BP 160/80 R 18 O2 sat 96% RA General: Moderate discomfort HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, OP without lesions Neck: Small nodule (old scar), no lymphadenopathy Heart: RRR, S1S2, faint 2/6 SEM LUSB Lungs: Decreased breath sounds right base, clear right Abdomen: NABS, soft, NTND, no rebound/guarding, well-healed scar in lower abdomen Back: Tenderness to palpation in right flank Extremities: Right upper extremity is markedly edematous, without erythema or warmth.
No LE edema Skin: Port on right, nonerythematous  Pertinent Results: Labwork on admission: STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY [**2190-4-21**]-FINAL {CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE} .
TTE [**2190-3-8**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-1-28**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yoF with high grade large B cell lymphoma admitted for Cycle 2 [**Hospital1 **] with recent admission for C. difficile.
Patient with abdominal and flank pain on admission.
Below is Course for the floor: # High grade large B cell lymphoma.
The patient tolerated this therapy poorly, with persistant nausea and fatigue.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
The patient had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate 130s-140s.
The patient has a history of these episodes thought secondary to irritation by epicardical lymph nodes.
The patient has a dilated left atrium.
# Abdominal pain.
No obstruction on abdominal x-ray.
CT torso showed no concerning findings.
Likely secondary to constipation or medication effect.
No concerning physical exam findings.
The patient was given a bowel regimen; the abdominal pain resolved with resolution of the constipation.
The patient subsequently had diarrhea later in her hospital course and was restarted on flagyl IV.
# Right flank pain.
Likely secondary to pleural irritation vs T7 metastasis.
CT torso showed no concerning findings.
Unlikely pulmonary embolus but on differential.
UA negative/urine culture pending to rule out pyelonephritis.
# Shortness of breath.
The patient became short of breath [**5-1**].
Chest x-ray showed fluid overload and question of gith middle lobe infiltrate.
The patient was diuresed with lasix with resolution of the shortness of breath.
The patient was given levofloxacin for question of community-acquired pneumonia.
# C. difficile infection.
The patient subsequently developed diarrhea and was restarted on flagyl IV.
# Right upper extremity edema.
Ultrasound negative for DVT on recent admission.
This likely represents lymphatic obstruction as CT torso showed persistently enlarged axillary nodes.
# Anterolateral and then inferior ST-T changes.
The patient remained asymptomatic throughout admission.
The patient had multiple negative cardiac enzymes.
# Hypertension.
The patient's metoprolol was increased for high blood pressures.
# History of pleural effusions.
The patient has a history of persistent pleural effusions (malignant) requiring multiple thoracenteses and eventually pleurodesis.
This may place the patient at increased risk for pulmonary infections and complicates [**Location (un) 1131**] of imaging.
Patient transferred to the ICU [**2190-5-8**] for worsening respiratory distress and low BP.
Found to have vanc resistant enterococcus septicemia.
Course was complicated by respiratory failure req intubation [**5-10**] and afib with RVR requiring amiodarone.
