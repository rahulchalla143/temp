Right and left lower lobe opacities, which may represent atelectasis or consolidations.
Scattered ill-defined hypodense liver lesions, which appear concerning for  cholangitis with microabscesses.
Moderate intraperitoneal free fluid without evidence of a drainable abscess.
[**2102-5-8**] ABdominal CT Scan: (1) New 15 x 8cm fluid collection at the inferior aspect of the afferent loop,  consistent with anastomotic breakdown.
2) Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
The differential for this area includes detractor injury versus cholangitis with abscess.
4) Multiple other small hypoattenuating lesions throughout the liver, likely  consistent with simple cysts versus hemangiomas.
7) Stable appearance of multiple simple-appearing cysts at the residual tail  of the pancreas.
[**2102-5-17**] Video Swallow Eval: No evidence of penetration or aspiration.
Mild residual within the  vallecula and piriform sinuses, which was cleared after several attempts.
Stable bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Resolution of subhepatic organized fluid collection.
Stable small amount of ascites without evidence of any new drainable  organized fluid collection.
[**2102-5-24**] CXR: Bilateral Pleural Effusions  PATHOLOGY: [**2102-4-18**] Operative Specimens: I.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A): 1.
Chronic cholecystitis.
Small intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, 0.9 cm, with low-grade dysplasia (slide O).
Tiny foci of low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
c. Dilation of pancreatic duct and focal chronic inactive pancreatitis.
d.  Mild hyalinization of pancreatic islets.
Chronic active inflammation of common bile duct with dilation, and of cholecystic duct.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GI:  [**2102-4-21**] EGD: 1- There was thick sputum and debris in the retropharynx and piriform sinuses that was suctioned.
2- NG tube in the esophagus and associated ulcerations 3- Blood in the stomach.
5- Anastomotic ulceration (injection).
[**2102-5-18**] EGD: 1- No blood in the visualized portions of the upper GI tract 2- Erythema in the stomach compatible with gastritis 3- Nonbleeding ulcer in the stomach body (beneath the balloon of the PEG) 4- PEG tube in the stomach body 5- The endoscope was passed to the hub in the left limb and approximately 20-30 cm in the right limb.
There was no blood in either limb.
efferent) 8- Gastric erosion (mild) at the anastomosis site  [**2102-5-19**] Colonoscopy: 1- There was no blood seen in the colon or ileum.
2- Polyp in the sigmoid and transverse colon 3- There was an area in the colon at 35cm where the mucosa was edematous and the lumen somewhat collapsed.
There appeared to be multiple diverticulum in that area but the mucosa appeared ok.
This could be an area that was transiently ischemic or inflammed with diverticular disease 4- Diverticulosis of the descending colon   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old gentleman who presented for a Whipple resection for an obstructing ampullary mass.
His post-operative course was extensive and complicated by significant post-operative bleeding requiring emergent laparotomy, ventillatory dependence requiring tracheostomy, tube-feeding requirements, and urinary tract infections with bacteremia.
He progressed well in the initial post-operative period but on post-operative day 3 he was noted to have tachycardia  with decreased urine output and a drop in hematocrit with bloody NGT output.
Emergent endoscopy was performed revealed blood in the stomach and ulceration in the anastamosis.
The patient subsequently became tachypnic with a decrease in arterial oxygen and was intubated.
His transfusion requirements continued to increase and his abdomen became more distended and he was taken to the OR on [**2102-4-21**] for abdominal washout and control of bleeding from his anastamosis (please see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for full details).
His platelets gradually dropped and an HIT panel was sent which was negative; this was assessed as being secondary to consumption coagulopathy.
His Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled with Diltiazem and aggressive diuresis was performed for post-operative fluid re-spacing.
He had partial dehiscence around his abdominal wounds which required initiation of wet to dry dressing changes.
On [**2102-5-8**] the patient had an abdominal CT scan which revealed a small fluid collection near the anastamosis.
On [**2102-5-18**] the patient was stable in appearance but was transferred to the ICU with a significant elevation in his WBC count and guaic positive stools with a drop in his hematocrit.
Colonoscopy and EGD evaluation revealed no obvious bleeding source.
Pan-cultures revealed no obvious source for the patient's WBC count but he was started on empiric treatment for presumed C-Diff colitis.
Anti-coagulation for his chronic atrial fibrillation was not started given the chronicity and his recent severe episodes of post-op bleeding.
You should return to the ER or call the office with any worsening abdominal pain, bloody stools, fever > 101.5, nausea or inability to tolerate a regular diet, respiratory distress, drainage from your wound, or concerning laboratory values.
