Admission Date:  [**2192-9-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-9-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-10-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Urinary retention  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo male with h/o PE s/p IVC filter placement and prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2183**] with known mets to his bone s/p XRT and chemo.
Pt presented this AM with "pain all over" and acute urinary retention since [**96**]:30 pm last night.
Pt complained of full body pain with pain localized to lower back and legs, which was old and new low abdominal pain.
He denied dysuria or hematuria.
He never had urinary retention in the past and no recent difficulty initiating urination.
He also noted difficulty walking [**12-22**] to both weakness and pain.
He does have LE weakness at baseline.
He was seen by neuro who recommended dexamethasone for possible cord compression and he was given 10 mg IV.
He had a CXR and abd x-ray which were normal except for bony mets in the pelvis and degenerative changes in the spine.
He also had an L-spine MRI which was pre-liminarily negative for cord compression.
Prior to transfer here CT of the T and C spines were done which showed degenerative changes and spinal stenosis in c5-c6.
A head CT was also done b/c the patient became confused in the ER.
No evidence of bleed was noted.
He initially complained of left sided chest pain but became pain free without intervention.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
ROS: Denies chills, sick contacts, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, incontinence, loss of sensation in extremities + fever to 100.5 per wife this AM + occ SOB with exertion and occ LE edema + transient CP for 10-15 mins in L side of chest   Past Medical History: -DM -anemia -s/p PE after hip surgery with IVC filter in place -Prostate CA diagnosed in [**2183**].
He was later found to have a "tumor" in his cervical spine and was treated with steroids and radiation for that.

*Urinary Retention: Urinary retention in the setting of lower extremity weakness and known spine mets was initially concerning for cord compression.
MRI of the L-spine did not show evidence of cord compression or cauda equina compression.
Urinary retention could also be [**12-22**] to autonomic dysfunction from DM but the acute nature of this makes this unlikely.
Pt did not have preceeding sx prior to this acute episode, however.
-Dexamethasone 4 mg PO dexamethasone q 6 hrs was continued for diffuse spinal metastatic disease with some muscular weakness potentially related.
-T and C spine MRI, no cord compression but diffuse metastatic dz.
-Foley to stay in -Pt has made decision not to pursue further chemotherapy or aggressive Rx.
*Abdominal Pain: Pt had new abdominal pain that coincided with urinary retention.
Likely [**12-22**] to bladder distension as pain improved after foley placed.
CT abd negative for acute process.
Low abd pain not consistent with elevated LFTs.
H/o PE, CP and tachycardia initially raised concern for PE, though this was less likely in the setting of a therapeutic INR and IVC filter.
-cardiac enzymes not consistent with acute myocardial ischemia and ECGs unchanged.
As patient is pursuing palliation at this time, will not pursue this further.
*Initial Fever: w/u negative (bld cxs x2, urine cx, chest xray, abd CT scan, spine MRI, brain MRI) and resolved by the time I had met him without intervention.
*Chest pain: Pt describes transient chest pain on a regular basis as an outpt and experienced CP here.
prior to d/c regarding support.
-Although an LP was recommended to look for meningeal spread of tumor to explain pt's ?weakness on limited neuro exam (see neuro consultation note in OMR), this was not pursued due to pt's desire not to pursue aggressive rx, elevated INR, and discussion with pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23509**].
*h/o DVT s/p PE:  Pt is on coumadin as outpt and has IVC filter in place.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
