Admission Date:  [**2145-10-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2145-10-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-4-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 36 year old female with history of renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the spine, status post nephrectomy with medical therapy complicated by drug-induced pneumonitis.
She noted her breathing to be increasingly labored with tachypnea.
She does have a history of chronic cough with clear sputum.
A chest computerized tomography scan showed moderate-sized pericardial effusion and the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.
Renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2142-12-12**] during workup for miscarriage.
From [**2144-9-10**] to [**2144-12-11**] the patient was started on PTK/787 chemotherapy, from [**2145-2-10**] to [**2145-8-10**] the patient was enrolled in a clinical trial and was treated with CTI-779/Interferon, however, this was stopped in [**2145-8-10**] secondary to question of pneumonitis.
Then in [**2145-8-10**] the patient was found to have spinal metastases.
Of note, in [**2145-9-10**] the patient had a bronchoscopy with biopsy with no evidence of carcinoma to her lungs.
Anemia of chronic disease.
4 hours prn cough 4.
In general the patient appears frail and tachypneic with mild respiratory distress, leaning forward.
Neck:  Supple, cachectic with persistent slow eye movements, unable to assess for jugulovenous pressure.
Cardiovascular: Muffled heartsounds, faint S1 and S2, no rub appreciated.
Lungs, poor air movement, faint crackles bilaterally at bases left greater than right.
Extremities, wasted 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, warm and well perfused, no edema.
Chest x-ray, diffuse interstitial thickening involving all portions of the lung without favoring any distribution.
Interval development of pleural effusion from [**2143-7-12**], new right T6 fracture.
Examination features of congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema, superimposed on persistent interstitial changes of pneumonitis.
Lower extremity doppler, no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Chest computerized tomography scan, new moderate pericardial effusion with associated interstitial and alveolar opacities.
Question of underlying interstitial metastatic process in the lungs which can not be distinguished from other inflammatory process such as drug reaction.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats/minute, normal axis, normal intervals, TWI/flattening in 1, AVL, AVR, V1 to V2, no ST elevations.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  This is an unfortunate 36 year old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the spine, now with progressive dyspnea times one day.
Computerized tomography scan with evidence of pericardial effusion.
The patient was admitted to Coronary Care Unit and noted to have a moderate pericardial effusion and was tapped for 470 cc of straw-colored fluid with the drain left in place.
In the meantime, the cytology came back positive for malignant cells.
On [**10-7**], the patient had a pericardial window performed with removal of drainage tube.
She required numerous small fluid boluses secondary to low blood pressure and low urine output.
The patient desatted to the low 80s when she had occasional coughing spells which caused diaphoresis and increasing pain.
The patient was on Celebrex, Zanaflex, Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/hr and Oxycodone for pain control.
Her shortness of breath was not improving and she required and had increasing oxygen requirement now to 6 liters of oxygen plus 100% scoop mask.
After discussion with Oncology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the pulmonology attending it was decided that the patient would have a repeat bronchoscopy and repeat biopsy to diagnose her pulmonary interstitial disease.
Pathology returned positive for carcinoma in the lymphatic system.
The patient continued to have periods of coughing and shortness of breath where she would desat down to the low 80s.
A repeat chest x-ray following bronchoscopy revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.
Following many lengthy discussions with the patient and family it was decided that code status be changed from full code to Do-Not- Resuscitate/ Do-Not-Intubate, on [**2145-10-18**].
At this time the patient's pulmonary status was progressively deteriorating.
We attempted to diurese the patient with Lasix, however, there was little improvement in her respiratory status.
However, this was eventually stopped secondary to increased pulmonary and lower extremity edema although there is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Pain - Initially the patient's pain was well controlled on a Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/hr with Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
However, the patient's pain requirement increased throughout her stay.
Given the patient's pain and increased agitation, Morphine drip was started on [**10-18**] with better control of her pain.
The patient understood that her condition was terminal with poor prognosis, and that she would not be considered for a mini-allo BMT, due to the severity of her disease.
The patient had a long discussion with her husband on [**10-18**] and it was decided that her code status would be changed from full code to Do-Not-Resuscitate/Do-Not-Intubate.
