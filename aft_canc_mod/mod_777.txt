She reports feeling confused and having headaches.
She was seen by her PCP and he was concerned that she suffered a seizure and did a head CT. She denies any other symptoms  Past Medical History: Hypertension [**10/2184**] benign cyst removal (small portion of small and large intestine removed)   Social History: Married, lives with husband.
+ Tobacco - 1 ppd, denies ETOH   Family History: Positive for father with heart attack at 55.
Mother died of liver problem at 42 and two older brothers with hypertension.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Multiple enhancing lesions in bilateral frontal and temporal lobes and left cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding vasogenic edema causing mass effect and leftward shift by 1.2 cm.
The findings are concerning for brain metastases; less likely lymphoma, infectious or inflammatory process.
Incidental small 3.3x2.9 millimeter aneurysm at the right middle cerebral  artery division- needs further assessment with MRA and INR consult.
Multiple pulmonary nodules.
The largest of these are seen in the left upper lobe (3:28) , has sattelite nodules and may represent the primary lesion.
There are multiple smaller nodules seen throughout the lungs.
There is extensive hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with central necrosis seen of the lymph nodes.
There is left axillary lymphadenopathy with a 1.7 cm in diameter lymph node with central necrosis, which is amenable to CT or ultrasound-guided biopsy.
There are multiple intermediate to solid density nodules seen within the thyroid lobes bilaterally.
There is a right adrenal mass measuring, likely benign.
[**2185-4-5**]: MRI BRAIN FINDINGS: Multiple brain enhancing brain lesions are identified with the largest at the right frontal lobe at the convexity with surrounding edema and in mass effect on the adjacent lateral ventricle.
Several other lesions are seen including lesions in the posterior fossa and the right temporal and left posterior temporal lobes.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: MRI performed for surgical planning with markers again demonstrates multiple brain lesions seen on the previous MRI [**2185-3-31**].
4/.17.12 CT BRAIN FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy with expected subcutaneous gas and post-procedural pneumocephalus as well as a trace amount of subarachnoid blood in the resection bed.
The sulci of the right frontal lobe are effaced into a lesser extent the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle there is 8 mm of right to left shift of normally midline structures (2A:13).
There continues to be vasogenic edema of the right frontal lobe in the resection bed.
There is no ntraventricular hemorrhage and the basal cisterns are patent.
[**2185-4-6**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes after resection of right frontal lobe lesions.
Minimal residual enhancement at the posterior margin of the right frontal lobe lesion is seen, best visualized on series 14, image 20.
Minimal marginal restricted diffusion appears to be secondary to surgery.
Other enhancing brain lesions in the temporal lobes and cerebellum are again identified, unchanged.
A CT Torso was requested which revealed multiple pulmonary lesions and adrenal lesions.
She had some left sided weaknedd and was taken to the OR on [**4-5**] for a right craniotomy for mass resection on [**4-5**].
She was stable on the floor, alert and oriented, neurologically intact, worked with PT on [**4-7**] and was ambulating independently without difficulty.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**6-28**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
You will need a CT scan of the brain with / without contrast.
