Admission Date:  [**2164-9-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-9-24**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with intervention.
History of Present Illness: 83yo female with known CAD (s/p MI in '70s and cath x7), HTN, Afib, CHF (EF 35%), [**Hospital 5550**] transferred from OSH for cardiac catheterization.
Pt was subsequently transferred to Life Care NH for rehab where she developed severe diarrhea and dehydration.
While being transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] to rehab pt experienced brief episode of chest tightness.
Pt reports onset of sub sternal chest tightness while being transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital to rehab center.
Chest tightness was unlike any other chest pain or GERD sx experienced previously and did not radiate to any other location.
Chest tightness was associated with SOB and sensation of "panic" or inability to breath, but no diaphoresis, n/v, lightheadedness, faintness.
Pt does admit to night sweats but this has been ongoing for some time now and has been atributed to CML and CLL.
Pt also admits to stable [**1-24**] pillow orthopnea that has not changed recently.
Found to have small sigmoid ulcer and internal hemorroids.
Pt has no complaints of CP/SOB.
Past Medical History: -CAD -HTN -CVA with residual left sided weakness -Chronic Afib -CHF (EF 35% by ETT MIBI on [**4-24**] at [**Hospital1 1474**]) -GERD -CLL -CML -?DM?
Neck: no JVP appreciate, asymmetric prominent carotid pulse at base of left neck with positive bruit CV: irregularly irregular, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS+ Back: no CVA tenderness Buttocks: 3 pressure ulcers in midline sacral region (largest is 4cm x 1cm stage II, with smaller ones approximately 2cm x 2cm and 2cm x 1cm stage II ulcers).
Ext: pigmentation of skin laterally on leg up to knees (as per daughter due to allergic rxn from 3 years ago, is improving), no clubbing, cyanosis, edema Neuro: A+O x3, CN II-XII grossly intact.
Strength: Right UE [**4-25**] with Left UE [**3-26**], Right LE [**4-25**] with Left LE [**3-26**]   Pertinent Results: [**2164-9-13**] 08:55AM   INR(PT)-1.0 [**2164-9-13**] 04:14PM   PLT COUNT-446*# [**2164-9-13**] 06:00PM   DIGOXIN-0.6* [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   PLT COUNT-445* [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   CK-MB-NotDone [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   CK(CPK)-27 [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   POTASSIUM-3.5  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2164-9-13**] Atrial fibrillation with well controlled ventricular response Left axis deviation - possible left anterior fascicular block Left ventricular hypertrophy Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2157-12-19**], atrial fibrillation is new  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2164-9-19**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-9-18**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response persist as do the ischemic appearing ST-T wave abnormalities in leads I and aVL.
The T wave inversions recorded on the tracing of [**2164-9-16**] can now be compared with the current ECG showing less prominent T wave inversions in leads V2-V6 but without diagnostic interim change.
Severe single vessel coronary artery disease status post PTCA and stenting of the RCA.
Moderate two vessel coronary artery disease involving the LAD and LCX.
Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Severe central hypertension.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed moderate two vessel disease and severe single vessel disease.
The LAD contained a 40% stenosis in the mid vessel and mild luminal irregularities throughout.
The LCX demonstrated moderate diffuse disease in the mid vessel.
The OMB revealed diffuse disease.
The RCA contained moderate diffuse throughout with 90% tandem stenoses in the mid vessel and a long 90% stenosis in the proximal PDA.
Left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 20 mm Hg).
Severe central hypertension was noted (aortic pressure was 200/90 mm Hg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Inferior akinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis were noted.
Moderate mitral regurgitation was noted.
Successful placement of overlapping 2.5 x 28 Cypher drug-eluting stent (DES) and 2.5 x 23 mm Cypher DES in the proximal to mid-RCA, postdilated most proximally with a 3.5 mm balloon and in the midvessel with a 2.75 mm balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Colonoscopy: Impressions: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Ulcer in the cecum Otherwise normal Colonoscopy to cecum  Recommendations: No lesions that would account for hematochezia were localized.
EGD: Normal EGD to second part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] is a 83yo woman with h/o CLL/CAD/AF admitted on [**9-13**] from OSH for CP/ROMI, transferred for elective cath.
Her cath on [**2164-9-13**] revealed severe 1vCAD s/p PTCA and stenting of the RCA.
Patient taken for EGD--> normal with mild gastritis.
Pt transferred to the MICU on [**9-17**] for stablization, and colonscopy revealed small sigmoid ulcer and hemorroids.
Aside from the GI bleed, her hosital course was complicated by a mulit-drug resistent proteus urinary tract infection, being treated treated with oral cefpodoxime with improvment of symptoms.
GIB: d/t sigmoid ulcer +/- hemorroids in setting of aggressive antiplatelet therapy.
As per GI, bleeding likely secondary to small ulcer/hemorrhoids in setting of high-dose antiplatelet therapy.
Serial hematocrits continue to be checked for stability.
ECG with small persistent inferior ST elevation, asymptomatic.
Pt monitored for fluiod overload given receiving blood products and fluids, without any signs of overload.
CLL: Continue hydroxyurea and allopurinol, outpt heme f/u  Diarrhea at OSH: 2 c diff negative during admission.
Pt's symptoms were resolving on discharge.
Hyperpigmented rash across body: may need outpt derm follow-up.
Prophylaxis: C diff precautions, bowel regimen, protonix, pain  Code:FULL  Communicate w/family   Medications on Admission: Hydroxyurea 500mg every other day Allopurinol 150mg once daily Digoxin 0.125mg QHS Lisinopril 10mg once daily Atenolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Lipitor 10mg once daily Protonix 40mg once daily Vancomycin 250mg Q6hours  After transfer from ED these meds added: Cholestyramine 4 g QD Simvastatin 40 mg Atenolol D/c'd, started lopressor 50 [**Hospital1 **] Plavix 150mg QD  All: -PCN (sulfas) -Lasix?, ASA?

Call your doctor if you have bright red blood from your rectum, chest pain, shortness of breath, pain with urination.
You have an ulcer in your vaginal region, you need to see the gynecologists for this, call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5777**] if you want to see one at [**Hospital1 18**].
You may not have a true allergy to lasix/furosemide or aspirin and taking these medications would help your heart greatly.
Continue taking your antibiotic for a multi-drug resistent proteus urinary tract infection for 8 more days.
