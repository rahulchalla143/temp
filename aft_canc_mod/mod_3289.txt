Pt reports no concerning GI symptoms prior to this since [**0-**]/[**2170**].
Colonosocpy at this time was notable for diverticulosis but no acute bleeding.
No fevers or chills.
No lightheadedness or dizziness.
Pt denied a change in appetite.
It was felt that given the pt's presentation and history, she most probably had a lower GI bleed due to diverticulosis.
On the night of admission, pt had another episode of BRBPR associated with lightheadedness.
A tagged red blood cell scan was also obtained which showed no active areas of bleeding.
On the morning of [**1-2**], an EGD was done which showed a Schatzki's ring at the GE junction but no bleeding.
A colonoscopy was significant for dark red blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon.
Another tagged red blood cell scan was then obtained which showed bleeding at the hepatic flexure felt to be coming from the right colic or middle colic artery.
HTN 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.

Blood culture [**1-7**] neg x2 --- Femoral vascular U/S [**2171-1-4**]:No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula in the right inguinal region.
---- Colonoscopy [**2171-1-4**]:Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon.
Recommendations: Consider dilation if patient experiences dysphagia --- Tagged RBC scan [**2171-1-2**]:Active gastrointestinal bleeding localized to the hepatic flexure   Brief Hospital Course: 1.GI: The pt seen by GI in ED.
She had a h/o lower GIB attributed to diverticulosis.
Had not had bleeding since episode at [**Hospital1 1501**] when we evaluated her.
However, she began to have moderately brisk BRBPR, associated with the bowel prep.
In the unit, she had an EGD which did not show bleeding, and a colonoscopy which showed blood in sigmoid and descending colon along with diverticuli.
A repeat tagged RBC scan showed source at hepatic flexure(same as previous bleed in [**Month (only) 404**]), but a follow-up angio did not reveal a source, so no embolization was performed.
Repeat colonoscopy two days later showed multipls diverticuli throughout colon, but no active bleeding.
It remained stable in the low 30s, and she had no further bleeding on the floor.
She was transferred back to her nursing home after 6 days without bleeding and a stable Hct.
Per surgery team, most surgeons have a cut-off for rate of bleeding before performing colectomy for this problem.
In addition, pt found to have Schatzki's Ring in esophagus.
HTN: Her BP was elevated with SBP 170 when she came out of the unit.
