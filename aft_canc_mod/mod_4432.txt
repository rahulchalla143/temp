He was found to have an atypical pigmented lesion at the posterior neck.
He was well until [**2154-8-10**] when he experienced mid-frontal squeezing headaches with an intensity of [**2155-3-13**].
It was worse with standing , and he had comcomitant nausea and vomiting.
A head CT showed a mass in the left frotnal brain.
This was followed up with a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2154-9-17**] at [**State **] Center that showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal brain involving the dura.
But he wanted to have Cyberknife radiosurgery.
He underwent cyberknife but followup imaging revealed persistent metastasis.
He presents today [**Date Range 82473**] for tumor resection.
Melanoma s/p resection & cyber knife  Social History: Married with daughter and step son.
[**Name (NI) **] tobacco, no alcohol.
Neck is supple and there is no bruit or lymphadenopathy.
His extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no nystagmus.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.
Coordination examination does not reveal appendicular dysmetria or truncal ataxia.
He does not have a Romberg.
Expected postoperative changes with minimal hemorrhage and pneumocephalus noted at both operative sites.
Unchanged degree of leftward midline shift secondary to vasogenic edema compared to the preoperative MR.  [**2156-1-24**]: CT torso 1.
No definite evidence of intra-abdominal metastasis.
No acute intra- abdominal process.
Unchanged 5-mm subpleural right upper lobe nodule.
Bilbasilar atelectasis.
[**2156-1-24**] MRI brain Status post left cranioplasty and metastatic resection on the left frontal lobe with decrease in the amount of air with persistent fluid level consistent with CSF and hematocrit.
Vasogenic edema is redemonstrated on the right cerebral hemisphere associated with melanoma metastatic lesion and causing effacement of the sulci and midline shifting towards the left with approximately 5 mm of deviation, not significantly changed since the prior study.
No new lesions are demonstrated in this short interim, and there are areas with hemorrhage on the left parietal, left temporal and right parietal lobes as described in detail above.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute/subacute ischemic changes.
Surgery was without complication and the patient tolerated it well.
He was extubated in the operating and transported to the ICU for observation.
CT head showed post-op chnages and persistent edema.
CT torso ruled out other metastatic lesions.
