Respiratory Viral Culture (Preliminary):     Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2165-10-18**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
STUDIES: EKG [**2165-10-17**]: sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm, nl axis, prolonged PR interval, nl QRS and QT, Q wave in III, no ST depressions/elevations (unchanged compared to prior on [**2165-9-30**].

F from [**Hospital3 2558**], systemic lupus erythematosus with positive lupus anticoagulants vs. antiphospholipid syndrome (on Coumadin with goal INR [**2-20**]), history of multiple PEs, who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath.
EKGs without any ischemic changes.
No events on telemetry.
Shortness of breath: Likely secondary to pneumonia, but also considered PE and pericardial effusion if in active lupus flare.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, and consideration was given to CHF also showed retrocardiac opacity.
TTE showed normal systolic and diastolic function but with mild elevated pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Also only small pericardial effusion seen on TTE.
Pt was ruled out for influenza.
Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with IVFs.
SLE with positive lupus anticoagulants vs. antiphospholipid syndrome: C3, C4, ESR, and CRP were ordered to evaluate for active flare.
Held coumadin on admission, which was restarted when pt was subtherapeutic and there was no plan for procedures that may cause bleeding.
Acute blood loss Anemia/ Bright red blood per rectum: Hct 28.8 today, baseline 31-33, Fe studies WNL in summer [**2164**].
Active type and screen maintained.
She continued to have blood clots in stool without significant drop in Hct.
Bleeding was evaluated with virtual colonoscopy which showed a small 5mm polyp.

Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
Oxycodone 5 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain: hold for oversedation or rr<12.
Pleuritic chest pain 2.
Acute renal failure 4.
Anemia 3.
Hypertension 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Seizure disorder 6.
Colon polyp   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, on 1L O2   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain.
During your hospitalization, your heart was monitored and you did not have a heart attack.
You were thought to have a pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics.
You also had an echo that did not show any dysfunction of your heart.
We believe the blood is coming from internal hemorrhoids, for which you should follow up with General Surgery for evaluation and treatment.
The following changes have been made: --> Albuterol nebulizer every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath --> We stopped your ciprofloxacin.
-->  Your gabapentin was changed to 300 mg po every 12 hours (this was changed for renal dosing) --> Coumadin was changed to 6mg daily to maintain a goal INR [**1-22**] (closer to 3).
--> Tylenol was added to your medication regimen for pain as needed.
We expect that you will continue to have small amounts of bright red blood and clots in your stool.
To date the amount you have passed small nickel sized clots and some bright red blood, less than the amount that would saturate a feminine hygiene pad.
However if you have multiple such bowel movments in one day, large amounts amounts of blood, black stools, or symptoms of large volume blood loss such as dizziness or worsening shortness of breath, you should go to the emergency room.
You should also call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room if you have chest pain or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
