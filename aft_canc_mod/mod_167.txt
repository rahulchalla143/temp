LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
CMV IgG POSITIVE, IgM NEGATIVE, no CMV DNA detected  [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] VIRUS VCA-IgG AB (Final [**2170-12-17**]):    POSITIVE BY EIA.
No evidence for pulmonary edema.
ECHO [**2170-12-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Small liver hemangioma.
Fullness of the bilateral renal pelvises without hydronephrosis.
Gallbladder wall edema without significant distention of the gallbladder likely relates to third spacing.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Left renal cyst.
Partially occlusive thrombus within a left posterior tibial vein with possible occlusive thrombus in a second left posterior tibial vein versus superficial vein.
No additional deep venous thrombosis within the bilateral lower extremities.
There is a bilateral diffuse airspace process which again appears slightly improved favoring that this represents some moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema rather than diffuse pneumonia.
No large pneumothorax appreciated.
[**Year (4 digits) 4338**] Brain, C-spine [**2170-12-21**]: Scattered areas of high signal intensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, extending to the callosal septal region, consistent with demyelination and related with a history of multiple sclerosis.
The plaques are more numerous since [**2163**], there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.
No mass effect or shifting of the normally midline structures is present.
The alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies appears maintained, disc degenerative changes are identified, consistent with disc desiccation, mild posterior disc bulge is noted at C4-C5, causing anterior thecal sac deformity and impinging the thecal sac (image 13, series 19).
There is no evidence of neural foraminal narrowing or significant spinal canal stenosis.
The spinal cord demonstrates areas of high signal intensity on the fat suppression sequence, more evident at C2, C3 and C5 levels, likely consistent with demyelinating plaques.
There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement in this area.
Head CT [**2170-12-25**] Final Report INDICATION: 64-year-old male with MS presents with coagulopathy, respiratory distress and mental status change.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A tiny amount of hyperdense material is seen in a right frontal sulcus (2:20) and a right temporal sulcus (2:14) concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
In addition, there is a small amount of hyperdense material layering in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle concerning for intraventricular hemorrhage (2:17).
There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.
There is no major vascular territory infarction, mass effect, or edema.
There is age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci compatible with diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Mucosal thickening in the left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses is noted, but the remainder of visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
There is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone lesion.
Findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal and temporal lobes and a tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle.
This likely represented diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in cortical sulci, and there was a "sedimentation layer" in the trigone and occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle at that time (8,12:[**10-23**]).
No pathologic leptomeningeal or dural enhancement was demonstrated on that exam.
HEAD CT [**2170-12-26**] CLINICAL INFORMATION: 64-year-old male with MDS and MS, found to have intracranial hemorrhage and altered mental status, for followup.
There has been interval development of hyperdense material layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, increasing the probability that this does in fact represent hemorrhage.
While the ventricles are mildly prominent, there is no dilatation of the temporal horns to suggest hydrocephalus.
Hypodensity in the frontal white matter, extending superiorly from the corpus callosum is consistent with the known demyelinating lesions seen better on [**Doctor Last Name 4338**].
Hyperdense foci are also seen within frontal sulci (image 26), which is nonspecific and could represent subarachnoid hemorrhage or calcification.
There is minimal mucosal change of the left maxillary sinus, and there is partial opacification of left mastoid air cells.
Additionally, there is an air-fluid level seen within the left sphenoid sinus with mucosal thickening.
Redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage, now seen within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, bilaterally.
Subtle hyperdensity within multiple sulci, likely reflecting resorption and redistribution of the diffuse subarachnoid blood seen on the MR study of [**2170-12-21**] is unchanged from the NECT obtained only 10 hours earlier.
There has been further ventricular dilatation since the remote MR study of [**2163-2-12**], but this more likely reflects progressive global, including central atrophy, rather than developing hydrocephalus.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY Cell culture was established to provide metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, TRILINEAGE DYSPLASIA, AND INCREASED MYELOBLASTS.
Note: The findings are highly suspicious for a myelodysplastic disorder best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-2) based on the number of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood (a marrow aspirate could not be obtained) and the core biopsy immunostained with CD34.
However, given the clinical presentation of the patient with severe anemia and acute high output cardiac failure the findings in this marrow need to be interpreted with caution and a follow up biopsy is highly recommended, unless cytogenetic studies confirm myelodysplastic syndrome or other related myeloproloferative disorder.
Please correlate with cytogenetic findings and clinical evolution.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The peripheral blood smear is adequate for evaluation.
Erythrocytes exhibit anisopoikilocytosis, targets, bite cells, elliptocytes, dacrocytes, and show polychromasia and basophilic stippling.
Monocytes are normal in number and exhibit mild dysplasia.
Lymphocytes are decreased in number and include some large granular lymphocytes.
Multiple nucleated red blood cells are seen (50% of nucleated cells) and exhibit significant dyspoiesis including asymmetric nuclear budding, nuclear fragments and cytoplasmic nuclear dy synchrony.
One core consists almost entirely of fibrotic marrow with variable cellularity, which ranges from 5% to 20%.
CD68 stains most myeloid precursors as well as increased marrow histiocytes.
CD117 (CKit) has strong staining in the mast cells and reveals an increased number.
Clinical: Anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
64 year old male with progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7595**] associated with pancytopenia concerning for aplastic process.
INTERPRETATION Immunophentopyic findings consistent with an increased population of myelodysplastic and erythroblasts, and suggest a myelodysplastic syndrome with increased blasts or acute leukemia.
However, the FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .
Clinical:  Multiple sclerosis and new pancytopenia.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo M with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis presenting with increasing fatigue/weakness, b/l LE swelling, and pancytopenia, bone marrow consistent with MDS, course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, DVT/PE, Pneumonia, ICH.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient initially presented with increasing fatigue.
Developed hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Differential included PE (patient with DVT found on LE ultrasound), transfusion associated circulatory overload [**2-14**] to rapid multiple transfusions, and less likely pneumonia.
CXR revealed a diffuse bilateral pattern.
Initially covered with Vanc/Cefepime, but then discontinued Vanc/Cefepime after 2 days when likelihood of pneumonia low.
Extubation was performed on HD 5, however patient was extremely tachypnic and required re-intubation.
In addition, patient had a large left sided effusion, largely related to volume overload/pulmonary edema, which was drained by thoracentesis.
Fluid was consistent with transudate and culture was negative.
Difficulty extubating was also thought to be related to underlying multiple sclerosis causing neuromuscular weakness.
# Deep vein thrombosis:  Patient had bilateral swelling of lower extremities on presentation.
Doppler ultrasound showed a partially occlusive clot in the left lower extremity.
Patient was placed on heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80 given patient's high risk of bleeding given his pancytopenia.
Lovenox was however discontinued due to thrombocytopenia.
A CTA was deferred given patient's initial acute kidney injury.
# Hypotension: Concern of sepsis from urinary and pulmonary sources.
Sedation may also have contributed to hypotension.
Adrenal insufficiency ruled out by normal cortisol AM level and cortisol stim test.
Bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with erythroblasts without evidence of leukemia.
# Multiple sclerosis: Patient has progressive MS, with recent deteriorations.
Oxacarbazepam was initially held as concern for cause of pancytopenia, however it was restarted once bone marrow showed MDS.
In addition, difficulty extubating was attributed to MS [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4338**] showed plaques in C3-C5 concerning for involvement of the phrenic nerve.
However, as above, following extubation, patient had no signs of neuromuscular weakness effecting his ability to breath independently.
# Supraventricular tachycardia: Patient was noted to have 2 episodes of tachycardia to the 150s after transfer to the BMT service.
He also became mildly confused during the first episode.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: On [**12-25**] patient was noted to be confused.
Given his low platelet count there was concern for an intracranial hemorrhage.
A head CT did show a small focus of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle and small foci of possible SAH.
# Acute mental status changes: Patient was noted to be confused on transfer from the ICU.
ICU delirium was likely a factor as mental status improved with better sleep hygiene.
Additionally, as above the patient was noted to have a small intracranial hemorrhage.
# Urinary retention- Patient noted to be retaining urine after removal of a foly catheter.
# Elevated INR - Patient noted to have INR elevated to 1.3-1.6.
# Urinary tract infection:  Urine culture was positive for pansensitive citrobacter from the urine.
# Hypernatremia: Patient's sodium was high during admission.
# Transaminitis: Initially elevated, then trended down.
RUQ showed no signs of hepatic congestion or infiltrative disease.
No venous thrombosis.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr initially elevated, likely [**2-14**] severe hypovolemia in the setting of severe anemia.
Potassium and phosphate were not consistent wtih tumor lysis syndrome.

You were found to have a clot in your left leg.
You were also found to have very low blood counts due to your bone marrow not working properly.
Since your blood counts are low we cannot give you blood thinners to treat the clot so a filter was placed in one of your blood vessels to prevent it from traveling to your lungs.
You also had trouble breathing while in the hospital and required placement of a breathing tube.
Your heart was noted to have an irregular rhythm that was very fast.
You were also noted to have a small bleed in your brain.
START senna, colace as needed for constipation 8.
START tylenol as needed for pain 9.
