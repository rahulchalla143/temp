Admission Date:  [**2101-6-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-6-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2037-1-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 64 year old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, who was referred from chemotherapy clinic on [**2101-6-6**], to the [**Hospital1 346**] with the chief complaint of shortness of breath times one week.
The patient reportedly noticed an acute worsening of her symptoms two days prior to admission, characterized by increasing dyspnea on exertion accompanied by dry cough and lower left extremity edema.
The patient reportedly denied calf tenderness but did complain of increased abdominal girth and poor appetite with concomitant nausea but no vomiting.
Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the brain and retroperitoneal and inguinal lymph nodes, now status post right parietal and left temporal resection.
Mild hypertension.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Endometriosis status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient underwent a plain chest radiograph which demonstrated an interval increase in the size of her cardiac silhouette as compared to prior film obtained on [**2101-5-17**].
Subsequent CAT scan of the chest demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with no evidence of pulmonary arterial thrombi and notable bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the cardiac care unit under the directly of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] with the presumptive diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.
The patient was sent to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for a pericardiocentesis; the procedure was performed without complications and resulted in the drainage of approximately 730 cc.
of serosanguinous fluid with an immediate reduction in filling pressures appropriate to the relief of this pericardial pressure.
Although the finalized results of this pericardial tap cytology are still pending at the time of this dictation, sufficient evidence existed at the time of drainage to suspect that the patient's pericardial effusion was malignant in nature and an Oncology consultation was obtained.
Following discussions with the patient and her family, the patient elected to temporarily hold her chemotherapy pending resolution of her effusion and abdominal distention.
A follow-up echocardiogram demonstrated a small to moderate sizes persistent pericardial effusion which appeared to be loculated, with no further evidence of tamponade.
Following a thorough evaluation of the patient and review of her assorted studies, the patient was recommended for a combined thoracoscopy, drainage of right pleural effusion and pericardial window.
On [**2101-6-10**], the patient therefore underwent a left sided thoracoscopy with a concomitant left pleurodesis and pericardial window.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and required one liter of fluid intraoperatively with minimal associated blood loss.
