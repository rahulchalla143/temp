Presented for chemo [**2124-3-7**] with dehydration and dizziness, found to have acute renal failure (Cr 2.0).
He had been unable to eat or drink due to throat pain.
His renal failure worsened, to Cr 5.0, thought to be ATN.
He began having hemoptysis and was seen by ENT, who felt he needed a tracheostomy, but did not feel comfortable doing it given his comorbidities.
[**2124-3-16**] he was found to have bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and was started on vanc/Zosyn.
He also had positive blood cultures for gram positive cocci.
He had a worsening respiratory status today requiring a non-rebreather, with which is O2 improved and he was thought stable.
There was concern for his ability to protect his airway, so he was transferred here by [**Location (un) **].
Labs notable for hyponatremia to 132, Cr 4.8 (per d/c summary peak 5.0), BUN 111, WBC 3.4 with N73 and 15% bands, Hct 24.0 and Plts 10.
He has not had signs of withdrawal.
He was having a lot of trouble eating and would have prolonged coughing spells after trying to have even a milkshake.
Past Medical History: - Stage IVb squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, s/p first round of chemo with docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU - DVT in [**2091**] s/p 3 months of anticoagulation - alcohol abuse - tobacco abuse - s/p right shoulder arthoscopy   Social History: He smokes 1.5ppd since [**29**], quit 3 weeks ago.
No h/o tonsillar cancer.

Moderate bilateral pleural effusions persist, with several internal locules of air.
There has been slight overall increase in multifocal ground-glass and consolidative opacities, demsontrating a peribronchovascular distribution.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51yo male with Stage IV squamous carcinoma of the tonsil, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with stridor, bacteremia, hypotension, and pancytopenia.
#) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and Pneumonia: Multifactorial, likely due to PNA/lung abscesses and volume overload as well as ARDS.
He was then started on Bactrim for Acinetobacter/Stenotrophomonas as well as Cefepime for Pseudomonas in the miniBAL.
He was requiring q1h suctioning of thick/copious/bloody or tan secretions, but his secretion production decreased significantly.
His CT chest scan suggested b/l lung necrosis and cavitary lesions, w/ right hydropneumothorax and L pleural effusion.
His respiratory status began improving due to fluid removal with HD and increased movement (getting into the chair).
Infectious disease was consulting along with the primary team, and agreed with the following Abx regimen to treat PNA attributed to pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas/possible invasive aspergillosis:  Abx regimen and projected duration: - Sulfameth/Trimethoprim Suspension 120 mL PO/NG QHD - Cefepime 1gm IV q24h (give after HD on HD days) start date: [**2124-3-29**] stop date:  [**2124-5-10**]  - Voriconazole 200mg PO q12h start date: [**2124-4-12**] stop date:  ongoing pending [**Hospital1 18**] ID f/u .
#) Bacteremias: His OSH cultures were positive for MSSA on [**3-16**].
TTE negative for vegetation, and TEE was not performed as there was no strong suspicion for endocarditis.
#) Atrial flutter: Throughout admission, he has had a persistently elevated HR usually ranging in the 90-130 or 140s.
#) Anemia: Patient with history of melena concerning for upper GI bleed.
NG lavage upon admission was negative for any blood or coffee grounds.
However, he may have had diffuse bleeding from multiple sites related to mucositis [**12-23**] chemotherapy.
#) Leukocytosis ??????
After trach, pt had some bleeding from the L angle of his mouth.
This was unclear in etiology and difficult to stop; there was no cut or lesion visible, but rather the mucusa of the lip was friable.
The bleeding improved with PO Amicar.
#) Thrombocytopenia: Pt required 15U of PLTs throughout hospitalization; no e/o active bleeding.
#)Stage IVb squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil: s/p 1 cycle of docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU, approximately on [**2124-3-2**].
If pancytopenia continues or worsens, can consider a bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis.
-Pt's fentanyl patch was decreaed on [**4-15**] from 100mcg to 75mcg; can increase back if pt experiences pain (was originally started while trying to wean pt off of ventilator).
Medications on Admission: Medications at home: - oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **] - oxycontin 10mg Q6hrs PRN - lorazepam 1mg Q4hrs PRN - diltiazem 60mg TID - nicotine patch 14mg - arixtra 10mg SQ injections  Discharge Medications: 1. white petrolatum-mineral oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
7. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO QID PRN () as needed for fever/pain.
8. oral wound care products     Gel in Packet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Fifteen (15) ML Mucous membrane TID (3 times a day) as needed for mucositis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypoxic respiratory failure Multifocal pneumonia  Secondary diagnoses: VRE Bacteremia Atrial flutter Anemia Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted because you had trouble breathing, and had pneumonia for which you had to be intubated.
