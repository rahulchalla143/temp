Intraventricular conduction delay with left bundle-branch block pattern and secondary ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2143-3-18**] probably no diagnostic interval change.
[**2143-4-8**] Portable CXR: CHEST, AP: There has been increase in diffuse interstitial and airspace pulmonary opacities, with confluent opacification in the left upper lobe and lingula, as well as the right perihilar region.
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, with a tortuous and calcified aorta.
There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
The bones are diffusely demineralized, with multilevel degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary opacities, likely representing worsening congestive heart failure, although underlying consolidation from  infection/aspiration, mass is not excluded.
Incomplete assessment of right renal vasculature but normal brisk upstroke arterial waveforms noted.
Normal left kidney with normal arterial and venous waveforms.
No evidence of renal arterial stenosis in either kidney.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 F with PMH of metastatic breast ca, HTN, and dCHF who presented to the ED with respirtory distress and hypertensive urgency initially requiring bipap.
Acute Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to hypertensive emergency as patient presented with SBPs in 190's.
Patient had crackles to mid lung field, peripheral edema, and evidence of volume overload on CXR.
At discharge she was breathing comfortably on room air and her peripheral edema had improved.
Hypertensive emergency: Patient has had three recent hospitalizations for CHF likely related to hypertensive emergency/urgency.
Work-up for secondary causes of hypertension was initiated in hospital.
She also had renal artery ultrasound without evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Anemia: Patient had HCT drop on admission, but remained stable in the 29 - 30 range after admission.
She had some hematuria with from foley trauma at admission, but not enough hematuria to explain drop.
Please continue outpatient anemia work-up.
Acute Renal Failure: On admission, creatinine was slightly elevated likely from poor forward flow in setting of acute diastolic CHF.
Troponin elevated likely in setting of demand ischemia.
Patient had no chest pain.
This was discussed with patient as it is difficult to resuscitate someone without intubating.
Hypertensive emergency: Initiated work-up for secondary causes of hypertension with TSH (normal) and Renal ultrasound with dopplers that did not show renal artery stenosis.
Patient to continue endocrine work-up for secondary causes of hypertension as outpatient.
