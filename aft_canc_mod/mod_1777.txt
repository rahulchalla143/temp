HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 64-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for ovarian cancer of a papillary peritoneal serous type, metastatic, status post TAH, BSO in [**8-/2104**] with recurrence of disease [**8-/2105**], which was treated with subtotal colectomy and ileostomy with mucous fistula.
Chronic PE, DVT, and most recently SVC syndrome.
On [**4-/2105**], the patient was diagnosed by increased shortness of breath.
The patient complained today of approximately three weeks of increased shortness of breath, which was intermittent and self limiting.
She also noted five days of increased low extremity edema, increased facial swelling, and increased in pleuritic chest pain.
The chest pain is left sided, now almost constant.
The patient also complains of headaches, fatigue, and chills with some increase in the amount of abdominal pain.
She denied fevers, change in stool, or dysuria.
She has chronic mild cough with scant sputum, which is unchanged.
Papillary peritoneal serous carcinoma, metastatic.
Chronic PE, DVT.
VRE line infection.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  GENERAL:  Obese, flushed female with facial edema, no acute distress.
HEENT: pupils equal, round, and reactive to light; extraocular muscles are intact neck was flush, supple, no oropharyngeal lesions, mucous membranes moist.
Chest x-ray showed residual left effusion.
However, there were numerous collaterals seen within the chest wall suggesting venous thrombosis, which could not be proven by CT imaging.
There were also noted multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, two small pleural effusions and two small pulmonary nodules not clearly identified on the previous examination.
The MR was not detected secondary to the stent, which was in place in the SVC from previous SVC syndrome.
This was done under general anesthesia, and the patient was intubated despite her DNR/DNI status for the procedure.
She was then transferred to the MICU for TPA infusion and frequent blood draws.
She also had some lymphocytosis and possible aspiration pneumonia was evaluated by chest x-ray.
until [**2106-10-27**] at 2 a.m.  Heparin was stopped at that point in preparation for a procedure, and then she was started on Lovenox 70 mg p.o.b.i.d.
for therapeutic INR.
Mental status.
However, in the MICU, it was noted that she had prolonged effect from benzodiazepines and the benzodiazepines were discontinued.
She was noted to be extremely lethargic, and thus underwent a head CT to rule out subdural hematoma.
The CT was negative for bleed or any other processes, and Ms. [**Known lastname **] mental status eventually improved.
However, on [**2106-10-25**], she became acutely short of breath, and she was placed on four liters of nasal cannula.
Chest x-ray showed stable effusions and no further CHF changes.
The EKG was stable without sinus tachycardia or any other changes.
As stated before, there was some question of aspiration pneumonia, and she was started prophylactically on Levaquin and Flagyl on [**2106-10-21**] for a total of a fourteen-day course.
After I had spoken with thoracentesis, preliminary results showed the pleural effusion to be transudative in nature.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has a history of CHF and EF of 35% to 45%.
The Ace inhibitor was continued through her stay, but discontinued on [**2106-10-22**] secondary to renal failure.
At that time, she was placed on Hydralazine and nitrates, which were held secondary to hypotension to systolic blood pressures of 60s to 70s.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent CT of the abdomen, which showed increased retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy indicating likely further metastases of her cancer.
It ranged from tender to palpation with some guarding; however, abdominal CT showed no further abscess.
Continued abdominal pain suggested possible microperforation; she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl, as above.
On [**2106-10-24**], they noted no stool per rectum suggesting possible enteroenteral fistula.
She began to receive Tincture of Opium to slow rectal output.
Acute renal failure.
She was given boluses of IV fluids and tolerated these well with some decrease in creatinine.
The urinalysis showed fungal UTI with total protein indicating possible nephrotic syndrome.
There were also some dysmorphic red cells, suggesting possible glomerular process.
As stated above, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also had hypotension to the 60s and 70s for two days, with her creatinine rising to a high of 3.0.
She had, initially, IV access, but this was discontinued and could not be restarted secondary to her extreme edema.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 32259**] family was consulted regarding further workups versus hospice care.
