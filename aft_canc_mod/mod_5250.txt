She went to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] and CXR revealed large mass in her R lung as well as a possible post-obstructive PNA.
She received 1X levaquin for post obstructive pna.
During transfer at 6PM, she became tachycardic to 140's, but in sinus rhythm.
Although her vitals signs were stable in the ED, she was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring given the potential risk for airway compromise as well as erosion of mass into her pulmonary artery.
She reporst a 12 poound weight loss since [**8-6**] as well as increasing fatigue.
Her SOB has gradually increased over the past 2 weeks with worsening wheezing and DOE to less than a block.
Also, over past few days, she has developed numerous enlarged lymph nodes as well as a large mass under right axilla.
She denies any hx of childhood irradiation   Past Medical History: Type 2 DM HTN hx of DVT s/p appy/chole osteoporosis glaucoma   Social History:  Pt lives alone.
Daughter lives in [**State 8780**] and is visiting  Family History: Father: good health; Mother died heart disease Sister: breast cancer dx age 68 No other family hx of malignancy   Physical Exam: Vitals: 98.6   118/52   106   95%4L NC Gen: NAD, pleasant, breathing comfortably HEENT: MM dry, PERRL, EOM intact NECK: no thyromegaly, LYMPH nodes: +R 2 cm firm, tender LN; numerous Pulm: coarse BS more on right than left, occ wheezes CHEST: 3 inch large mass on right midaxillary line, slightly tender Heart: tachycardic, [**2-12**] sysolic ejection murmur, no rubs Abd: soft, NT,ND Ext: no edema Neuro: strength 5/5 in UE and LE, face symmetric   Pertinent Results: CXR: FINDINGS:  There is a dense right hilar mass with narrowing of the right main stem bronchus and inferior trachea.
There is minimal mediastinal shift to the right.
There is no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  Right hilar mass with associated compression of the right mainstem bronchus and inferior trachea, better visualized on the concurrent CTA chest examination ([**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**]).
No significant interval change.
CT CHEST:  There is a large mass centrally in the mediastinum mainly located cranially of the left atrium in the midline and expanding towards the right side where it completely encircles the right main bronchus which is for a stretch narrowed only 3 cm in diameter.
It also encircles the proximal portion of the right middle lobe branch and the right lower lobe branch.
In addition there are two separate large rounded masses in the right upper lobe with a diameter each of about 3 cm.
There is also a smaller mass with a diameter of 2 cm implanted on the dome of the right hemidiaphragm.
There are no suspicious lesions in the left lung.
There is also a large hiatal hernia present.
THE RIGHT MAIN BRONCHUS HAS ONLY A 3 MM DIAMETER FOR SEVERAL CMS.
IN ADDITION THERE ARE SEVERAL SATELLITE LESIONS MAINLY IN THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE BUT ALSO IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE WITH PLEURAL ATTACHMENTS.
THERE ARE NO PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.
IN THE LOWER AXILLARY PORTION OF THE RIGHT BREAST THERE IS A 3 CM LARGE MASS.
Immunophenotyping: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia or lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
# Mediastinal mass: Mass encircles the right main bronchus as well as the pulm artery indicating that it is a middle mediastinal mass.
Biopsy of supraclavicular node revealed small cell carcinoma.
As small cell carcinoma highly chemosensitive, will complete treatment with chemotherapy and evaluate response.
Patient tolerated chemotherapy without complication.
On day of discharge patient reported difficulty hearing.
It was unclear if this was new onset hearing loss or age-related.
PNA: Pt reported noted to have a possible post-ostructive PNA at OSH and started on levaquin.
CXR here without evidence of PNA.
, # HTN: Had transient hypotensive episode in ED, but now BP in low 110's.
# CODE: DNR but OK to intubate discussed with pt and daughter .
