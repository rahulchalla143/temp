Admission Date:  [**2118-8-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2118-8-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-5-3**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 24-year-old male with past medical history significant for bilateral PE with bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusions in [**2118-6-3**] requiring extensive MICU stay and prolonged hospitalization.
Since discharge, the patient had been reasonably well, however, over the week prior to admission he developed onset of pleuritic right sided anterior chest pain associated with exertional dyspnea.
Emergency Room evaluation done at that time revealed no new clot by CTA but revealed a right atrial abnormality.
Follow-up echo showed echo dense space intimately associated with either the pericardium or the pleural space.
The patient was hemodynamically stable without pulses paradoxus or tamponade.
Echo at this time showed increased size of the right sided loculated pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the RV.
Chest x-ray showed increase in heart size.
EKG showed ST elevations in 2, 3, and AVF with PR depressions in 3 and a pulsus paradoxus of 10.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion status post drainage with pigtail catheter in [**2118-6-3**] with negative rheumatologic malignant and infectious work-up.
Bilateral pleural effusion status post pigtail drainage of the right with negative work-up as well for rheumatologic infectious disease and malignancy, bilateral pulmonary emboli diagnosed in [**2118-6-3**], treated with Heparin initially and currently anticoagulated on Coumadin, history of heterozygosity for factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12843**] mutation.
In general, in no apparent distress sitting in bed.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left and right atrial abnormalities, 1-2 mm ST segment elevations in leads 2, 3, and F, PR depression in 2.
ST elevations were new compared to EKG from [**6-3**].
Initially this was thought secondary to recurrent pericarditis.
On [**2118-8-9**] the patient was taken to the operating room by cardiothoracic surgery for pericardial window.
At the time of surgery, transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and showed abnormality in the right atrium consistent with perforation with overlying clots and fluid loculated on pericardial effusion.
At this time plans were suspended for pericardial window with plans for medial sternotomy in [**1-4**] days for repair of right atrial abnormality.
He was taken to the operating room again on [**2118-8-11**] where the patient underwent median sternotomy with exploration of his cardiac anatomy.
He was extubated on [**2118-8-12**] without complication.
His postoperative course was complicated by significant blood loss requiring a number of blood transfusions to maintain a hematocrit between 25 and 30.
His chest tubes and mediastinal tubes were removed without complication on postoperative day #3.
On postoperative day #4 anticoagulation for history of bilateral pulmonary emboli was reinitiated with IV unfractionated Heparin without a bolus.
Within 8-10 hours of reinstitution of anticoagulation the patient became tachypneic, tachycardic and hypoxic.
At that time it was noted to have a large re-accumulation of fluid in his right hemithorax on chest x-ray as well as a small pneumothorax.
The patient obtained hemodynamic stability and his chest tubes were discontinued without complications on postoperative day #7.
Follow-up chest x-ray throughout the remainder of the hospital course showed resolution of the patient's pneumothorax and stability in a small right sided pleural effusion.
Follow-up CAT scan revealed abnormality consistent with tumor and postoperative changes along the right cardiac border with bilateral atelectasis.
No pulmonary metastases.
Follow-up staging abdominal CT was performed during this hospitalization which revealed no evidence of metastases, showed a small right inguinal seroma.
The patient was placed briefly on Vancomycin and Ceftaz but after pan CT revealed no evidence of fluid collection or infectious etiology, these antibiotics were discontinued.
The thought was the fevers were secondary to tumor fever.
Upon discharge the patient's fever curve had been trending down with occasional low grade temperatures.
The patient developed a new pericardial friction rub during this admission after his operative course.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**8-21**] to evaluate this pericardial friction rub which revealed no pericardial effusion, stable LV and RV function.
The patient had some tachycardia that resolved by discharge.
Pain:  The patient had significant chest discomfort during this hospitalization which initially required PCA.
He was transitioned to OxyContin with Percocet for breakthrough and was discharged on 30 mg q a.m., 20 mg of OxyContin q p.m. and Percocet for breakthrough.
Pulmonary:  The patient had to rule out the possibility of DVT leading to PE secondary to concerns over his chest pain.
Heme/Onc:  Patient's tumor at resection was sent to pathology.
Pathologic diagnosis revealed angiosarcoma of low grade type.
Angiosarcoma of cardiac origin.
Right atrial perforation secondary to tumor.
Pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology.
Anemia secondary to blood loss as a complication of cardiothoracic surgery.
History of bilateral pulmonary embolus.
Postoperative chest pain.
