Over the past couple of weeks, he has developed numbness and tingling throughout his legs which has extended cranially and now involves the entirety of both legs, his groin, and the lower part of his abdomen.
A lumbar spine MRI at [**Hospital3 2568**] revealed a mass in his L1 vertebral body thought to be either malignant or a hemagioma.
A subsequent PET CT on [**2191-4-22**] showed an FDG-avid mass within his T6 vertebral body causing a pathologic fracture and concern for cord compression; the L1lesions showed mild FDG-avidity.
With this finding, he was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where an MRI of his thoracic spine (described below) confirmed the T6 mass and showed it impinging on the spinal cord with associated edema of the cord.
Past Medical History: atrial fibrillation treated with catheter ablation (not on anticoagulation since) - he has never had a colonoscopy   Social History: He works at the [**Last Name (un) **] and has a longterm girlfriend who is his healthcare proxy.
Family History: His mother had lung cancer but died of cardiovascular disease.
Otherwise, no known family history of malignancy  Physical Exam: O: T: 97.2 HR:97 BP:167/99 R:16 O2Sats: 99% RA Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Exam upon discharge [**5-8**]: T10 sensory level, motor intact   Pertinent Results: MRI T-spine [**2191-4-28**] Mass lesion of T6 which causes collapse of the vertebral body and which extends into the right anterolateral paravertebral soft tissues and posteriorly into the posterior elements and the central canal causing compression and edema of the spinal cord.
An indeterminate area of low attenuation in the right 5th rib could represent a further osseous lesion.
No abnormal mass lesion is seen in the lungs.
A number of other smaller  hypoattenuating lesions in the liver are too small to characterize, but may also represent hepatic cysts.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CTA chest [**2191-5-4**]: 1)No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aneurysm.
2)Loculated effusion which contains air in the left lower lobe overlying the thoracotomy site with a small Left sided pneumothorax and partial left lower lobe collapse 3)Consolidation in the right lung is most likely pneumonia.
4)Post-surgical changes in the paraspinal soft tissues with new orthopedic fixation device and residual paraspinal soft tissue.
There are some degenerative changes with disc space narrowing, worse at L5/S1.
Minimal anterior spurring is seen.
There are no compression deformities or abnormal antero- or retrolisthesis.
There is some residual contrast material seen within the colon.
There are some degenerative changes of the bilateral hips, right side worse than left.
Lungs are essentially clear except for opacity in the left lung which is related to recent thoracotomy.
There is minimal left apical pneumothorax that may retrospectively be seen on the prior study restricted to the very left apex.
A CT of chest of negative was negative for any pulmonary involvement.
On Post op day 2 early am, he experience acute onset shortness of breath and peri scapular inspiratory pain, followed by supraventricular tachycardia.
Pain (peri scapular inspiratory) and shortness of breath resolved spontaneously earlier this a.m. and SVT had followed this event by about two hours he went into a rapid afib rates 120-170.
They performed a CTA which was negative for PE, he did have a loculated effusion which contains air in the left lower lobe overlying the thoracotomy site with a small Left sided pneumothorax and partial left lower lobe collapse.
He was transferred back to our service on [**5-5**] and had no further cardiac or respiratory issues.
He had bradycardia from 70's-50's.
EKG ordered for irregular heart rate.
Discharge Instructions: -Do not smoke -Keep wound clean / Please shower daily --No pulling up, lifting> 10 lbs., excessive bending or twisting for two weeks.
-Limit your use of stairs to 2-3 times per day -Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection -If you are required to wear one, wear cervical collar or back brace as instructed -Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake if you experience muscle stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort -Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, Advil, aspirin, Ibuprofen etc.
