Admission Date:  [**2177-11-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-5-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: Pelvic mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, radical resection of pelvic mass, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ileocecectomy with ileal ascending colostomy anastomosis, rectal resection with end sigmoid colostomy and Hartmann pouch, infracolic omentectomy, extensive tumor debulking.
Due to her h/o nephrolithiasis, a CT urogram was done on [**8-11**] which showed non-obstructing stones and a bulky heterogenous uterus consistent with fibroids.
Pelvic ultrasound on [**10-16**] showed a large complex vascular left adnexal mass.
HEART:  Regular without murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and distended with a palpable mass extending from the left lower quadrant to the left upper quadrant.
There was also a palpable mass in the mid lower abdomen, which was also quite firm.
There was a large smooth mass that was palpable both through the anterior vaginal wall and through the posterior fornix.
By rectal examination, the posterior mass was filling the cul-de-sac.
Bimanual examination revealed that the mass seemed to be contiguous with the mass in the left upper quadrant.
There was no parametrial disease.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have markedly decreased.
There is a marked retrocardiac atelectasis, associated with a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Small areas of atelectasis are also seen at the right lung base.
The size of the cardiac silhouette has mildly increased.
There are no features suggesting pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
CTA Chest [**11-6**]: REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    R/o PE IMPRESSION: 1.
Acute pulmonary emboli, right upper lobe pulmonary artery and segmental divisions.
Severe bibasilar atelectasis and small airways obstruction probably also contributory to respiratory insufficiency.
Small bilateral pleural effusions reflect recent abdominal surgery.
No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.
Pelvic mass, biopsy (A-G):  Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with papillary serous carcinoma.
Uterus, right ovary and tube, left ovary and tube, small intestine, large intestine and rectum:  Papillary serous carcinoma, see synoptic report.
a.  Uterus, right ovary and tube, left ovary and tube (AA-AI):  -Uterine serosal implant of serous carcinoma.
-Resected supracervical margin is negative.
-Ovaries (left and right) with serous carcinoma.
Small intestine (R-U): Multiple serosal implants of serous carcinoma c.  Large intestine and rectum, partial resection (V-Z): Diffusely encased with serous carcinoma.
Cecum (AJ-AK):  No malignancy identified.
Sigmoid tumor ([**Doctor Last Name **]-AP):  Papillary serous carcinoma.
Left colon tumor  (AQ):  Papillary serous carcinoma.
She was monitored in the ICU overnight given her extensive surgery, and was transferred to the regular floor on POD 1.
*) Pulmonary embolus: On POD 1, she had shortness of breath, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
*) Chest pain: She had one episode of chest pain on POD 2 which resolved spontaneously.
Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia and her cardiac enzymes were cycled for 3 sets and found to be normal.
