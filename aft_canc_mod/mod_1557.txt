Admission Date:  [**2144-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, hematemasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD, arteriovenous graft revision, placement of tunnelled dialysis catheter, central line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a 74 year old man with DM II c/b triopathy, CRI on dialysis (baseline Cr 4), aortic stenosis, dilated CMP (EF 60%), and recent GI bleed who presents with nausea, coffee ground emesis, poor po intake, increasing confusion, and foul-smelling urine.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 4494**] in [**Location (un) 1514**] for vomiting and GI bleed from [**Date range (3) 32041**].
His son noticed that his baseline mental status decreased while admitted, as he was more confused and unable to answer questions about his symptoms.
Last week, his son noticed that the patient had poor po intake, and seemed weaker with less interest in the TV.
Last night, he observed his father vomiting; this morning, the patient had coffee ground emesis and his urine appeared dark brown and foul-smelling.
EKG showed diffuse T wave flattening and CXR was negative.
1st set of cardiac enzymes showed Troponin 0.10, which was decreased compared to prior Troponin levels and consistent with decreased clearance [**12-28**] to his poor renal function.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was not complaining of nausea, vomiting, or chest discomfort.
The patient was unsure of prior chest pain, SOB, hematemesis, foul-smelling urine, or dysuria.
Past Medical History: Type I diabetes mellitus, dx in [**2105**] complicated by: - peripheral neuropathy - retinopathy - nephropathy Hypertension Aortic Stenosis Chronic renal insufficiency Spinal spondylosis Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy BPH Compression fracture C4-5 Bone cancer in childhood  Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] lives with his son and his son?????
Skin: pink, no rashes, no suspicious lesions, no jaundice HEENT: NCAT.
III/VI crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at base with radiation to the carotids and abdomen.
No rubs or gallops.
No rales, rhonchi or wheezes.
Abd: Well-healed vertical scar on RUQ.
+BS, soft, NT/ND, no HSM, no rebound or guarding.
Back: No CVA tenderness.
No gross focal deficits.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Right superior mediastinal fullness likely relates to tortuous vessels.
No airspace opacification identified.
No gross osseous abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are noted, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is an anterior fixation device at L5-S1.
Otherwise, no gross osseous abnormality.
There is linear atelectasis versus scarring at the left lung base.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for obstruction.
Barium passes freely through the esophagus into the stomach, and there is no demonstration of mucosal abnormality or stricture.
Barium is seen in the tracheal tree secondary to regurgitation and aspiration.
There is an anterior fixation device, and there has been a vertebroplasty.
IMPRESSION: No transit of barium from the stomach: gastroparesis versus gastric outlet obstruction; recommend nuclear medicine gastric emptying study.
Contrast material has progressed to the colon, indicating the absence of a complete obstruction.
Diagnostic considerations include severe gastroparesis or partial gastric outlet obstruction.
Moderate ascites.
Small layering gallstones.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of coronary arteries, aorta and major branches.
Aspirated barium at the right lung base.
Upper lumbar vertebroplasty with retropulsed fragment of L2 into the spinal canal.
There is no evidence of thrombus within internal jugular, subclavian, or axillary veins in which compressibility, flow, and augmentation is maintained throughout.
No pneumothorax.
Moderate right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, with adjacent increasing consolidation at right lung base.
Small left pleural effusion is also evident as well as minor atelectasis at the left base.
High-density material is present adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to aspirated barium, as reported on earlier radiograph of [**2144-5-7**].
Deformity of proximal left humerus is likely due to old injury.
Increasing right effusion and adjacent right basilar consolidation.
The latter may potentially be due to an evolving infection, possibly secondary to aspiration.
Small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old man with DM II c/b triopathy, CRI on dialysis (baseline Cr 4), aortic stenosis, dilated CMP (EF 60%), and recent GI bleed who presents with nausea, coffee ground emesis, poor po intake, increasing confusion, UTI, and ?chest discomfort.
Briefly, pt was being treated for upper GI bleed and suspected severe gastroparesis when he missed an oral dose of amiodarone and went into rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation.
*) Nausea/coffee ground emesis, with poor po intake: Pt had hx of severe gastroparesis with admissions for similar sx in the past.
He had an EGD on HD#2 which revealed a medium hiatal hernia, tortuous esophagus, erythema with single polyp/protrusion at the gastroesophageal junction, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, edematous antral folds, edematous duodenal mucosa, and a polyp in the stomach body.
On HD#[**2-29**], pt began to have significant emesis and had an upper GI series, which demonstrated contrast in the stomach for >24hrs, consistent with prolonged gastric transit secondary to severe gastroparesis vs. obstruction.
Abdominal CT revealed contrast in the colon, ruling out complete obstruction, but differentiating between gastroparesis and partial gastric outlet obstruction was not possible with that exam.
Given lack of improvement, concern for process other than gastroparesis was considered and repeat EGD to further evaluate previously seen gastric/duodenal pathology.
Prior to this study, pt began to have significant bilious emesis.
EGD was postponed secondary to medical instability.
*) GI bleed: Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 3765**] ([**4-19**]) after admission for GI bleed.
He had an endoscopy and colonoscopy at that hospital which showed prepyloric antritis consistent with gastroparesis, esphagitis with mucosal ulceration, moderate-severe ischemic colitis, sigmoid diverticulitis, and internal hemorrhoids.
*) Atrial fibrillation: Hx of a fib, not currently anticoagulated secondary to GI bleed.
Pt with significant emesis, missed one dose of PO amiodarone and was found to be in asymptomatic rapid a fib on HD#6.
On HD#10, pt unable to be dialyzed secondary to clotted fistula.
He was started on a heparin gtt on HD#13, as the risk of hypercoaguability was determined to outweigh the risk of further GI bleed.
*) ?Chest discomfort: No specific EKG changes to suggest ischemia; patient has no h/o CAD.
Repeat EKG with no change.
Pt did not have any further sx during this admission.
# DM II: Pt was on lantus and ISS at home.
His lantus dose was decreased given poor PO intake.
Blood glucose was frequently elevated likely secondary to variable absorption of intake.
Pt with flat affect, poor short term memory, and apparent cognitive deficits on this admission.
Sx felt to be secondary to dementia, environment, and worsening renal failure.
*) UTI: Pt makes very little urine at baseline.
Pt has known moderate aortic stenosis.
ASA 81 mg held due to concern for GI bleed.
*) Hypothyroidism: Pt had elevated TSH, thought to be secondary to decreased absorption of levothyroxine in setting of prolonged gastric emptying.
Levothyroxine dose was increased and changed to IV in setting of poor tolerance of POs.
As emesis resolved, he was able to take sips of liquids, but still had poor PO intake.
He was started on PPN, which was subsequently d/c'd out of concern for poor renal function.
