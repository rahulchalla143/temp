Patient reports increasing fatigue and SOB x 2 weeks with associated myalgias, night sweats, subjective fevers, and shaking chills.
Additional symptoms include the following: - shortness of breath with minimal activity - hemoptysis with coughing up clots of blood on the day prior to admission - productive cough with green sputum - abdominal pain which he believes is secondary to repetitive coughing - chronic low back pain unchanged in character from previous  He otherwise denies increased infections, chest pain, dysuria, diarrhea, constipation, lower extremity swelling, recent bleeding, or easy bruising.
Of note, patient was recently found to have segmental retinal vein occlusion, raising concern for a hypercoagulable state.
Shortly after admission to the ED, patient was apparently clinically stable; however over the course of the day, patient became increasingly tachypneic and diaphoretic resulting in MICU admission.

FINDINGS: There is a consolidation with air bronchograms in the posterior and lateral basal segments of the left lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.
The costophrenic angle is obscured which may be due to a small parapneumonic effusion.
The mediastinum demonstrates a mildly tortuous aorta.
No definite pneumothorax is seen.
There is no right effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia as detailed above.
Possible small associated parapneumonic effusion.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST  HISTORY: Worsening hypoxia and tachycardia, evaluate for PE or other cause of hypoxia.
CHEST: There is no mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy.
There are small bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is multifocal patchy airspace opacity involving the perihilar area on the right, as well as bilateral lower lobes, left greater than right.
Findings are likely infectious, though the presence of bibasilar opacities raises the possibility of superimposed aspiration.
IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to prior tracing of [**2142-8-19**] no diagnostic interim change.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo male with past medical history of metastatic prostate cancer, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hepatitis C was admitted with shortness of breath and found to have neutropenia.
# Shortness of breath - The patient was found to have a LLL pneumonia.
Given his neutropenia on admission, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftaz/vanco/levo).
TTE did not show signs of heart failure.
His lasix was held over the last two days of hospitalization secondary to contraction alkalosis.
# Chest Tightness: The patient had one episode of chest tightness the day prior to discharge.
After 10 minutes his chest tightness resolved.
EKG did not show ischemic changes, and his cardiac enzymes were negative.
The leukopenia was lilely a result of his acute illness on presentation.
#Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient developed hypokalemia and a metabolic alkalosis after being diuresed with lasix over several days.
# Anemia: Unclear etiology of patient's anemia in setting of acute illness.
Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was initially administered his home NPH regimen at half the normal fixed dose along with a sliding scale.
His HCTZ was held because the patient developed a metabolic alkalosis secondary to over diuresis, but by the day of discharge his alkalosis had resolved and his HCTZ was restarted.
# Gastroesophageal Reflux - continued on PPI.
# History of Prostate Cancer: Patient's most recent PSA was 22 in [**2-24**].
