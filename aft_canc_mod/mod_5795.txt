No definite evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral lower extremity veins.
Left posterior tibial veins could not be visualized.
Upper GI Series : [**2168-10-18**] Significant esophageal dysmotility with multiple nonpropulsive tertiary contractions and corkscrew configuration of the esophagus.
Lack of passage of barium tablet beyond distal esophagus, which is likely due to esophageal dysmotility as described above.

Brief Hospital Course: Inpatient Oncology Service brief hospital course:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9480**] is a 82 yo woman with h/o low grade B cell lymphoma, initially treated with radiation in the [**2128**], recurred in [**2166**] and then treated again with chemo, who presented with failure to thrive, nausea, and diarrhea.
She was at a rehab facility where she was transferred after a recent admission for colitis when she developed altered mental status, vomiting, and diarrhea.
On admission she was found to have an elevated AlkPhos (1600), acute renal failure, and a UTI.
Her UTI was treated with antibiotics without issue.
Her elevated AlkPhos was investigated with a liver Bx which did not show B cell lymphoma.
Her ARF was treated with aggressive fluids complicated by peripheral edema and pulmonary edema.
She was found to have diffuse esophageal dysmotility.
Of note, she has a history of achalasia s/p dilations.
Her anasarca continued to progress to the point that she was diffusely edematous and developed worsening pulmonary edema.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: ([**Date range (1) 98467**])  Upon arrival to the ICU, Ms [**Known lastname 9480**] was volume overloaded and having difficulty breathing due to pulmonary edema, so she was treated with lasix.
A renal ultrasound was conducted to rule out hydronephrosis.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics inluding vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for hospital acquired pneumonia as chest x-rays were concerning for infiltrate.
She had increasing respiratory distress after lasix gtt was stopped.
ABG showed(7.33/36/184/20/-6) and CXR looked stable with perhaps slight increase in interstitial infiltrates.
She desatted on NRB with increasing respiratory distress, gas showed 7.32/39/60/21, symptoms unalleviated by 80mg IV Lasix so decision was made to intubate.
On [**10-28**], her pulmonary and renal insufficiency worsened.
Echocardiogram showed high output cardiac failure with hyperdynamic circulation and LVEF 70-80%.
This could be due to septic shock.
