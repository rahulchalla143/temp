Small subsegmental right upper lobe pulmonary emboli.
There is mild gallbladder wall edema and mottled apparance of the liver are likely due to congestive hepatopathy.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Severe cardiomegaly.
Multilobulated large left hemithorax pleural empyema with foci of gas noted.
Given the foci of gas the differential includes recent instrumentation versus infection with a gas-forming organism versus a bronchopleural fistula.
These findings may be representative of multiple cysts but a superinfectious process with multiple abscesses cannot be excluded.
Small subsegmental right upper lobe pulmonary emboli.
There is mild gallbladder wall edema and mottled apparance of the liver are likely due to congestive hepatopathy.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Severe cardiomegaly.
Compared to [**3-30**], there are increasing bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular congestion, and parenchymal opacities suggesting developing pulmonary edema.
Tere is no pneumothorax.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2162-3-31**] 9:08 AM IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of a dominant gas/fluid collection within the left hemithorax, and near-resolution of an adjacent medial collection.
There remains a loculated posterior collection that does not appear tocommunicate  with the catheter.
Adjacent severe left lower lobe atelectasis with a consolidative component.
Slightly enlarged small right pleural effusion.
New moderate anasarca.
Increased caliber of the main pulmonary artery likely reflects chronic  pulmonary hypertension.
Bilateral peribronchial ground glass opacity and patchy opacities which are a non-specific finding.
Slight decrease in size of right pleural effusion.
Stable increased diameter of the main pulmonary artery likely due to pulmonary hypertension.
Persistent non-mobile 1.3cm filling defect within the left main bronchus which is suspicious for polyp, neoplasm or mucus plug.
Mid-esophageal soft tissue mass severly narrows and may invade left main bronchus.
Interval placement of a second left lower lung drain with interval decrease in size of the air and fluid collection.
Persistent left lower lung consolidation is either pneumonia or atelectasis.
Thinning of the renal cortices with hyperdensity which could represent retained contrast or nephrocalcinosis.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

INDICATIONS: 86-year-old female with esophageal cancer, lung empyema and ischemic right foot.
There is no signal present at PT.
PVRs are artifactually diminished proximally and aphasic at the metatarsal level suggesting severe tibial disease.
PVRs show significant dropoff between calf and ankle and again between ankle and metatarsal level suggesting severe tibial occlusive disease.
Based on Doppler waveforms and PVRs, there is severe tibial disease bilaterally.
A small-to-moderate effusion layers posteriorly.
There is no large air-fluid collection in communication with the anterior or posterior drain.
Moderate left basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation is unchanged.
A moderate right effusion is slightly larger.
No new consolidation, nodule, or pneumothorax is present.
The boundaries of a large mid esophageal mass are hard to delineate without contrast.
The lesion measures approximately 1.9 x 3.4 cm (2:20).
Since the preceding exam five days ago, the left main bronchus has become completely effaced (2:20) by a combination of mass effect from the thickened esophagus, and bronchial secretions.
There are extensive secretions in the distal left lower lobe segmental bronchus at (2:25).
The non-contrast appearance of the heart and great vessels shows cardiomegaly, massive right atrial enlargment, and minimal aortic arch calcification.
No mesenteric, hilar or axillary adenopathy is present.
There are peripheral hyperdense foci in the visualized portions of both kidneys.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.

Final Report CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: Query pneumothorax, 86-year-old woman with large esophageal neoplasm extending into the left mainstem.
TECHNIQUE: Portable upright chest view was read in comparison with multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from [**2162-4-13**].
FINDINGS:  Lower lung opacity due to a combination of effusion and atelectasis now involves the entire left hemithorax suggestive of an increased large left pleural effusion.
Increase in the left pleural effusion.
There has not been much change in the position of the mediastinum probably due to associated left lung volume loss.
Moderate right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis is similar.
IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion has progressed over last two days.
Two left pleural pigtail catheters are in unchanged position and moderate right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.

Hospital course was notable for admission to the ICU where she was found to have lung and renal abscesses, septic shock requiring vasopressor support, DVT and PE, and difficult to control atrial fibrillation.
She was also noted to have a large esophageal mass suggestive of esophageal cancer with compression of the left main stem bronchus causing intermittent lung collapse and esophageal compression with dysphagia/aspiration.
Patient had a long ICU course and transferred from the floor to the ICU multiple times.
Ultimately, given the patient's multiple significant and severe medical problems, age, and progressively declining course despite maximal medical care, a discussion was held with the family and the decision was to transition the patient's care to comfort centered care and the patient passed away [**2162-4-19**] at 2:10AM.
#Septic shock/Lung and renal abscesses: Patient presented in septic shock from pneumonia with empyema and was found to have lung and renal abscesses.
Gram stain showed GPCs, GNRs and gram positive rods.
#DVT/PE: Patient was found to have DVT on lower extremity ultrasound.
CTA showed small subsegmental RLL PE.
#Esophageal Mass, likely esophageal cancer, with bronchial and esophageal obstruction: CT showed large  mid esophageal soft tissue mass with now complete opacification of the left main bronchus either by invasion, hemorrhage, and/or secretions.
There was persistent post-obstructive left lower lobe consolidation and bronchial secretions and patient did suffer collapse of her left lung.
It was believed that this mass was the etiology of her polymicrobial septic shock, as well as persistent pleural effusions and left sided atelectatsis.
Secondary to the obstruction of the esophagus and risks for aspiratoin, the patient was made NPO.
She did transiently receive TPN, but this was discontinued when care was transitioned to comfort centered care.
#Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has history of afib, but this was likely exacerbated or caused by infection/sepsis.
There may also have been contribution of irritation by esophageal mass.
After hypotension resolved patient was managed on the medical floor with IV betablockers but required transfer back to the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation and low blood pressures in the 90s.
# Acute Renal failure: Creatinine 1.8 with unclear baseline.
Her creatinine later increased to a peak of 2.8 which was believed to be ATN from septic shock.
# Anemia: She required 3 UPRBC in setting of elevated lactate and septic shock.
With the patient's age of >80 years and multiple medical problems that continued to progress despite medical care (including IV amiodarone drip, TPN, antibiotics, and IV anticoagulation), the family decided to focus on comfort centered care on [**2162-4-16**].
