Admission Date:  [**2128-11-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-11-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-12-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right Internal Jugular Central Line Placement Flexible Bronchoscopy Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 65 yo Vietnamese male w/ a PMH sig for Non-small cell endobronchial lung CA s/p RMSB stent ([**5-21**]), COPD, CRI, recent admission for respiratory distress requiring intubation, and chest tube placement x 2 in [**6-20**],  who presented to an OSH on [**11-7**] @ ~1730 with significant tachypnea and tachycardia, requiring 5 L NC to keep sats above 95%.
The patient's respiratory distress did not resolve and after obtaining an ABG of 7.17/74/226, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He became hypotensive with SBP<60 post-intubation.
He was given 1400cc of fluid and started on Levophed after a central line was placed in his right femoral vein.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
There is no evidence of RV compression.
Extensive scarring is present in both upper lobes with upward retraction of both hila.
Pleural thickening is present over the right lung apex and there is shift of the trachea to the right.
Similarly, the tenting of both hemidiaphragms and pleural thickening in the right costophrenic angle are unchanged.
No pneumothorax and no new lung lesions.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

CULTURE CONFIRMATION PENDING.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
The patient has significant CO2 retention at baseline with PaCO2 50-70 and a baseline compensatory metabolic alkalosis with HCO3 in the low 30s.
The patient was initially intubated in the setting of hypercarbia and impending respiratory failure.
On [**11-8**] he underwent flexible bronchoscopy with BAL at the bedside which demonstrated significant airway edema, thick white secretions but no obstruction.
The BAL fluid was positive for RSV antigen but no virus was isolated.
He continue to improve with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers and was breathing progressively more comfortably over the next few days on the floor with no significant oxygen need.
2. question of PNA: Patient's underlying respiratory distress thought secondary to underlying  sepsis [**1-19**] PNA aspiration vs. MSSA PNA.
He was febrile on admission, but afebrile throughout remainder of ICU stay.
Pt continued to improve and follow up chest X ray showed on [**2128-11-20**] showed no new lung lesions.
Sepsis: Hypotension likely related to septic shock on admission.
An ECHO was performed which showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, a normal LA, and an EF of 50-55%.
He was bolused for low CVP throughout the first several days of his hospital stay such that by [**11-12**] the patient was over 13 L positive, but did not show any signs of peripheral edema.
The patient was thought to be profoundly intravascularly depleted [**1-19**] sepsis, poor nutritional status and poor PO intake.
COPD: Severe underlying disease/possible exacerbation in the setting of RSV bronchiolitis complicated the patient's respiratory status.
The patient was maintained on a slow prednisone taper due to his severe disease, and was also sent home with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.
5. acute renal failure: The patient's Cr on presentation was 2.1.
Thrombocytopenia was felt most likely secondary to medication administration (likely secondary to Carboplatin, which he received prior to admission; there was also concern over contribution from vancomycin or levaquin, which were discontinued).
This favors the possibility of a drug-induced effect, most likely bone marrow suppression due to carboplatin.
Cachexia/malnutrition:  Pt had poor po intake after he was extubated and began to recover.
His mental status improved, but he became transiently hypernatremic and required free water repletion.
However, he was still with poor po intake on discharge, which is thought to be due to his malignancy.
During the hospitalization, and likely due to poor po intake, pt was dehydrated, with hypernatremia, relative hypotension to SBP 90s, tachycardia to 110s, and a contraction alkalosis.
The reasons were thought to be multifactorial, most notably in the setting of infection and then with steroids.
He should have his glucose rechecked by his new primary care physician.
Mental status: Pt required haldol and increased sedation while in the ICU, even needing a sitter temporarily.
A depression screen revealed no evidence of depression, and pt was back to his baseline per family members.
