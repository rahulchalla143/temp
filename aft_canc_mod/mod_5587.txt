HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female with a new diagnosis of large B cell lymphoma who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from Bone Marrow Transplant Service for respiratory distress, urgent need for central venous access and initiation of CHOP chemotherapy in anticipation of tumor lysis syndrome.
The patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 649**] on [**2131-10-19**] to the Medical Service with the chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue.
She was found to have prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions.
Of note, the patient was suspected to have lymphoma prior to admission to the hospital.
Her pleural effusions were tapped.
Pathology from pleural fluid returned positive for B cell lymphoma.
The pathology of supraclavicular node biopsy which was done as an outpatient prior to admission also was consistent with B cell lymphoma.
One day prior to transport, the patient had worsening shortness of breath and was ruled out for a pulmonary embolism for CT angio.
Within a few hours after transfer, she developed worsening tachypnea, shortness of breath.
Because of the lack for venous access and high likelihood of deterioration after the initiation of chemotherapy he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Upon transfer, she was short of breath, denied any chest pain, any nausea or vomiting.
She had no other complaints.
SLE diagnosed in [**2112**] complicated by end-stage renal disease requiring cadaveric renal transplant in [**2120**].
Her kidney transplant was very close match and she had no episodes of rejection.
Left hip avascular necrosis, status post replacement times two in [**2126**] and [**2130**].
HEENT:  The oropharynx had a wide plaque on the hard palate, also a covered tongue and buccal mucosal.
Neck:  No JVD.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Crackles two-thirds down bilaterally with no wheezes.
A CT of the chest was done on [**2131-10-20**] which showed massive axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy, with bilateral pleural effusions and collapse of posterior left lower lobe.
CTA was done on [**2131-10-21**] and showed no pulmonary embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress and CHOP chemotherapy was started the same night.
LYMPHOMA:  Diagnosed by chest CT confirmed by supraclavicular node biopsy and malignant cells and pleural effusion tap, large B cell lymphoma was positive for EBV virus, Burkitt's type with 100% cells dividing.
The patient's large tumor burden in the chest and neck was initially treated with the cycle of CHOP chemotherapy followed by five days of Cytoxan and high-dose prednisone.
LDH initially was elevated at 4,000.
The patient indeed has severe mediastinal lymphadenopathy with large lymph nodes compressing on the major airways and great vessels of the chest.
She developed chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia on day number three postchemotherapy, granulocyte colony stimulator factor was started at 400 mg IV q.d.
Because of the risk of AZT induced lactic acidosis per ABGs, the lactate levels were followed closely.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Multifactorial, caused by airway and great vessel compression and obstruction by tumor mass as well as large and growing malignant pleural effusions, hypoalbuminemia leading to third spacing and severe volume overload as well as atelectasis.
The patient was initially thought to have pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics without significant success.
She was later ruled out for pulmonary embolism with CTA.
Her pleural effusion was tapped on [**2131-10-20**] prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; 600 cc were drained with almost immediate reaccumulation of fluids.
During the course of her ICU stay on [**2131-10-26**], another attempt was made at therapeutic thoracentesis; however despite large pleural effusions bilaterally on the chest x-ray only 10-15 cc of fluid were obtained.
Follow-up CT done on [**2131-10-29**] showed growing large pleural effusions as well as persisting multiple lymph nodes, described above.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Soon after initial intubation, the patient began complaining of abdominal pain.
On [**2131-10-28**], the abdominal pain worsened.
She developed diarrhea positive for C. difficile colitis and was started on Flagyl p.o.
She developed a fever and was started on cefepime with vancomycin IV.
The patient remained afebrile on antibiotics for three days.
GASTROINTESTINAL/FLUIDS ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As above, the patient developed abdominal pain with KUB consistent with ileus on [**2131-10-28**].
This was followed by abdominal CT scan which showed dilated sigmoid colon and significant thickening of the jejunum.
Surgery was consulted due to the concern for typhlitis, infiltration of the small bowel by lymphoma and/or ischemic bowel.
Tube feeds were started two days after; however, due to severe gastroparesis and ileus, the patient could not tolerate even a minimal amount of tube feedings.
Of note, during this procedure, significant small bowel wall thickening was also noted.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Shortly after intubation, the patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as well as atrial ectopy.
The last echocardiogram was done on [**2131-10-31**] and showed hyperdynamic left ventricular function with mild outflow obstruction and mild pulmonary artery hypertension, both new compared with a previous study.
She had two episodes of hypotension requiring pressors.
Because of the concern for post transplant proliferative disorder, she was withdrawn of immunosuppression except for a low-dose of Solu-Medrol.
The patient's creatinine remained stable for the first seven days; however, subsequently, it started rising in the setting of some tumor lysis, multiorgan failure, multiple nephrotoxic medications, and likely renal hyperperfusion.
HEME:  Secondary to pancytopenia induced by chemotherapy, the patient required daily platelet transfusions and packed red blood cells every other day.
Laboratory data was consistent with chronic diffuse intravascular coagulation.
ACCESS:  Because of the severe lymphadenopathy, obtaining access was a difficult task.
