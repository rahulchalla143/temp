The patient denies any chest pain or any kind of prodromal symptoms.
The patient denies any black, tarry stool or bright red blood per rectum.
Diabetes mellitus 2.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3.
Hypertension 6.
Recurrent urinary tract infections 7.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  A small amount of dried crusted blood on lips.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur and fainter holosystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologic:  Alert and oriented x 3, no focal signs.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray from [**2170-1-13**] showed right lower lobe and right upper lobe opacity which could represent atelectasis or consolidation.
Because the patient had voluminous hemoptysis, and new oxygen requirement, she was immediately brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient received a chest CT, which was notable for a right lower lobe mass, read as concerning for malignancy vs pneumonia.
In addition, there was significant volume loss in the right lung, and atelectasis throughout the right lung.
Given that the patient gave a history of about a 30 pound weight loss over the past year, and new night sweats, the finding of a right lower lobe is quite ominous.
This did not show any clear central endobronchial lesions that could explain the hemoptysis, but did show complete obstruction of the right main stem bronchus secondary to blood clots.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed, as well as lymph node sampling.
Given that the patient presented with this new mass in conjunction with fever, and given that an obstructive process was present with multiple blood clots, it is very likely that the patient developed a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Pulmonary:  The patient has not had any further hemoptysis since admission.
The patient's transbronchial biopsy results showed only inflammatory changes with atypia, and no signs of neoplasm.
However, given that the patient is a smoker, with a one year history of weight loss and new night sweats, there is still much concern for a neoplastic process.
Of note, the patient had a negative PPD to rule out tuberculosis.
If the mass is the same size or has gotten larger, it will be necessary to do a more invasive sampling, such as a VATS procedure.
Otherwise, if the mass shows some regression in size, it may be mostly attributed to an ill-defined pneumonia.
On [**2170-1-17**], the patient developed increasing shortness of breath, even though her oxygenation was steadily improving.
Chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe process, consistent with effusion and potential mild congestive heart failure, and/or atelectasis.
The patient did not have any symptomatic improvement, nor did the chest x-ray change with the lasix.
Part of the patient's general shortness of breath was also attributed to her resolving pneumonia.
Infectious Disease:  As already noted, the patient was suspected to have a post-obstructive pneumonia, and was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient has been afebrile since admission, and her white blood cell count has decreased.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable, after a small dip at the time of bleeding.
The patient has a history of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, for which she takes prednisone and danazol.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, for which she is preload and rate dependent.
Codeine phosphate 15 mg every four to six hours as needed for cough 4.
Hemoptysis, concern for lung cancer 2.
Diabetes 3.
