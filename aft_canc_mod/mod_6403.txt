Admission Date:  [**2155-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-6-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Autologous BMT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: continuous renal replacement therapy hemodialysis intubation and mechanical ventilation tracheostomy paracentesis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male who was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma in 01/[**2154**].
He had a long preceding history of night sweats and dry cough, followed by the development of right leg swelling and a right inguinal mass.
In [**2154-1-31**] he developed swelling in his right lower extremity and a mass in his inguinal area.
CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis on [**2154-2-18**] revealed generalized lymphadenopathy beginning at the crural lymph nodes and extending inferiorly into the periaortic, mesenteric, celiac, pararenal, common iliac, and external iliac chains.
In the right groin, there was a large lymph node mass approximately 6 x 5 x 6.6 cm.
There was also a rounded low-density area just medial to the femoral artery which was felt to represent thrombosed femoral and external iliac veins.
Overall, the findings were concerning for lymphoma.
He was referred for a CT of his chest on [**2154-2-19**] which showed prominent adenopathy, principally in the left supraclavicular and left axillary regions, with the largest mass measuring 2.6 cm in his left axilla.
Based on that, he was referred for excisional biopsy of the right inguinal adenopathy on [**2154-2-26**] which revealed follicular lymphoma with partial marginal zone differentiation, grade I-II by large cell quantitation.
His lymphoma was felt to represent a transitional state between follicular lymphoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.
After three cycles of R-CVP, the vincristine was discontinued due to neuropathy.
He had also developed recurrent night sweats and cough.
He underwent a second PET scan on [**2154-6-12**] which showed little significant change, with hyperactive adenopathy at the left axilla and extensively below the diaphragm in the mesentery, para-aortic and pelvic regions.
He underwent a second excisional biopsy on [**2154-7-2**] which again showed follicular lymphoma, grade I-II.
CHEMOTHERAPY HISTORY  [**Date range (1) 83066**]: He received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone plus rituximab (R-CVP) x 3 cycles; the vincristine was discontinued due to neuropathy.
Night sweats and leg swelling improved.
[**2154-5-1**]: PET Scan showing extensive FDG avid disease  [**Date range (1) 83067**]: continued on R-CVP for two additional cycles, but after the fifth cycle, he noticed the recurrence of right inguinal lymphadenopathy.
He had also developed recurrent night  sweats and cough.
Denies headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, fevers, chills, recent night sweats, blurry vision, shortness of breath.
Reports only mild ongoing cough significantly improved from prior and occasional fatigue when his counts get low.

No evidence of focal hepatic lesion or hepatic or portal vein thrombus.
Suggestion of siderosis within the spleen.
No biliary abnormalities noted.
Hyperintense subarachnoid material, involving the sulci of both cerebral hemispheres, most likely representing subarachnoid hemorrhage, less likely proteinaceous material as seen in meningitis.

No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT TORSO:  [**2155-5-23**] 1:53 PM CHEST CT: Bilateral small pleural effusions, on the left increased as compared to the prior study and the right slightly increased as compared to the prior study.
Linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe accompanied by small patchy consolidations in the left lower lobe.
Small amount of pericardial effusion is noted (series 2, image 34).
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
Visualized small bowel demonstrate diffuse mucosal thickening without evidence of dilatation.
The findings may caused by ascites or GVHD.
Urinary bladder is not distended.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes in the lumbar and sacral vertebra.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, slightly larger as compared to the prior study.
Linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe and left lower lobe patchy consolidation which is new as compared to the prior study.
There is a suggestion of increasing layering effusions on this semi-upright projection.
Patchy opacities in right mid and right lower lung could be due to either atelectasis or early sites of pneumonia, and followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 56 year old male with PMH of follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma s/p R-CVP admitted for BEAM auto-SCT (C1D1 ([**2155-3-26**]) and as per BMT protocol, initiated carmustine day -7, followed by etoposide/cytarabine on days -6 to -3, then melphalan on day -2 ([**2155-3-31**]).
On [**2155-4-11**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress, altered mental status, renal failure, and transaminitis secondary to [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease.
Respiratory distress - The patient was tachypneic to the 40s on admission to the ICU and had an increasing oxygen requirement, thought to represent attempted compensation for metabolic acidosis and low lung volumes with atelectasis.
He had no evidence of pneumonia but was noted to be >7L fluid positive on admission, with increasing ascites secondary to his hepatic complications.
Serial CXRs over course of his ICU stay demonstrated reduced lung volumes with small amounts of atelectasis but no new consolidation, effusion, or intravascular congestion.
Patient remained intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a) impaired mental status and b) restrictive physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure.
Hypotension - The etiology was initially thought to be a combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchnic vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.
Sepsis thought to be a contributing factor as well, but he was maintained on broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, with no infectious source identified for the majority of his hospitalization.
The patient was initiated on levophed [**4-12**] and had a prolonged ongoing pressor requirement without an obvious cause for hypotension.
A cortisol stimulation test was performed to better assess for impaired adrenal response, did not reveal any significant abnormal findings.
After his CVVH was stopped, the patient had an episode of symptomatic hypotension, for which vasopressin was briefly restarted.
His hypotension may be related to his liver disease in addition to severe deconditioning.
He is persistently orthostatic which has somewhat improved with restarting midodrine.
Please continue to encourage thigh high compression stockings to increase peripheral resistance.
Autonomics was consulted prior to discharge and feels like hypotension is not likely related to dysautonomia given his hypotension even while supine.
It is felt that the hypotension is likely related to deconditioning and aggressive PT should be pursued.
Leukocytosis - Elevated WBC count beginning [**4-13**] with persistent hypotension.
Patient was at high risk for nosocomial infection (critically ill, ascites, multiple tubes/lines) with difficult-to-interpret fever curve on CVVH.
He was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics with a mild improvement in his leukocytosis but with no obvious source on cultures.
The patient was treated with seven days of ceftazidime per infectious disease recommendations, after which his leukocytosis improved but still remained dramatically elevated.
Ultimately, only his CVVH catheter tip grew out the same strain of pseudomonas on [**6-4**] that was in his sputum on [**5-12**].
He should no longer be on precautions as he has no active infections.
A component of this elevation may be due to auto splenectomy that appears to have occurred during this hospitalization.
Transaminitis/Hepatic Failure - Right upper quadrant ultrasound and abdominal MRI demonstrated reversal of flow through portal vein, suggestive of cirrhosis.
On admission to the intensive care unit, he was noted to have new significant ascites.
The patient was then started on a defibrotide treatment protocol on [**2155-4-9**] with close monitoring of coags, plts, hct, fibrinogen due to concern of bleeding (goal INR < 1.5, plts > 30, Hct > 30, Fibrinogen > 150).
After 25 days of treatment for defibrotide, a head MRI revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which necessitated discontinuation of the treatment.
The patient subsequently continued to show gradual, mild improvement in functional status, but continued to have large ascites on exam requiring periodic taps.
Depression: The patient appears to be extremely frustrated and depressed about his current state.
Caution should be used with blood thinners due to his low platelet level.
Ileus - Attributed to critical illness with ascites and opioid -based sedation.
Abdominal x-ray and CT scan were negative for obstruction.
The patient was started on reglan and an aggressive bowel regimen.
Lactulose was continued less frequently as prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and was eventually discontinued.
He developed loose stools/ diarrhea that was treated as below.
Diarrhea - Patient has had continued loose stools ever since his ileus resolved.
His stool frequency has improved after stopping lactulose but have continued to remain loose.
Altered mental status - Attributed to hepatic encephalopathy in addition to sedating meds for treatment of his abdominal pain.
Standing lactulose was started for therapy of hepatic encephalopathy and was also given broad spectrum antibiotics for treatment of possible infections.
Renal failure - The patient was found to have new renal failure that began on [**2155-4-10**].
Per renal, the etiology was most consistent with ischemic ATN.
His initial hypotensive insult was likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
The patient was started on CVVH on [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic acidosis.
He continued to be severely oliguric throughout his admission with no restoration in renal function.
The patient's severe volume overload was corrected gradually via CVVH while he continued to have an ongoing pressor requirement.
EKG Changes:  The patient had subtle ST depressions at the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**] in the setting of decreased mentation and hypotension.
He was ruled out for an MI and these depressions have since resolved.
Neutropenic fevers - On admission, patient was kept on broad spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fevers (vancomycin/cefepime/ganciclovir/micafungin).
Patient was culture negative and no source of infection was identified.
Antibiotics were stopped [**4-12**] following recovery of his neutrophil counts.
He was treated later in his hospital course for a pseudomonas pneumonia (see above).
Deep Vein Thombosis Prophylaxis: Patient not started on heparin due to low platelets.
White Petrolatum-Mineral Oil 42.5-56.8 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Follicular Lymphoma - Renal Failure, Acute tubular necrosis, now requiring hemodialysis.
- Respiratory Failure - Hepatic Failure Secondary to Venous Occlusive Disease - Hypotension - Multi-Drug Resistant Pseudomonal Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
If concerned about blood pressure, monitor for change in mental status.
Patient tolerating very low blood pressures attributed to deconditioning.
You had a prolonged hospital course that was complicated by liver failure, infection, persistent low blood pressure, kidney failure, and respiratory failure that ultimately required trach tube placement.
