Admission Date:  [**2131-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-6-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Roxicet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: J-tube replacement x 2.
2 blood transfusions   History of Present Illness: 40yo female with a history of esophageal cancer s/p trach was admitted from the ED with respiratory distress.
She has a tracheostomy in place due to esophageal cancer.
EMS presented and took the tracheostomy out and noted a small plug in the tracheostomy itself.
Her exam was notable for tachycardia only.
Her labs were notable for elevated WBC to 12.9, and her imaging was notable for CXR with left-sided pneumonia.
She was evaluated by thoracics who replaced her tracheostomy and they recommended further evaluation for her pneumonia.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic esophageal Cancer   ---> EGD - [**2130-6-1**] that was successful on the third attempt and tissue biopsy at that time revealed an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
---> [**12-4**] She was admitted with nausea and vomiting and found to have evidence of tracheal obstruction.
In addition, she had a CT of her neck, which was concerning for perforation.
She was noted to have a left upper lobe cavitary lesion on the CT scan.
She underwent a wedge resection on [**2130-1-11**], which revealed carcinomatous plaques on the pleural wall.
This was confirmed to be a metastatic disease on frozen section.
During the hospitalization she was treated for pharyngeal abscess and had issues with tachycardia as well as hypotension.
- J tube placed by surgery via an open procedure in [**4-4**] - constipation - hypercalcemia - tachycardia of unknown etiology - tracheostomy     ---->[**12-4**] - Tracheostomy placed due to supraglottic edema in the setting of esophageal perforation     ----> [**3-5**] - Tracheostomy placed due to vocal cord paralysis and stridor  Social History: Home: Originally from [**Country 3587**] and Portuguese-Creole Speaking only Lives at home with her cousin and husband who care for her.
Physical Exam: Gen: no acute distress, resting comfortably in bed, fatigued but interacting appropriately HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD, trach in place without erythema, tenderness, or discharge CV: RR, tachycardic, NL S1, S2.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: decreased breath sounds at the left lower base ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
Left lower lobe pneumonia with subjacent effusion.
Interval increase in size of left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Increase in size and number of cavitary masses in the lungs bilaterally, consistent with progression of metastatic disease.
Distended gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2-mm non-obstructing left renal calculus.
[**2131-5-14**] LUE US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
Near complete venous obliteration at the level of the junction of the left subclavian vein/left brachiocephalic vein, by invasion of adjacent pleural mass.
Interval worsening of left lung consolidation.
Left lower lobe bronchi is filled with secretion.
Edema of subcutaneous tissues of left chest.
No significant interval change in the thickness of circumferential pleural mass with loculated pleural effusion.
No significant change in the focal consolidations and cavitary lesions in the right lung.
Multiple osteolytic lesions in the left side ribs from local invasion.
[**2131-5-26**]: J-tube check: IMPRESSION: Jejunostomy tube terminates within the bowel with no extravasation noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 40F ([**Location 7972**] Portuguese speaking only) with metastatic esophageal cancer c/b respiratory failure requiring trach admitted initially with respiratory distress due to mucous plugging as well as hypercalcemia.
Her course was complicated by progressive lung mets on the left resulting in subclavian/brachiocephalic venous obstrution causing left facial edema.
She receeved treatment for HAP with persistent hypercalcemia and worsening facial edema due to compression of vessels by her tumor.
She passed away with her family at her bedside after several days of progressive cognitive and respiratory decline.
# Enteric - vesicular fistula: After Jtube replacement on [**2131-6-5**] Pt developed bilious output from her vagina.
Concern for entero-vaginal fistula so injected methylene blue into the Jtube at 0945AM on [**2131-6-7**].
Seems to be having blue urine consisent enteric-vesicular fistula.
# Pleural mass/Left-sided swelling: CTA of her chest on [**5-15**] showed near obliteration at the left subclavian vein and left brachiocephalic vein by a pleural mass.
Per rad-onc consult the patient has had radiation in the area which would need to be irradiated earlier in her disease and the risks of radiating her again would outweigh the questionable benefit it could given her.
Symptomatic treatment with pain control.
This treatment had to be used judiciously as she became agitated with steroids and suffered a fall.
# Respiratory Distress: Occasionally has respiratory distress secondary to mucous plugging which improves with suctioning.
Chest CTA on [**5-15**] showed interval worsening of left lung consolidation.
# Chronic Pain: The patient suffered chronic pain under her left arm near a previous scar which continued to cause her pain.
Also had local invasion of her left ribs which contributed to her pain.
Palliative care guided her pain management.
As her calcium remained elevated despite hydration, she was given zolendrenic acid on [**5-12**].
PTHrP returned negative and imaging showed multiple osteolytic lesions in the left ribs from local invasion.
Given this, bony mets are likely the cause of her hypercalcemia.
