She also complained of sharp right sided chest pain.
She was aditted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for rule out MI and fevers.
Past Medical History: -- R. breast cancer s/p mastectomy no chemotx / radiation[according to records from [**Hospital1 **]--pt had 1.9cm infiltrating, poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma; 8 axillary nodes (-).
Chest CT from [**2138-10-14**] shows "extenisive tumor mass involving the right anterior chest wall & ribs...there appears to be increase in the extent of .
] -- s/p excisional bx of right neck lymph node [**10-3**] (for purpose of assessing recurrance of breast CA via tumor markers -- Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer -- Osteoarthritis (according to son) -- Anemia NOS -- Pulmonary nodule (6mm) seen on [**10-3**] CT, unchanged from prior scan -- Calcified lung granuloma (?
remote h/o TB) --- choledolithiasis - 3 months ago @ MWH, had subsequent sphintorectomy and biliary duct stenting placed with improvement in n/v -> subsequent functional decline with overall weakness leading to R hip Fx after a fall at home.
--- R hip replacement - 6 weeks ago - s/p ORIF, subsequent care at [**Hospital1 **] --- SI/attempt [**1-30**] to hip fx and associated pain   Social History: Pt moved from [**Country 651**] to US 10yrs ago to live w/ her son & his children.
HEENT: NC/AT, temporal wasting, anicteric, dry MM, clear OP without lesions.
distant HS; S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: + BS x 4 quadrants, soft, NT/ND, no masses or guarding  Rectal: Guiac positive in ED.
Large area of skin breakdown with necrotic area, exposed bone, area ~ 5 cm diameter with minimal surrounding erythema.
Extremities: No edema, no cyanosis.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted, no extremity skin breakdown   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2138-11-20**]: Right lower lobe pneumonia with a small parapneumonic effusion.
Low limb lead voltage.
There is diffuse slight ST segment elevation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
MR head: Moderate brain atrophy.
No enhancing brain lesions to indicate metastatic disease.
There is no spinal cord compression.
There are STIR and T1 hyperintense lesions in C7 and T2 most consistent with hemangiomas.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2854**]: There is no evidence of metastatic disease to the thoracic spine  or thoracic spinal cord compression.
No lesion is seen that suggests a lumbar spine metastasis.
There is moderate degenerative stenosis at L4-5 where there is grade 1 spondylolisthesis and posterior element hypertrophy.
Associated right lateral chest wall 1.2 cm subcutaneous deposit.
Moderate-sized layering right pleural effusion with three right upper lobe/right middle lobe nodules.
No primary lung mass identified.
No additional osseous metastatic lesions seen.
Calcified lung nodule with associated multiple calcified mediastinal nodes suggest prior tuberculosis exposure.
Pneumobilia with distended intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts.
No hepatic metastases visualized.
Large right sacral decubitus ulcer extending to the sacrum/coccyx, chronic osteomyelitis cannot be excluded.
Right total hip replacement without evidence for loosening.
No acute fracture or dislocation.
Bone scan: Patchy uptake involving the anterior right ribs and sternum correlates with right chest wall osseous tumor invasion on CT scan.
Uptake around the trochanteric portion of the right hip prosthesis may relate to surgery, but if there had been a pathologic fracture initially, residual osseous tumor cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 YO mandarin speaking woman with metastatic breast cancer and recent hospitalization for hip fracture, state IV ulcer, and recent suicide attempt who presents with fevers, N/V and found to have pneumonia, UTI, bacteremia, Stage IV decubitus ulcer, pleural effusion.
# Fever: Has multiple sources of infection including RLL PNA treated with a course of azithromycin and at time of discharge no cough or sputum production, lungs are clear.
Pleural effusion was tapped and showed exudate negative for bacterial culture.
It is thought the pleural effusion is most likely associated with her malignancy but await cytology results.
# ID: During her hospitalization, the infectious disease service was concerned about active tuberculosis.
Her pleural effusion was negative for AFB stain.
Infectious disease and infection control have cleared patient for active TB; she does not need to wear mask at home OR have contact TB precautions when hospitalized (unless she develops new symptoms suspicious for TB) at which point this will need to be reevaluated.
She only had low grade temperatures and her lactate was normal which argues against sepsis.
However, she currently has multiple infections and a dramatic stage IV decubitus ulcer which puts her at high risk for sepsis.
# MS CHANGE: She is back to baseline currently, confirmed with son.
MRI head was negative for metastatic disease .
She denies blood in stool but was guaiac + is ED.
She has iron panel suggesting anemia of chronic disease.
# CARDIAC: She has small (if even present) ST elevations in II, II, AVF and no old EKGs to compare.
Echo showed normal L and R ventricular function with moderate TR.
# BREAST CA: She has metastatic disease to chest wall and ribs.
Per family, she was cooking and cleaning 7 weeks ago and now she cannot walk and has urinary incontinence.
MRI of spine was negative for evidence of cord compression.
CT showed large right breast/anterior chest wall soft tissue mass, eroded the adjacent sternum.
Associated right lateral chest wall 1.2 cm subcutaneous deposit.
Moderate-sized layering right pleural effusion with three right upper lobe/right middle lobe nodules.
No primary lung mass identified.
No additional osseous metastatic lesions seen.
Pleural effusion tapped and cytology is pending.
Pain control provided.
Lymph node cytology obtained from OSH revealing metastatic disease.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
