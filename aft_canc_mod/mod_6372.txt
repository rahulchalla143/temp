Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname 85394**] is a 69 y/o male with a history of CAD and metastatic RCC who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of respiratory distress and hemoptysis secondary to a tumor obstructing the trachea.
# Respiratory Distress: Secondary to 80% tracheal obstruction by vascular tumor.
Respiratory distress improved signficantly after removal of the tumor by rigid bronchoscopy and patient was weaned to room air with O2 saturation >95%.
Albuterol and ipratroprium nebulization was provided as needed for additional control.
# Right internal jugular vein: Patient was noted to have swollen right arm, and US showed thrombus of right internal jugular vein along with superficial clot in the antecubital veins.
Head CT was obtained and showed no evidence of metastasis, and patient was placed on heparin drip.
Of note, he did have occasional hemoptysis following initiation of lovenox, with a few tables of blood streaked sputum.
# Chest Pain: Has chronic right sided chest pain due to metastatic tumor, however he also endorses chest pain associated with exertion and relieved by rest, sometimes spreads to left side of chest.
Has a history of CAD and DM.
ECG showed some non-specific ST changes and TWIs in lateral leads that are a change compared to prior earlier this month.
Also had elevated troponin to 0.14 and CK-MB but these were trending down prior to discharge.
# Urinary Retention: Patient with urinary retention following bronchoscopy.
Patient was voiding spontaneously but continued to have large PVR and straight catheterization was required.
Patient developed burning on urination and UA showed evidence of infection.
# Metastatic RCC: Patient will need to follow up with Oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for any additional treatment options.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 85394**],  You originally presented for shortness of breath and were coughing up blood.
You were seen to have a tumor blocking most of your trachea.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy and removal of the part of the tumor blocking your airway.
While you were here, we noticed your arm was swollen, and an ultrasound showed that you have a blood clot in one of the veins in your neck.
Additionally, you had a urinary tract infection, probably because you retain some urine in your bladder after voiding.
Finally, you were also having some chest pain which appears to be from the tumor, but may also represent some strain on your heart.
Please use this list until you are instructed to change your medications: - oxycodone  5 mg Tablet 1-2 Tablets PO every four (4) hours as needed for moderate pain .
- docusate sodium  50 mg/5 mL Liquid Take 10mL 2 times a day as needed for constipation - senna 8.6 mg Take One (1) Tablet 2 times a day as needed for Constipation - ipratropium bromide  0.02 % Solution One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing, shortness of breath.
- albuterol sulfate  2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization, One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing, shortness of breath.
- lactulose  10 gram/15 mL Syrup Take Thirty (30) ML 2 times a day as needed for constipation.
- lisinopril  5 mg Tablet One-half Tablet DAILY - polyethylene glycol 3350  17 gram/dose Powder Take One (1) dose DAILY as needed for constipation.
