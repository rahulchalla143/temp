However, in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year, he was developing increasing confusion, aphasia, and headaches, and was found to have 3 metastatic lesions in his brain.
He underwent radiation therapy, and his symptoms improved.
He had been doing well until a restaging scan was done on [**7-20**], which demonstrated persistence of the three lesions associated with significant edema of the left posterior lesions, if not slightly bigger, as well another new lesion in the left parietal lobe.
He was seen in the radiation oncology clinic last week for consideration of stereotactic radiosurgery.
The multi disciplinary decision was made to go ahead with the cyberknife treatment, and hold off on resection, if his symptoms improved.
However, this morning he was noticed to have a new onset of expressive aphasia and weakness/inability to ambulated.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis associated with Dexamethasone 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Hypertension 5.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: Mild dysmetria, R > L  Discharge exam: expired  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2198-8-7**] 03:54PM   GLUCOSE-60* UREA N-24* CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-6.2* CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-16 [**2198-8-7**] 03:54PM   WBC-15.5* RBC-4.95 HGB-14.9 HCT-41.5 MCV-84 MCH-30.1 MCHC-35.9* RDW-17.3* [**2198-8-7**] 03:54PM   PT-13.0 PTT-22.0 INR(PT)-1.1  IMAGING CT Head [**8-7**]: Extensive vasogenic edema with underlying hyperdense mass lesions in the right temporal and left parietal lobes, compatible with known melanoma metastases.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Multiple lesions in the brain - left parietal/occipital and right temporal lobes as described above, with significant mass effect, vasogenic edema and cortical swelling and subfalcine herniation as described above.
CT Head [**8-9**]: No acute hemorrhage, mass affect, or new infarct identified.
No diffusion-weighted abnormality to suggest acute ischemic change.
Persistent vasogenic edema with mass effect in the corpus callosum splenium and effacement of the left ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Multiple post-gadolinium enhancing metastatic lesions unchanged from prior.
Expected post-surgical change status post left parietal craniotomy and tumor resection with interval near-complete resolution of left frontal pneumocephalus.
No new hemorrhage or infarct identified to explain the patient's change in mental status.
CTA Head [**8-11**]: IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of the temporal ventricular horns with air in the left temporal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**], contiguous surveillance is recommended to rule out hydrocephalus.
Stable post-surgical changes noted in the left parietal region, consistent with craniotomy, underlying vasogenic edema is redemonstrated in the surgical cavity with pneumocephalus, Unchanged vasogenic edema is noted on the right temporal lobe.
Mild mucosal thickening noted in the sphenoid and right ethmoidal air cells.
There is no evidence of major vascular occlusion or stenosis, minimal amount of atherosclerotic disease on the left cervical carotid bifurcation with a small soft plaque and calcified plaque in the left internal carotid artery.
The major intracranial vascular structures are unremarkable with no evidence of flow stenotic lesions or aneurysms larger than 2 mm in size.
Multilevel disc degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine as described above, more significant at C3/C4 and C5/C6.
New areas of restricted diffusion are identified adjacent to the surgical area and also on the right parietal convexity, raising the possibility of ischemic changes.
Persistent vasogenic edema in the left temporal and parietal lobes, the patient is status post left parietal craniotomy with blood products in the surgical bed, unchanged since the prior study.
Interval enlargement of the lateral ventricles with air in the left temporal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and persistent vasogenic edema on the right temporal lobe, unchanged nodular hemorrhagic metastatic lesions on the right temporal and left temporal lobes  MRI brain [**2198-8-17**]:Increase in size of the postoperative cavity in the left parietal lobe as well as a small extra-axial collection in this locale which has also increased in size.
The more lateral postoperative cavity in the left parietal lobe demonstrates a central area of restricted diffusion and possibility of an abscess cannot be entirely excluded.
There is enhancement of the ependyma and debris in the ventricles which may represent ventriculitis .
Acute infarctions in the right thalamus and left midbrain.
Subacute infarction in the high right parietal lobe, unchanged from prior examination.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2198-8-9**] for a L craniotomy for resection of a occipital and parietal mass.
a post op Head CT demonstrated no hemorrhage, and post op MRI showed persistent but unchanged vasogenic edema.
In the afternoon, he developed expressive aphasia again.
A stat head CT was performed, which did not demonstrate any specific rationale for the patient's change in mental status.
His exam deteriorated, as his pupils became unreactive and he lost all bowel function.
He was placed in 24 hour EEG monitoring, but no specific seizure activity was recorded.
There was a brief reported episode of hypotension at the induction of the anesthesia, which was transient and self-limited.
Over the weekend on [**8-4**] the patient remained intubated and with very minimal neurologic exam; his pupils remained non-reactive, and the EEG recordings were still negative for any seizure activity.
No acute infarct or hemorrhage was identified.
His LUE did have some weak withdrawl but no spontaneous movement.
Pt did have a fever on this day but repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures all proved to be negative.
In light of his poor exam and poor prognosis,a family discussion was had on [**2198-8-20**] along with palliative care consult.
