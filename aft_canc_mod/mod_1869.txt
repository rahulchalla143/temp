Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2166-2-26**] Left temporal craniotomy for mass resection.
[**2166-3-3**] Right inguinal lymph node biopsy.
History of Present Illness: 52 yo Right handed man diagnosed with a left temporal lesion in [**Month (only) 404**], found on workup of right sided arm and leg numbness, speech arrest, episodes of disorientation, memory difficulties and involuntary movements of his righ hand.
He was started on Keppra and the dose has been titrated up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] for control of these symptoms with good effect.
Since the increase in Keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] the patient has not experienced any numbness, tingling, difficulies with speech or episodes of disorientation.
Right hip replacement.
Chronic hepatitis B.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Biapical reticular and cystic changes consistent with patient's known history of histiocytosis X.
Subcentimeter subpleural pulmonary nodules for which a follow up CT chest in 12 months or attention on follow up imaging is recommended.
Bilateral axillary adenopathy which is stable since [**Month (only) **] [**2160**].
Left adrenal adenoma.
Multiple enlarged retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes.
A right external iliac lymph node may be amenable to ultrasound-guided biopsy if required.
[**2166-2-26**] MRI HEAD: IMPRESSION: Surgical planning study demonstrates increase in size (3cm) in irregular pattern of enhancement of left temporal and periatrial mass.
The mass has considerably increased in size compared with the MRI [**2166-1-17**].
Post-contrast images are motion degraded, limiting evaluation for pulmonary embolism in segmental and subsegmental branches.
No central pulmonary embolism identified.
Chronic reticular and cystic changes within the upper lungs in this patient with history of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis.
No new focal consolidation within the lungs.

He was having right ear fullness, headaches, numbness on the right side, and involuntary RUE movements (?seizure) x3 months.
CT torso [**2166-1-17**] significant for enlarged retroperitoenal and iliac LNs.
He tolerated the procedure well, but post-operatively he showed marked word finding difficulty.
A head CT showed no hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
He was given NaCl tabs for hyponatremia.
High-dose methotrexate delayed for iliac lymph node biopsy and bone marrow biopsy to exclude systemic lymphoma.
He tolerated chemotherapy very well and the expressive aphasia resolved over days.
# Anxiety and sleep disorder: Added clonazepam 0.5mg qNOON for anxiety.
Hyponatremia resolved, so DDAVP restarted [**2166-3-2**].
# Diabetes insipidus: Controlled on DDAVP.
# Chronic hepatitis B: Hepatitis serologies negative.
Tender right upper chest wall suggested musculoskeletal cause, no resolved.
# HTN: Continued lisinopril.
HCTZ stopped due to hyponatremia.
# Code: Full.
Left temporal mass.
Pelvic adenopathy (enlarge lymph nodes).
Expressive aphasia (difficulty speaking).
Hyponatremia (low sodium level).
Diabetes insipidus - makes sodium levels high.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a craniotomy and resection of a brain mass in the left temporal region.
Pathology showed this to be an aggressive lymphoma, so you were transferred to the Oncology service to start chemotherapy.
The surgery was complicated by a severe word finding difficulty, which markedly improved over several days.
Before you were given chemotherapy, a pelvic lymph node biopsy was done because a CT scan had shown enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen.
You were also followed by Endocrinology for diabetes insipidus and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) causing high and low sodium levels.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Your wound was closed with dissolvable sutures; you can wash your hair since three days after surgery.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**7-1**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
