The CXR showed left hilar mass and left upper lobe consolidations, and the patient was referred to the ED.
CT chest revealed a large spiculated left lung mass, bulky necrotic mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral pulmonary nodules, pericardial effusion and pericardial mass.
He was subsequently admitted for one week, during which time he underwent pericardiocentesis for effusion with tamponade physiology, and bronchoscopy with biopsy revealing a mix of small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma.
On [**7-2**], the patient re-presented with ongoing dry cough, chest pain, dyspnea, weight loss, and swelling of his left arm, neck and face.
Pulsus was measured at 10, and bedside echo showed recurrent effusion.
Vancomycin was discontinued after his pericardial fluid grew out coagulase negative staph.
Urine lytes were consistent with perfusion-related kidney injury.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient does not appear to have significant discomfort or distress.

b/l upper extremity edema w/ evident engorged veins b/l.
Near complete attenuation of the SVC by a large (4.7 x 3.0 cm) necrotic right precarinal lymph node conglomerate.
Extensive mediastinal and left hilar necrotic lymphadenopathy.
Left upper lobe necrotic mass stable to slightly increased in size.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are increased.
Unchanged pericardial lesion with moderate pericardial effusion, stable to slightly increased from PET-CT from five days prior.
Right mainstem endobronchial filling defect could reflect aspirated secretions or tumoral involvement.
[**7-2**] Echo: There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is left atrial diastolic collapse.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Pericardial tamponade.
Successful pericardiocentesis with 400cc bloody fluid removed and sent for pathological analysis.
[**7-4**] CXR: In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of [**2176-6-17**], the patient is now intubated and has bilateral chest tubes as described without evidence of pneumothorax.
Hilar mass appears unchanged.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no overt echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-7-19**], the pericardial effusion has increased in size.
Decrease in size of spiculated left lung nodule and decreased size of conglomerate necrotic lymph nodes throughout the mediastinum as compared to [**2176-7-2**] chest CT.
Decrease in pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural effusions, and enhancing pericardial soft tissue lesion.
Numerous less than or equal to 4-mm diameter lung nodules are mostly stable in size since the prior scans except for a 4-mm right upper lobe nodule which has grown from 2 mm.
Asymmetrical interstitial thickening involving the left lung greater than the right is concerning for lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but hydrostatic edema and infection may produce a similar appearance.
Nonspecific lingular opacities favor an infectious or inflammatory etiology over new foci of metastatic disease.
Tiny loculated left basilar pneumothorax with left chest tube in place, which has a partially intrafissural location.
Brief Hospital Course: ============================= BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY ============================= 58 yo vietnamese male with history of GERD and new diagnosis of SCLC presented with pericardial effusion and SVC syndrome.
Subsequently he developed bilateral pleural effusions, a left pneumothorax, had 3 chest tubes placed and then developed a RLL pneumonia.
# Pericardial Effusion sp Drain Placement: malignant, recent lung carcinoma diagnosis.
The drain was removed, and the patient exhibited no signs of tampanade while in the ICU.
s/p pericardial window [**7-4**], but [**7-29**] TTE showed reaccumulation of moderate effusion, which is loculated,  likely not draining through window, per thoracics, no further intervention.
# SVC syndrome: Chest imaging concerning for near-total attenuation of SVC by mass.
Significant edema in UE's.
No clear interval change from most recent CT.  MRV was done during this hospitalization to attempt to locate site for access (for chemo).
Ultimately, there was no place for access, and an abdominal port was placed by surgery.
# Pleural effusions: Bilateral, malignant effusions [**2-7**] recent lung cancer diagnosis.
9 days later, he had reaccumulation and b/l taps on [**7-22**] and [**7-23**].
Most recent CT imaging on [**8-5**] demonstrated decrease in bilateral pleural effusions.
# Lung Mass: Mixed small cell / non-small cell lung Ca pt initiated chemotherapy ([**Doctor Last Name **]/Etoposide) on [**2176-7-6**] in hopes that this would help not only his cancer, but also treat his malignant effusions.
He had a second cycle on [**2176-7-27**].
No acute inpt therapy potential with radiation, per conversation with rad onc.
# RLL Pneumonia: on the evening of [**2176-7-12**] the patient became hypotensive despite good PO intake and IVF's.
W/u revealed a RLL pneumonia for which he was started on Vanc and Cefepime.
# Anemia, Thrombocytosis: most likely related to initiation of chemotherapy ========================= INACTIVE ISSUES ========================= # GERD: The patient does not take medications for this at home, and he was monitored for symptoms.
========================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ========================= 1. sutures from L pleurex placed [**7-31**], to be removed at 8/9 IP appt 2. pt sent home with VNA services to assist with pleurx drainage, qod 3. pt arranged to have hospital bed, wheelchair delivered to home 4. pt needs vietnamese translator for all outpt appts 5. f/u pericardial effusion with cardiology on [**9-6**] 6. f/u w/ ?
