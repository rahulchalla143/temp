Current problems include febrile neutropenia (afebrile since [**2126-4-12**]), anasarca/CHF, GVHD (skin, bowel, and liver), acute renal failure, bilirubinemia, pancytopenia.
Patient developed diffuse abdominal pain yesterday in the BMT unit and was mildly uncomfortable with tachypnea on exam.
Abdominal and pelvic CTs showed bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right unchanged from previous.
Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis, extensive diffuse subcutaneous edema, and intra-abdominal pelvic ascites all with interval increasing severity.
Gallbladder nondistended, minimal straining around the kidneys, no hydronephrosis, no free air, several loops of dilated small bowel in the left upper quadrant with contrast and air-fluid levels concerning for partial SBO versus ileus and no definite bowel wall thickening or transition point.
No prior GI history.
Over the last 3 days, husband reports decrease in alertness and mental status.
History of febrile neutropenia in [**2-6**].
History of right upper extremity DVT.
History of anal fissure.
History of line infections.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with CVA, father with prostate cancer.
In general, patient had generalized anasarca, mumbling incoherently with no apparent distress.
Neck:  Unable to assess JVD, lymphadenopathy secondary to subcutaneous swelling.
No significant tenderness to palpation.
Extremities:  GVHD bilateral lower extremities, 4 plus lower extremity edema.
IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 48-year-old female with ALL day number 57 of allo-MUD BMT admitted to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring of gastrointestinal bleeding and acute renal failure.
Patient had an EGD performed in the ICU which showed esophagitis with friable mucosa likely secondary to chemotherapy.
It was suggested that patient most likely had a severe esophagitis from her chemotherapy drugs.
We were unable to use Carafate given her questionable ileus versus obstruction.
Given that patient was comfort measures only, no further hematocrits were checked or platelets.
Her Solu-Medrol was continued initially but then subsequently discontinued in anticipation for extubation.
Acute renal failure and generalized anasarca.
She had massive anasarca most likely from GVHD, renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, nephrotoxic medications.
Renal did consult initially but decided that they would not perform hemodialysis since it is unlikely to change the course of her medical condition and heparin would only cause further bleeding.
Family was aware that patient may have a fatal arrhythmia with such high potassium (the team had spoken to the husband extensively) and no further electrolytes were checked during her hospital course after her high potassium was 6.8.
Patient had a lower extremity rash also with GVHD of the bowel and liver.
Her steroids Ursodiol and Entocort were all discontinued secondary to poor prognosis and lack of access.
Acute mental status.
Patient had encephalopathy secondary to uremia and medications including narcotics and benzodiazapine.
Patient was maintained on nothing by mouth status given her severe mucositis and had numerous electrolyte abnormalities given uremia and anuric and that no dialysis was indicated per the renal team, number 14 code.
The family took many days to decide on CMO status since they were still not at terms with her grave prognosis.
No breath sounds or heart sounds could be auscultated, and patient's pupils were fixed and dilated.
