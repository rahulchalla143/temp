Her pancreatitis was likely secondary to hypertriglyceridemia (Trig 2736), but could have been secondary to Navelbine treatment.
When her hct was found to be higher, it suggested her fluid requirement was not being met so her fluids were increased to 500cc/hr.
Her pain was not well controlled on the PCA and she had continued N/V.
She was empirically started on flugyl and cipro for high fevers, but there was no CT evidence of necrotizing pacnreatitis.
Her N/V and pain improved and WBC trended down.
Repeat abd CT was done on [**12-30**] and showed interval developement of left sidedd pleural effusion and increase in degree of peripanreatic stranding and effusion with no evidence of necrosis.
