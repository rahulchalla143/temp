Admission Date:  [**2148-7-10**]       Discharge Date: [**2148-7-19**]   Service:  MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**])  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old female with widely metastatic lymphoma who was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room on [**2148-7-10**] for failure to thrive.
She was admitted to the oncology service initially where she was treated for urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
She subsequently developed new onset atrial fibrillation during the course of her stay on the oncology floor with RVR to the 180s.
An EKG showed rate-related ST depression in V4 and V5.
Her rate did not respond to these blocking agents, and she had exquisite blood pressure sensitivity with frequent hypotension whenever she was given one of these agents.
In the setting of this new atrial fibrillation she was worked up for PE with lower extremity Dopplers which were negative.
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70%, normal left atrial size, mild aortic stenosis, no pericardial effusion.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit on [**2148-7-12**] because of atrial fibrillation with a rate up to the 180s and a blood pressure drop to 80/palp with IV diltiazem.
Status post XRT for left iliac metastases.
Recurrence of left axillary lymphoma in [**2148**].
Known metastatic disease to spine, spleen, lungs, pleura, mesentery and abdominal lymph nodes.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Lumbar spinal stenosis.
Status post partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease.
Urinary retention.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General examination was alert but oriented x self only, recognizes and interacts with her husband, appears fatigued and in mild respiratory distress, easily tearful and agitated.
HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, oropharynx with dried blood clots, dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac:  Irregularly irregular rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs: Expiratory wheezing left greater than right, no crackles on anterior examination.
Chem-7 normal except for slightly elevated bicarbonate of 28.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema, innumerable pulmonary metastases, right lower lobe opacity and retrocardiac opacity.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rate of 130, normal axis, normal intervals, ST scooping in 1 and aVL, V5 and V6.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is an 82-year-old female with widely metastatic lymphoma with abysmal prognosis admitted to the intensive care unit for atrial fibrillation with RVR and difficulty controlling rate secondary to blood pressure sensitivity to nodal-blocking agents.
She was treated for a urinary tract infection with resistant E. coli which was sensitive to cefepime.
She has baseline hypoxia due to innumerable pulmonary metastases as well as a postobstructive right middle lobe collapse.
Bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were negative for deep venous thrombosis.
He often stated that she can still be saved and that "everyone beats cancer these days".
for pain and dyspnea.
