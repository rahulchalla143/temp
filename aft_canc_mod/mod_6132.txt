No blood on tissue.
Isolated episode, BM after that was normal.
Per Dr[**Name (NI) 1369**] note: Briefly, she was evaluated for abdominal pain in [**2195-5-15**].
She had prior outside CT scans on [**2195-4-8**] that demonstrated a 6 cm focus of decreased density within the liver and a 2.6 cm exophytic mass coming off the posterior cortex of the left kidney.
On [**4-17**] an outside MRI demonstrated a 7 x 4.5 x 7.5 cm mass thought to possibly represent an atypical area of focal nodular hyperplasia.
She was also noted to have a fatty liver.
The exophytic mass off the left kidney measured 2.8 x 1.8 x 2.7 cm concerning for renal cell carcinoma.
On [**6-5**] a MRI demonstrated a mass measuring 7.7 x 6.1 x 6.9 cm within segment 4 of the liver but extending into the anterior segments of segment 5.
There was an obstructed dilated bile duct raising the possibility of a peripheral cholangiocarcinoma.
There was also a second discrete progressively enhancing lesion within the peripheral aspect of segment 5 and it was thought to either represent metastases versus FNH.
There is also a subtle third lesion in the dome at the junctions of segment VII and VIII.
She also had a 2.2 x 2.4 x 2.6 cm exophytic lesion of the lower inner pole lesion of the left kidney.
There was a 1 cm left adrenal nodule not characterized at the time of this workup.
A biopsy of the lesion on [**6-18**] demonstrated metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma positive for CK7, cytokeratin cocktail, P504S/AMACR and carbonic anhydrase 9.
The tumor was compatible with renal artery  but failure to stain with PAX-2 was unusual and additional sites were considered.
Chest CT demonstrated no evidence of metastases.
CT colonoscopy demonstrated only a 6.5 mm polyp in the mid transverse colon.
She was felt to require a right hepatic trisegmentectomy and underwent right portal vein embolization and this had adequate hypertrophy of the left lateral segment.

There were no complications during the surgical procedures.
Neuro: Post-operatively the patient was delirious secondary to pain medication.
Cards: Patient was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 180s on the floor (POD 2).
Pulmonary: Her course on the floor was complicated by a pleural effusion on the R.  This was drained by thoracentesis on [**2195-10-8**] and was found to be concerning for exudative effusion secondary to infection and therefore the patient was started on Unasyn.
A CT chest and abdomen was obtained to rule out residual effusion.
GI: The patient began taking sips on POD1, was advanced to clears on POD2, and tolerating a regular diet by POD5 without any nausea or vomiting.
Musculoskeletal: Patient was difficult to mobilize following surgery secondary to pain and fatigue.
She worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate in the hallways with assistance however, it was believed that she would benefit from a short stay in a rehab facility but then was cleared by PT for home with home PT  Heme: CT of abdomen obtained on [**10-9**] to evaluate pleural effusion and possible bile leak returned an incisdental finding of "Status post left partial nephrectomy with thrombus in the left renal vein."
She will be followed by VNA for PT/INR with results to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 698**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 699**] RN for dosage changes initially.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Pain or Temp above 101F.
