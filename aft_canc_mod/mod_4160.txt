Admission Date:  [**2136-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-5-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ambisome  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible sigmoidoscopy Paracentesis Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: 28yo M, history of AML s/p recurrence after 3 allogenic transplants from unrelated donor, recently discharged from this service [**2136-9-20**], presents with 1 day history of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and dehydration.
[**Known firstname 16376**] went to bed and was having rib pain R>L of same character as he had during last admission, for which he has been taking MS Contin twice a day, and also c/o L shoulder pain, which he states he was having during an admission earlier this year.
Around 3am, [**Known firstname 16376**] started having stomach cramps and began to have loose stools.
ROS as above, also significant for fatigue due to deconditioning since last admission that has been slowly improving, pain in his ribs R>L and L shoulder, a new onset cough that started day prior to admission (some phlegm but no purulence).
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY - [**10-29**]: Diagnosed with AML (p/w fevers and myalgias, found to have Influenza A) WBC of 3 with 74% blasts.
Had residual disease after completion requiring HIDAC.
Transplant was complicated by prolonged neutropenia, fevers, high transfusion requirement secondary to ABO mismatched graft.
- [**2135-11-1**]: p/w progressive fatigue.
Found to have 54% blasts in his peripheral blood without evidence of tumor lysis or DIC.
- Chronic GVH of the liver, manifesting as liver function test abnormalities.
He had a Liver Bx in [**7-31**]: findings consistent with GVH, but also increased ferritin consistent with iron overload.
Recent MRI did not show any change in adenoma size -Splenic rupture [**2-27**] MVA in [**2125**], no splenectomy required -h/o VRE bacteremia in [**4-30**].
Family History: Patient had a cousin who passed away from leukemia at the age of 9.
His grandfather has DM2, and his father has multiple kidney stones.
He also notes that multiple relatives on his father's side have had MIs and CAD.
No cardiopulmonary distress.
No lesions noted in mouth.
No supraclavicular, cervical, or submandibular LAD Lungs CTAB no w/c/r/r noted Tachycardic but otherwise reg rhythm, S1 S2 clear, no murmurs Abdomen soft, NT, ND, BS+.
No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Skin--Scars noted in suprclav area from previous lines, folliculitis widespread on bilateral lower extrems, otherwise no rashes noted No edema noted in extremities.
The pre-existing right-sided pleural effusion has markedly decreased but is still visible in the region of the posterior and the lateral costophrenic sinus.
Overall improved lung ventilation, no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting an infectious episode.
EGD Biopsy [**10-19**]: Positive for adenovirus Blood culture [**10-29**]: Positive for adenovirus  [**2136-9-27**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Areas of mild thickening of the small bowel wall, most prominent in the right lower quadrant.
This finding is suggestive of enteritis, likely infectious or inflammatory in nature.
In the presence of bilateral effusions and ascites, third-spacing could also call diffuse bowel wall edema.
Mild bowel wall thickening/edema seen in the ascending colon.
Moderate amount of predominantly perihepatic ascites extending down to the pelvis.
Moderately sized bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged since previous MRI abdomen study of [**2136-9-6**].
Unchanged morphology of left upper lobe nodule and associated satellite lesion.
Minimally decreasing extent of bilateral pleural effusions, but slightly increasing extent of right basal peribronchial consolidation.
Minimal increase of bronchial wall thickening and associated air trapping.
No other changes.
No new pathology to explain transaminitis.
Specifically, no imaging findings to suggest solid organ infection or heptosplenic candidiasis.
Unchanged severe systemic hemosiderosis involving the liver, spleen, pancreas, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow.
Little change to bilateral pleural effusions, moderate intra-abdominal ascites, and diffuse third spacing.
Hyperenhancing small bowel mucosa suggests a component of acute small bowel graft versus host disease (also recently suggested by colonic biopsy), though a portion of the bowel wall edema is also likely secondary to third spacing.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 28-year-old gentleman with AML s/p 3 allo transplants with recurrence, most recently a DLI and SCR, who presents to [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and bilateral rib pain.
He eventually passed away on [**2136-11-9**] from graft versus host disease of liver and gut, adenoviremia and liver failure.
WEEK 1 Within 24hrs of admission, patient had signs of sepsis with spiking high fevers and hypotension.
Pt still complaining of [**Month/Day/Year 5283**], deep type pain, imaging with no clear etiology, only showing gross ascites and small bowel enteritis.
This week, GI was consulted and they performed a Flex Sig showing severe GVHD, no pseudomembranes were seen, and the Bx was negative for CMV.
He continued to have significant [**Month/Day/Year 5283**] pain and a [**Month/Day/Year 5283**] u/s was obtained which was non-diagnostic, only showing ascites and no etiology of the pain.
Abdominal pain continued to increase.
Ascites was negative for infection.
At this point, GVHD was considered to be most likely etiology of abdominal pain.
At the end of the 3rd week, [**Known firstname 16376**] went into spontaneous atrial fibrillation with RVR; his systolic BP's were in the 90s and heart rate in the 140s.
Stat bedside echo showed no cardiac tamponade, only small effusion.
Results showed cobblestoning consistent with severe GVHD; CMV cultures negative.
The EGD showed areas of erythema, a heaped up mucosa in the antrum of the stomach, but no gross bleeding vessels or varices.
[**Known firstname 16376**] did however go for a therapeutic paracentesis; about 4.5 liters of ascites were removed with profound symptomatic relief.
[**Known firstname 16376**] continued to have large amounts of stool (~4 liters per day); all stool cultures were negative.
Lasix was continued for volume overload.
Week 6: [**Known firstname 16376**] continued to have severe bloody diarrhea.
EGD biopsy came back positive for adenovirus; blood cultures subsequently returned positive for adenovirus as well.
A bone marrow biopsy this week was negative for leukemic infiltration.
No acute changes were seen on MRI.
Throughout the course of this week, [**Known firstname 16376**] started to became hypothermic (temperatures to 95) and hypotensive (pressures in the 80s).
Sepsis was suspected, and antimicrobials were broadened (with ID input).
The second dose of Cidofovir, which was supposed to be administered on [**11-8**], was held in light of acute renal failure.
On the night of [**11-8**], healthcare team was called to patient's room for seizure-like activity.
Small dose of ativan given and symptoms eventually resolved.
