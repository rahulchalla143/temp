She reports 6 weeks of left ear pain and left submandibular lymphadenopathy.
There was some improvement in ear pain with each course, but the lymphadenopathy progressed.
Since the operation she has had worsening pain in the back of her throat, dysphagia, and dyspnea.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] ER the night prior to transfer here with dyspnea which was treated and improved with decadron and ceftriaxone.
A CT of the neck was also obtained at [**Hospital3 **] which showed a 2.5 x 2.0 mass within the base of the tongue posteriorly on the right and numerous necrotic lymph nodes and opacified bilateral mastoid air cells.
In the ED, she was seen by ENT, who performed fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealing whitish masses in the nasopharynx and at the base of the tongue, and no supra-glottic edema.
Past Medical History: # Thyroid cancer s/p total tyroidectomy ([**2165**]).
# Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonitis (dx by VATS bx, followed by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]) treated with steroids in past and continues on azathioprine.
# Normal mammograms, no colonoscopy.
+DUI, no blackouts, no prior withdrawl.
No other cancers.
Extensive cardiac history.
Physical Exam: VS: 96.9F  HR 71  BP 113/58  RR 24  97% 10L shovel mask General: Middle aged woman in NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, telangectasias on cheeks, small tube in left ear, right TM intact, non erythematous, OP with diffuse soft tissue swelling but no erythema.
Lymph Nodes: left submandibular surgical incision, diffuse congruent hard, somewhat tender lymphadenopathy in submandibular region extending across mandible to parotid region.
Chest:  No stridor.
5-mm noncalficied left lower lobe nodule may be post-inflammatory or could presumably represent a solitary metastasis.
Small right pleural effusion with associated mild pleural thickening suggests exudate or subacute/chronic duration.
Calcified right pleural plaque may reflect previous asbestosis exposure, previous complex effusion, or pleurodesis.
[**7-7**] CT NECK: Large ill-defined mass at the base of the tongue extending into the right lingual tonsil and obliterating the right vallecula.
Multiple large enhancing and necrotic lymph nodes.
Findings are concerning for malignancy with metastatic spread, likely squamous cell in origin.
Fiberoptic laryngoscopy by ENT: White obstructing mass in nasopharynx, base of tongue/lateral pharyngeal walls with mass effect and narrowing, moderate secretions with pooling, no supra-glottic edema, mild R true vocal cord paresis, airway patent no masses, piriform sinuses clear .
7/26 L submandibular LN biopsy/ L nasal pharynx incisional biopsy: Involvement by B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, best classified as diffuse large B-cell type .
[**7-12**] CT ABD/PELVIS for staging: No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
A few scattered small subcentimeter retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are however noted.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
# Large B cell lymphoma: She presented with cervical lymphadenopathy, biopsy here revealed large B cell lymphoma.
She was transferred to the MICU for close observation and continuous O2 monitoring s/p trach placement.
No complications.
# Clostridium difficile: Her hospital course was complicated by infection with clostridium difficile.
# Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis: --Her LIP had been well-controlled with azathioprine until early [**Month (only) **] when she developed a new infiltrate in her R middle and lower lobes, per outpatient pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# Thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy: -- continued thyroid replacement.
# Elevated Glucose: Pt is without history of diabetes but did have elevated serum glucose on this admission.
Likely secondary to steroid use.
Other: Clostridium difficile Cellulitis around surgical incision (resolved) Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonitis Thyroid cancer, s/p thytoidectomy .
Stable without airway compromise s/p trach decannulation.
You were tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neck mass and were found to have Large B Cell Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Please be sure to complete your full course of antibiotics for C. difficile infection (4 days left).
Call your doctor or return to the emergency department if you have any trouble breathing, bleeding from your stoma, fevers, chills, cough productive of sputum or any other symptoms that concern you.
