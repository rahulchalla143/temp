He underwent an had a prolonged hospital course with mental status changes likely secondary to an intracranial extension of the post transplant lymphoma.
He had a right internal jugular dialysis catheter which was placed during his admission for which he was receiving his dialysis, and the patient was discharged on [**12-22**] to a antibiotics secondary to a superinfection of his intracranial lymphoma.
The patient returned on [**12-28**] with the chief complaint of dysfunctional right internal jugular Perm-A-Cath.
He was at his baseline functional status with a conversant mental status at the time of going to the operating room for this Perm-A-Cath.
The surgery went well with a good functional Perm-A-Cath being placed intraoperatively with no complications.
However, postoperatively he was found to be hypotensive and septic in appearance.
The patient continued to progress with his sepsis and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit intubated and placed on pressor support for his hypotension.
A source for his sepsis was not found despite pan culturing.
His Perm-A-Cath measurements clearly showed a hypermetabolic process consistent with sepsis.
The patient's blood pressure was very dependent on fluids, and he received several liters of fluids in addition to his pressor requirements to maintain his end-organ perfusion.
However, after one week of hospitalization he showed slow and steady improvement.
However, he had a sudden episode on the evening of [**1-5**] (the early morning of [**1-6**]) where he became hypertensive and then had a cardiac arrest.
