SInce her last chemotherapy at the end of [**Month (only) 956**], she was admitted with foot pain and swelling due to bilateral lower extremity DVT's and found to have multiple PE's on CTA for minimal pleuritic chest pain.
She was started on enoxaparin [**Hospital1 **] and reports both her foot pain and her left anterior pleuritic pain on deep inspiration have completely resolved.
Her CTA suggested infiltrates consistent with a pneumonia so the patient was also treated with an outpatient course of azithromicin.
On ROS she denies fevers, sweats, chills, productive cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, pleuritic pain, leg or calf pain or swelling.
She has no new neurologic symptoms including weakness, numbness, tingling, seizure, change in vision.
She does report a transient left anterior head pain with cough or standing rapidly from a sitting position.

[**2131-4-5**] CXR: suspected early pneumonic infiltrates in right infrahilar and lower lobe position are less prominent but some residuals exist.
Similarly, some hazy densities in the left lower lobe persist and appear to be stable when comparison is made with the previous study.
No new acute parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
There is no pneumothorax in the apical area.
The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.
The hematoma has components of acute, subacute and hyperacute blood products indicating continued hemorrhage.
Enhancement along the dura on post-gadolinium images likely represent dural inflammation from hematoma but associated tumor infiltration cannot be completely excluded.
Mass effect is seen on the left cerebral hemisphere with midline shift, but no subfalcine herniation or basal cisterns herniation seen.
No hydrocephalus.
Post-therapy changes are visualized in the left thalamus and basal ganglia region.
No enhancing brain masses identified.
No acute infarct is seen.
Acute/subacute moderate left hemispheric subdural hematoma with 9-mm rightward shift of midline structures, allowing for differences in technique, is stable since earlier study of [**2131-4-6**].
No new parenchymal bleed.
[**2131-4-10**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal hemicraniectomy and drainage of left frontal subdural hemorrhage with expected post-surgical changes and interval improvement of rightward shift of midline structures.
Residual left frontal subdural hematoma is present.

DDx includes complicated migraine, tumor progression, hemorrhagic CVA or stroke - reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] - will obtain MRI with contrast - neuro checks Q2H - hold enoxaparin until rule out intracranial bleed .

- [**Month (only) 116**] need to increase Dexamethasone taper since last taper triggered severe migraines .
# Recent DVT and PE: held lovenox 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] in light of new sdh / pt had IVCF placed.
# Recent Pneumonia: no symptoms of an infection after azithromicin course.
CXR does not show any new or progressive infiltrates.
Consider more detailed imaging if she spikes or develops respiratory symptoms .
# Anemia: Chemo-induced.
# Hyperglycemia: As above.
# Chronic constipation: Continue bowel regimen.
Metabolic alkalosis secondary to administered bicarb.
# DVT prophylaxis: Ambulation./ Boots / IVCF .

Headache and nausea resolved the next afternoon, but she was noted to have new RUE dysmetria.
Surgery was without complication and she tolerated it well.
Post operative head CT revealed evacuated SDH with small residual acute blood.
