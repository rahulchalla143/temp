She developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone.
She was transfused with packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
As she continued to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on amiodarone, coumadin was started for anticoagulation.
A bedside exam was suggestive of aspiration with this liquids thus a pureed diet with nectar thick liquids was started.
The swallow service returned to evaluate Ms. [**Known lastname 54633**] for possible advancement of her diet however noted that she has developed a new globus sensation in her throat with all consistency foods.
A video swallow was performed which showed aspiration during and after swallowing of nectar thickened liquids.
Ineffective cough reflex, mild residue within the oral cavity and valleculae.
The ENT service also evaluated her and noted a paresis of her right vocal chord.
She was able to tolerate purees and honey thickened liquids without issue.
As Ms. [**Known lastname 54633**] continued to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the Electrophysiology service was consulted.
Thyroid studies were obtained which showed mild hypothyroidism and her beta blockade was advanced.
Ms. [**Known lastname 54633**] was noted to have an elevated creatinine and a renal consult was obtained.
A renal ultrasound was performed which showed a small right renal cyst and redemonstration of large heterogeneous left renal mass, likely representing a renal cell carcinoma.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions were also noted.
On [**2101-11-30**], a left thoracentesis was performed for a left pleural effusion draining 600cc of serous fluid.
She was also noted to be in a sinus bradycardia with rates in the 50s.
