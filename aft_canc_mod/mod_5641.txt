Admission Date:  [**2161-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-3-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-7-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L craniotomy for evacuation of L SDH   History of Present Illness: 66 year old female with HTN, DLP, atrial fibrillation/flutter on coumadin, coronary artery disease s/p DES to LAD [**2153**], h/o CVA in [**2140**] with mild aphasia, rheumatic mitral stenosis s/p vavuloplasty, history of colon cancer s/p resection, anxiety who initially presented on [**2-25**] with a severe headache and dizziness, found to have a large left subdural hemorrhage.
The patient had stable repeat head CT's on [**2-26**] and [**2-27**], but developed episodes of somnolence and verbal unresponsiveness followed by behavioral outbursts with violence.
There was concern for speech difficulties due to edema at the operative site.
An EEG showed evidence of non-convulsive seizures, and she was loaded with Levetiracetam 1 gm and continued on 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
The last noted seizure on EEG was [**2-28**], and subsequent EEG on [**3-2**] showed evidence of encephalopathy and discharges but no further seizures.
LENI's on [**3-2**] were negative, and Neurology suggested considering an MRI head to r/o stroke, but the Neurosurgical team felt that the patient's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium was not consistent with a stroke and an MRI was not ordered.
The patient had been having low grade fevers of 100-100.1 on [**3-3**] and [**3-4**], but spiked to 102 on [**3-5**].
The patient continued to have fevers and developed a leukocytosis of 12.6 on [**3-7**].
While on the neurosurgical service, there was a concern for aspiration and an NGT was placed on [**3-3**].
However, the patient's nurse felt that the patient had a potential aspiration event and she was placed back on NPO and NGT was re-placed.
Additionally, the patient was also noted to have tachycardia secondary to her known afib/flutter/a-tach.
She was loaded with Amiodarone post-op, but this was subsequently discontinued due to bradycardia, and she has been in atrial fibrillation/flutter since.
She had persistent episodes of tachycardia and EP was consulted on [**3-3**].
She was given Lasix 20 mg IV on [**3-2**] for pulmonary edema with good urine output.
Atrial fibrillation.

Acute subdural hematoma along left frontal and temporal convexities and along the falx causing mass effect and shift of midline structures to the right.
Mild narrowing (25%) of the origin of the right internal carotid artery.
Significant decrease in subdural hematoma, mass effect, and midline shift.
Some residual subdural hematoma remains overlying the left frontal and temporal convexities and falx.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
No evidence of infarction.
[**2161-2-27**] CT head: Stable, no new blood.
[**2161-3-1**] CT head: Mild decrease in the subdural hemorrhage in the left middle cranial fossa and in the left inferior frontal region.
[**2161-3-2**] CT head: No acute intracranial changes.
Expected evolution of subdural hematoma overlying left frontal and temporal convexities and falx.
No new hemorrhage or infarction.
[**2161-3-2**] Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
However, there is a substantial increase in severity of the pulmonary edema, and mild bilateral pleural effusions are now visible.
There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
There are scattered bilateral simple renal cysts, measuring up to 2.0 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm on the right and 4.7 x 3.9 x 5.0 cm on the left, increased in size compared to prior CT from [**2155-5-8**].
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal calculi, or a perinephric collection.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
Small left pleural effusion.
LLE Ultrasound [**3-9**]:  No evidence of DVT.
CT Head [**3-9**]:  Stable appearance of left subdural hematoma and mild effacement of left frontal sulci.
No new hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
Video Swallow [**3-10**]: Slight penetration but no gross aspiration was observed.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66 year old female with HTN, DLP, atrial fibrillation/flutter on coumadin, coronary artery disease s/p DES to LAD [**2153**], h/o CVA in [**2140**] with mild aphasia, rheumatic mitral stenosis s/p vavuloplasty, history of colon cancer s/p resection, anxiety who initially presented on [**2-25**] with a severe headache and dizziness, found to have a large left subdural hemorrhage, s/p emergent left craniotomy.
Now transferred to medicine with tachycardia in the setting of known afib/flutter/a-tach.
Also with fever and white count secondary to enterococcus UTI.
# Subdural Hemorrhage:  The patient presented with a headache and dizziness for one day in the setting of anticoagulation on Coumadin.
Head CT in the ED showed a left subdural hemorrhage.
She was transfused 2 units PRBC for a post-op hematocrit of 21 in the setting of her cardiac history.
Speech difficulties were attributed to expected postoperative edema but an EEG was ordered.
On POD3 ([**2-28**]), EEG showed frequent seziure activity in the left spreading to the right, and Dilantin was increased, Keppra load was given, and Keppra and Ativan were started.
On [**3-4**], the Epilepsy team reviewed her EEGs which were negative for seizure activity.
She was continued on Keppra and Dilantin, and has been having daily Dilantin levels which were corrected for her low albumin.
She is being discharged on Keppra and Dilantin with follow-up with Neurology and Neurosurgery.
# Fever/UTI: The patient began having low grade fevers to 100.1 while in SICU on [**3-3**].
Repeat urine analysis on [**3-6**] had a negative dipstick but as not sent for microscopic exam.
Her fevers are most likely due to her enterococcus UTI, and her fever curve and white count have been down-trending on Ampicillin.
However, given she was still having low grade fevers of 100.6 this morning with a white count of 12, a renal ultrasound was obtained to rule out perinephric abscess or renal calculi causing hydronephrosis, which was negative.
Also, given mild LLE fullness compared to the RLE in the setting of low grade fevers, LLE US was obtained to rule out DVT, which was negative.
The patient's fevers resolved and she has been afebrile without a white count or signs and symptoms of an infection.
# Thrombocytosis:  The patient has had a progressively increasing platelet count, and has thrombocytosis today, [**3-12**], with platelets of 692.
Although thrombocytosis in the setting of her urinary tract infection and post-operative state is expected, the reason for the trend of her increasing platelets is unclear.
There is no evidence of acute infection or inflammation, as the patient's fevers and leukocytosis have resolved.
There is also no evidence of active bleeding.
The patient may be having thrombocytosis secondary to medications (new medications include Ampicillin).
It is also possible the patient is having rebound thrombocytosis following her episode of thrombocytopenia at the time of her craniotomy for the subdural hemorrhage.
# Delirium:  The patient was noted to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium, likely secondary to her UTI infection.
She also had post-operative seizures and was started on Keppra and Dilantin with Neurology following (see above under Subdral Hemorrhage).
It was initially felt that her delirium may have been secondary to non-convulsive seizures, but EEG showed no evidence of continued seizures and she was discovered to have an Enterococcus UTI.
Her mental status improved significantly since initiation of antibiotics for her UTI and her delirium cleared.
Also, the patient had a large subdural and is s/p left craniotomy, so may take some time to return completely back to baseline.
# Atrial flutter: Known history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and atrial tachycardia, which the patient was noted to have in-house.
She had episodes of tachycardia requiring additional doses of Metoprolol, and her standing dose was progressively increased with improved heart rate control.
Of note, the patient has intermittent episodes of variable block with atrial flutter which is asymptomatic and non-sustained.
This is not bradycardia, but atrial flutter with occasional variable conduction.
Likewise, she also has brief, intermittent episodes of 2:1 conduction where she becomes transiently tachycardic without symptoms, and which sponatenaously resolves without intervention.
She will have outpatient follow-up with her cardiologist within several days of discharge, who will follow up with management of her chronic atrial flutter.
However, in the absence of symptoms of hemodynamic instability or symptoms, this is not an acute or active medical issue at this time.
The patient remains asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable during these episodes, and no intervention is required at this time.
The patient's Coumadin dose was increased from 3 mg daily to 5 mg daily on [**3-9**] for persistent sub-therapeutic INR's.
# ?Aspiration:  Post operatively, the patient had been on tube feeds througn an NG tube.
She subsequently passed her speech and swallow evaluation while on the Neurosurgical service, but when she was started on a PO diet, nursing had concerns regarding aspiration given coughing episodes with drinking water.
The patient had also pulled out her NGT, but failed her repeat video swallow study, which showed slight penetration with no aspiration but significant abnormalities with swallow putting her at risk for aspiration.
Attempts to place a Dobhoff for nutrition failed, as the patient had a broken nose in the past.
She subsequently was felt to have significantly improved swallow with pills and her delirium had resolved, so speech and swallow was reconsulted for re-evaluation on [**3-12**].
#Hypertension:  On home Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide, as well as increased dose of Metoprolol as detailed above for tachycardia with blood pressures within goal.
#Anxiety Disorder:  Patient on Gabapentin as an outpatient, presumably for anxiety vs chronic pain.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] TCU - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Subdural Hemorrhage Urinary Tract Infection Post-operative seizures   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for headaches and dizzines, and you were found to have bleeding around your brain called a sub-dural hemorrhage.
You were noted to have seizures following your surgery, which sometimes occurs after bleeding in the brain, and you were started on two medications to prevent further seizures.
While in the hospital, you were found to be confused with a fever, and you were found to have a urinary tract infection.
Because of the bleeding around your brain and the surgery to drain the blood, your swallowing ability is abnormal.
You are therefore at risk of aspiration, which occurs when food that you swallow goes into your lungs instead of your stomach.
Please take care to remain well hydrated with plenty of thickened fluid intake during this time period.
In the setting of the bleeding around your brain, your Coumadin, which you take for your atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, was held.
You continued to have known atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, with very transient, brief episodes of slow and fast heart rhythms that lasted only seconds.
Your blood pressure remained stable and you did not have any symptoms during these episodes.
The following changes have been made to your home medications: - Ampicillin was STARTED, to be taken until [**2161-3-21**] - Keppra was STARTED - Dilantin was STARTED; please adjust dose as instructed based on your weekly dilantin and albumin levels - Oxycodone was STARTED, to be used as needed for post-operative pain - Docusate and Miralax were STARTED to help regulate bowel movements - Metoprolol was INCREASED to 100 mg TID until follow up with your cardiologist - Coumadin was INCREASED; please adjust as directed based on your INR - Lovenox was STARTED, to be used until your INR is above 2.4 - Insulin sliding scale was STARTED, to be used at rehab; please discuss with your primary care physician whether you should continue to be on insulin when discharged from rehab - Omeprazole was SWITCHED to Ranitidine until you are able to swallow pills whole without needing them crushed - Gabapentin was stopped initially in the hospital but RESTARTED on discharge - Lisinopril was STOPPED; please follow up with your primary care physician prior to [**Name9 (PRE) 18290**] this medication For your post-surgical care, please following the instructions below: ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
Because you are taking Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
