Patient with 2 month h/o hoarseness and dysphagia and neck CT showing node compressing R recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Later found to have non small cell lung CA by bx.
Abdominal and head CT were negative for metastatic dz.
Required trach ([**2168-7-21**])and PEG ([**2168-7-15**])for vocal cord paralysis secondary to b/l vocal cord paralysis and inability to protect airway.
Trach also placed for dyspnea and possible glotic component.
[**2168-8-1**] patient found to have hemoptysis by tracheostomy tube, hypoxemia--> 82% and hypotension.
She was started on levoquin on [**2168-8-1**] for questionable pneumonia and kept on levoquin for group b strep bacteremia.
Ruled in for MI by enzymes--presumed demand ischemia in absence of CK elevation or ST elevations.
Bronchoscopy showed no source of bleeding and presumed bleeding from aggressive suctioning.
On the night of [**2168-8-12**] patient fell and had a negative head CT (without contrast) with no events noted on telemetry.
On [**2168-8-13**] patient became more lethargic and nonverbal.
Stat repeat head CT was negative for hemorrhage.
At 5 pm patient with increasing O2 requirements.
O2 sats were 85-90% on 35-40% via trach collar and increasing respiratory distress was noted throughout the night; she was using accessory muscles for breathing.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for impeding respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: COPD colon CA (XRT and chemo) MV replacement A fib CAD s/p CABG HTN Hyperlipidemia arthritis Osteoporosis  Social History: Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] lives with her husband.
Right apical spiculated nodule and mediastinal and right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
The differential diagnosis includes nonsmall cell cancer with extensive mediastinal involvement or small cell lung cancer.
The appearance of the mediastinal nodal mass with confluent features and encasement of vessels suggests the possibility of lymphoma.
Given that there is biapical scarring, the spiculated lesion in the right apex could possibly relate to nodular scarring.
Finally, metastatic disease should be considered from unknown primary.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema.
Cardiomegaly with notable enlargement of the right and left atria.
Tumor cells stain for CK-7 and TTF-1, consistent with a lung origin.
Correlation with physical exam and patient status is recommended to exclude a pathological bowel perforation.
Of note, no oral contrast material or ascites is noted in the abdomen.
New right pleural effusion and aspiration-like changes at the left base since the prior chest CT. 3.
Marked distention of the urinary bladder to a calculated volume of 770 cc.
Does this patient have clinical signs of urinary retention?
Thickened adrenal glands without discrete mass.
Marked biatrial enlargement.
MRI head: No convincing evidence for intracranial metastatic disease.
Bone scan:  1) No evidence of metastases.
2) Distended bladder with pooling of activity within the left renal collecting system  Brief Hospital Course: 1.)
Non-small cell lung cancer--CT chest showed a 0.9cm spiculated nodule in the R apex as well as extensive mediastinal LAD.
A swallow study at this time found Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] to be at great risk for aspiration of liquids, so she was kept on a soft solid diet with no liquids.
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was kept NPO, a PEG was placed that was advanced to a GJ tube because of poor GI motility and possible proximal obstruction.
Radation therapy was initiated in the hopes of shrinking the mediastinal masses and relieving the vc paralysis.
Given her poor medical state, she was felt to not be a candidate for chemotherapy.
Because monitoring had been discontinued as part of the code status, it was difficult to ascertain the immediate cause of death secondary to her end-stage lung cancer.
Mental Status Change   Pt with fall on [**8-12**] and head CT at that time was negative for hemorrhage.
Mental status changes thought secondary to hypercarbia, but patient has continued to be withdrawn after hypercarbia corrected.
Metastasis unlikely given sudden time course of events.
With persistant decreased mental status, ritalin increased to 10mg qd and celexa d/c'd for concern of mental status changes from serotonin syndrome.
However, the evening prior to the procedure, she was scoped and found to have bilateral VC involvement.
Pt was to get Passy Muir Valve on [**7-25**] but was contraindicated because pt has B/L vocal cord paralysis.
COPD/Pleural effusion/Respiratory failure--Mrs[**Last Name (STitle) **] COPD flared during the course of her hospitalization.
Further exacerbating Mrs[**Last Name (STitle) **] pulmonary status was a R pleural effusion that developed over the week of [**7-15**] to [**7-22**].
She had a thoracentesis to remove 1L of fluid on [**7-23**].
The effusion was most likely the result of the lung CA and there was no evidence of PNA or empyema.
She began to improve from a respiratory standpoint and ventilatory weaning by sprint/rest method was initiated.
After a 48 hour period of rest, the patient was once again tried for a short period on the trach mask, but acutely became uncomfortable, diaphoretic, and hypercapneic.
The patient was also started on metoclopramide for improved gastric motility but this was d/c'd after she has liquid c/diff (-) stools.
)Hemoptysis -- During course of stay, pt's INR became supertherapeutic to 3.8.
After deep suctioning, pt developed hemoptysis from her trach tube.
)Hypotension -- Concurrent with hemoptysis and ICU transfer, pt became hypotensive and was found to have gram + cocci on blood culture, and pt was put on vanco and levofloxacin.
)Myocardial ischemia -- Pt had some ST depression while in unit, felt to be due to tachycardia causing a demand ischemia.
)Anemia -- Secondary to chronic disease, without obvious source of blood loss.
)Code -- Code discussion was complicated at first by the patient's withdrawn mental status and then by the patient's inability to vocalize due to her bilateral vocal fold paralysis.
It was initially interpreted that the patient desired comfort measures only except with ventilatory support, nebulizers, antiemetics, and morphine for pain control.
Code status was adjusted to add the patient's tube feeds, warfarin, and digoxin after the patient made it clear that she understood these to be part of comfort-oriented care.
Because monitoring had been discontinued as part of the code status, it was difficult to ascertain the immediate cause of death secondary to her end-stage lung cancer.
