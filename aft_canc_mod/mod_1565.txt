CXR demonstrated a right para mediastinal mass which measured 4.7 x 3.9 cm in size (unchanged from previous) and vague nodular densities at lung bases with some pulmonary edema but no focal infiltrates.
He was given cefepime and vancomycin for presumed febrile neutropenia as well as dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 as he is chronically on prednisone.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: Mr. [**Known lastname 21781**] was initially found to have multiple polyps on routine colonoscopy in [**2182-11-28**].
A repeat colonoscopy on [**2183-9-2**] with bx showed high grade dysplasia and CIS.
Follow up PET scan demonstrated abnormal FDG activity in a lung nodule and in the transverse colon.
On [**2184-7-2**] a biopsy of the right upper lobe nodule yielded an undifferentiated carcinoma which was positive for CK 7, negative for CK 20 and TTF-1 and LCA.
After much discussion, a medical regimen consisting of Nevelbine wsa initiated as his significant COPD and other co-morbidities precluded a surgical approach.

Vague nodular densities are again seen at the right lung base superimposed over the pericardial fat pad, and also at the left lung base along the diaphragmatic border.
There are slightly increased interstitial markings asymmetrically involving the right hemithorax relative to the left.
No definite pleural effusions, although extreme right costophrenic angle has been coned off of this image.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Focal pleural thickening/rib fractures again seen at the lateral mid thoracic ribs on the right.

for aflutter, LAD, RSR' in V1-V4, no ST changes, poor R wave progression   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is an 80 year old gentleman with lung cancer metastatic to colon undergoing Navelbine chemotherapy, severe COPD on home oxygen undergoing taper who was admitted with sepsis to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and found to be neutropenic with Klebsiella bacteremia.
In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt had transient pressor requirement along with IVF support for hypotension which resolved by HD 2.
Blood cultures from admission grew 2 out 4 bottles with final culture being Klebsiella sensitive to cefepime, resistant to levofloxacin and gentamcin.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course also remarkable for intermittent atrial flutter seen on telemetry and supratherapeutic INR for which coumadin was held.
On transfer to the general medical [**Hospital1 **] ([**2183-12-19**]), the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with no pressor or IVF requirement.
The pt also was noted to become significantly dysthymic, becoming tearful at times and with evidence of hallucinatory behavior and therefore a psychiatry consult was called.
By discharge the patient had returned to his baseline respiratory status and had no signs of infection including fever, chills, malaise or gastrointestinal symptoms.
In summary, this is an 80 year old gentleman with metastatic lung cancer on chemotherapy, severe COPD, type II diabetes, DVT, and depression who was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis, COPD exacerbation, and found to have Klebsiella bacteremia.
He was treated with IV cefepime for his infection and high dose steroids for his COPD.
Sepsis was likely related to immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy.
He is to continue 5 more days of antibiotics for his infection and a prednisone taper for his COPD exacerbation.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further coordination of his chemotherapy for his metastatic lung cancer.
Sepsis/hypotension: Secondary to Klebsiella infection/bacteremia.
COPD: appears back at baseline, exacerbation likely secondary to infection.
Metastatic lung cancer, on Navelbine treatment, will have to defer further cycles for now, will coordinate with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to determine timing of further treatment.
Appears that he had this as far back as [**2184-5-28**] and plain films at that time were negative for any abnormality including SBO, free air or ascites.
Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Cr appears back at baseline  10.
Depression: Have changed psychatric regimen, had some signs of depression and and hallucinations this admission, resolved when we restarted pt on trazodone and venlafaxine.
Anemia: Known chronic anemia, had acute [**Month (only) **].

Please return to hospital if lower extremity edema starts to worsen.
Please have pt follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to coordinate further treatment of metastatic lung cancer.
Please have patient follow up with mental health therapist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26687**] of Mass Mental [**Telephone/Fax (1) 32123**].
