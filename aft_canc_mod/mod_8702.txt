The patient states that she has had difficulty breathing for the past few months but her dyspnea on exertion has increased.
She notes an intermittant cough for the past 2 weeks with occasional sputum production which is unchanged.
She denies any fever, chills, sick contacts, or recent travel.
Labs were drawn in clinic which revealed [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr from baseline of around 1.2 to 1.8), elevated LDH, and hyperbilirubinemia.
Also, pt endorsed worsening SOB with exertion.
Last admission, pt had an extensive workup for her systemic complaints as pt endorsed that she felt similar to her initial Dx with Hogkins disease.
Of note, she was initially admitted to the MICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and fever in the PACU status post rigid bronchoscopy for mediastinal LN biopsy She had previously been evaluated at [**Hospital1 2177**] for these complaints prior to transferring her care to [**Hospital1 18**].
Her course last admission was also complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and anasarca, abnormal LFTs, and pancytopenia.
Ultimately, patient was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged EBV viremia, possibly resulting in her abnormal LFTs, nephrotic syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.

LE edema largely resolved.
Stable mild wall thickening in a non-distended gallbladder is a non-specific finding.
No cholelithiasis or evidence of cholecystitis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Decreased right pleural effusion.
15 mm right lower lobe nodular opacity which is new or increased since [**2160-7-27**] in an area previously obscured by right pleural effusion; given size, follow-up options include repeat chest CT within three months or PET-CT.
Given adjacent right hilar opacity, this could represent infection, in which case follow-up after treatment is recommended.
Stable underlying diffuse interstitial pulmonary changes.
[**2160-12-2**] CT CHEST IMPRESSION:  As compared to the previous examination from [**2160-11-10**], there is evidence of diffuse fibrotic lung parenchymal pattern with bronchiectasis and spectral distortion as main morphological components.
In addition, mild fluid overload could highlight the appearance of the interstitial structures.
The right pleural effusion is unchanged.
Minimal newly appeared left pleural effusion.
Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy, unchanged coronary calcifications and slight valvular calcifications.
Bilateral basal linear atelectases are noted and the previously described pleural effusion is still present, blunting the right-sided lateral pleural sinus and extending along the right lateral chest wall similar as before.
There is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates as can be identified on this portable chest examination.
[**2160-11-17**] CHEST X-RAY: Compared to radiograph of [**2160-11-14**], no significant interval change.
Persistent interstitial opacities and pulmonary edema.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Low lung volumes.
[**2160-11-15**] KUB Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.
[**2160-11-10**] CT Chest, Abdomen & Pelvis IMPRESSION: There is no jejunal mass identified.
There is however small bowel and mesenteric lymphadenopathy as described above.
There is a smaller soft tissue mass in the small bowel mesentery adherent to a bowel loop, this would likely be of higher yield to biopsy.
There is also soft tissue within the region of the base of the cecum suggesting possible lymphomatous involvement.
Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, reflecting chronic interstitial lung disease with an NSIP-type pattern.
There are discrete nodules in the left lower lobe which may represent neoplastic involvement.
Multiple splenic hypodensities suspicious for lymphomatous involvement.
Hypoperfused kidneys suggesting component of chronic renal failure.
Interval worsening of the right-sided pleural effusion (2;8) compared to the prior CT from [**2160-10-13**].
Two new mesenteric soft tissue masses adjacent to the jejunum as described in detail above.
This could be secondary to lymphoma invading the fat in an infiltrative pattern; since there does seem to be some fat intermingled, extramedullary hematopoiesis could considered in the appropriate setting although the location is somewhat unusual and sequelae of an inflammatory process could also be considered.
Newly apparent thickening at the base of the cecum, not present on the prior study; this may be associated with debris but could be secondary to an inflammatory process such as CMV colitis or even potentially a further site of potential lymphoma.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial to very small pericardial effusion located primarily adjacent to the atria, without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Normal [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular global systolic function with high cardiac index.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Interval improvement in bilateral airspace process, although there is a residual reticular nodule initial abnormality.
These findings are therefore consistent with resolving pulmonary edema, but the possibility of underlying interstitial disease should also be considered.
Interval decrease in size of bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
No large pneumothorax is seen although the positioning of the patient is not indicated and the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax would be diminished if acquired using supine technique.
[**2160-10-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Extensive diffuse lung opacities have markedly worsened.
Bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to evaluate, moderate on the right and small-to-moderate on the left.
[**2160-10-24**] ECG Sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No evidence of toxic megacolon.
The right internal jugular line  tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
Widespread parenchymal  consolidations appear to be minimally improved since the prior study.
The right pleural effusion has slightly increased compared as to the previous image this morning.
Bilateral parenchymal opacities, left more than right, persist.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
No significant valvular abnormality.
Mild elevation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
[**2160-10-21**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Right lower lobe opacity has improved consistent with decreased pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
There has been mild interval increase in lung opacities in the left lung.
These are a combination of patient's known fibrosis and superimposed infection.
Right upper lobe opacities have improved consistent with resolving atelectasis.
Interstitial opacities in the right upper lobe are minimally increased consistent with increasing  mild interstitial edema.
Patient has known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Low lung volumes persist.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2160-10-20**] SPINAL FLUID Lumbar puncture:  ATYPICAL.
[**2160-10-17**] US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE OR (prelim) Two son[**Name (NI) 493**] grayscale still images were obtained during real-time evaluation of underlying perihepatic ascites for possible paracentesis prior to liver biopsy.
It was noted at that time that an appropriate window of minimal fluid was noted just along the anterior right hepatic lobe, appropriate for biopsy.
DIAGNOSIS: ATYPICAL LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER IN THE SETTING OF PERSISTENT [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] VIRUS VIREMIA IN A BACKGROUND OF IMMUNODEFICIENCY, SEE NOTE.
Note: Sections are of liver core biopsies with dense portal and pericentral mononuclear cell infiltrates.
The infiltrate consists of an admixture of small mature appearing lymphocytes and, in lesser number, larger atypical cells with pale eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm, irregular nuclear outlines, vesicular chromatin, and variably prominent nucleoli.
Though atypical none of the large cells resemble [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells or variants.
Admixed, there also are scattered histiocytic, eosinophils and plasma cells, including those with [**Last Name (un) 13683**] bodies.
Prominent apoptotic debris is seen, but mitoses are only rarely seen and necrosis is absent.
The background liver exhibits mixed micro and macrovesicular steatosis, ballooning degeneration, apoptotic hepatocytes, and centrilobular congestion.
By immunohistochemistry, the lymphoid infiltrate is diffusely positive with CD45 (LCA).
The majority of T cells are CD4 positive helper T cells, with only a minority being CD8 positive.
CD138 decorates hepatocytes' membrane (also stain scatter plasma cells in the lymphoid infiltrate), while BCL1 and BCL6 stains hepatocytes' nuclei.
CD10 highlights bile canaliculi and stromal elements within the lymphoid infiltrates.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Last Name (un) **] RNA in situ hybridization study shows rare scattered positive nuclei within the lymphoid aggregates.
Overall, the morphological and immunophenotypic findings are those of an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder, similar to those seen in previous biopsies.
As in previous biopsies the findings in the current biopsy are felt to represent an EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorder in the setting of persistent EBV viremia and in the background of an IgA deficiency/CVID phenotype.
[**2160-10-16**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Worsening bibasilar consolidations consistent with effusion and atelectasis  Also stable bilateral upper lobe pulmonary opacities consistent with edema.
[**2160-10-13**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Slight worsening of pulmonary edema compared to the prior radiograph from 3 days previous.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right, unchanged from the prior examination, and small on the left, increase in size from most recent CT chest examination of [**2160-10-9**].
On a background of fibrosis, there is increased septal thickening which is worse compared to the prior exam and likely represents mild pulmonary edema.
Generalized anasarca and simple-appearing ascites.
Mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon of unclear etiology, likely due to third spacing in the setting of ascites.
Diffuse non-specific T wave flattening.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
[**2160-10-12**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Heterogenous signal within the liver parenchyma on diffusion weighted imaging.
Assessment is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast however the appearances raise the possibilty of an infiltrative process or infection.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The spleen is normal in size but demonstrates heterogenous signal consistent with previous Hodgkins disease.
Generalized anasarca with intra-abdominal ascites and bilateral small pleural effusions.
[**2160-10-10**] PLEURAL FLUID:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2160-10-9**] 9:15 PM CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Newly enlarged moderate non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion.
Fibrotic bibasilar lung disease with traction bronchiectasis unchanged.
No lobar consolidation.
Borderline echogenic liver suggestive of fatty infiltration.
More severe forms of liver disease including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

# Hypoxemia / respiratory distress: A CT of the chest demonstrated large pleural effusion at the time of admission.
The pleural fluid was mostly blood and cytology did not support a diagnosis of malignancy.
While further infectious vs malignant work-up was in progress patient was transferred from the BMT floor to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute hypoxemic respiratory distress and altered mental status.
Her acute decompensation was thought to be due to reaccumulation of known R pleural effusion since repeat CT showed no change in effusion size compared to the [**10-9**] study which was done prior to drainage of 1L pleural fluid via thoracentesis.
After discussion with IP, repeat thoracentesis was held because patient's respiratory status had improved and she was at risk of bleeding from her coagulopathy.
Sputum GS this admission showed GPC and GP rods and culture consistent with commensal respiratory flora.
Multifactorial [**2-28**] pulmonary edema on a baseline of severe restrictive chronic lung disease (fibrosis from bleomycin), in addition to lingular PNA.
She was successfully extubated on [**10-27**], but 3 days later, on [**10-30**], she became hypoxic in the 80s with increased O2 requirement and was re-intubated.
Bronchoscopy was performed, which showed very small amount of secretions and no significant amount of blood.
She was restarted on vanc and [**Last Name (un) 2830**], but abx were discontinued after 48 hours of blood cultures with no growth.
Vancomycin and cefepime were started for presumed PNA, although CXR and CT chest showed no evidence of new PNA.
She continued to have an intermittent O2 requirement during her hospitalization.
Her persistent hypoxemia is due to persistent fluid overload, with interstitial infiltrates and persistent large pleural effusion.
She has obstructive lung disease, interstitial fibrosis from bleomycin toxicity, bronchiectasis, and recurrent large right-sided pleural effusion.
Likely colonized given that patient is doing well clinically making our suspicion for yeast pneumonia and/or dissiminated disease less likely.
# Encephalopathy: At admission the patient was ambulating and communicating verbally.
While an infectious vs malignant work up was underway she developed acutely altered mental status in the setting of her hypoxemic respiratory distress.
CT head on [**10-12**] showed no acute intracranial process.
No uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities.
Differential diangosis includes EBV related meningoencephalitis or toxic/metabolic cause from underlying infection.
She was also inappropriately answering questions with fluctuating mental status.
There was also question of possible severe depression given her prolonged hospital course and deterioration.
Psych was also consulted for evaluation.
Per psych, she was in a hypokinetic delirium and withdrawn.
It was determined that she did not have capacity for decision making and medical decisions were deferred to [**Doctor First Name **].
Started sertraline [**11-13**], stopped [**11-28**] as her mental status improved.
# Acute renal failure/FSGS: Patient had anasarca likely related to her nephrotic syndrome.
She also had progressively worsening renal function likely from volume depletion.
This was attributed to FSGS and renal hypoperfusion from sepsis and poor oncotic pressure.
In consultation with renal, heme onc and ID, she was started in IV methylprednisolone (d1 = [**10-23**]) for nephrotic syndrome and liver inflammation.
CVVH was initiated primarily for volume overload.
She was sent home with a slow steroid taper, and will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in nephrology clinic, who will manage her continued taper.
CMV and EBV became negative/undetectable with treatment.
# Abdominal ileus: Abdominal x-ray [**11-2**] showed distended bowel loops.
Likely ileus as no evidence of obstruction.
Speech and swallow evaluated and felt it was okay to start pureed food and nectar thick liquids.
Her stool output and pain improved.
# Atypical Combined Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID): Patient has EBV viremia and h/o lymphoma which are both associated with HLH/MAS in adults, so this diagnosis was considered initially, but heme onc later revised the putative diagosis to atypical CVID.
Her elevated ferritin (7091, previously >10,000 in [**8-7**]), transaminitis with possible hepatic infiltrate on abdominal MRI, cytopenia in two cell lines and altered mental status are also concerning for this diagnosis.
Bone marrow bx from [**8-9**] showed increased macrophages with ingestion of cells and debris, as well as an increased cytotoxic T cell infiltrate with concurrent markedly elevated ferritin level.
# Left vocal cord hypokinesis / paralysis - She had a persistent hoarse voice which was originally thought to be related to intubation.
Due to concern for vocal cord paralysis, otolaryngology was consulted, and she underwent laryngoscopy.
She was found to have left vocal cord hypokinesia / paralysis.
She underwent a repeat speech & swallow evaluation, which revealed left vocal cord hypokinesis.
Likely secondary to decreased synthetic function from liver disease and nephrotic syndrome.
# Transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia: Pt noted to have persistent transaminitis, direct bilirubinemia and elevated alk phos and LDH since admission.
RUQ u/s [**10-9**] showed borderline echogenic liver suggestive of fatty infiltration, no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, normal flow within the hepatic artery, hepatic veins, and portal veins.
MRI abd [**10-11**] showed heterogenous signal within the liver parenchyma concerning for infiltrative process or infection.
CT abd/pelvis [**10-13**] showed generalized anasarca and simple-appearing ascites as well as mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon.
Liver biopsy was reviewed and felt to be immune infiltrate with T cell predominance.
# C. diff: Patient was treated with po vancomycin (day 1 was [**Date range (3) 102514**]) with resolution of her diarrhea.
Surveillance testing negative for C. diff.
# Hx Hogkins disease: Extensive workup including multiple LN biopsies and marrow showed no evidence of recurrent disease last admission on [**2160-10-13**].
# Abdominal lymphadenopathy: 2 mesenteric soft tissue masses adjacent to jejunum- 3.2 x 3.0 cm and 3.7 x 2.6 cm not present on prior scan.
Given history of lymphoma, and EBV viremia, there was concern for lymphoma.
Instead, they recommend a repeat CT abdomen at a later date to assess for interval change.
# Vaginal bleeding, postmenapausal: Not hemodynamically significant.
Could be secondary to endometrial atrophy, but need to rule out endometrial cancer.
- need transvaginal ultrasound and possible endometrial biopsy in the future, will defer to outpatient workup for now.
# Anemia:  Pt had anemia, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Because of the elevated MCV count and RDW, there was suspicion for nutritional deficiency, so we started her on a multivitamin.
# VRE UTI- Completed course of Linezolid.
# Hypertension / tachycardia:  She was started on diltiazem for tachycardia and hypertension with likely diastolic congestive heart failure.
