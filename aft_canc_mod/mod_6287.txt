Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 **] with increased dyspnea, bedside TTE showed no pericardial eff, new ARF, with creatinine of 1.4 and k of 7.
She also complained of back pain and received one dose of dilaudid 2mg IV.
Initially here patient reported that she went to the OSH not for SOB but weakness and poor po intake.
Then , in our ED she felt acutely dizzy with BP 85/56 HR 106 AF and complained of SOB with RR 36 and O2 sat 100% on 4L NC.
CXR showed bilateral basilar infiltrates/effusions and she received one dose of zosyn.K was 6.2 and she received insulin and dextrose as well as calcium.
A bedside TTE showed no pericardial effusion.
She was given 0.5mg IV ativan for anxiety and a dose of dilaudid for pain.
On the floor, the patient reported that she had been short of breath since leaving the hospital on [**6-4**].
She also had discomfort from being in bed all the time but denied back pain.
She did endorse chest pain on inspiration.
She also noted palpitations and tremulousness as well as increased anxiety.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic endometrial CA with lung metastases and recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions requiring QOD drainage via pleurex catheter - Upper extremity dvts on fondaparinux - Afib with RVR .
She had an endometrial biopsy which showed poorly differentiated cancer.
Pathology revealed serous adenocarcinoma with endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia, it was a grade III tumor 7.5 cm in the greatest dimension with mets to the ovaries bilaterally.
She had three out of the left pelvic lymph nodes involved with metastases and two out of seven right pelvic lymph nodes involved with metastases as well as a right periaortic lymph node.
The patient was treated for her stage IIIC papillary serous endometrial cancer with four cycles of carboplatinum and Taxol by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and treatment started on [**2187-5-24**] and completed on [**2187-7-27**].
She also started whole abdominal pelvic  radiation.
On the CT scan followup in [**2-/2188**], the patient had an  interval development of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules associated with significant mediastinal adenopathy and left axillary adenopathy.
She also had diffuse, low-density hepatic lesions consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
-complicated by large pleural/pericardial effusions, s/p drainage of both with pleural drain in place   Social History: Originally from martinique.
Family History: No history of cancer at young age.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP: 98/54 P: 105 irreg irreg R: 16 O2: 100% General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, Dry MM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Decreased air movement bilaterally with crackles at bilateral bases CV: Irregularly irregular and tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities NEURO: Moves all four extremities.
Respiratory viral cx pending.. Urine legionella Ag negative  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 55yo F with h/o metastatic endometrial CA complicated by bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion requiring intermittent drainage via pleuradex catheter and bilateral upper extremity DVTs on fondaparinux and O2 (1L NC) at home admitted with SOB, ARF, Afib with RVR.
SOB: Initially CXR showed right-sided infiltrates worse from prior and concerning for HCAP vs aspiration PNA.
MI was ruled out with three sets of cardiac enzymes.
Plan for drainage qod per home regimen but did not have large effussions at presentations and had been drained day of admit.
# Hypotension: SBP in 80s-110s range on admission.
Patient likely with low-running BP at baseline with question of contribution from infection given CXR findings and leukocytosis despite remaining afebrile.
On the AM of [**6-16**] - BP transiently decreased to 50s while mentating well, unclear if spurious, as subsequent cuff read back to 110s.
No resuscitative efforts as pt was made DNR/DNI day prior on discussion with family.
# ARF: Patient had had recent CTA and also had had poor po intake while taking lasix at home.
A renal US also noted new right hdrynephrosis which was conerning to be related to pelvic massess and obstruction - it was unilateral  #.
Metastatic endometrial CA: Patient has poorly differentiated stage endometrial cancer with metastases to the lungs and liver.
Continued here on lidocaine patch for pain and ativan for anxiety.
Given her poor prognosis, family decision was to make pt DNR/DNI on [**2188-6-15**], and patient died the morning of [**2188-6-16**].
Tachyarrhythmia: Pt with h/o afib as well as SVT on prior admission.
Episodes seemed associated with anxiety, exacerbated by volume depletion.
Hypercoagulability - Patient had been previously diagnosed with bilateral UE DVT.
Left-sided DVT was spontaneous while the right-sided DVT was PICC associated.
In late [**4-3**], she had a right-sided DVT occurred while on lovenox for which she was switched to fondaparinox.
UENIs here showed persistent LUE DVT.
Fondaparinox was held in setting of ARF and evidence of coagulopathy while trying to obtain IV access.
No point tenderness or neurologic deficits to suggest cord involvement.
# Code: DNR/DNI .
