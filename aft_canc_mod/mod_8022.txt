EGD: normal, no varices .
[**2168-6-7**] CXR Mild pulmonary edema is new, left lower lobe atelectasis and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF, alcoholic cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of AS, who p/w persistent, severe DOE and was additionally found to be bacteremic.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: #  Critical [**Name (NI) **] Pt's recent echo showed valve area 0.5mm2.
Pt did have new Afib on this admission which could have been contributing to SOB and pt was cardioverted (see below).
Liver was consulted and thought pt's etoh cirhhosis was not severe was found to be Child's A, and would be able to go through surgery.
Pulmonary similarly thought the patient was high operative risk and would likely have prolonged time on ventillator, but agreeble to surgery - and would recommend bilateral thoracentesis prior to surgery or pigtail after surgery due to pt's signficant pleural efffusions.
Pt was then assessed for valvuloplasty and he underwent successful aortic baloon valvuloplasty [**2168-6-10**].
# Sepsis/Hypotension - Patient was transferred to the CCU for hypotension on [**2168-6-7**].
Patient was bolused with IVF and culture data revealed MSSA bacteremia and UTI.
He did not tolerate dopamine due to tachycardia.
On [**2168-6-12**] a trial of dobutamine was unsuccessful and not tolerated due to worsenng hypotension.
ABG revealed worsening acidosis likely responsible for lack of efficacy to pressors.
Patient demonstrated a mixed anion gap and non anion gap acidosis likely due to lactic acidemia and renal failure respectively.
# Renal Failure - Patient initially developed renal failure in the setting of sepsis but Cr corrected to 1.0 prior to cardiac cath as hemodynamics improved.
Urine sediment showed white cells which may have been due to infection or AIN.
A renal consult was requested, but dialysis/CVVH were not possible because patient continue to be hypotensive at this time.
# Atrial Fibrillation- New this admission.
It was thought that pt may have become dyspneic at home due to new onset of Afib, so pt was to be cardioverted.
The EGD was negative for varices, and so cardiology proceeded with a TEE to look for a mural thombus which was negative.
He had a brief episode of Afib again after cardiac cath but this self terminated.
Repeat ECHO in setting of r/o infectious endocarditis revealed EF now = 20%.
Pt was continued on Vitamin K 5mg until pt needed to be on anticoagulation for recent cardioversion.
#  [**Name (NI) 1069**] Pt had loose stool on [**6-4**], and a fever 101.2.
#  history of HTN - not on any hypertensives, low-dose ACEi and spironolactone d/c on last admission, likely due to cirhhosis.
Pt also had hypotension last admission pt underwent CTA which was negative for PE.
Pt initially remained stable w/ baseine systolic in 100s, but fell to SBP 70's on the day of transfer to the ICU.
He mentated well but had low urine output at this time.
He was started on Dobutamine drip but became tachychardic to 150's, tachypnic to 40's, and hypotensive to 60's, within one hour of administration.
# Code - DNR/DNI (briefly reversed for valvuloplasy and then re-initiated DNR/I)  Medications on Admission: - Vitamin K 5mg daily - MVI - Glipizide 5mg [**Hospital1 **] - Lasix 20mg daily - Fluticasone 50mcg [**Hospital1 **] - Lomotil 1 tab q6h prn   Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Critical aortic stenosis - Atrial fibrillation - Bacteremia  Secondary diagnosis: - cirrhosis - diabetes - systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none.
