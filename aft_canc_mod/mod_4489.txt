Rectal scans of the prostate were performed demonstrating a normal size gland with volume estimated at approximately 23 cc, but nevertheless, there is evidence of some mild benign prostatic hyperplasia with expansion of the central gland.
A few small cystic areas are seen within the central gland, but there is no evidence of abscess and there is no increased vascularity seen on color flow imaging.
CONCLUSION: Normal size gland with volume of 23 cc and mild BPH.
There are no signs of prostate abscess.
