Admission Date:  [**2130-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-6-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3513**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, decreased UOP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: History could not be obtained per pt.
Per records: Ms. [**Known lastname 5655**] is an 84 yo F with recently diagnosed metastatic ovarian CA thought not to be a chemo candidate, with recent admission [**Date range (1) 62824**] during which she was admitted for SOB, had 2 abdominal paracenteses, one of which showed adenocarcinoma via peritoineal fluid culture c/w ovarian origin.
Anticoagulation was not started [**3-2**] head CT c/w possible metastatic disease and overall poor performance status, however brain MRI showed no metastatic disease.
Palliative onc was consulted during that admission with the patient and her son deciding that chemo that was aggressive enough to shrink her tumor would not be tolerated by the pt given her poor functional status and they thought palliative care would be most appropriate.
Additionally she had ARF with Cr up to 2.8, which resolved with fluid boluses, however there remains concern about possible tumor infiltration into the bladder.
MR urogram was not revealing in this regard and was consistent with metastic ovarian ca.
She was noted to be hypotensive to 73/37 at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and no urine output was noted since her arrival there on [**5-5**].
Pt has never had pap smear, mammogram, or colonoscopy.
Family History: No known family history of heart disease or cancer.

Allowing for technical differences, no significant change is seen within the cyst compared to prior study.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
Again noted is free fluid within the abdomen.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with volume overload.
There is atelectasis at the left base and a small right pleural effusion.
Left basilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion * ECG [**2130-5-12**] Sinus tachycardia with frequent atrial ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-5-10**] the rate has increased and frequent atrial ectopy has appeared.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo woman with advanced metastatic ovarian CA who initially presented on [**2130-5-7**] in septic shock, admitted to MICU for hypotension/sepsis, transferred to the floor  on [**2130-5-26**] with acute renal failure.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and possible sepsis.
Renal US was performed to evaluate oliguria and was negative for hydronephrosis.
Repeat paracentesis performed on [**5-17**] demonstrated malignant cells, and given the advanced stage of her ovarian cancer and her performance status, she was not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy.
Urine electrolytes were sent and were consistent with a prerenal azotemia.
She was hydrated initially with crystalloid, and subsequently with blood, but with no response.
A urine sediment was significant for muddy brown casts.
Her worsening renal failure was thought more likely to represent ATN from her presenting hypotension.
Concurrently the patient's anasarca, which was attributed to her ovarian cancer and peritoneal seeding, worsened.
Gentle diuresis was attempted , however, given her renal failure and tenuous blood pressure, the patient remained volume overloaded.
Head MRI was negative for metastatic disease.
Her mental status changes were thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy given uremia and recent infections.
Given patient's underlying disease and the likelihood that she would not recover renal function, code status was once again addressed.
Patient was given morphine for pain control.
