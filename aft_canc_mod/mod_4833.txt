He was complaining of a severe headache and he was sent to his local hospital in NW where a CT scan was performed.
He has remained conscious since the fall and has been answers questions appropriately since arrival.
Past Medical History: Of note the patient has had multiple falls and walks with a cane.
He also has had difficult moving his left shoulder and it was discovered recently he has a torn rotator cuff on the left side.
-Gout -HTN -b/l cataracts - blindness in left eye ?ischemic event 3 years prior - CAD, h/o stent [**10**] years prior   Social History: Patient lives at home with wife.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Visual fields are full to confrontation on R, on L has no visual acuity.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
Muscle in UE [**6-14**] with some decreased strength in left UE [**3-14**] to pain and weakness from rotator cuff repair.
**FINAL REPORT [**2107-10-17**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2107-10-17**]):       POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
IMAGING: Head CT [**10-6**]:NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is right parietooccipital scalp hematoma, without underlying acute fracture seen.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right cerebral hemisphere and also foci in the left frontal lobe appear similar to that seen on outside hospital CT performed six hours prior.
Several foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior convexity are newly apparent.
There are also bilateral small predominantly frontal subdural hematomas, which measures up to 4 mm on the left, which appear unchanged.
Small focus of hemorrhagic contusion along the inferior right frontal lobe is unchanged.
There is new intraventricular extension of hemorrhage layering bilaterally in the occipital horns.
Size of the ventricles is unchanged, without evidence of hydrocephalus.
No shift of normally midline structures or effacement of the basal cisterns is seen.
No evidence for large vascular territorial infarction is seen.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the carotid siphons and vertebral arteries.
The patient has had prior bilateral lens replacement.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted within anterior ethmoid air cells and the left maxillary sinus, with small mucus retention cysts along the floor of the left maxillary sinus.
Compared to six hours prior, couple of new foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior complexity are newly apparent, as well as intraventricular extension of hemorrhage.
No shift of normally midline structures, effacement of the basal cisterns, or hydrocephalus.
Head CT [**10-8**]: FINDINGS: No significant interval change.
There is a subarachnoid hemorrhage located in the right cerebral hemisphere and left frontal lobe.
There is a tiny amount of blood layering along the falx and tentorium as well as dependently within the bilateral lateral ventricles, also subtle.
There is a right frontal subdural hematoma, which appears similar compared to prior study.
Previously noted left frontal subdural hematoma is slightly less prominent.
There is an area of contusion in the right inferior frontal lobe with similar appearance compared to prior study, with unchanged surrounding edema.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
There is no significant shift of midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, which could be due to age-related atrophy and appears similar compared to prior study.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of subarachnoid, intraparenchymal, and intraventricular hemorrhage allowing for some redistribution.
No shift of midline structures.
Bilateral consolidative changes of the lung bases most likely suggestive of aspiration, pneumonia is another likely possibility.
Atelectasis is less likely as there is no associated volume loss.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Loculated effusion is noted adjacent to the aorta on the left side.
Calcified cyst of the upper pole of the left kidney which does not meet the criteria for a simple cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service after falling backwards from a standing position and had a small SAH found on head CT.
He had fevers, elevated WBC, and his stool was positive for c. difficile.
The patient also had presumed aspiration pneumonia after several episodes of vomiting.
His first CXR did not show signs of pneumonia so antibiotics were not started for that.
However there was evidence of a mediastinal mass and LUQ masses.
Since the patient had multiple medical issues and did not require neurosurgery, he was transferred to the geriatrics service on [**10-13**].
# Aspiration pneumonia:  Pt denies any dyspnea and he sats mid-90s on RA.
1:1 supervision with meals to maintain aspiration precautions .
# Delirium on dementia:  His namenda and aricept were held, and he was started on Ritalin titrated up to 5 mg daily and Celexa 5 mg. .
# CAD, s/p stent [**10**] years ago:  He was continued on his metoprolol.
# MDS with refractory anemia:  His HCT remained at baseline of ~23.
