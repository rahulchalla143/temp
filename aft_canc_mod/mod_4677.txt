Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Tracheal Y-stent placement [**2150-8-5**] - Esophageal stent placement [**2150-8-6**] - Bronchoscopy [**2150-8-7**]   History of Present Illness: In brief, this patient is a 76 yo M former smoked admitted on [**8-3**] from [**Hospital6 1597**] for worsening dyspnea and 60 pound weight loss over 4 months and found to have a moderately differentiated squamous cell lung CA compressing the right mainstem bronchus and esophagus.
He underwent bronchoscopy that showed squamous CA with no mets seen on CT head, abdomen/pelvis.
Was treated with a 15 day course of levofloxacin for post-obstructive PNA and received 3 doses of radiation therapy.
He developed solid food dysphagia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for esophageal stenting, but was determined to need tracheal stenting first.
Tracheal stenting was performed on [**8-5**] followed by esophageal stenting on [**8-6**], afterwhich he developed atrial fibrillation.
He had a CXR that showed collapse of his RLL and RML with mild aeration of RUL.
Currently on steroid taper since transfer for COPD exacerbation.
Past Medical History: - Lung cancer - Epilepsy (age [**11-10**] yrs, was on Dilantin and stopped) - Appendectomy  Social History: - Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility by himself but able to manage ADL without assistance.
- Long time smoker (started at age 13yr) 2ppd til 2 wks ago - EtOH - 3 beers/night, more at younger age - IVDU - denies  Family History: - Rheumatoid Arthritis  Physical Exam: VS: 98.8 122/62 68 20 96%2L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, cachectic appearing, coughing HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL, EOMI Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: coarse breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes appreciated CV: RRR normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: warm, dry, intact with no rashes or lesions Neuro: A+Ox3, CN II-XII grossly intact with no focal deficits.
CARDIOLOGY [**2150-8-4**]   Cardiology ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat.
Findings are non-specific and may be within normal limits but cannot exclude possible chronic pulmonary disease.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
PATHOLOGY [**2150-8-5**]   Pathology Tissue: right lower lobe tumor: pending .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval placement of patent tracheal Y-stent.
Worsening of right lower lobe collapse and consolidation since prior CT (though improved from recent radiographs), likely due to tumoral involvement and/or secretions within right lower lobe airways.
Similar appearance of locally invasive hilar/mediastinal mass, consistent with reported history of squamous cell lung cancer.
Increased left pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation and atelectasis, consistent with pneumonia and possibly aspiration.
Small right pleural effusion little changed; pleural enhancement noted and pleural involvement by tumor cannot be excluded.
13 mm left upper lobe ground glass opacity is nonspecific, and may represent aspiration, infection, or tumor.
7 mm right upper lobe nodule.
However, there remains increased opacity and right-sided pleural effusion in this location.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
There are no pneumothoraces identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M with long hx of tobacco smoking, appendectomy, and epilepsy in youth presenting from OSH after x4 radiation treatments, 15 day Levofloxacin course for pna, and steroid taper for COPD exacerbation presenting for tracheal and esophageal stent placement for lung carcinoma.
During the patient's admission, he tolerated esophageal and airway stenting, but developed atrial fibrillation with RVR during his course.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Post-stenting, the patient developed AF with RVR requiring MICU transfer for diltiazem gtt.
He was converted to a standing oral regimen on transfer to the general floor, and was noted to be in sinus with 1:1 conduction for the duration with intermitent episodes of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation.
Given multiple recent interventions performed, aspirin therapy was deferred during his admission, but can be considered on discharge.
Urinary retention: Following tracheal stent placement, the patient developed urinary retention.
A foley catheter was placed and Tamsulosin was started [**2150-8-6**] with successful voiding trial.
Hyponatremia: Patient developed hyponatremia to 130.
Ddx includes volume depletion vs. SIADH.
