A CXR was noted to have a RML/RLL infiltrate so she received vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin for HAP as well as nebs.
obstruction by pelvic mass but pelvic CT showed the problem was a collapsed bladder with no mass seen.
She was given 2L of NS in the ED but had a persistently elevated lactate with no hypotension.
She was also noted to be markedly tachypneic with RR in the 30s but without significant hypoxia, satting 95% on 2L.
Rest of ROS not obtainable due to patient's dementia and poor historian.

#.Respiratory failure/HAP: The patient had a known RLL mass, that was likely causing a post obstructive pneumonia.
Given her large hiatal hernia she was at increased risk of aspiration and the infiltrate in her RLL and RML lung zones was larger suggestion recent aspiration.
She was ventilated her first evening in the ICU with non-invasive BiPAP for hypercarbia which was likely secondary to dilaudid.
She also had evidence of volume overload and was on CVVH.
The next morning in the ICU her respiratory status continued to decline with increasing oxygen requirement.
#.Anuric renal failure:  The patient had a collapsed bladder leading to anuria.
The patient was noted to be hypocalemic and was started on continous calcium infusion.
A CT of the abdomen showed pancreatitis and cholelithiasis.
Her acidosis was likely secondary to her taking metformin in setting of renal failure.
She was changed to an ISS and her acidosis was improving.
Elevated lactate/AG acidosis:  Her AG acidosis was likely from relatively poor perfusion in the setting of hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.
The concurrent use of metformin was likely contributing to her acidosis in the setting of renal failure.
Hyperkalemia: She had hyperkalemia likely from ARF.
She had no EKG changes and was treated with  kayexelate as well as CVVH.
Gout: Allopurinol was held in the setting of renal failure.
