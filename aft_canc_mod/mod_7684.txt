It consists of several hypercellular spicules.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of fragmented trabecular bone, which appears osteopenic.
The marrow cellularity is 80-90% and comprised mainly of sheets of large cells with abundant cytoplasm, vesicular and folded nuclei, and prominent nucleoli.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
[**2179-2-8**] Peripheral Blood Flow Cytometry: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast and lymphocyte yield.
T cells comprise approximately 55% of lymphoid gated events, express mature lineage antigens and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.4 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
[**2179-2-15**] Right Thigh Skin Biopsy: Sparse perivascular inflammation and edema involving dermis and subcutis.
The findings are non-specific and mild.
There is focal perivascular inflammation with a few slightly enlarged mononuclear cells in a fat lobule, however, there is limited adipose tissue in the specimen.
The changes are not those of a neutrophilic dermatosis.
Special stains ([**Last Name (un) 18566**], PAS, and gram) are negative for organisms.
[**2179-2-17**] Right Leg Skin Biopsy: Mild perivascular inflammation and edema involving dermis and subcutis.
There is slightly more inflammation observed than in the prior biopsy.
While mild, the finding of perivascular mononuclear cells and edema within the dermis and subcutis is unusual.
There is some erythrocyte extravasation, however, no definitive vasculitis is observed.
There is focal lipomembranous fat necrosis which may be observed as a non-specific finding.
The findings are not sufficient for erythema nodosum.
The changes are not those of a neutrophilic dermatosis.
Rare large atypical cells are seen in dermal perivascular distribution in a background of edema.
The morphological findings are suspicious for treated leukemia cutis.
It consists of scant hypocellular spicules composed of stromal cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and clusters of plasma cells.
Rare hemophagocytic histiocytes are present.
Erythroid precursors are rare in number with normoblastic maturation.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of fragments of trabecular bone that appears osteopenic, with an overall cellularity of <10%.
A small poorly formed lymphohistiocytic granuloma is seen.
Eosinophilic debris is present consistent myeloablative chemotherapy.
Cytogenetics: Tissue cultures were established to obtain cells for cytogenetic and FISH analyses.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
No significant valvular abnormality.
[**2179-2-8**] CXR: Mild cardiomegaly, mediastinal and hilar prominence are most consistent with vascular engorgement, but could be mimicked by adenopathy.
There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Probable mild cardiac decompensation.
No evidence of pneumonia.
[**2179-2-9**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new right-sided double-lumen dialysis catheter and a new left internal jugular vein catheter.
Mild areas of atelectasis at the left lung base.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
Several segmental pulmonary emboli associated with multiple sites of apparent pulmonary infarcts.
Clot burden and site of most proximal emboli may be underestimated due to poor vascular enhancement.
Infiltrative lymphadenopathy especially of the bilateral hila and infra-hilar regions.
Hypodensities within the spleen as described, differential includes either infarctions or involvement with this patient's AML, unfortunately no prior studies to allow assessment for interval change.
Other than the above, no other abnormalities which may be acute are appreciated.
Note of a fatty liver, probable cyst within the right kidney, fibroid uterus, prominent right inguinal lymph node.
Lung bases appear unchanged compared to the chest CT from one day earlier, including findings raising the suspicion of pulmonary infarctions.
Soft tissue density between the right common carotid and jugular veins with differential as discussed above.
This could represent a nodal lesion versus phlegmonous tissue.
No evidence for abscess is seen.
There is no evidence for vascular thrombosis.
[**2179-2-15**] RENAL U/S: No hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or evidence of renal calculi.
Markedly thickened and heterogeneous endometrial stripe with apparent increased vascular flow.
Findings are consistent with hemorrhage within the cavity possibly from degeneration of a submucosal fibroid, but possibly from other mass, polyp, or vascular malformation.
Large fibroid uterus.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old woman with a history of HTN and borderline DM who initially presented to an OSH with fevers, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy at day 14 ([**2179-2-23**]) demonstrated an empty bone marrow, consistent with myeloablative therapy, and her ANCs rebounded nicely thereafter.
She developed severe oral mucositis, requiring TPN for a short period of time, but this resolved with routine oral care and she is now able to tolerate POs, though her appetite is still depressed.
She currently has a small well-healing area of mucositis in the left buccal mucosa.
# Neutropenic Fever: On admission she was started on vanco/cefepime/azithro for questionable CAP.
A CT chest was performed given her hypoxia, which showed PE with basilar infarcts.
She developed rigors and a non-painful and non-pruritic diffuse body rash and antibiotics were switched to vanco/meropenem.
Oral lesions were consistent with mucositis but suspicious for viral infection (HSV) and she was started on IV acyclovir.
She remained afebrile and all cultures were negative so the antibiotics were eventually stopped.
# Hypoxia/PE: She was initially diuresed with gentle IV furosemide boluses as her high respiratory rate and CXR findings were felt secondary to fluid overload given aggressive hydration as part of chemo.
Due to concern for PE, CTA was performed and demonstrated bilateral PEs and pulmonary infarction in addition to considerable lymphadenopathy.
She had negative bilateral LE dopplers and a CT of the neck and CT abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of venous thrombosis peripherally or in the more central veins.
An IVC filter was placed on [**2179-2-13**] given the inability to start anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia/Menorrhagia: Initial platelet count was 103 but she became profoundly thrombocytopenic after initiation of chemotherapy.
GYN was consulted and a transvaginal U/S showed multiple fibroids and a hypervascular endometrium.
They deferred endometrial biopsy due to her neutropenia, and deferred hormonal therapies given the prothrombotic risks in someone with a PE.
Her bleeding slowed markedly and her bone marrow began to recover with decreased need for transfusions.
# Rash: Patient developed several quarter sized areas of hyperpigmented, raised lesions on her legs shortly after chemotherapy was completed.
The quantity of the infiltrate was not consistent with leukemia cutis but due to the few enlarged perivascular cells and the fact that this did not fit with any typical dermatitis, hemepath was asked to review.
The rash resolved without intervention.
# Diarrhea: Patient noted frequent stools without abdominal pain.
Etiology likely secondary to chemotherapy and had resolved by discharge.
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts, consistent with ATN, but urine electrolytes were more consistent with contrast-induced nephropathy vs. pre-renal etiology.
# Type 2 Diabetes: Previously diet-controlled.
She was briefly started on glyburide [**Hospital1 **], but due to poor appetite and PO intake, her blood sugars were low and the glyburide and insulin was stopped.

Lab testing and a bone marrow biopsy showed that you have leukemia which was treated with chemotherapy.
You were also found to have a small clot in your lungs which we treated by placing a filter in one of your veins.
You had some vaginal bleeding which required some blood transfusions, but this is resolving.
