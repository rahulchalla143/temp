History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 63651**] is a 61-year-old right-handed woman with a past medical history including recurrent glioblastoma who presented to the ED with increasing somnolence and lower extrmity weakness and was found to have right frontal hemorrhage in a prior resection site.
The symptoms occurred in the setting of cough.
As she has previously developed similar symptoms in the setting  of infection, Mr. [**Known lastname 63651**] thought she might be ill.
The imaging revealed hemorrhage in a prior right frontal resection site, intraventricular extension, and mild hydrocephalus.

Mild hydrocephalus is noted.
CT Head [**2142-5-19**]:  IMPRESSION: Stable right frontal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and dilation.
Hyperdense material in the suprasellar cistern likely represent hemorrhage, stable.
CT Head [**2142-5-20**]:  IMPRESSION: Stable right frontal hemorrhage, with intraventricular extension.
CT Head [**2142-5-21**]:  IMPRESSION: Stable examination with right frontal hemorrhage and intraventricular extension.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 63651**] is a 60-year-old woman with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme was admitted for neurological deficits from baseline and was found to have a right intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan.
She expired after a second large episode of epistaxis.
The initial plan was to repeat a CT scan at time of discharge, however, as further events resulted in change in goals of care, this plan was no longer appropriate.
(3) Epistaxis:  She had an episode of epistaxis on [**2142-5-29**].
ENT was consulted and controlled the bleeding with packing.
She recovered from the acute respiratory distress though she continued to breath with accessory muscles.
On [**2142-6-14**] she had a second large episode of epistaxis.
(5) UTI:  She had low grade temperatures and was in sinus tachycardia which prompted an infectious work up.
