Yesterday noticed some left drooling but speech was fine.
Today, family noticed left facial droop and some mild slurring of speech with some left hand weakness.
He did appear to have some confusion with following some commands even considering language barrier.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger Gait: wide-based  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2100-12-31**] 07:36PM   PT-13.0 PTT-26.1 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2100-12-31**] 07:36PM   PLT COUNT-358 [**2100-12-31**] 07:36PM   WBC-7.0 RBC-5.01 HGB-14.7 HCT-40.8 MCV-81* MCH-29.3 MCHC-36.0* RDW-14.0 [**2100-12-31**] 07:36PM   OSMOLAL-291 [**2100-12-31**] 07:36PM   GLUCOSE-110* UREA N-15 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.0 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-14 [**2101-1-1**] 03:11PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.017 [**2101-1-1**] 03:11PM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-TR BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-NEG [**2101-1-1**] 08:40PM   PHENYTOIN-9.8* [**2101-1-1**] 08:40PM   GLUCOSE-122* UREA N-17 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-3.7 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-17  MRI OF THE BRAIN:[**2101-1-1**] (PREOP) There is an approximately 4.5 x 3.5 cm mass in the right frontal lobe with irregular shape and thick rim enhancement.
The central portion of the mass is hypointense on T1-weighted images, without enhancement and demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion.
There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle without midline shift.
There is no evidence of acute or chronic blood products seen within the mass.
There is surrounding white matter edema noted.
There are no other abnormal areas of enhancement seen within the brain.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.
MRI OF THE BRAIN:[**2101-1-2**] (POSTOP) Extensive postsurgical changes are noted in the right frontal region consistent with recent surgery.
Enhancement is noted in the postsurgical bed may represent residual tumor versus postsurgical changes.
Moderate brain edema and mild-to-moderate midline shift noted, which appears to be not significantly changed since the prior examination.
Minimal subdural collections are noted in the postsurgical bed.
Slight reduction in subdural gas.
[**1-7**] KUB: Prominent small bowel and large bowel gases throughout down to the rectum, probably representing ileus.
[**1-8**] KUB: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without significant interval change.
There is some minimal decrease of the air in the small bowel.
No signs of bowel obstruction.
[**1-18**] KUB: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
No evidence of free air or small-bowel obstruction.
Moderate free air within the abdomen.
Rim-enhancing collection within the left inferior pelvis, at the medial and posterior aspects of the left acetabulum.
This collection could represent a small abscess within the obturator internus and gluteus minimus muscles, or may represent an infectious arthritis.
An MRI may be helpful for further evaluation.
Mild pulmonary edema, manifested as ground glass opacity.
Distended bladder, with a tiny air bubble.
A couple of nodular opacities within the lungs.
[**1-29**] CXR: Free air under the diaphragm.
[**1-31**] CXR: Interval decrease in pneumoperitoneum.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 65087**] is a 70-year-old Portugese speaking man admitted with slurred speech and left sided droop noticed by sister.
[**Hospital 4695**] Hospital course: Patient taken to OR on [**2101-1-2**] for right craniotomy for resection of fronto-parietal mass under general anesthesia without intraoperative anesthesia.
Postoperative day one([**2101-1-3**]) patient transferred to NeuroICU due to continuing intubation.
He was advanced back to tube feeds on the [**1-11**] a speech and swallow consult was obtained and a general surgery consult in anticipation of failure of speech and swallow to place a G-tube.
[**2101-1-18**] a Foley catheter was placed back again for urinary retention.
Urine cultures taken on [**2101-1-17**] showed E. coli resistant to Cipro, switched to Augmentin.
This was likely multifactorial, with his neoplasm and recent surgery, along with related brain edema, as well as medications, constipation, and urinary retention and UTI all contributing.
The patient had serial abdominal films with no evidence of obstruction.
The patient was also started on reglan and simethicone and encouraged to get out of bed and work with physical therapy frequently to prevent recurrence of his constipation and distention.
The urine culture grew E. coli resistant to TMP/SMX and ciprofloxacin, so the patient was switched to augmentin to complete the course of treatment.
On on [**2101-2-3**], the patient was noted to have an elevated WBC count, and UA was found to be positive.
Culture again grew E. coli with similar sensitivities, so he was treated with ceftriaxone for 1 week.
A follow up urine culture grew 10,000-100,000 colonies of vancomycin resistant enterococcus, but the UA at that time was negative and the patient was afebrile and had a normal WBC count so this was considered likely to be a colonizer.
A repeat swallow evaluation prior to discharge was done, and the patient was then allowed to take small amounts of pureed food and nectar prethickened liquids with supervision for comfort.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 6257**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal parietal glioblastoma s/p craniotomy.
Discharge Instructions: If you experience fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or any other new or concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or return to the emergency room for evaluation.
