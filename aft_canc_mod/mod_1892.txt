Ct head:IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Right bundle-branch block.
Downsloping ST segment depressions in leads V3-V6 with primary T wave changes in leads V2-V3.
Compared to tracing of [**2176-10-17**] the ST segment depressions are slightly less pronounced.
CXR:IMPRESSION: [**10-29**]:New right mid and lower zone opacities consistent with aspiration/pneumonia.
EGD-normal colonoscopy-grade 1 hemorrhoids, diverticulosis of the whole colon   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 89 y/o man with hx of duodenal ulcer, h pylori [**10-14**], CAD, Afib, p/w CP and found to have melanotic stools, hct 21, INR 5.0. s/p FFP, vitamin K, PRBC's.
EGD normal, colonoscopy shows diverticulosis without active bleeding.
Additionally, pt was found to have +h.pylori in [**2175**] for which he was not treated secondary to elevated creatinine.
Spoke to GI regarding this matter who feels that after patient's clinical condition improves, pneumonia resolves, and is off current antibiotics, can consider H.pylori treatment as EGD was normal.
# Chest pain: Likely demand ischemia in the setting of known CAD and anemia.
EKG showed changes c/w prior GIB when he had demand ischemia.
However, lasix and ACEI were held [**1-10**] bleed and transiently elevated creatinine.
# Cards rhythm: afib on coumadin.
PT placed on telemetry for monitoring.
# CHF: hx of mild systolic CHF thought [**1-10**] CAD (Given his stress report).
Pt appeared clinically euvolemic and transiently hypovolemic given hypernatremia and elevated creatinine.
Repeat CXR showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia for which pt was placed on levoflox and flagyl.
Sputum culture was consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Pt has some low  grade temperatures 99's.
#hyperglycemia: Pt found to be hyperglycemic with no known history of diabetes.
HE was placed on a DM diet and given diabetic teaching.
# Renal function: Baseline Cr 1.3 - 1.5.

Dermatology felt the lesion to be unusual but suspicious for neoplasm.
They performed 3 punch biopsies on [**2177-11-4**] and closed the wound with sutures.
Dermatology will contact the PCP/family with biopsy results.
