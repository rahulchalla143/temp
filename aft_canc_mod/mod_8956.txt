Overall, he has had numerous complaints including crampy abdominal pain, cramps in his legs, generalized weakness, confusion, emotional lability, and non-specific difficulty with his vision.
Over the past 3 days, however, he has become acutely worse with significant confusion and inability to meaningfully interact and converse with his family, and inability to take in significant fluids or nutrition PO.
Out of concern for his health, his family found information on the internet regarding low potassium levels from diarrhea and tried to feed him bananas and electrolyte-containing drinks as well as pepto-bismol.

No dysarthria.
No apraxia or neglect.
Has left facial droop affecting the upper and lower half of the face.
Moderate hydronephrosis which is unchanged from the outside ultrasound of [**2171-4-16**].
A Foley catheter is in place within the partially distended bladder and there is a large amount of echogenic material within the bladder consistent with hemorrhage.
There is a small amount of hemorrhage at the site of right femoral line placement with no significant hematoma at that site.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Hemorrhage is noted in the bladder with foci of air suggestive of recent instrumentation.
Bilateral mild-moderate hydronephrosis with hydroureter all the way to the most distal ureters.
Although no clear stones are identified, evaluation is severely limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
Prominent para-aortic lymph nodes which may be of reactive or malignant etiology, though incompletely characterized.
GU U/S [**4-20**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent left-sided mild hydronephrosis.
Resolution of right-sided hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:  61 year old male with no known prior history in our system, transferred from OSH for AMS, hyperkalemia, fulminant renal failure, and hypertensive emergency.
Course complicated by new diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer, NSTEMI, CVA with persistent left sided hemiparesis, and delirium.
# Subacute Obstructive Uropathy complicated by hyperkalemia and fulminant renal failure: He was admitted with poor UOP, symptoms of obstruction and overflow incontinence.
Foley was placed initially at OSH with initiation of bleeding and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Initial Renal/GU U/S showed moderate bilateral hydronephrosis with a large amount of echogenic material within the bladder consistent with hemorrhage.
Repeat U/S showed persistent left-sided mild hydronephrosis with improvement of right-sided hydronephrosis.
He was continued on dialysis for multiple sessions with gradual improvement in his creatinine and uremia.
His left tube continued to drain a substantial amount of urine daily, although the right tube averaged 150-200cc per day, which was felt to reflect decreased renal function on that side.
Ultimately, it was felt his initial renal failure was due to obstructive uropathy from new prostate cancer and ATN.
# Metastatic Prostate cancer: He presented with obstructive uropathy, and had a massively enlarged and hard prostate on rectal exam.
His PSA was elevated to about 300 and bone scan showed multiple sites of metastases to bone.
He had a significant amount of hematuria (see below) and underwent XRT to the prostate and completed treatment to reduce bleeding.
# Gross Hematuria: He was noted to have hematuria after a difficult foley placement at OSH.
The patient had a CT scan performed on [**4-18**] which showed an enlarged prostate.
After continued gross hematuria and persistent high-level CBI requiring 20 units of pRBCs during his MICU course, he was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for cystoscopy by urology which showed bleeding prostate, with gross appearance highly suspicous for prostate cancer.
Due to persistent bleeding he was started on radiation therapy to help control bleeding, which was successful.
# Hypertensive Emergency with AMS: He had a systolic BP of 220+ on admission with altered mental status, and fulminant renal failure.
ECG inferior Q-waves c/w with prior infarction and troponins were elevated, but difficult to interpret in the setting of renal failure.
# NSTEMI/Chest pain: He had a few episodes of chest pain during this admission without ST changes on ECG.
He did have elevated troponins, which were difficult to interpret in the setting of renal failure, but did increase to 1.55 which was felt to be an NSTEMI, likely demand in setting of a large 20 unit bleed from his prostate.
He remained on labetalol and chest pain free for the duration of admission.
# Stroke: He was noted on admission to have mild left sided weakness.
He continued to have delirium and some left sided weakness.
One morning, in the setting of hypertension to the 200/100 range, he was noted to have full left sided upper extremity paresis and LLE weakness.
Stat CT head and neurology consult was obtained which showed new right occipital high attenuation likely representing intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as left posterior occipital subdural hematoma.
MRI showed multiple watershed vs embolic infarcts.
The exact cause of these infarcts was not clear, but they were ultimately felt to be related to hypotensive episodes during his large hemorrhage in the MICU or swings in BP during dialysis.
Initially anticoagulation was held given the partial hemorrhagic conversion, but he was eventually started on SC heparin and a baby aspirin daily.
He has not had a TEE to fully evaluate for an embolic source.
# Asymptomatic Pyuria: During his altered mental status, he had a UA with pyuria.
He was started on CTX and vancomycin [**5-2**] for UTI given he had low grade fever, poor mental status, WBC with a few bands and positive UA (difficult to interpret given low UOP).
# Pancytopenia: He had pancytopenia after his massive bleed in the MICU.
The cause of this was not entirely clear, but it was felt to possibly be due to marrow involvement of his prostate cancer.
He was transfused multiple units of blood intermittently for anemia and should have a CBC checked weekly after discharge.
# Left shoulder pain: He complained of shoulder pain at the site of a likely metastasis seen on bone scan.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Weekly monitoring of chem10, CBC - Needs outpatient oncology f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for prostate cancer - Needs radiation oncology f/u for possible radiation of left shoulder - Neurology f/u given recent acute strokes - Needs urology f/u for his percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, will need to be changed at some point per urology recommendations - Needs at least daily PT for new embolic strokes  Medications on Admission: Medications: None   Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Prostate cancer Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction Stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were brought to the hospital because of your confusion and kidney failure.
You had a lot of bleeding from your prostate after foley catheter was placed, so you were transfused red blood cells and platelets to try to stop the bleeding.
Because of the way your prostate looked on the cystoscopy and certain lab tests (elevated PSA), you were diagnosed with prostate cancer that showed spread to the bone, that was seen on the bone scan.
During your hospitalization, you had a heart attack, but your heart remained with normal function.
You were also noted to have a stroke which left you unable to move your left upper arm.
