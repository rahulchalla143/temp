Admission Date:  [**2107-1-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-2-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-7-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: 77 year old male,recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]  for CHF exacerbation,thought to be due to to urosepsis(e.coli).
This time, the patient presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital on [**1-28**] with dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypoxia, telemetry showed supraventricular tachycardia (aflutter vs fib.
He was noted to have a both an elevated WBC >16 and a metabolic acidosis, though in the setting of acute renal failure.
In the CCU pt recieved Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for presumed community aquired pneumonia and was extubated in [**5-10**] hours after intubation.
He was on heparin for ~24 hours as he ruled in for an MI by enzymes.
HTN 3.

Pertinent Results: LABS ON DISCHARGE: Hct 30 (baseline) WBC = 9 INR 1 Glucose-79 UreaN-11 Creat-0.9 Na-143 K-3.9 Cl-109* HCO3-28 AnGap-10 Vanc trough 17.4 (goal >10) ([**2107-2-7**]) lactate 1.5  Cardiac Labs: CK 185, 587, 257, 80, 67 TnT 0.67, 2.25 CKMB 22, 82, 21, 5  [**Month/Day/Year **] LA 4x3cm LV septum 1.5cm LVEF 45% with mild global HK E/A ratio 0.57 E wave decel 260ms TR gradient = 31mmHg (<25) - indicating pulmonary hypertension  Radiology CXR [**2107-1-29**]- AP FINDINGS: The patient has been intubated in the interval, with endotracheal tube 2.5 cm above the carina.
Prominent lung markings are on the left, which may be chronic vs representing edema/infection.
There appears to be a layering left- sided pleural effusion, most prominent at the left apex, possibly combined with pleural thickening.
There has been some volume loss on the left.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2107-2-1**]-Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Apparent diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax, likely secondary to rotation and technique.
However, a layering effusion or other acute process is difficult to exclude.
No evidence of focal pneumonia.
Stable left-sided volume loss and pleural thickening.
Shortness of breath- Pt was intubated for SOB at OSH and transferred to the CCU.
His attending cardiologist felt that his primary cause of SOB and tachycardia was not cardiac in origin but more related to an infectious etiology.
His SOB was likely secondary to worsening heart failure related to his underlying infection (tracheo bronchitis) as well as his acute MI in the setting of demand ischemia.
Pneumonia was unlikely.
CT edmonstrated no consolidation.
Sputum grew out MRSA with oral flora.
This may be the etiologic agents or may represent colonization as pt lives in nursing home.
Aspiration as a cause for his tracheobronchitis is very possible.
He has severe Parkinson's Disease and becomes extreemly rigid when missing his Sinemet giving him a profound aspiration risk.
He remained afebrile throughout his hospital course and his white count on admission was decreased from previous measurements at the OSH.
Coronary Artery Disease and [**Name (NI) **] Pt with LBBB on EKG that is old.
He ruled in for an MI with a peak CK of 560.
His MI occured in the setting of demand ischemia due to his infection and atrial tachycardia.
There is a questionably history of atrial fibrillation though this was never demonstarted on ECG.
Pt was hypernatremic on admission to the medicine floor to 147.
It may be from from diverticulosis, though pt did not have his Outpt colonoscopy as of yet.
Tachycardia Pt tachycardic previously now in 80-100s.
Likely atrial tachycardia vs. flutter.
Several attempts were made the next day but placement was difficult as twice it went to the lungs and other times it was difficult to place secondary to nasal anatomy.
Hypertension BP was well controlled on beta blocker.
