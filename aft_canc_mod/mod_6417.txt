Admission Date:  [**2149-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Third Ventriculostomy   History of Present Illness: HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 78196**] is a 73 y/o female who was running outside on [**2149-4-21**].
She stopped on a hard surface and fell forward resulting in hand lacerations, facial lacerations, and bilateral mandibular condyle fractures.
She was confused and amnestic to the event at that time, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for higher level of care.
At [**Hospital1 18**] she appeared to remember the details of the fall, and described a history of breast cancer with bilateral mastectomies.
Head CT from OSH was suspicious for mass lesions with effacement of fourth ventricle.
Past Medical History: PMHx: hypertension diabetes type 2 breast cancer  PMHx: hypertension diabetes type 2 breast cancer  PSHx: bilateral mastectomies [**2131**] and [**2140**]   Social History: Social Hx: lives alone, admits to 1-1/2 packs of cig.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
The thoracic aorta is slightly unfolded.
There is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.
No pleural effusions are seen.
No displaced rib fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild cephalization of pulmonary vasculature without frank pulmonary edema.
Non-specific junctional ST segment changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 73 year old woman s/p fall with bilateral mandibular condyle fractures.
Multiple cerebellar masses on CT. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Intracranial bleed?
INDICATION: 73-year-old woman status post fall and multiple cerebellar masses.
FINDINGS: As noted on the prior CT and MRI performed prior to this examination, there are multiple masses seen best in the posterior fossa with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
These masses were better evaluated on the MRI performed prior to the study.
There is a small focus of hemorrhage in the subependymal/ventricular system in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, which is increased in size since the outside hospital CT dated [**2149-4-21**] at 18:49, approximately 24 hours earlier.
This may represent evolution of post-traumatic hemorrhage given the patient's recent fall.
Alternatively, this could represent hemorrhage of a subependymal metastasis although an enhancing lesion is not seen in this region on the MRI performed prior to this study.
There is no midline shift.
Multiple mass lesions seen best in the posterior fossa with surrounding vasogenic edema are consistent with metastatic disease, which was better evaluated on the preceding MRI.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci may be related to age-related involutional change; however, given the mass effect on the fourth ventricle, obstructing hydrocephalus may be evolving and close clinical followup is recommended.

MR HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There are multiple enhancing lesions throughout the brain, the largest of which are within the posterior fossa.
The largest lesion measures 4.2 x 3.4 cm within the left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is a 1.6 x 2.8 cm enhancing lesion within the right cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly and a 2.7 x 3.7 cm lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere superiorly.
There is a 1.5 x 1.9 cm lesion centered in the cerebellar vermis.
There is a 1.0-mm lesion in the left temporal lobe inferiorly and multiple smaller subcentimeter lesions within the remainder of the temporal lobe.
Multiple smaller subcentimeter lesions are seen throughout the frontal lobe, many of which are rim-enhancing.
All of these lesions demonstrate surrounding vasogenic edema.
Multiple lesions within the posterior fossa are heterogeneous in signal intensity and enhancement characteristics which may reflect underlying necrosis or calcification.
There is a lesion in the subependymal region of the left posterior occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] which demonstrates increased susceptibility on gradient echo consistent with hemorrhage.
The fourth ventricle is narrow, however, there is no evidence for tonsillar herniation at this time.
There is no subfalcine herniation.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent.
There are scattered T2 hyperintense foci in the periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
Multiple large enhancing masses throughout the brain parenchyma most consistent with metastatic disease.
There is effacement of the prepontine cisterns and the fourth ventricle, however, there is no evidence of tonsillar herniation at this time.
Small focus of subependymal hemorrhage in the left posterior occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] may represent a hemorrhage within a metastasis.

No other area concerning for fracture or malalignment is identified.
There is a well corticated osseous density along the volar region of the fourth middle phalanx, perhaps related to prior trauma, but incompletely evaluated.
On the right, the patient is unable to straighten her third digit at the PIP joint, no other area concerning for fracture or dislocation is identified.
There are vascular calcifications noted.
The bones have a patchy appearance, which may relate to demineralization.
No fracture identified.
Her initial head CT showed masses in her posterior fossa.
The patient initially had multiple bruises on her face, she sustained bilateral mandibular condyle fractures, and had lacerations on her hands.
After being admitted to the TSICU, the patient was able to recall the events leading to her fall and was able to give a past medical history including bilateral mastectomies.
Several hours after admission, she became agitated, confused and had a repeat head CT which showed a new small hemorrhage in the left ventricle.
They stated that there was no surgery needed at the time for her mandibular fractures and recommended keeping her NPO initially.
On [**2149-4-24**] the patient had a CT chest which showed a 3-cm right lower lobe mass lesion and extensive associated lymphadenopathy, which was likely primary lung CA.
There were also two liver masses and extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy found.
She had a bone scan which showed no evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
On [**2149-4-25**] the patient went to the OR for a 3rd ventriculostomy which went well without complication.
On [**4-29**] she was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
On the 17th and 18th, she had radiation, after which she was discharged to rehabilitation to continue with her radiation, therapy and further discussion of possible lung biopsy.
