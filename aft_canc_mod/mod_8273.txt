These findings are nonspecific and can be seen with a multifocal pneumonia, aveolar hemorrhage, or massive aspiration.
Evidence of mild volume overload with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions.
Superimposed diffuse ground-glass opacities not typical in a typical distribution for pulmonary edema suggest a superimposed process such as hemorrhage, infection, or drug reaction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with basilar consolidation and atelectasis.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes may be reactive or due to patient's known MDS.
Coronary artery calcifications of unknown hemodynamic significance.
Mild splenomegaly.
Enlarged pumonary artery suggesting pulmonary artery hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE:  80 yo female with h/o [**Hospital 90129**] transferred from OSH in [**Location (un) 3844**] with progressive SOB and hypoxia likely secondary to multifocal PNA.
Guaiac was not done due to lack of bowel movements.
With improvement of her lung process it hovered between 1.2 and 1.5.
Renal had been consulted for question of pulm-renal syndrome like Wegener's/MPA/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 112225**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] positive but with 1:160 titer.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  -PNA/HYPOXEMIA: Transferred from OSH [**9-29**] with respiratory distress after 3 days of ceftriaxone, azithromycin and lasix for treatment of PNA vs CHF in the context of hypoxemia (79% RA-->90% 3L NC), bilateral infiltrates on CXR, lower extremity edema and BNP 1780 .
There was also concern for leukostasis given her h/o MDS and WBC elevation (51.4k from baseline 20-30k).
Echo showed EF 55-60% with mild AI and MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name (NI) 153**], pt alert, appeared comfortable, but inital sats in low 90s on 5-6L simple facemask with desats to mid 80s.
Antibiotic coverage broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin to cover HCAP due to recent PNA hospitalization [**6-11**] and completion of antibiotic course for course 2 wks PTA.
CT chest [**9-30**] showed small bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse ground-glass opacities suggestive of hemorrhage, infection, or drug reaction.
Oncology consulted, peripheral blood revealed marked monocytosis but few blasts so pulmonary leukostasis less likely than PNA.
Renal also consulted given concern for vasculitis/pulmonary renal syndrome as pt had [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 112226**] [**Last Name (un) **] and microscopic hematuria.
No dysmorphic RBCs seen in urine, recommended ANCA, complement and anti-GBM antibodies.
ANEMIA: Chronic normocytic anemia in the setting of MDS.
LDH high, but in setting of malignancy this is unreliable.
No schistocytes seen on smear.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6 on admission (baseline 0.9) with microscopic hematuria on UA.
Fractional excretion of urea not suggestive of pre-renal etiology.
URICEMIA: Unlikely due to tumor lysis syndrome although possible due to elevated tumor burden.
No rasburicase given.
INACTIVE ISSUES: GLAUCOMA: continued on home medications INSOMNIA: on Lunesta at home which is non-formulary; treated with PRN trazodone HTN: on amlodipine and lisinopril at home; home meds held for SBP 100-120s throughout ICU stay, lisinopril also held for [**Last Name (un) **] DEPRESSION: continued on home Lexapro  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  # FULL CODE # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: On 3-4L O2 requirement on d/c.
f/u guaiac to r/o bleed as cause of inappropriate response to previous transfusions, although lack of bowel movements from blood catharsis is reassuring.
Lunesta *NF* (eszopiclone) 3 mg Oral HS prn insomnia 4.
Lunesta *NF* (eszopiclone) 3 mg Oral HS prn insomnia 5.
Simethicone 40-80 mg PO QID:PRN gas pain 10.
Lumigan *NF* (bimatoprost) 0.03 % OU unknown   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1108**] Rehab Unit at [**Hospital6 1109**] - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multifocal bacterial pneumonia Myelodysplastic Syndrome (possible transformation to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were transferred to our ICU from the ICU at [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] for continued care for low oxygen saturation in your blood.
We did a CT scan which showed changes consistent with an infection, although it does not rule out other causes of low oxygen.
We started you on antibiotics that cover a wide range of bacteria and your oxygen saturation improved.
Since you had an old history of blood in your urine and also had some impaired kidney function on admission, the nephrology (kidney) doctors came and saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **] to rule out other, rarer, causes of combined lung/kidney disease.
This could be a sign that your MDS is in transition into Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML).
However, to determine this we would have to repeat a bone marrow biopsy, which was deferred in light of your active lung process to your primary oncologist.
MDS also causes chronic anemia and low platelets due to impaired production in the bone marrow.
