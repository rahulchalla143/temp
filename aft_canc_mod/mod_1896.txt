Bronch showed bleeding in the left lung and a large clot.
Work-up with colonoscopy/endorectal US/CT chest showed mass in the rectum about 8 cm from the anal verge (T3 N0 MO).
Biopsy pos for adenocarcinoma.
He had endorectal ultrasound, which confirmed the mass along the left anterolateral rectal wall.
Underwent abdominoperineal resection in [**7-7**] c/b urethro-pelvic fistula.
- Bilateral pulmonary lesions c/w met dz noted on CT in [**3-8**].
- Course complicated by Hand/foot syndrome --> decrease xeloda to 1500 mg b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: as above Colostomy No diabetes, heart disease.
No consolidative opacities are identified.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
Cx R [**11-6**] Consolidation at the right base has improved and represent clearing of some aspiration.
Left lower lobe consolidation is stable.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Abd CT [**11-9**] HISTORY: 66-year-old male with colon CA and known lung metastases.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring 2.5 x 2 cm, slightly diminished from prior examination where it measured 2.2 x 3 cm within the left upper lobe.
Many of the nodules appear slightly increased in size and there is new appearance of large nodules in the right lower lobe and abutting the left major fissure.
There are new bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with some consolidation or atelectasis of the left lower lobe abutting the pleural effusion.
There is dependent atelectasis within the right lower lobe.
There is a grossly unchanged appearance to subaortic lymphadenopathy measuring 18.7 x 8.6 mm on today's examination.
No pathologic axillary nodes are identified and the heart and great vessels appear normal.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver enhances homogenously and again identified is a small 6 mm hypodensity in the left lobe (segment III), unchanged from prior examination and a larger well defined hypodensity within the inferior tip of the right lobe measuring approximately 11 x 15 mm on current examination, previously measuring 21 x 14 mm which are concerning for metastases.
There are multiple dilated loops of small bowel with a questionable transition zone within the left lower quadrant followed by distal decompressed loops, concerning for small bowel obstruction.
There is a mild- moderate amuont of ascites surrounding the liver.
There is no free air or pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy identified.
A previously mentioned increased soft tissue density in the presacral area is again identified unchanged from prior examination, likely representing postsurgical changes versus stable recurrent tumor.
The distal ureters and bladder appear normal.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
New and increased size of bilateral pulmonary nodules with mild decrease in size of most dominant nodule.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Unchanged left lobe lesion with better definition of right inferior lobe hypoattenuating lesion, concerning for metastasis.
Dilated loops of small bowel with questionable transition zone within left lower quadrant.
Likely represents partial small bowel obstruction, coorelation with clinical symptoms suggested   Brief Hospital Course: Upon arrival to the ED the pt was noted to be hypertensive.
He had no hemoptysis and was hemodynamically stable, so he was transferred to the oncology service.
He coughed up [**1-5**] cups of bright red blood over the course of 5 minutes.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had further small amounts a hemoptysis.
He was electively intubated (R mainstem intubation to avoid the bleeding area) and a bronch was done, revealing a L mainstem bronch clot with sorrounding blood oozing.
During transfer, pt had several episodes of hypotension requiring levophed.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **], bronchoscopy with ablation of bleeding lingula.
later, recurrent bleeding post procedure and elevated BP requiring labetalol.
Post-extubation c/b emesis, NGT was placed, KUB showed no evidence of obstruction.
He was also on Labetalol drip for HTN until [**11-6**] then transition to BB PO.
He did have e/o obstruction on later KUB and he was not able to take pos, for which he required 2 dys of NPO.
Pneumonia: patient with fevers and leukocytosis and was treated for a 7d course of zosyn/vanco for post-obstructive PNA.
