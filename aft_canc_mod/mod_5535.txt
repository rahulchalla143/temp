Admission Date:  [**2188-3-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-9-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP Exploratory Laparotomy Revision Roux Limb Entero-enterostomy x 2 Repair of Abdominal Wall, Wound Dehiscence PICC line VAC   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 57203**] is a 50 yo male with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who p/w fever and elevated bilirubin level.
He tells us he had a temperature last Wed of 102.4 along with a sinus headache with no other associated symptoms.
He has had recurrent episodes of dry heaves which he attributes to the chemotherapy.
He has had alternating constipation and diarrhea recently.
He denies any abdominal pain.
Chronic low back pain .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He was in his usual state of health until [**10/2186**] when he experienced the onset of headache with associated diarrhea, chalky-white stools, sinus tenderness, nausea, and dark urine.
Ultrasound followed by CT scan showed a soft tissue mass at the confluence of biliary duct.
ERCP and MRCP showed dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct, which extended from the common hepatic duct to the bifurcation.
This presentation was felt to be most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
Pathology revealed no positive lymph nodes, 10 were sampled.
The procedure was uncomplicated with the exception of a bilateral chylous pleural effusion.
He had multiple PET/CT scans, which showed stable appearance of pulmonary nodules that were not FDG avid.
However, his most recent PET scan showed findings that were consistent with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and local site recurrence in the surgical bed.
In light of disease recurrence in this young patient, it was decided to proceed with treatment and he was started on a clinical trial 05-349 and received bevacizumab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin.
Both his parents are alive; however, his mom has had myocardial infarction and is obese.
His paternal grandfather died of a myocardial infarction.
His paternal grandmother died of myocardial infarction.
His maternal grandfather of died of MI and his maternal grandmother is still alive with [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease and is currently age 86.
Physical Exam: GENERAL:  No apparent distress.
No icterus, no tonsillar erythema or exudate.
No lymphadenopathy, no JVD, no thyromegaly.
Decreased breath sounds, right base.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no palpable masses.
Well-healed midline scar from umbilicus to epigastrium.
Mild tenderness to palpation along the scar.
No RUQ tenderness No splenomegaly EXTREMITIES:  Warm, well perfused.
No lower extremity edema, no calf tenderness.
Afferent loop syndrome with dilatation of the afferent loop up to 4.4 cm until a transition point at the Roux-en-Y anastomosis.
This obstruction may be due to stricture/inflammation at the anastomotic site or adhesions from prior surgery.
Stable appearance to multiple post-surgical changes including ill-defined soft tissue in the surgical bed and nodularity along the mid anterior abdominal wall.
Perirectal soft tissue prominence most likely due to lack of distention.
Stable small right pleural effusion and right lower lobe soft tissue lesion.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2188-4-30**] 10:42 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 50 year old man s/p entero-enterostomy X 2 and s/p wound exploration and re-closure with retention sutures SUPINE AND ERECT ABDOMEN: No abnormally dilated loops of bowel are seen and gas is noted throughout much of the colon with gas and stool in the rectum.
Multiple nonspecific small bowel air fluid levels are identified on the decubitus view.
There is no evidence of free air.
IMPRESSION: Multiple small bowel air fluid levels may suggest ileus without evidence of obstruction.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
New, widespread multifocal dense ground-glass opacities, predominantly within the right lung.
While this appearance could be consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema, no secondary sign of volume overload is seen.
Infectious processes should be considered, including bacterial pneumomonia as well as opportunistic pathogens such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this patient receiving chemotherapy.
Unchanged appearance of the anterior abdominal wall, with abnormalities related to previous wound dehiscence, and continued evidence of small foci of air, fluid, and abnormally enhancing tissue, which may represent inflammatory change or, possibly, metastatic seeding of incision tract.
Diffuse anasarca, ascites, and small right pleural effusion.
Interval resolution of previous small-bowel obstruction.
Anasarca, ascites, and massive scrotal edema.
Moderate right pleural effusion with interval increase in size.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 57203**] is a 50 yo male with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who presents with fevers and elevated bilirubin .
1) Hyperbilirubinemia:  Concerning for biliary obstruction due to stricture vs. tumor progression.
Fevers and elevated WBC (11.5 today, up for ~5 previously) raises concern for ascending cholangitis; will start Zosyn empirically.
2) Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: He is currently enrolled in Phase II trial of Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin in combination with Bevacizumab, protocol #05-349.
- Hold further chemotherapy until acute illness resolved - Anti-emetics PRN .
3) Pain control: Continue his current regimen of Oxycontin 30 mg qAM.
Will discontinue PRN vicodin given the acetaminophen component in the setting of elevated transaminases.
After getting his pain under control, he was doing quite well and able to get up and ambulate.
After the take back to the OR, he continued to use his PCA for pain control.
We consulted Chronic Pain and we added Tizantidine 4 tid and then transitioned him to PO Dilaudid.
His Post-operative course was complicated by a wound dehiscence requiring a return to the OR for abdominal wound repair.
On Friday evening, he began gushing salmon colored fluid from his drain and required take back to the OR on [**4-5**] for wound exploration and re-closure with retention sutures.
He was not looking good and we discussed code status with the patient and his wife given his metastatic cancer and abitlity to recover from this event.
He receive PRBC for his blood loss anemia.
The wound was held together with retention sutures and several staples were removed and the site was packed with gauze.
His abdomen was likely not going to heal with the widespread cancer in his abdomen.
Pneumonia: The CT showed no evidence of a PE, but he likely aspirated and developed multifocal pneumonia: RUL, RML, LUL.
Centrilobular ground glass appearance suggestive of atypical infection.
Micro: [**4-16**] Abd wound: coag neg staph - sparse; ANAEROBIC: BACTEROIDES FRAGILIS - mod, beta lact positive 5/26,[**4-21**] Sput: sparse yeast [**4-24**]: Extubated, 6  [**4-18**]: Bronched; hypotension responsive to fluid boluses (x2) [**4-20**]: tube feeds started, JP fluid replaced 1/2 cc:cc [**4-23**]: TF w/ 1.5g protein, 30 kcal/kg; TPN stopped [**4-24**] Extubated [**4-25**] : passed speech and swallow  He remained in the ICU for several days and made it out to the floor on [**2188-4-27**].
Pain Management: Palative care was consulted for help with pain manageent.
A KUB was ordered and showed air fluid levels suggestive of an ileus.
He had slightly less distension and reported +BM and +flatus.
He was having some fluid drainage near the inferior portion of the wound.
He continued to have near 2 liters of clear, ascitic fluid draining from the wound.
VAC changes required Aquacell dressing under each retention suture, Adaptic dressing covering each retention suture, Adaptic dressing within the opening against the fascia, stoma adhesive around the inferior midline  site and around the drain site in the LLQ.
Hypovolemia: He was requiring Albumin for low vascular volume and for his ascities.
Edema: He had +[**12-29**] lower extremity edema and excessive scrotal swelling.
