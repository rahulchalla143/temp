Possible small right pleural effusion.
Increased size of the bilateral axillary lymph nodes, right paratracheal lymph node, and prevascular mediastinal mass, highly concerning for progression of disease.
Interval development of upper lobe predominant multifocal patchy ground-glass and heterogeneous airspace opacities with a central/paramediastinal distribution.
Findings may be related to an infection/inflammatory process; however, a neoplastic process cannot be excluded in this patient with peritoneal carcinoma and other findings of disease progression in the chest.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation is likely related to subsegmental/compressive atelectasis from bilateral pleural effusions which are enlarged since the prior exam.
However, underlying infection is difficult to exclude.
Continued thickening of the gastroesophageal junction is poorly evaluated in the absence of enteric contrast.
Comminuted fracture involving the right proximal humerus with mild angulation and displacement may be pathologic.
Sclerotic focus in the midthoracic spine would be better evaluated with bone scan to decipher malignant potential.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-8-26**], no major change.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Redemonstration of hypoechoic hepatic lesions consistent with metastases.
Moderate ascites.

# Goals of care: Patient became increasingly volume overloaded and dyspneic after arrival to floor.
Diuresis was attempted without success (see below) due to acute kidney failure.
Given progressive cancer on imaging and poor overall prognosis, goals of care were discussed with the family and the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.
#Hypotension- Likely sepsis with catheter associated cellulitis as source with element of volume depletion.
In the MICU patient was in no acute distress.
Obtained blood, peritoneal, and urine cultures which showed no growth.
#Anion Gap acidosis: likely from lactic acidosis due to dehyrdation/potential sepsis and concurrent acute renal failure.
Anion gap only 10 but albumin is 2.0 and there elevated anion gap acidosis.
#Dyspnea: denied dyspnea on arrival to MICU.
No known history of heart failure though mild pulm edema seen on CXR.
No chest pain or orthopnea.
No pericardial effusion seen in ED on ultrasound.
Obtained TTE for full eval of cardiac function in setting of new effusion and low voltage EKG (new finding this admission).
TTE showed normal EF, trivial pericardial effusion, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Also obtained CT chest non-con to eval new pleural effusion in setting of malignancy.
CT chest showed increased lymphadenopathy concerning for cancer progression, enlarging pleural effusions and possible pathologic fracture of right humerus.
She became increasingly dyspneic throughout her hospitalization, which was attributed to volume overload  #ARF: likely due to hypotension .
#Primary Metastatic Peritoneal Carcinoma- s/p Topotecan late [**2155-6-8**].
#Nausea/vomiting/decreased p.o intake- the patient endorses early satiety and 3-5 episodes of small vomiting.
Likely related to ascites pressure from malignant ascites and slowing of gastric motility.
Reassuring patient is having bowel movements making ileus or obstruction less likely.
Patient denied frank diarrhea and gastroenteritis/c.diff less likely.
