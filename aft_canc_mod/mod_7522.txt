P-R interval prolongation.
Possible left atrial abnormality.
Since the previous tracing of [**2181-12-5**] the rate is faster, the QRS width is less and right bundle-branch block is no longer seen.

The cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates normal heart size with mild atherosclerotic calcification seen within the aortic knob.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mildly dilated aortic root.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 year old male with history of non-sustained VT status-post attempt at ablation, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, who was transferred from OSH for symptomatic NSVT.
Ventricular Tachycardia:  Patient has history of symptomatic Non-Sustained VT at OSH with similar presentations in the past.
Likely focus of VT was thought to be LVOT given axis of VPCs on ECG.
He had an episode of Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia on presentation to the CCU, at which time he self converted back to NSR and was given an amiodarone load of 150mg IV.
Patient did not have any further episodes of VT when observed in the ICU for 24hours post procedure.
He was sent home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts event monitor.
# DM: In past, patient has been maintained on his Byetta because of concern for being hypoglycemic with insulin, and his sugars were elevated in the 200s.
# Prostate Cancer/BPH: Continued finasteride, terazosin, bicaluthamide.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital because you were having an abnormal heart rhythm which would come and go occasionally that was concerning.
You were taken to the Electrophysiology Lab with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to try to ablate some of the cardiac tissue that might have been contributing to your abnormal rhythm.
Unfortunately, the parts of cardiac tissue contributing to your abnormal heart rhythm could not be completely ablated because it was too close to your coronary arteries and there was a lot of calcification around the area.
You did not have any further episodes of the abnormal rhythm in the next 24 hours while being monitored in the ICU.
You will be sent home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor which will be further explained to you before leaving the hospital.
Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms concerning to you.
