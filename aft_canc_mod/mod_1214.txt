His flank pain began suddenly while driving home from Foxwoods casino.
CT abdomen at OSH revealed right perinephric hematoma with contrast extravasation.
Past Medical History: Atrial Fibrillation: s/p DC cardioversion [**2118**], found to be back in asymptomatic afib on routine visit [**2121-10-2**], s/p cardioversion [**2121-10-17**], found to be in afib again, now s/p repeat cardioversion ([**2121-12-17**]) CAD singel vessel s/p circumflex stenting [**2114**] CHF/cardiomyopathy (global hypokinesis, EF 40-50%) HTN Prostate cancer, s/p radical prostatectomy [**2114**] MVA with scapular and rib fractures [**2103**] ?

Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: 99.2, 144/72, 73, 22, 97% RA GEN: NAD HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, sclera anicteric, OP clear, MMM, no LAD, no carotid bruits.
PULM: decreased breath sounds RLL, otherwise CTAB, no r/r/w.
ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS, no HSM.
Right perinephric collection with signal characteristics consistent with hemorrhage.
A short-term followup examination is recommended to assess resolution of the perinephric fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: ## perinehpric hematoma CT abdomen at OSH revealed right perinephric hematoma with contrast extravasation.
repeat NG lavage afterwards, upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], was negative (few clots, no bleeding).
MRI of the abdomen suggested cause of perinephric bleed to be due to an angiomyolipoma.
# GIB He initially presented with coffee ground emesis which cleared with NG lavage and was hemodynamically stable.
## atrial fibrillation On first transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was initially in afib with RVR.
Upper endoscopy was deferred at that time due to pt's increasing O2 requirement (due to RLL pneumonia) as well as Afib.
He did not require TEE prior to the electrical cardioversions because episodes of Afib lasted less than 48 hours.
His pnuemonia is being treated with Ceftriaxone.
## hypoxia The patient was noted to develop an oxygen requirement while in afib.
His hypoxia was felt to likely be from afib, although a contribution from pneumonia was also considered.
He was started on ceftriaxone on [**12-24**] for focal opacity seen on CXR.
