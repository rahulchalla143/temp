Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital3 709**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 8**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 11059**] care on [**2142-1-6**] for complaints of a duodenal mass and upper GI bleeding requiring large volumes of blood although he was hemodynamically stable at transfer.
Although, there was not an obvious mass on the CT scan, a decision was made to take the patient to the operating room, given his active bleed and endoscopic pictures describing a well-circumscribed, polypoid intraluminal mass in the distal duodenum.
Because there was also a 2x2.5 cm right iliac artery aneurysm on the CT scan, Vascular Surgery was consulted.
He had been afebrile with stable vitals, producing good urine output and flatus.
