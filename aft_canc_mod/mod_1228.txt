Admission Date:  [**2120-1-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-2-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2068-6-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea and vomiting.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma and chest plasmacytoma (status post radiation therapy approximately two weeks ago) who now presents with nausea, vomiting, decided oral intake, and chest pressure.
The chest pressure is not exertional, it is not new, and is presumably secondary to the large retrosternal plasmacytoma.
The patient has had nausea and vomiting for the two weeks prior to admission, and he describes his vomitus as black with chunks, and his stool as dark.
He also complained of early satiety, orthopnea, and a persistent cough.
The patient described some shortness of breath related to this full feeling in his chest.
Of note, he had a repeat chest computed tomography prior to admission which revealed a decreased size of the retrosternal mass, a thickened pericardium, and thickened wall of the stomach to 6.1 cm.
He had no pulsus paradoxus, and he was mentating well.
Multiple myeloma and chest wall plasmacytoma diagnosed in [**Country 5881**] in [**2117-11-5**] where it was initially treated in [**2119-8-6**] with .................... and prednisone.
The patient did have a large 18-cm X 17-cm plasmacytoma extending from the inferior portion of the sternum to the inferior peritoneum.
This mass was concerning for advancement to the pericardium, left hepatic lobe, and anterior stomach wall.
The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma (which has never required intubations in the past).
He has a question of diabetes; given that he had elevated blood sugars while on dexamethasone.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary examination revealed no crackles.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His complete blood count on admission showed white blood cell count was 4, hematocrit was 30.6, and an elevated neutrophil and band count.
PLASMACYTOMA ISSUES:  The patient initially was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit to prevent any further drop in his hematocrit or any further episodes of hematemesis or bright red blood per rectum.
These initially showed a cardiac ulcer with granulation tissue, but no tumor.
Therefore, the patient had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed.
The second esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed hyperplasia and mild regeneration of the gastric pit.
No neoplasm was seen in this sample.
Considering the gross appearance, the lesion was thought to represent either an inflammatory or hypoplastic polyp.
There was also possibly an underlying lesion of the gastric wall.
The third biopsy was performed with ultrasound guidance which was not available at the time of discharge; however, it suggested fungal elements with possible lymphocytes consistent with plasmacytoma.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  Otherwise, in terms of gastrointestinal issues, the patient continued to have guaiac-positive stools for the first few days of his hospitalization; however, these normalized.
He experienced constipation and was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen.
MUSCULOSKELETAL ISSUES:  His left arm had severe pain on admission; requiring an increase in his OxyContin dose to approximately 60 mg p.o.
The patient was seen by the Orthopaedic Surgery Service, and plain films were obtained which suggested a left humeral fracture and a thrombolytic lesion.
This thrombolytic lesion appeared to impinge on the ulnar nerve (according to a computed tomography scan which was performed).
Radiology/Oncology treated the thrombolytic lesion in the humerus for a few days prior to discharge.
They set up outpatient appointments as well for the patient.
Otherwise, the patient also experienced some left hip pain; for which plain films were obtained, suggesting a thrombolytic lesion in the proximal femur.
As well, the patient had some radial and medial nerve damage; according to an electromyogram which was performed while he was in house.
This possibly suggested a brachial plexus nerve route injury, and a magnetic resonance imaging was attempted.
Anesthesia was consulted, and the patient was to return on [**2120-2-15**] for a magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and left arm under anesthesia.
