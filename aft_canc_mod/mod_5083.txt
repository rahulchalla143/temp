History of Present Illness: 27 yo M with a past medical history of metastatic melanoma with diffuse lymphatic spread, a recent history of a jejunal lesion, now here with large volume hematemesis with clots.
He has never had bleeding from above before, only LGIB.
He also has noted sputum production that was slightly pink tinged in the past week in the setting of recent imaging showing thickening of his nasopharyngeal soft tissue.
He denies abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath.

Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname 24344**] was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2174**] when he underwent a shave biopsy for an at least 2.6 mm thick and at least [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level 4 melanoma with focal ulceration and 12 mitosis per high-powered field on the back of his right calf.
Both sentinel lymph node biopsies in the inguinal area showed evidence of microscopic involvement of melanoma.
He underwent completion lymph node dissection, which showed no residual melanoma in the remaining lymph nodes.
He developed recurrence in his right thigh in [**11/2177**], which was confirmed by a fine needle aspiration.
CT showed right pelvic adenopathy and a biopsy showed evidence of melanoma.
He underwent resection of the right thigh mass confirming melanoma and a right pelvic node dissection with no melanoma found in 5 nodes.
A follow up PET/CT showed a 2.8-cm mass in the right pelvis with biopsy being remarkable for residual melanoma.
Pathology revealed melanoma in 1 lymph node, which was 2.5 mm in diameter with extensive parenchymal involvement with minimal extracapsular extension within adjacent blood vessels.
Follow-up CT showed extensive mesenteric adenopathy.
He did well until [**10-1**] when a CT and MRI showed a 2.5 cm mesenteric root mass.
He underwent an exploratory laparotomy with resection the metastatic lesion from intestinal mesentery on [**2179-10-14**].
Routine F/U PET-CT on [**2180-5-2**] revealed disease recurrence in the cervical, supraclavicular and right paracaval regions.
He began the compassionate use ipilimumab protocol on [**2180-5-23**] with evidence of disease progression in [**2180-10-25**] with a new jejunal metastasis and anemia noted.
He received his first cycle of dacarbazine on [**2181-3-23**] with significant nausea and vomiting noted as well as a fever prompting hospital admission on [**2181-4-8**].
He is awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Melanoma (see above).
*T3B N1A invasive melanoma of the right calf treated w/high-dose interleukin-2, finishing in [**2178-7-25**] and complicated by hypothryroidism and portal vein thrombosis and then compassionate use Ipilipimab protocol on [**5-2**].
Past Surgical History: Wide excision right calf [**6-/2174**] Right groin dissection [**7-/2174**] Pelvic Node dissection, right thigh lesion [**12/2177**] Right pelvic node dissection [**2-/2178**] Exploratory laparotomy and resection of mass at the root of proximal small bowel mesentery [**9-/2179**]  Social History: He works as an administrator at [**Hospital3 1810**].
OP with evidence of ulceration on EGD, no thrush.

CXR [**2181-5-1**]: In comparison with study of [**4-8**], there is no interval change.
Specifically, no evidence of pneumonia or parenchymal nodule.
Brief Hospital Course: 27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume hematemesis.
EGD done upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway; that being said, there was a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of the bleed at this time.
More concerning, however, is the marked progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**].
A posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
On night of [**2181-5-1**] he spiked a fever and blood cultures were drawn.
After radiation oncology planning and first treatment on [**2181-5-2**], patient received a IR embolization of bilat spheno-palantine branches of maxillary artery without sequelae.
He remained in the MICU overnight on [**2181-5-2**] for monitoring, received boluses for low UOP, but was otherwise stable.
Leukocytosis / Fever - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17265**] for severe nausea.
The microbiologic data was negative at the time of dischage without any signs of infection clincaly.
Hyponatremia - Most likely secondary to dehydration.
Tachycardia - Sinus tachycardia on admission, secondary to bleeding and hypovolemia.
Metastatic Melanoma - currently travelling to [**Location (un) 5622**] to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5850**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial.
He is awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility.
