But over the past few months had developed decreased PO intake, weight loss and progressive scleral icterus.
There, he had many imaging studies, including an MRCP which documents a mid CBD stricture.
Additionally, his MRI from the OSH documents mild to mod ascites and a small R sided pleural effusion.
Was initially transferred to the floor on [**2193-7-22**] but developed hematemesis x 2, then transferred to the ICU.
There, he had no further episodes of UGIB and went to IR for PTC.
His gastric biopsy returned positive for gastritis and + H pylori, and triple therapy was initiated.
He has been afebrile, no chills, or nightsweats.
He feels that his jaundice has improved since insertion of the biliary drain.
Also is complaining of back pain and reports that he has not had a BM after his tap water and mineral oil enema.

[**7-25**]: CXR bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette  Most recent CXR: [**8-3**]: PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**2193-7-29**].
Bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged with no evidence of increase in the pleural effusion or consolidation, but definitely bibasilar opacities might represent infectious process.
There is no pneumothorax.
IR Biliary dilatation: Preliminary Report: Percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatation of orifice of left main duct and orifice of right posterior duct via transhepatic access in right anterior duct.
This was followed by dilatation and stenting of patient's known occlusive upper common bile duct stricture with a 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent, which extends through the ampulla.
Highly atypical glandular epithelial cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Chronic active gastritis.
[**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain is positive for bacteria morphologically consistent with H. pylori.
No pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Stable thoracic aortic aneurysm without focal area of dilation as depicted above.
Bilateral pleural effusions and consequent consolidations.
Correlate for possible reflux and out of concern for potential aspiration-risk.

Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 yo male with a history of poorly differentiated gastric cancer who developed jaundice secondary to biliary stricture.
Stricture results with atypical glandular cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Interventional Radiology would like to see pt back as an outpatient for cholangiogram and reevaluation of biliary stent/drain.
* Likely recurrent Gastric Cancer: s/p Bilroth II.
Gastric biopsies were taken during ERCP at the suture line of the gastric mucosa, and noted to be chronic active gastritis and findings c/w h pylori.
Biopsy results showed chronic gastritis, despite suspicious appearance on EGD.
However, as above stricture brushings was malignant with atypical glandular cells.
* Hematemesis: 2 episodes of 100cc of hematemesis were noted following the patient's ERCP.
It is thought that his bleeding was secondary to the biopsy site, from his gastritis or esophagitis.
* Nausea and vomiting: He had persistent nausea and vomiting early morning [**8-2**].
He had a recent chest CT scan that showed a fluid filled esophagus.
His nausea and vomiting subsequently resolved with treatment with zofran and did not recur.
* Hypoxia:  This is likely [**12-24**] to his bilateral pleural effusions and may have some contribution from ascites.
Given progressive hypoxia and concern for aspiration, he underwent a chest CT which showed primarily bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis.
* Urinary obstruction: on morning of [**8-3**], patient noted difficulty urinating, and pt was bladder scanned with finding >500 cc.

You did not need to get transfused and your bleeding stabilized.
You were found to have likely cancer causing the blockage.
If elevated bilirubin, external drain can be reconnected to bag drainage.
