Moderate pulmonary edema, asymmetrically worse on the right side.
Bibasilar and retrocardiac opacity, could reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
Suggestion of a nodular opacity in the RUL, could represent confluent edema, repeat imaging after diuresis to exclude an underlying pathology is recommended .
Shoulder [**3-12**] -  A single, portable view is presented that is extremely difficult to interpret due to scattered radiation secondary to the size of the patient.
No gross abnormality on this extremely limited study.
Brief Hospital Course: 65F with OSA, COPD, Pulmonary HTN and diastolic CHF who presents with respiratory distress.
# Respiratory Distress - Likely COPD flair v flash pulmonary edema in setting of diastolic CHF.
#  CHF - EF from [**Hospital1 2177**] from [**2-6**] shows preserved EF, dysfunction likely diastolic.
#  Diabetes - Type I Continued long-acting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] plus sliding scale .
#  Anemia - Epo dependent , receives qSaturday.
#  Hyperlipidemia - Continued statin .
#  R Shoulder Pain - chronic per patient, unable to lift arm.
Plain films difficult to interpret due to body habitus.
#  Anti-coag - Patient on fondaparinux.
OSH records reveals no history of HIT but no heparing products given.
Spaced out fondaparinux in setting of renal failure to q48h.
#  Right Heel Ulcer - Wound care per nursing.
