Legionella PNA: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after presenting to ER with hypoxia hypotension.
Chest Xray and CT showed extensive pneumonia.
Antiobiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin after bronchial washings and urine were positive for legionella.
Leukocytosis: Patient with impressive leukocytosis during admission, peaking at 53.7 on [**10-3**].
Suspect due to infection and effect of neulasta following chemotherapy.
Etiology was originally attributed to acute phase reactant due to PNA and malignancy.
Iron studies were suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation.
However, due to suspicion of iron deficiency driving thrombocytosis, patient was treated with IV iron and transfused another unit pRBCs.
Patient noted to have a rash the day prior to discharge, c/w with drug rash, unclear if related to prior [**Name (NI) **] or iron.
# LE Edema: Following aggressive fluid ressucitation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient developed impressive bilateral LE edema.
HTN: Home BP medications were held during hospitalization due to sepsis and hypotension.
Upon transfer to floor, patient remained normotensive without treatment.
