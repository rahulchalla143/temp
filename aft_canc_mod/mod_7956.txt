Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
secondary to dyskinesis of the interventricular septum, and severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior and infero-lateral walls.
The apex and mid-distal lateral wall contract best.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
WOUND CULTURES - pending  Brief Hospital Course: 69 YOF with AVR/MVR and CABG with subsequent trach in [**2172-11-7**], NHL s/p splenectomy who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with a right lower leg hematoma after she struck her leg a couple weeks ago.
# Hematoma: This was debrided in the emergency room and found to have blood and clots, but no pus.
Started on vancomycin and zosyn for concern of infection, but given the lack of systemic symptoms this is unlikely.
Daily wound changes with wick placement were required and should continue in rehab.
# Fluid overload: Increase in right pleural effusion and anasarca concerning for some fluid overload.
Her lasix was increased to 60mg IV BID in an attempt to mobilize some fluid given her poor forward flow.
