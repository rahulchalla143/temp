Admission Date:  [**2160-12-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-12-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2096-12-22**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage III, grade 3 papillary serous ovarian cancer (status post paclitaxel and carboplatin, Taxotere, Doxil, monthly Taxol, gemcitabine, and Topotecan weekly x2 cycles), who has been in the Bahamas in the past two months receiving immuno-augmentive therapy.
Per report, she did relatively well until [**12-7**], when she developed nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status, and subsequently fell.
She was ultimately flown back to [**Location (un) 86**] on the day of admission, and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where she was confused and minimally responsive.
She was hypotensive and started on dopamine.
She was hypoxic and intubated for airway protection as well as hypoxia; she also reportedly had periods of apnea.
Ovarian cancer as above.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Viral encephalitis.
Neck lipoma excision.
She had conjunctival edema, reactive pupils bilaterally.
Her heart rate was tachycardic, there are normal S1, S2 heart sounds, and there is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium.
She had bronchial breath sounds at the left base, otherwise her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her abdomen was firm, distended, there were hypoactive bowel sounds, and a fluid wave was palpable.
There was 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.
She was moving her extremities purposely, and not responding to verbal or tactile stimuli.
Diagnostic paracentesis was consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; peritoneal fluid Gram stain demonstrated 2+ polys, but no organisms.
Initial CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated a large left sided pleural effusion, moderate right sided pleural effusion, bibasilar compressive atelectasis, interval enlargement of left sided axillary nodes, diffuse distention of multiple bowel loops, with the majority of the small bowel dilated and fluid filled, right sided colonic distention with air and fluid, ascites, and a soft tissue mass in the mid-transverse colon leading to relative decrease in the caliber of the remaining large bowel with air in the left sided colon and rectum.
Overall, there was significant worsening of omental disease with scalloping of the liver margin and falciform ligament as well as new amorphous mass growing into the porta hepatis and compressing the IVC and portal vein.
Head CT demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
She was found to be in florid septic shock.
She was initially aggressively resuscitated with multiple pressors to support her blood pressure as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics for her peritonitis.
Nearly immediately following her transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, it became clear that the patient's chances of surviving her acute illness were essentially zero.
Within 15 minutes of the withdraw of pressors, the patient became hypotensive and subsequently asystolic.
Septic shock.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Hypoxic ventilatory failure.
Coagulopathy in the setting of sepsis and DIC.
Anemia of chronic inflammation.
Blood loss anemia.
