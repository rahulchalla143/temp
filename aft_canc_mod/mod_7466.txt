Decompressive laparotomy.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 89862**] is a 67 man  s/p radical prostatectomy, whose post op course was complicated by PEA arrested on floor on POD 1.
He was transferred to MICU for further management, started on IV heparin and TPA for presumptive pulmonary embolism.
He was hypotensive and received multiple liters of IVF for resuscitation.
The then developed abdominal distension, oliguira and reduced pedal pulses, elevated peak pressures and elevated bladder pressures.
Foley catheter in place draining yellow urine--secured in place at medial thigh lower left extremity with flexed left knee and decreased plantar flexion (approx [**3-15**] vs [**4-14**] on right).
No gross peripheral edema, pitting edema at bilateral lower extremities.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..  Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old male with diagnosis of prostate cancer, s/p prostatectomy, post-op course c/b by PEA arrest [**1-13**] presumed pulmonary embolus, profound hypotension, multi-system failure, post-operative hematoma, increasing abdominal distension requiring emergent laparatomy  Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the Urology service in the setting of s/p radical retropubic prostatectomy c/b POD#1 PEA arrest, thought to be [**1-13**] to PE, for which the patient was given tPA and started on a heparin drip.
Patient's course was complicated by hypotension (MAPs 50s), requiring frequent fluid boluses (26L over 2d course) as well as levophed and neosynephrine.
He became acutely anemic (10pt drop in 12hrs) and was found to have 16cm hematoma at his operative drain site without signs of intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeds.
ICU stay also c/b ARF (thought to be [**1-13**] to ACS), w rising creatinine and worsening acidosis, requiring bicarbonate drip.
On POD#3, patient was noted to have worsening abdominal distenion.
On [**4-9**], bedside cystogram showed disruption of the bladder anastamosis.
On [**4-11**] the patient went back to the OR for washout and placement of [**State **] patch by ACS, IVC filter placement, and urethrovesicular anastamosis by urology.
On [**4-12**], the white count was elevated and there was concern for possible VAP so a Bronch/BAL was performed and showed no purulent secretions.
On [**4-13**] the HD line was replaced as it was no longer working.
On [**4-14**] the patient went back to the OR for abdominal closure with mesh.
On [**4-17**], he was tolerating a regular diet and TF were held for copious diarrhea.
He was noted to have LLE weakness and proprioceptive deficit for which neurology was reconsulted.
He was maintained on telemetry in sinus tachycardia throughout his stay on the floor.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: NEUROLOGIC: Post-op, patient did well initially with pain controlled with IV morphine PCA.
On POD#1, pt got out of bed for first walk, c/o acute SOB/dizziness and collapsed with PEA cardiopulmonary arrest.
Post-code CT scan included a CT of the head, which showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage but a possible early acute infarction in the left frontal lobe.
After extubation, pt was comfortable with minimal pain medications.
He was noted to have decreased LLE strength and proprioception for which neurology re-consult was requested.
?tiny subacute infarct in the left posterior parietal lobe with no evidence of an acute intracranial infarction or hemorrhage.
Intracranial and cervical arterial vasculature does not demonstrate evidence of significant flow limiting stenosis, aneurysm or vascular malformation.
MRI T/L-Spine: No evidence for cord ischemia.
Mild lumbar spondylotic changes.
Heterogeneous marrow which could represent chronic anemia or other infiltrative disorders.
Neurology initially requested EMG of LLE for prognostic purposes, however this was deferred by the patient, as it would not have changed his management.
Neurology felt that his LLE deficits were consistent with root/plexus injury from compression due to hematoma, and that his prognosis was excellent with regard to recoverable function.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Initially post-operatively, his cardiac function was excellent without issues.
On POD#1, after he got out of bed to ambulate for the first time, he suddenly became dizzy and SOB and collapsed (witnessed by RN and family).
He was initially noted to be in PEA cardiac arrest and was pulseless for approximately 7 minutes.
He was noted to have continued hypotension requiring pressors, and shortly after transfer to the ICU, he became pulseless again.
?dilated hypocontractile right ventricle with small hyperdynamic left ventricle (these findings are consistent with acute pulmonary embolism or isolated right ventricular infarction with major hemodynamic compromise).
Multifocal segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving all lobes with CT findings suggestive of right ventricular strain.
Multifocal dependent pulmonary opacities with dense consolidation of the left lower lobe likely related to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
Trace amount of simple free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis with post-surgical changes from prior prostatectomy noted.
Soft tissue induration and edema noted from the right groin extending into the right thigh subcuatenous tissues and rectus femoris is most consistent with hematoma from recent line placement.
Venous aneurysms/varix involving the left common femoral vein and deep femoral vein with nidus of vessels noted within the mid left thigh highly suggestive of an underlying venous malformation.
Slit-like appearance to portions of the IVC may suggest underlying volume depletion or increased intrabdominal pressure.
Probable mixing artifact (non-occlusive clot is felt to be less likely) in the left saphaneous, DFV and SFV.
Mildly displaced mid sternal and right/left anterior rib fractures presumably related to resuscitative efforts.
Small adjacent anterior mediastinal hematoma.
After Chest CT confirmed bilateral Pulmonary Emboli, it was felt that despite the patient being in the immediate post-op period, he would likely not survive without drastic attempts at clot lysis.
This was felt to be from a retroperitoneal bleed around the surgical site.
The Acute Surgery Service was consulted, and felt that he likely had abdominal compartment syndrome for which he underwent emergent decompressive laparotomy.
During the post-op/post-extubation period, he was noted to be tachycardic and hypertensive, for which oral metoprolol 25mg TID was initiated.
His hypertension was felt to be secondary to his renal failure and was followed by the nephrology team.
PULMONARY: Per above, the patient sustained a cardiac arrest likely secondary to large pulmonary embolus.
CT of the chest post-code and intubation is detailed above and showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.
He was given systemic TPA for clot lysis after PE was found on his CT scan.
After his abdomen was closed, he was extubated and did well from a respiratory standpoint.
CT scan of Abd/Pelvis after TPA noted: ?????
?Large midline hematoma seen involving the rectus sheath and the adjacent anterior abdominal wall around the drain insertion site as described.
As compared to the prior CT scan, there is increase in the extent of bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusion and intraperitoneal free fluid.
There is increased subcutaneous abdominal and chest wall edema??????.
Attempts at fluid resuscitation failed to improve his blood pressure, and his abdomen was noted to become more distended and tight with bladder pressures increasing to the mid 60??????s.
ACS team consulted due to concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
Several attempts made to close abdomen, but initially unable due to massive generalized edema.
CRRT initiated due to anuria and large amounts of fluid removed daily at rate of about 200-400 cc/hr.
Eventually, abdomen closed with large prolene mesh on [**2196-4-14**], as unable to bring rectus muscles back together.
Once abdomen closed, NGT placed and tube feeds continued until patient passed speech and swallow eval.
RENAL: After his cardiac arrest, the patient became anuric likely felt to be a result of ATN secondary to hypovolemia, increased intraabdominal pressures, and systemic shock.
Once his BP stabilized and pt able to tolerate fluid removal, he had a large amount of fluid removed with approximately 2-3 liters of fluid per day removed.
He was closely followed by the nephrology team, who felt that he had an excellent prognosis with regard to recovery of his renal function.
After thrombolysis was carried out, he had a retroperitoneal bleed likely from the surgical bed.
The urethra was re-repaired, although there was a urine leak noted at the time of closure.
Repeated creatinine values taken from the pelvic drain fluid showed a creatinine value consistent with serous fluid and NOT urine.
A portable cystogram performed on the day of discharge did show a presumed urine leak after instillation of around 60 cc of cystograffin.
HEMATOLOGY: During his initial surgery (prostatectomy), the patient was noted to have a very large and dilated left external iliac vein at the time of his lymph node dissection.
During an abdominal washout procedure, he had a retrievable IVC filter placed by the ACS team ([**4-11**]).
At the time of discharge, his INR was slightly sub-therapeutic at 1.8.
He was given perioperative infection prophylaxis for his procedures.
During his ICU stay, his foley was noted to have yeast growing in the tubing, for which a urine Cx was sent, which was positive for yeast.
His WBC was noted to be quite elevated in the mid 30?????
On the day of discharge, he was noted to have malodorous urine during cystogram, so urine sent for culture and pt started on renally-dosed ciprofloxacin for 3 days and fluconazole for 3 days.
