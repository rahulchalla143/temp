Pt also endorsed light headedness and dizziness for several days since chemo.
Denies any CP until morning of admit when he had episode of SSCP that lasted "seconds", relieved by nitro.
CXR showed worsening pulm congestion with possible right sided PNA.
EKG showed NSR, 1st degree AV block, NA w Q in III and aVF and STD I aVL and slight ST elevation in II and aVF, TWI V1-V3.
He was initially admitted to the floor, where he was noted on arrival to be in mild repiratory distress.
Given that the working diagnosis was volume overload, he was given 20 mg of IV lasix with a resulting drop in blood pressure to 80's systolic.
Review of systems at the time of admisison was notable for increasing DOE x 1 week.
Denies any blood in stool or dark tarry stools.
Has not had any coughing, no nausea or vomiting, no fevers or chills.
No dysuria or rashes.
No abd pain.

Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer on clinical trial drug a past history of CAD, CHF EF 45%, anemia, presenting with fatigue and DOE x 1 week, now with hypotension and hypoxia.
Hypoxia:  His CXR showed volume overload.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative thus making an ischemic event unlikely.
However, he subsequently developed increasing oxygen requirement, recurrent crackles, and hypoxia without elevated JVP or peripheral edema.
CXR was again suggestive of pulmonary edema.
Given erratic hypoxia, pulmonary artery hypertension on echo, and recent use of taxotere, chest CT was done.
This was thought to be possibly secondary to taxotere.
He continued to have a 3L O2 requirement with desaturation into the 70s with exertion.
Given this lack of improvement over a week, there was concern for PCP given his history of prednisone use.
Thus, he was taken for bronchoscopy and BAL, which was negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] oxygen requirement continued, so he was sent home with home O2 and plans to continue the prednisone and follow-up with his oncologist to arrange for PFTs, to attempt to taper prednisone, and for a possible referral to outpatient pulmonary and/or repeat CT if he didn't improve clinically.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was afebrile, with negative blood cultures and no evidence of sepsis.
CHF may have been contributory, although echo showed a nearly normal EF and only mild valve disease.
His beta blocker may need to be restarted as an outpatient given his history of coronary disease.
EKG changes: The patient had inferior ST changes on admission EKG.
These were though to be secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of known CAD.
Troponins were elevated in the setting of renal failure and increased demand.
Imdur was held for low blood pressure but may be restarted as an outpatient if needed for symptom control.
Anemia: This was likely secondary to malignancy and recent chemotherapy.
DM 2: He was placed on a sliding scale for hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid use.
# Elevated INR: Warfarin was held initially given subtherapeutic INR and restarted at home dose when INR fell within the therapeutic range.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
This was thought to be because of inflammation in your lungs that may have been related to your taxotere.
Other medication changes: - Bactrim was started - Omeprazole was started - Senna and colace were started - lasix was decreased - Metoprolol and imdur were stopped because of low blood pressure.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have wrosening shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers and chills, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
