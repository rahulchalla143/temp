Admission Date:  [**2133-9-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-9-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue and dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD with biopsy   History of Present Illness: 74 yo F w/ h/o of subarachnoid hemorrhage, liver hemangioma s/p resection, DVTs s/p IVC filter placement.
The patient noticed that she was constipated with decreased frequency of stooling and dark stools.
Per MICU Resident, the patient presented with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
She first noted feeling fatigued and unsteady on her feet about 1 PTA.
She has had a decreased appetite, but no N/V, or abdominal pain.
In retrospect, she says she had noticed that her stools were dark or black in color.
There was no BRBPR.
She has no past history of GI bleed.
She has also noted increased LE edema over the last few weeks.
She denies orthopnea or PND.
The patient was also noted to have new LLE swelling and U/S showed new DVT.
Labs have been notable for elevated alk phos and bilirubin, with a benign abdominal exam.
RUQ ultrasound and subsequent torso CT noted diffuse metastatic disease to liver with likely gastric primary.
Prior to arrival to the floor, she denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain.
Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage ([**2113**]) 2.
Liver hemangioma ([**3-21**]): s/p L lateral sementectomy 3.
DVT ([**2121**] and [**2132**]) - Not anticoagulated, presumably due to h/o SAH - S/p IVC filter placement 4.
Diabetes Mellitus Type II 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
HTN 7.
Slightly anxious.
2-3cm ecchymosis on R posterior, medial calf below the knee.
Large abdominal scar.
2+ radial and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Decreased tactile fremitus on L. No wheezes.
Ext: 1+ LE edema bilaterally L>R.
No swelling or erythema in LE bilaterally.
Intact light touch and diminished joint position sense in LEs.
Right femoral vein deep venous thrombosis extending to popliteal vein, which is new compared to prior study of [**2133-9-23**].
Persistent DVT of left femoral venous system.
CXR: Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with atelectasis at the left base.
No signs for focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.
Exophytic metastasis in segment IVB projects into gallbladder fossa but does not appear to invade gallbladder wall.
Smooth gallbladder wall edema is likely secondary to liver dysfunction.
No evidence of primary gallbladder neoplasm.
Innumerable hepatic metastases.
Necrotic-centered lymph nodes along gastrohepatic ligament with thickened gastric wall near gastroesophageal junction.
Findings are consistent with primary gastric carcinoma with metastatic lymph nodes and hepatic metastases.
Nodular area of high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images posterior to hepatic flexure.
Differential diagnosis would include a small splenule, but the signal intensity properties of this area do not follow splenic tissue on all pulse sequences.
Bilateral pleural effusions with volume loss at the bases bilaterally.
Small pericardial effusion.
Multiple pulmonary nodules concerning for metastases.
Multiple liver masses concerning for metastatic disease.
Asymmetric gallbladder wall thickening may represent tumoral invasion.
Lack of enhancement of any portion of the thickened gallbladder wall, and absence of focal nodularity or evidence of invasion makes primary gallbladder neoplasm less likely.
Abnormal thickening of the lesser curvature of the stomach with adjacent enhancing soft tissue and necrotic lymphadenopathy is most concerning for primary gastric neoplasm, most likely a signet cell-type tumor.
Bilateral deep venous thrombosis.
Two suspicious masses in the liver, concerning for primary neoplasm or metastasis.
Eccentrically thickened gallbladder wall concerning for primary gallbladder neoplasm versus infiltration from adjacent liver tumor.
No evidence of choledocholithiasis, as clinically questioned.
Brief Hospital Course: # UGI Bleed: Bleeding ulcer seen on initial EGD, hemostasis achieved.
Patient found to have adenocarcinoma at GE junction and cardiac region of stomach.
nodules in lung c/w metastatic disease.
# DVT: Patient found to have b/l DVTs.
# Hypoxia: Likely due to fluid overload from blood transfusions.
Subacute PE's also possible given DVT's w/o coagulation.
Repeat CXR showed elevation of L hemidiaphragm with atelectasis with b/l effusions not large enough to tap.
No signs of consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.
# Cough: Patient complains of persistent cough.
Likely secondary to pleural effusion or lung nodules.
Repeat CXR on [**2133-9-27**] showed elevation of L hemidiaphragm with atelectasis at the left base.
No signs of consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.
# UTI: Patient has h/o multiple UTIs and complains of symptoms of UTI with positive UA.
# Type II diabetes: - QAC and QHS finger sticks with Humalog ISS coverage.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Disp:*14 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Suspicion for gastric malignancy - bx pending Gastric Ulcer Bilateral Deep Vein Thrombosis UTI .
Secondary Diagnosis: HTN   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for bleeding from an ulcer in your stomach.
You had endoscopies to stop the bleeding from the ulcer in your stomach and to take biopsies from your stomach.
Please report any shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fever >101, bleeding, or other concerning symptoms to your primary care physician.
