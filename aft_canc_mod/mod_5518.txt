As his tumor has been responding to chemo, he has has been able to eat more and more.
He is just incredibly deconditioned and weak  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 745**] is a 60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue who intitially presented on [**2128-8-6**] after a syncopal episode at home when standing from sitting position.
There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness.
There was no witnessed seizure like activity.
There was no confusion or disorientation.
He felt weak and shakey after he stood back up.
Further history revealed poor PO intake over the preceding few weeks since prior discharge from the hospital on [**2128-7-28**].
It was during that hospitalization that his cancer was diagnosed.
He had a CXR which showed hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities and multiple compression fractures of vertebrae.
He had a CT of the head which was negative for acute process.
Knee films were negative for fracture or dislocation.
He was admitted to the cardiology service given syncope and borderline elevated troponins (0.5).
While on the cardiology service he was initially started on IVF for hydration out of concern that his syncopal episode was related to his poor PO intake and dehydration.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction and transferred to the oncology service.
Given his poor oral intake he underwent PEG placement on [**2128-8-12**].
Also on [**2128-8-12**] the patient was noted to complain of left lower quadrant abdominal pain with hematuria.
He underwent CT of the abdomen and pelvis which did not reveal etiology of his abdominal pain but did show debris in the right lower lobe bronchus and right lower lobe air space disease most likely atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
On [**2128-8-13**] he was started on a morphine PCA for pain control secondary to jaw and back pain.
Overnight on [**2128-8-14**] he was noted to develop a new 2L oxygen requirement.
CXR performed in this setting was concerning for bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
He underwent emergent CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed right lower lobe partial collapse, debris in the right lobe bronchus and bilateral pleural effusions.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he continues to have significant oxygen requirement and complained of being short of breath.
Per oncology notes he was also complaining of left sided chest pain but he did not note this to ICU team.
Anesthesia and ENT were emergently consulted given rapidly rising oxygen requirement and lack of ability to orally intubate.
Decision was made to proceed with nasotracheal intubation which proceded without complication.
Past Medical History: - Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue diagnosed in [**2128-7-17**].
Now s/p PEG tube for decreased PO intake secondary to pain and limited mobility of oropharynx.
- Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia  Diverticulitis s/p ileostomy [**2127-10-17**] (At [**Hospital1 **]) Depression GERD   Social History: Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **].

Small locules of free air adjacent to the stomach and anterior to the ventral aspect of the liver likely attributed to recent G-tube placement.
No evidence of hemorrhage or intra-abdominal or pelvic fluid collection.
Right lower lobe air space disease most likely atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Superimposed infection not excluded.
Debris/mucoid impaction fills right lower lobe bronchi.
This may be from secretions or aspiration.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
Considerable increased consolidation of the right lower lobe, with scattered ground glass opacities in other lobes bilaterally, suggesting pneumonia.
Unchanged right anterior fifth rib fracture and multilevel thoracic vertebral body compression deformities.
Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial and alveolar markings are again seen suggesting fluid overload.
Bilateral pleural effusions, increased.
Bibasilar atelectasis, however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Slight thickening of mid loops of small bowel; however, no intra-abdominal fluid or collections, and no mesenteric fat stranding.
Mild CBD dilation, stable.
Chronic compression fractures of the lower lumbar spine and old fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus.
Pt was initially admitted after presenting to the ED with syncope on [**2128-8-6**].
This was in the setting of poor PO intake due to progressive right jaw pain and trismus that devolped in [**Month (only) 205**].
Cancer was diagnosed by CT and confirmed to be SCC by biopsy of lesion at the base of the tongue.
Syncope was likely related to hypovolemia and poor nutritional status.
He was transferred to the oncology service and started on a morphine PCA for pain control.
On [**2128-8-14**] he was transferred to the ICU with hypotension and hypoxia in the setting of an aspiration event.
Bronchoscopy revealed copius purulent secretions which were culture positive for EColi.
He became neutropenic and febrile after his first cycle of chemo.
He was seen by dermatology for an erythematous rash in his groin and extremities.
He had anasarca that was likely related to low albumin and the IVF that he received while in the ICU.
Throughout his stay he complained of abdominal pain and had high residuals from the tube feeds.
Although he has not received any additional imaging, his ability to speak and eat have improved which suggests that the mass has decreased in size.
TRACH CARE:  The patient had a brief hypoxic event on [**2128-9-22**] which resolved after suctioning and removal of a mucous plug.
PAIN CONTROL: Pain in mouth/jaw at site of malignancy and also with chronic lower back pain.
Has been on morphine PCA due to poor GI absorption and difficulty swallowing.
As his tumor has been responding to chemo, he has has been able to eat more and more.
He developed erythema and purulent drainage around his PEG site last week.
