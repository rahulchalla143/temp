She had a pelvic US and CT abdomen and pelvis which demonstrated a thickened heterogeneous endometrium.
She returned shortly thereafter with heavier vaginal bleeding, a low grade fever, and low abdominal discomfort.
Past Medical History: OB/GYN: no paps/ pelvic exams, never sexually active, last regular menses ~ age 40-42, PMB started in [**2162**], heavy since [**Month (only) **], +[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4585**] PMH: pulmonic stenosis, likely HTN PSH: sternotomy with repair of pulmonic stenosis   Social History: No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substance use.

Normal appearance of the cervical stroma with no focal mass identified.
No large uterine mass evident and no definitive evidence of parametrial extension identified on these limited views of the uterus.
Bilateral enhancing distended fallopian tubes concerning for pyosalpingitis.
CXR [**11-8**]: Apparent mild pulmonary congestion, which may be explained by low lung volumes.
There are low lung volumes.
Left lower lung opacity has increased consistent with worsening atelectasis and/or aspiration.
New right upper lobe opacity also is consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
Bilateral lower lung atelectasis are unchanged.
Suspicious opacity for pneumonia in the right upper lung on [**2163-11-9**] is due to summation of the rib and soft tissue shadows and rotation of patient.
CXR [**11-12**]: There is no pulmonary edema.
Large areas of opacification in the lung bases are almost certainly atelectasis, not pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated on the lateral view.
CT abd/pelvis [**11-14**]: small hyperdense nodule in vagina, no apparent fluid collections, small amount of fluid around small bowel beneath incision but no abscess.
some stranding/ fluid collection under incision.
Following the procedure she continued to have fevers and thus vancomycin was started after ID consultation.
The pathology was consistent with clear cell adenocarcinoma.
Shortly following this decision she became tachypnic and was desaturating to the 80's.
There was no evid of PE on CTA.
Her ECHO was felt to be normal with an LVEF of 55% and no valvular lesions identified.
She had to remain intubated for an additional 24 hours due to tachypnea and inability to tolerate SBTs.
She remained afebrile following her surgery.
On POD 3, she developed leukocytosis and bandemia though remained afebrile and asymptomatic.
ID was reconsulted and suggested PO flagyl for empiric coverage of c diff while the ag study was pending.
We also obtained a CT of her abdomen and pelvis which did not reveal any evid of intraabdominal abscess.
