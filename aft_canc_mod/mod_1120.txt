High grade brain glioma, status post craniotomy.
Status post pituitary adenoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old man with a pituitary adenoma resection in [**2084**], and hypertension, who was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for evaluation of a left parietal occipital lesion with edema and minimal hemorrhage with a midline shift on CT.
He was noted to be hypoxic and short of breath in room air postoperatively.
Head CT emergently done showed the above lesion in the parietal occipital area.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Chronic insomnia.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has not had any weight loss, no night sweats, no fever or chills, no difficulty talking, no chest pain, no abdomen pain or diarrhea, no constipation, no bloody stools, no trouble with urination, no numbness or tingling.
The patient is pleasantly interactive, no acute distress.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulses 2+ in upper and lower extremities and no lower extremity edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted for a new mass and lesion of the left parietal occipital lobe.
On hospital day three, the patient had a left parietal occipital craniotomy that showed a high grade glioma.
He was noted to be hypoxic the following day and pulmonary team was consulted for hypoxia, shortness of breath and tachypnea.
On the floor, the patient continued to have low oxygen saturation into the 80s on 100% nonrebreather almost every night, usually would improve on own and was helped with some BiPAP.
Bubble echocardiogram was performed that showed an aneurysmal interatrial septal shunt with a right to left shunt but a right heart cath showed that there was no increase in left atrial saturation with oxygen and VQ scan was negative.
It was decided by the pulmonary team after multiple examinations and days of notes and discussions that it was OK to tolerate an oxygen saturation over 86% in this gentleman.It was felt that atelectasis could be part of the issue ?
sleep apnea or occult lung disease.
High grade glioma brain tumor.
