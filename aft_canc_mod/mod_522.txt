Imaging:  [**2153-6-6**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: New consolidations in the posterior segment left upper lobe (4, 53), in the right upper lobe (4: 52, 91), are most likely infectious in etiology.
Pericardial opacities in the right middle lobe could be atelectasis or infection.
1 mm right upper lobe lung nodule (4, 35) is stable, 1 mm lung nodule in the right middle lobe is also stable.
Subpleural 3 mm lung nodule in the right upper lobe is new (4, 95).
There are scattered calcified granulomas.
Small right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis is new.
There are few calcified pleural plaques (4, 118).
Mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Mild calcification of the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic significance.
Trace pericardial effusion is unchanged and physiologic.
Tiny epicardiac lymph nodes are again noted.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
For a more detailed description of abdominal findings, please refer to concurrent MR of the abdomen.
Multifocal bilateral opacities mostly likely infectious in etiology.
[**2153-6-6**] BONE SCAN INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton obtained in anterior and posterior projections show no abnormal areas of tracer uptake.
On the anterior projection, there is reduced uptake in the spine and kidneys, unchanged, secondary to large volume ascites as seen on the MRI of the abdomen done today.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
[**10/2152**] EGD - One column of nonbleeding grade I varices were seen in the lower esophagus.
- There was erythematous and nodular mucosa at the antrum.
There was no evidence of active bleeding.
- Mild non-bleeding portal hypertensive gastropathy was seen in the body of stomach.
There was no gastric varices.
- The mucosa at the duodenal bulb appeared erythematous and nodular.
There was no evidence of active bleeding.
There was no evidence of varices.
Nodular cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension with splenomegaly, ascites, recanalization of paraumbilical vein.
A 7 mm nodule within segment II, which demonstrates arterial enhancement and washout but without T2 correlate is also very suspicious.
Close surveillance of these lesions is recommended.
New multiple nodular foci within segment VI with arterial enhancement, no T2 correlate or washout identified.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.

# Hepatic Encephalopathy: Patient presented with increased irritability for 1 week and determined to have slow onset grade I encephalopathy.
He was found to have community-acquired pneumonia given bilateral upper lobe opacities seen on [**2153-6-6**] CT chest.
# ETOH Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy and HCC s/p RFA.
Was found to have non-bleeding grade 1 varices on EGD 11/[**2151**].
# Community-acquired pneumonia: Patient had CT chest [**2153-6-6**] which showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for infection.
Denied any fever, cough, or increased sputum production.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr ~1.5-1.7.
A suspected cellulitis developed on the LLE which was started on vanco.
It was thought that the cellulitis would not resolve with LE edema and thus would not qualify patient for transplant.
Because the edema would not resolve with diuretics, Lasix 80mg daily was started with the understanding that the patient's renal function would likely deteriorate and HD would be required.
# PVD/Chronic Infected Femoral Graft.
Consulted vascular surgery to comment on status of PVD and ability to tolerate transplant.
Noninvasive vascular studies showed patent bilateral external iliac and common femoral arteries with monophasic waveforms and no focal velocity step-up.
# LLE Extremity cellulitis: The patient was found to have erythema on distal LLE extremity.
On [**6-18**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] recommended discontinuing the vancomycin as cellulitis seemed less likely once some of the LE edema resolved.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital with confusion and a decline in your kidney function.
Your confusion was due to a pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which we treated with antibiotics.
Since you have had a bladder mass removed in the past, you had a cystoscopy performed to look in the bladder.
No signs of cancer were found.
You also had an infection of your left leg which we treated with antibiotics.
During the admission, the vascular surgeons saw you to evaluate the extent of your peripheral vascular disease and your ability to withstand a liver transplant.
The following changes have been made to your medications: STOP: Furosemide, Spironolactone, Carvedilol DECREASE: Allopurinol to 150mg daily START: Lactulose and take enough to achieve [**2-25**] bowel movements per day to prevent confusion Lanthanum for your kidney disease Nephrocaps for your kidney disease Xifaxan for your liver disease  Please see below for follow up appointment information  Followup Instructions: Please call to schedule follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Vascular Surgery) 1 month after discharge for your peripheral vascular disease at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2867**].
