Patient initially presented to BIDN with worsening shortness of breath.
He first noticed increasing weakness about six weeks ago and then over the last two weeks, he also reports worsening shortness of breath.
Also reports having a new 2 pillow orthopnea that developed over the last two weeks, as well as intermittent PND.
The patient also reports having new LE edema that for the last few weeks has been getting worse.
He reports having intermittent night sweats over the last few weeks - occasional night cough; only occasionally productive of whitish sputum.
Reports decreased appetite for the last six weeks, with 5-6 pound weight loss over last two weeks.
The patient also reports increased urinary frequency (but reports that this has been a long standing issue since he was in his teens), hesitancy; denies any blood in urine.
He also reports having lower back pain that started about 5-6 weeks ago.
Of note, CT from OSH showed that the patient had a chest infiltrate, as well as concern for malignant lesions in bones.
Patient was also found to have multiple bony lesions and a high PSA thought to be widely metastatic prostate cancer however this is not yet confirmed with tissue and oncology feels that he still would have a three year prognosis regardless.
CT also showed enlarged heart, ECHO showed EF 20-25%, with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild AR, severe aortic stenosis.
Denies any history of early MI or cardiovascular disease.

Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
Conclusions Pre Bypass The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis, which improved to moderate free wall hypokineisis on epinepherine.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a tissue prosthesis (#25 magna per surgeons) in the aortic position with no perivalvular leaks.
Bibasilar chest tubes and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract are stable.
There continues to be patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting moderate pulmonary edema, which is essentially unchanged, although a diffuse pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Relative density of the ribs raises concern for sclerotic metastases, for which clinical correlation is advised.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
He remained hemodynamically stable in the early post-op course, because of his poor cardiac performance he was kept sedated through the first post operative night.
He was also noted to have a brief episode of atrial fibrillation which was treated with beta blockers and Amiodarone, after which he converted to sinus rhythm.
Right chest tube was removed [**1-17**] and CXR showed small anterior PTX.
Left chest tube was pulled on [**1-20**] and CXR showed persistent right small anterior PTX and reaccumulating right effusion.
He was found to have an unstageable coccyx decub and was seen by the wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7219**] were made ( see wound care note for deatils).
Lisinopril was not strated due to hypotension.
