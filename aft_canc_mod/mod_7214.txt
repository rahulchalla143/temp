The patient presented to Radiation Oncology today for WBXRT (session [**5-3**] today), and while at clinic developed 2-3 minutes of chest pain described as sternal chest pressure rated as [**4-29**] that resolved with supplemental oxygen.
The patient denied any associated SOB, n/v, palpitations, pain radiating to jaw, arm, or back that resolved with supplmental oxygen.
The patient received vanco and levofloxacin over concern for pneumonia as well as 3L IVF with an increase in his lactate from 4.1 to 4.7.
A CTA was negative for PE, but demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities, right base consolidation, and persistent infiltrates largely unchanged from a recent PET-CT.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was resting comfortably without complaints.
Denies any f/c/s, n/v/d, CP/SOB, palpitations, cough, orthopnea, PND, or hemoptysis.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 100424**] is a 78 year old gentleman with stage IV NSCLC admitted for lactic acidosis.
Differential includes type A lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion) from SIRS in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from ACS versus type B lactic acidosis from metformin/diabetes or active malignancy.
No evidence of liver mets or decreased synthetic function to suggest inability to clear lactate.
# Chest pain/CAD: Low suspicion for ACS given ECG in ED unchanged without ST-T wave abnormalities.
CTA negative for PE and patient was CP free throughout his stay in the ICU.
# Leukocytosis: likely secondary to dexamethasone, WBC and fever curve were stable in ICU.
# Ground glass opacities: Patchy ground glass opacities on CT present in 6/[**2174**].
Less likely to be blood, and low likelihood given clinical presentation for bacterial infection.
Given recent dexamethasone therapy, concern for PCP given lack of prophylaxis, although ground glass present prior to initiation of dexamethasone makes this less likely.
# Diabetes, type 2: Metformin given lactic acidosis and contrast load, pt was covered with ISS with accuchecks.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued, ezetimibe held given lack of data regarding benefit.

A heart related cause was ruled out with testing, however another test showed that you had too much lactic acid.
Accordingly, your lactic acid may be the result of uncontrolled diabetes and the pill (metformin) you were using to treat it.
You were discharged with a new diabetes treatment regimen: NEW Lantus 20 units in the morning NEW Glypizide 5 mg twice a day NEW Bactrim - to prevent a lung infection when on steroids STOP Metformin HOLD Ezetimibe, Fenofibrate - discuss instead starting a statin (such as simvastatin) with your primary care doctor.
