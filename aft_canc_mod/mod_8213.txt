Admission Date:  [**2189-6-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-7-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-4-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: morphine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: hematemesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endoscopy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year-old woman with a past medical history of prior lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy, COPD, history of breast cancer s/p radiation/lumpectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations for pneumonia, initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-24**] with shortness of breath and persistent cough.
She had a recent admission at the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**] for a CAP, COPD exacerbation during which she had a CTA of her chest which showed a new lobulated right upper lobe mass invasive into the airways, with possible postobstructive pneumonitis, highly suspicious for malignancy.
She was apparently supposed to have an outpatient bronchoscopy, but this never happened.
TTE was done which showed apical hypokinesis, EF 60%.
Cardiology was consulted and per notes, thought she had stable CAD, not acute coronary syndrome, recommended statin/aspirin, held off beta blocker secondary to wheezing.
In terms of her SOB, it was felt that she was having another COPD exacerbation with possible postobstructive pneumonia.
She was initially admitted to the floor and improved on PO steroids with nebulizers, then her respiratory status worsened, she became tachcyardic and she was tranferred to the MICU and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
After speaking with IP here, the patient was intuabted on [**6-30**], had a bronch at [**Hospital1 **], and is being transferred post - procedure to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and evaluation for possible stenting procedure.

Past Medical History: - Prior right lung pneumonectomy for lung cancer - COPD - prior community acquired pneumonias - breast cancer with lumpectomy: lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy - anxiety - positional vertigo - stress fracture both ankles - Cesarean section - reported history of a right adrenal mass - insomnia - GERD - diaphragmatic hernia.
Social History: ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] records): She was a moderate cigarette smoker, smoking about less than a pack of cigarettes a day for 35-40 years until 4 years ago when lung cancer was diagnosed.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Admission Exam Vitals: 98.4 95 158/81 18 100% gen: intubated and sedated, not responding to commands CV: tachycardic, no appreciable murmurs over vent Resp: transmitted breath sounds on left, coarse breath sounds on right Abd: +BS, soft Neuro: pupils equal  Pertinent Results: [**6-30**] Chest Xray Left lung is airless and mediastinum occupies the left hemithorax suggesting prior left pneumonectomy.
Right upper lobe is densely consolidated, and at its periphery is a 5 x 12 cm homogeneous opacity with lobulated margins along the lung interface which certainly could be a mass involving lung and pleura.
The right lower lung is free of consolidation but there are septal lines suggesting mild edema.
[**6-30**] ECG Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Right bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a history of non small cell lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy and COPD who presented with a new right lung mass and post - obstructive pneumonia.
She was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with symptoms of shortness of breath.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics given concern for a possible post-obstructive picture.
They performed a bronchoscopy, but were unable to perform any intervention given the location of the tumor compressing her airway.
