Admission Date:  [**2171-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-5-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: transfer for MRSA bacteremia/?endocarditis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left internal jugular central venous line placement ([**2171-2-6**])  History of Present Illness: 53 year old male with past medical history significant for marginal zone non Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p splenectomy [**2169-12-28**] and rituximab with post-op course complicated by gastric perforation.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] hospital in Novemember [**2170**] for generalize weakness and discharge without any cause of his weakness.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2171-2-3**] after five days of worsening fatigue, moaning, agitation and fall with a head trauma on [**2171-2-3**].
Tox screen positive for opiates.
His hospital course was notable for acute kidney injury which was initally oliguric but improved with intravenous hydration.
He was intubated on [**2171-2-5**] for worsening mental status and agitation.
CT head without contrast did not show any acute intracranial pathology.
Splenic marginal zone lymphoma - s/p splenectomy in [**12/2169**] - post-op course complicated by atrial fibrillation/sick sinus syndrome/reentral atrial tachycardia, gastric tear requiring re-exploration and repair of gastric perforation, post-operative pancreatitis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia requiring prednisone.
CAD s/p MI - s/p cardiac cath with no abnormalities - TTE [**3-/2170**]: EF 60%, normal systolic function, mild TR, borderline PAH, mild MR, trivial pericardial effusion 3.
Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome c/b DVT in [**2158**] - was on coumadin, currently on aspirin 5.
Sleep apnea 7.
Hepatitis C 8. h/o loculate pleural effusion 9. s/p pancreatic stent [**70**].Vitamin B12 deficiency 11.
Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.5) 12.
No clear history of increased alcohol abuse and no drug history.
Family History: Positive for a father who died from colon cancer at the age of 55.
His mother died from head and neck cancer at age 59.
No crackles or wheezing appreciated.
No gallops ABD:  Soft, nontender and nondistended.
NABS EXT:  No edema SKIN:  B/l stasis dermatitis.
Chronic skin changes at b/l UE.
No osler nodes or janeaway lesions noted NEURO:  Sedated.
IMAGING: CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology but this was the motion degraded study.
CT of the cervical spine:  No cervical spine fracture, subluxation or prevertebral soft tissue swelling; however, the DJD changes at C5-C6 place the patient at a greater risk for cord injury and if needed an MRI could be obtained.
Chest x-ray:  There is a right upper lobe opacity that potentially may represent an area of aspiration versus contusion, although definitive developing infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
hip x-ray showed no fracture.
Pelvic x-ray:  No pelvic fractures.
CT torso showed infiltrates and effusions at both lung bases, small  amount of ascites.
No obvious intra-abdominal abnormality.
Moderate vegetation at aortic valve.
METH RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS                        Target Route Dose               RX     AB   Cost M.I.C.
Blood culture ([**2171-2-5**]): No growth todate .
B/l infiltrate @ RLL and LLL .
No ST-T changes.. .
Pertinent Imaging TTE ([**2171-2-6**]): Moderate sized mass on the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve which is consistent with vegetation, tumor, or thrombus.
Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
ECG ([**2171-2-10**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-2-6**] no diagnostic interval change.
MRI ([**2171-2-10**]): Multiple foci of restricted diffusion, distributed in both cerebral hemispheres as described above, the possibility of septic emboli and thromboembolic ischemic events are considerations.
Few of these lesions demonstrate magnetic susceptibility at the frontal lobes and punctate enhancement in the left parietal lobe.
Bilateral mucosal thickening is identified at the mastoid air cells and sphenoid sinus.
Subtle high signal intensity foci are demonstrated in the pons on T2 and FLAIR, possibly reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
TTE ([**2171-2-12**]): Aortic valve vegetation with moderate associated regurgitation.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.
Multiple nodules are again consistent with the clinical diagnosis of septic emboli.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with past medical history significant for marginal zone non Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p splenectomy [**2169-12-28**] and rituximab, rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone, ?HIT, autoimmune hemolytic anemia transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management of MRSA bacteremia.
TTE showed moderate vegetation and 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of 50% which has stayed stable on TTE on [**2171-2-12**].
MRI head significant for > 20 foci concerning for septic emboli to brain which might have caused his acute agitation leading to his intubation at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].
CT abdomen/pelvis done on [**2171-2-13**] showed no intra-abdominal abscess, although study was limited without IV contrast.
Was started on zosyn on [**2-8**] for continued leukocytosis and fever; these initially improved but have remained elevated.
Respiratory failure: Intubated in the setting of agitation which could be due to septic emboli vs nonpulmonary ARDS from sepsis vs toxic/metabolic injury.
His respiratory status did improve over the course of his stay, however he remained intubated due to sedation and poor neurologic exam.
Acute kidney injury: pt has chronic kidney disease, with baseline creatinine around 1.5.
His creatinine has continually increased to max of 3.5, concerning for septic emboli to kidney versus ATN vs volume depletion (though urine lytes not consistent with prerenal state).
Anemia: Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Stool guiaic has been negative along with hemolysis labs.
Elevated LFTs: History of hepatitis C Ab with negative viral load in the past along with abnormal LFTs.
Differential also includes emboli to the liver but CT abdomen without contrast did not show any abscess vs amiodarone toxicity.
?HIT: ?
R foot discoloration: concern for arterial septic embolization.
Given his poor pre-hospital functional status, it was felt that all of these things were very likely to happen.
