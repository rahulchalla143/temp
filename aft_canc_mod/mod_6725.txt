She does state that she has been smoking for "longer than she can remember" and has had a "benign" mass resected from her left breast "many years" ago.
There is no nystagmus.
She continues to have a left pronator drift.
Gait is slow without listing.
food and fluid well with no nausea or vomiting.
Note: MIB-1 immunohistochemistry reveals a focal proliferation index of 80% in a dense small cell focus and 15-20% overall (block D).
Dural, right parietal (F-G): Leptomeninges focally involved by [**Last Name (un) **].
Brain, white matter (H):  White matter is diffusely infiltrated by [**Last Name (un) **] with mild hypercellularity and prominent microvascular proliferation.
V.  Brain, right parietal lesion (I-K):  Diffusely infiltrating [**Last Name (un) **] with areas of solid [**Last Name (un) **] cell nodules.
Radiology Report MR HEAD W/CNTRST&[**Last Name (un) **] VOLUMETRIC Study Date of [**2181-3-26**] 6:08 AM  [**2181-3-26**] 6:08 AM MR HEAD W/CNTRST&[**Year/Month/Day **] VOLUMET; CT 3D RENDERING W/POST PROCESS Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 82765**]  Reason: pre-surgical mapping for craniotomy Contrast: MAGNEVIST Amt: 12  Provisional Findings Impression: RXCg MON [**2181-3-26**] 6:41 PM PFI: Large 4.1 x 3.1 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right parietotemporal region causing mass effect on the ipsilateral lateral ventricle and effacement of the Ambien cistern.
There is surrounding perilesional T1 hypointensity reflecting edema versus [**Last Name (Titles) **] infiltration.
There is a mass effect involving the ipsilateral lateral ventricle as well as midline shift of approximately 4.9 mm, not significantly changed when compared to the prior exam.
There is effacement of the ipsilateral ambient cistern with no evidence for frank herniation.
No other abnormal enhancing lesions are identified.
Differential diagnostic considerations include primary CNS malignancy (such as GBM) or solitary metastases.
CT brain Wet Read: JXKc TUE [**2181-3-27**] 11:54 PM Post-op changes from right parietal resection with increase in vasogenic edema, and leftward shift of midline and subfalcine herniation of 10 mm (previously, 4mm).
New right subdural hypodense collection, measuring 4 mm.
Final Report HISTORY: 60-year-old female with recent right craniotomy for a mass, with small bleeding this morning, now increased lethargy and left hemiparesis.
FINDINS: Changes from a right parietal craniotomy and resection of the mass are again noted, with a small amount of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus seen within the resection bed.
There continues to be residual vasogenic edema, which may be slightly increased, particularly near the vertex, compared to prior study.
There is, however, a marked increase in associated mass effect and leftward subfalcine herniation, with herniation of approximately 10 mm (previously 4 mm); there is also evidence of early left uncal herniation.
There is also mass effect on the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, with an increase in caliber of the contralateral lateral ventricle, with the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] measuring approximately 8 mm (previously approximately 6.5 mm).
There is also new dilatation of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Since the interval study,there is also a new right subdural collection, which is relatively hypodense, could reflect a small subdural hygroma.
No new foci of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Previously noted dilated superior ophthalmic veins are improved.
Post-surgical changes are also noted within the soft tissues and scalp overlying the craniotomy site, with soft tissue swelling and air.
Status post resection of right parietal mass, with increase in vasogenic edema and mass effect, with an increase in leftward subfalcine and early uncal herniation.
Small new right subdural collection, measuring 4 mm in maximal dimension, could reflect a small subdural hygroma.
FINDINGS: There is no diffusion abnormality.
No diffusion-weighted abnormalities to suggest infarction.
Similar appearance to edema in the right parietal postsurgical area.
New 3.3 x 1.0 cm focus of hyperdensity within the right parietal resection area consistent with new bleed.
Persistent right subdural hypodense collection, essentially unchanged from prior.
Vasogenic edema persists and the amount of leftward subfalcine herniation is similar to prior at 10 mm.
There is evidence of uncal herniation.
Again seen is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] on the left, again mildly dilated.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normal.
Post-surgical changes are seen in the soft tissues of the scalp overlying the craniotomy site with soft tissue swelling and air.
Status post resection of right parietal mass with a new hyperdense focus compatible with new bleed.
Persistent right subdural collection, unchanged in size, may reflect some small subdural hygroma.
Later that evening of that same day - pt with increased lethargy.
Second stat CT of the day showed increased edema with MLS.
The following day she was more awake and passed speech and swallow.
Of note there was a new area of bleeding into the postop bed.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Keppra for seizure control.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
