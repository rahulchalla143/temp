EKG reportedly with ST depressions, CE negative (CKMB 3, Trop<0.01).
Previous episodes of afib with RVR attributed to chemotherapy, fevers, volume overload.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with plans for ERCP for possible cholangitis, based on LFTs and elevated bilirubin, however patient is afebrile with a normal WBC and no CBD dilitation on RUQ US.
Afib with RVR attributed to hepatobiliary process.
Patient without abdominal pain, resting comfortable in sinus rhythm.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma (diagnosed [**2121**], relapsed [**2126**] treated with AVBD c/b Afib w/RVR, bleomycin lung toxicity, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]) and Non-Hodgkin's (follicular) lymphoma (diagnosed [**2127**], treated w/rituxan in [**2128**]).
Hypertension 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.

Hypogammaglobulinemia .
Onc history: -  Left-sided neck adenopathy biopsied in [**5-/2122**]: Hodgkin disease with flow cytometry noted for monoclonal B cells which were CD5 positive,raising the possibility of CLL.
This was felt likely due to persistence of germinal centers and he was treated for stage IA lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] Hodgkin disease with radiation therapy with a total dose of 3060 centigrade of modified mantle field with three fractions of left neck cone down completed in 09/[**2121**].
-  CT on [**2127-1-20**] revealed a left pleural mass with biopsy consistent with relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma status post ABVD X 6 cycles with complications of neutropenia, necessitating the use of Neupogen, rapid atrial fibrillation, and bleomycin toxicity along with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
-  Recurrent adenopathy noted in [**6-/2128**] with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] size that was followed over time with a slowly increasing adenopathy.
Excisional biopsy of right neck adenopathy done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] on [**2129-3-28**] revealed a follicular lymphoma grade 2.
PET after 2 cycles with marked improvement.
PET scan after 4 cycles with no FDG avidity.
Doxil dose reduced to 25mg/m2 for 5th and 6th cycle due to hand/foot rash.
-  PET scan on [**2130-1-27**] revealed no FDG-avid disease.
-  Follow up PET scan on [**2130-5-16**] showed new FDG avid lymphadenopathy in the left infrarenal paraaortic and iliac regions, with the largest paraaortic node measuring 30 x 16 mm and SUVmax of 20.4, felt representing recurrent lymphoma but not amenable to biopsy.
No other new focal FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
-  Received 1 cycle of ICE on [**2130-5-31**] complicated by fluid overload and atrial fibrillation and flutter.
-  Received 1 cycle of ESHAP on [**2130-6-22**] complicated by bradycardia and repeat admission for atrial fibrillation.
-  Repeat FDG imaging on [**2130-7-20**] continued to show FDG avidity within the left paraaortic lymph node with SUV max of 11.2.
Given prior history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, he underwent a biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3748**] from Urology with laparoscopic surgery on [**2130-9-4**] which did not show any evidence for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma.
-  Repeat PET scan in [**9-/2130**] revealed resolution of his lymphadenopathy and FDG avidity with no new areas.
Follow up FDG tumor imaging on [**2130-12-11**] reveals no evidence for lymphadenopathy or recurrent lymphoma.
-  Further treatment with Rituxan held due to recurrent sinus infections which have been treated extensively with antibiotics under the guidance of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] from ID.
Follow up sinus CTs finally showed resolution of his infection.
-  Follow up PET scanning in [**4-/2131**] and [**9-/2131**] notable for enlarging FDG avid subcutaneous lesion in the right posterior neck and new FDG-avidity in a tiny (3 mm) right level 5 lymph node.
These were followed with examinations and scans and the right occipital node was increasing in size and proceeded with FNA on [**2132-7-8**] which was nondiagnostic.
-  Biopsy of right occipital mass on [**2132-7-31**] showed follicular lymphoma, Grade 3A and follicular lymphoma, Grade [**11-30**], diffuse(Extranodal extension) with concurrent lymphocyte-[**Doctor First Name **] classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
-  PET CT on [**2133-2-4**] shows resolution of numerous previously seen sites of FDG-avid cervical lymphadenopathy and right suboccipital tissue nodal tissue with persistence of a 10 x 6 mm left level IIB node with significant FDG avidity (SUV max 5.4).
