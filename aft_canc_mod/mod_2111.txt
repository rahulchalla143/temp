In [**1-/2139**] she was diagnosed with metastatic disease to the liver, bone, and lungs, and then developed brain metastases in 5/[**2137**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 22552**] was seen today in clinic where she reported eight episodes of falls and shortness of breath over the past few days.
She was noted to have brief periods of loss of consciousness with postictal period during which she also became transiently hypoxic.

Head CT and MRI showed a mass in the left cerebellum.
The [**Date Range 31255**] was consistent with metastatic breast cancer.
She then received Cyberknife radiosurgery to a right cerebellar metastasis (1,800 cGy) and a right superior cerebellar metastasis (1,600 cGy) on [**2140-6-27**] in one fraction, followed by a suboccipital craniotomy on [**2141-11-8**] for removal of right paramedian cerebellar metastasis.
Social History: Lives with her husband, [**Name (NI) **] tobacco, etoh use  Family History: Sister died of lung cancerat 43yrs; father died of hymphoma at 63yrs, and mother of heart attack at 52yrs.
Physical Exam: T 96.3 HR 77 BP 144/86  RR 22  96%3L GEN:  alert and oriented, comfortable, no acute distress, speaking full sentences but somewhat dysarthric and occasional incorrectly placed word HEENT:  PERRL, anicteric, conjunctiva pink, oropharynx without lesion or exudate, moist mucus membranes LYMPH:  no anterior/posterior cervical, occipital, supraclavicular, or axillary adenopathy CARDIOVASCULAR:  PMI nondisplaced, regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops LUNGS:  bilateral crackles ABDOMEN:  soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
no hepatosplenomegaly by percussion or palpation EXTREMITIES:  no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema SKIN:  no rashes, petechia, lesions, or echymoses NEURO:  cranial nerves II-[**Doctor First Name 81**] intact, with XII tongue deviates to the left, strength 5/5 BUE, 3+/5 RLE, 4+/5 LLE, sensation intact BUE/BLE to touch equal and symmetric  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission:       9.8 9.3>-----<350      30.9 N:80.8 L:13.0 M:3.6 E:2.4 Bas:0.1  136  99  11 ----------- <92 3.7  29  0.4  Ca: 8.3 Mg: 2.1 P: 2.4 Alb: 3.2  PT: 11.9  PTT: 29.2  INR: 1.0  Studies:  EKG ([**11-4**]): Sinus rhythm.
Delayed precordial R wave transition.
New appearance of diffuse multifocal interstitial and septal thickening in the left upper zone is concerning for an infiltrative process such as lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Additional confluent opacity in the right middle lobe is concerning for infectious process.
No definite acute intracranial abnormality.
Grossly unchanged post-surgical changes of the posterior fossa.
Focal small area of calcification adjacent to the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] corresponds to area of enhancement on prior MRI.
Mucosal sinus disease and opacification of the right mastoid air cells, grossly stable since prior MRI from [**2143-8-30**].
No pulmonary embolism.
No aortic dissection.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities and septal thickening and small bilateral effusions.
The constellation of findings is most likely due to pulmonary edema.
A followup chest CT following treatment and resolution of symptoms is recommended.
Focal consolidation of the right middle and left upper lobes concerning for superimposed infection.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: moderate pulmonary hypertension with a dilated right ventricle and moderate-to-severe tricsupid regurgitation  CT Head ([**2143-11-24**]): No acute intracranial injury.
No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
Sclerotic lesion seen on the vertebral body, also suspicious for metastasis.
Chest Xray ([**2143-11-26**]: Severity of the global pulmonary opacification has worsened since [**11-25**] indicating progression of a component of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage superimposed on extensive pulmonary metastatic involvement.
Small pleural effusions are presumed.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 50yo woman with breast cancer metastatic to liver, lungs, bone, and brain admitted with seizures and RLL pneumonia.
The CT did however show diffuse ground-glass opacities and septal thickening and small bilateral effusions, concerning for possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Pulmonology was consulted who thought that these infiltrates were likely responsible for her hypoxemia.
She underwent speech and swallow evaluation and was found to have silent aspirations which was likely to exacerbate her hypoxia.
Because of a worsening respiratory status, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of hypoxia and respiratory distress.
The patient was started on IV Decadron for possible lymphagitic spread.
PCP treatment was initiated empirically given recent steroid therapy but did not appear to have any benefit.
TTE showed moderate pulmonary hypertension with a dilated right ventricle and moderate-to-severe tricsupid regurgitation.
Given the possibility of pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction contributing to respiratory distress, she was aggressively diuresed.
Nonetheless, it is believed that the primary cause of respiratory distress was lymphagitic spread of breast carcinoma.
Eventually, she was made comfort-measures only and started on a morphine drip for comfort and respiratory distress.
Metastatic Breast Cancer:  As an ouptatient, she was getting bevacizumab and Herceptin.
She has brain metastasis and radiation induced necrosis which likely explains her cerebellar dysfunction.
Seizure: Patient had an EEG which showed no overt electrographic seizure activity, but suggested a possible focus of cortical irritability and potential for epileptogenesis as well as subcortical dysfunction in the left mid to posterior temporal region.
She did not have any further seizure activity.
