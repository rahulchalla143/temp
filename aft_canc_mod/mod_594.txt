Admission Date:  [**2179-4-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-5-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-8-30**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old African-American female with a history of multiple myeloma, status post autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2175-7-3**], congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%), status post total hip replacement in [**2179-7-3**] secondary to multiple myeloma infiltration who was home from rehabilitation approximately two weeks ago.
Her opiate dose was recently decreased, but for the past two to three days she has been complaining of increased fatigue, confusion, lethargy, decreased appetite, and decreased oral intake.
She has had decreased fluid intake.
According to her family, she has not had any fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
She has not had any rashes or neck stiffness.
No photophobia.
No abdominal pain.
The patient was found to have a critically high glucose by the Emergency Medical Service.
In the ambulance, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for two minutes.
In the Emergency Room she had her third seizure initiating in her left arm and then progressing to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%.
3+ mitral regurgitation.
Mass at the head of pancreas with magnetic resonance imaging in [**2179-3-5**] concerning for lymphoma versus adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Pulmonary examination revealed crackles at the left base; left greater than right.
Cardiovascular examination revealed normal first heart sound and second heart sound with a systolic murmur.
Extremities revealed no edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An echocardiogram done in [**2178-4-2**] showed an ejection fraction of 25% to 30% with global hypokinesis, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular moderately dilated.
A chest x-ray done on admission showed left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate, a small left effusion, moderate congestive heart failure.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen on [**2179-4-20**] showed 7-cm X 3-cm at the pancreatic head; atypical for adenoma, question of plasmacytoma versus lymphoma.
She did not carry of diabetes prior to this.
It was thought that it was secondary to her course of dexamethasone followed by decreased oral intake and dehydration exacerbating it.
It was felt that her glucose may have been elevated secondary to dexamethasone and possible infection.
She did not have any further episodes of hyperglycemia.
NEUROLOGIC SYSTEM:  The patient had seizures thought to be secondary to metabolic derangement.
It was felt that she likely had seizure due to hyperglycemia or hyponatremia.
She did not have any further episodes of seizures during the course of this admission.
Her mental status did wax and wane, but essentially improved from admission.
She did not have any intracranial lesions.
She did have an electroencephalogram to assess for any seizure focus, and that also did not show any conclusive evidence for seizure.
The electroencephalogram had suggested possible left focal cortical abnormalities.
The electroencephalogram had suggested a left temporal focus, but since the CT scan did not show any evidence, it was further pursued as she could not tolerate a magnetic resonance imaging.
Unlikely to be having ongoing seizures with the report, and a repeat magnetic resonance imaging was not able to be performed.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a fever on her first day of admission.
Subsequently, she had a lumbar puncture done.
A chest x-ray was suggestive of possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
It was felt that the low volume may have been from aspiration or vomiting during seizure.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient had multiple myeloma.
It was found that she had some nodular masses on her abdomen.
It was found to be consistent with a plasmacytoma or extension of her multiple myeloma.
It was felt that her diffuse tumor burden was increasing despite the chemotherapy that she had been receiving.
She also had a peripancreatic mass which was most likely part of this similar condition.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient had multiple episodes of dyspnea during the course of this admission.
It was felt that given her history of congestive heart failure that she likely had congestive heart failure.
She had persistent tachycardia during the course of this admission, and it was felt to be due to possible dehydration.
She received fluids and also with her history of congestive heart failure, she was continued on Lasix 40 mg once per day with metoprolol.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient had an increasing creatinine on her initial admission.
However, her creatinine improved with some fluid hydration.
Because of her history of congestive heart failure, the fluid intake was gently given.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient had episodes of dyspnea during the course of this admission.
The possible etiologies were pneumonia, tumor burden, along with congestive heart failure.
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  The patient had an episode of melena during the course of this admission.
Because of her poor prognosis, she was not a candidate for interventional studies.
She had a guaiac-positive stool and a decrease in hematocrit.
She had expanding tumor involvement including skin and likely pancreas.
On [**2179-5-20**], the patient was found to no longer have any spontaneous breaths.
She had no audible heart sounds.
