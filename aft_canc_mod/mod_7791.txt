Surgical consult was obtained to assess for resectability.
In summary, by report and through the OSH medical records (all of which are not available at this time), Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 89675**] presented to an OSH ([**Hospital3 15402**]) in late Decemeber [**2163**] with painless jaundice and an elevated bilirubin.
Of note, 2 days post-ERCP, he was prescribed and completed a 10 day course for bacteremia with zosyn.
He presented to the OSH again on [**2164-2-16**] with a fever of 104 and jaundice.
Ultrasound on [**2164-2-16**] showed a 2.3 cm lesion of the right lobe.
ERCP on [**2164-2-17**] showed stricture of the right and left hepatic ducts, left ductal system was accessible and stent was placed.
He had an u/s guided biopsy of a liver lesion on [**2164-2-22**] showing adenocarcinoma.
He has been afebrile since.

Moderate intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation similar to prior OSH scans.
extrahepatic CBD normal size  ERCP: Impression: -Strictured duodenum likely due to extrinsic compression from possible tumor (inflammatory changes alone are also possible) -Stent in the major papilla -Successful removal  of the previously placed.
-Stricturing of the right and left intrahepatic ducts was noted.
It was dilated and multiple biliary radicles were noted without stricture.
-The partially opacified CBD appeared normal with no stricture.
No significant change in metastatic cholangiocarcinom.
However, there is increased thickening of the hepatic flexure and tethering of the colon and duodenum at the level of the mass which may be causing partial gastric outlet obstruction.
Of note, due to delayed gastric emptying, approximately 250 cc of contrast remain in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 84 year old man with CAD, PAF, and DM who recently developed painless jaundice with new liver lesions and E. coli bacteremia who presented with fever, nausea, vomiting and was found to have obstructed bile ducts and a picture suggestive of sepsis/acute cholangitits.
His part of care was in the MICU as he developed hypotension following ERCP.
He also received propofol for sedation during the ERCP which may have contributed to transient hypotension.
In regards to his obstructive jaundice and liver masses, he had strictured duodenum likely due to extrinsic compression from possible tumor and stricturing of the right and left intrahepatic ducts.
The left intrahepatic duct was opened with biliary stent placement.
Sphincterotomy was performed and cytology samples were obtained for histology which was positive for adenocarcinoma.
CBD appeared normal with no stricture.
Of note, his CXR showed very large and multiple calcified lymphnodes.
He had no history of TB or asbestosis or smoking.
We did a CT of the chest to rule out primary or metastatic lung cancer.
The CT showed no evidence of lung malignancy.
GI recommended against colonoscopy as his liver biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma suggestive of cholangicarcinoma.
He should be on aspirin but because of repeated procedures and recurrent biliary bleeding from righ biliary drain, this was on hold.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet and his pain was well controlled.
He was kept NPO and an NG tube was placed due to persistent abdominal distention.
An UGI w/ SBFT was done on HD 19 that showed a narrowing of the first and second portion of the duodenum and delayed gastric emptying due to the gastric outlet obstruction.
TPN was initiated and both both IR and GI attempted to place a GJ through the stricture site but failed.
He became increasingly confused during the admission, and when lucid expressed understanding of the terminal nature of his illness and the desire to be near his wife.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 17181**] Manor Extended Care Facility - [**Location (un) 5503**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute cholangitis Obstructive jaundice, choledocholithiasis, Cholangiocarcinoma(unresectable) Hypothyroidism Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from another hospital with obstuctive jaundice and fever.
After an extensive work up and placement of multiple biliary drains and stents you were found to have an unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.
You were also found to have a stricture at your duodenum that has caused an obstruction.
