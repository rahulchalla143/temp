[**2118-4-26**] CT Abd/Pelvis: Right adrenal gland enlargement and hemorrhage into the surrounding retroperitoneum.
No renal lesion or renal/ureteral stones.
5-mm pulmonary nodule in left lower lobe and 3-mm nodule in left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 49 yo M HTN p/w R adrenal gland bleeding hematoma w/ extension of the bleed into the retroperitonium s/p right adrenal artery coiling/embolization by IR.
His hospital course during this admission is as follows:  1 Adrenal Hemorrhage: unclear why he would have spontaneous adreanl hemorrage; (no known adrenal mass from CT 1 yr ago); He was intubated intially, and taken to IR  s/p IR embolization of right middle adrenal artery for right adrenal gland enlargement and hemorrhage with active extravasation of contrast on presentation into the surrounding retroperitoneum -> successfully extubated on [**2118-4-27**]-> trasnferred to medicine service on [**2118-4-28**]; CT with evidence of R adrenal enlargement w/ surrounding hematoma, difficult to assess whether underlying mass is present and/or whether adrenal enlargement can be completely attributed to bleed (reviewing of the CT scan films again with staff radiologist once on the medicine floor, no adrenal mass seen on CT scan 1 year ago ([**2116**]), and currently adrenal enlargement can be attributed to acute bleeding, recommended follow CT or MRI after resolution of this bleeding 1 month).
On one end, patient with history of poorly controlled HTN x 25 years, however, he is a smoker, obese, poor diet and medication compliance which all can be contributed to his hypertension.
However, given this acute adreanl hemorrhage, raising suspicion for any adrenal mass that may cause this bleed.
Patient without Type B symptoms of weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats to suggest neoplasm, and he tolerated the procedure really well, ambulating and tolerating PO, no complaints of any sort.
He was also recommended to have his PCP schedule an MRI or CT w/ or w/o contrast of his abdomen/pelvis 1 month after discharge to make sure of the resolution of his hematoma and to reassess if there is any adrenal mass that may have caused this bleeding.
If clinically indicated for 2ndary causes of his hypertension, he can have outpt work up for pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, or cushion symdrome (although our suspicion for these 2ndary causes of his hypertension is very low).
2 Anemia -Patient Hct 39.7 on admission, but has a significant Hct drop given his known adreanl and consequent RP hemoorhage, he received 2 untis of pRBCs, and his Hct remained stable and trending up at the time of discharge.
3 HTN - most likely essential HTN (given smoking, obese, poor diet and med compliance, only on 2 agents (CCB and bb) at home); secondary hypertension is less likely, however, given his acute adrenal bleed,  we checked a plasma metanephrin and cortisol level which remained pending at the time of discharge.
He was to have a repeat MRI or CT of abdomen/pelvis 1 months after dishcarge tomake sure resolution of hematoma and assess if any adrenal mass; If clinically indicated for 2ndary causes of his hypertension, he can have outpt work up for pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, or cushion symdrome (although our suspicion for these 2ndary causes of his hypertension is very low).
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Right adrenal gland rupture, hematoma w/ retroperitoneal bleed  Secondary diagnosis: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital sign stable, ambulating, tolerating POs   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for right adrenal gland rupture and bleeding with extension into your retroperionium.
You had a right middle adrenal artery coil and embolization by interventional radiology to prevent further bleeding, and you did well post procedure.
You need to follow up with your PCP next week (see appointment below);  please have your PCP schedule and MRI (preferable) or CT (w/ and w/o contrast) of your abdomen/pelvis to make sure the hematoma resolves in 1 month, and to assess if there is any adrenal mass that may have caused this bleeding.
We encourage you to quit smoking, and continue low salt and low fat diet; .
Please call your doctor or return to the ER for any of the following:  * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
* New or worsening cough or wheezing.
