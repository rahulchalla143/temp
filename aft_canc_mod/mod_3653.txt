He initially presented with a sore throat, dysphagia and anorexia who on fiberoptic laryngoscopy found a large supraglottic mass.
He was admitted to an OSH on [**2111-5-13**] specifically for a G-tube placement due to this large subglottic mass.
His course was c/b ETOH withdrawal requiring benzos prn, then developed PNA with cultures revealing Psedomonas.
He subsequently developed respiratory failure and was initially intubated on [**2111-5-16**], extubated on [**2111-5-25**].
However, he had to reintubated by ENT on [**2111-5-28**] with question of  difficulty reintubating due to supraglottic mass.
He was initially treated with zosyn for his pseudomonal pna, then switched to Ceftaz; Pseudomonal culture sensitivities returned on [**6-8**] and abx were switched to Cefapime and Gent prior to transfer.
His WBC began to rise from 11-->25-->32 with the development of diarrhea which was C-diff + and initially treated with PO vanco then switched to PO flagyl.
While on the medicine service he became tachypneic and hypoxic with O2 sats 70% and transferred back to the MICU.
There are no records of CTA or chest CTs done during this hypoxic event.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of b/l IJ clots R>L and possible XRT to shrink tumor burden.

IMAGING: CT head [**2111-6-9**] - No acute intracranial hemorrhage or masses is seen.
- Large bilateral posterior cervical triangle masses, likely metastatic,   necrotic lymph nodes.
CT chest [**2111-6-9**] - Extensive necrotic lymphadenopathy of the supraclavicular region, with   apparent occlusion of both internal jugular and subclavian veins.
- Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural   effusion, with associated atelectasis involving the entire right lower   lobe.
- Ground-glass opacities throughout the remainder of the lungs are   nonspecific, possibly reflecting edema or infection.
- Axillary lymphadenopathy and borderline mediastinal nodes.
Chest Xray [**2111-6-9**] - Multifocal opacities consistent with pneumonia.
- Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
MRA of neck [**2111-6-12**]: - No evidence of arterial occlusion or invasion identified by large masses   in the neck.
- There is no evidence of occlusion of the superior vena cava seen.
- Partial visualization of both subclavian veins with findings suspicious   for invasion and extension of tumor through the right internal jugular   vein to the junction of right subclavian vein.
Preserved biventricular cavity sizes with normal    global and regional systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo M with large supraglottic SCC here for XRT, s/p trach for resp.
# Supraglottic SCC with potential compression of bilateral IJs on MRI.
He had an almost immediate reaction consisting of facial swelling and erythema after the 1st dose, which is now resolved.
# Respiratory: Pt is currently satting well on trach collar with FiO2 of 35%.
Pt had pseudomonal PNA (s/p 12-day course of meropenem + gentamycin) and large R plueral effusion.
He was previously on intermittent ventilation for temporary desats thought to be related to worsening of pleural effusion off ventilation.
CXR shows large R pleural effusion with some increased organization/consolidation; this has been stable.
Effusion is likely due to lymphedema and will most likely reaccumulate if drained.
He did have copious white trach secretions (req suction q1h) at the time but now has greatly decreased.
# RUE DVT, seen on US: - Cont.
Hyponatremia/hyperkalemia FeUrea = ~45%.
Differential diagnosis: SIADH (pulmonary, SSC,) vs. adrenal insufficiency vs. hypothyroidism (all not very much likely since they have been present for a long time and hyponatremia now new).
Random cortisol level relatively high, and now off dex since [**6-15**] --> suggests adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
Most likely diagnosis is therefore iatrogenic due to IV meds and diuresis without adequate Na replacement.
Meeting must be attended with patient's brother.
At the same time, he expresses wishes to continue radiation/chemo for disease palliation.
He also appears to have a depressed affect.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: supraglottic SCC respiratory failure pneumonia RUE DVT pleural effusion c.diff infection   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You are being transfere back to the VA [**Hospital 1268**] hospital after being transfered from that facility in order to receive radiation treatment for you cancer of the tongue.
The initial round of treatment showed a successful response, and the choice of whether to receive additonal treatment will be deceided in a future follow up next week.
Your hospitalization has been complicated by respiratory distress due to both obstruction of your airway due to your cancer and pneumonia.
