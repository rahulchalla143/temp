She describes the chest pain as "like an elephant standing on her chest".
She notes that it is associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness.
Symptoms persisted over last three weeks with increased fatigue and weakness.
She also notes waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] feversv(Tm 100-101), productive cough and 18 pound weight loss during this time.
At the [**Hospital 11074**] clinic on [**7-8**], a chest x-ray was done which was significant for mediastinal widening.
At [**Hospital1 1562**], a Chest CT showed diffuse mediastinal adenopathy and multiple pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly.
An echo showed small- moderate pericardial effusion and increased tuerculation in RV apex c/w RVA thrombus.
She was sent for a chest and abdominal CT which suggested a 5x4 cm mediastinal mass with precarinal lymph nodes, multiple smaller nodules throughout both lungs and a small-moderate pericardial effusion.
The patient denies headaches/abdominal pain/melena/hematochezia/ change in bowel movements/dysuria.
The patient does note 10 year history of perimenopausal symptoms - fatigue, myalgias, hot flashes, low grade temps.

Small axillary lymph nodes do not meet the criteria for pathologic enlargement and measure up to 6 mm in size.
A large mediastinal mass, which measures up to 5.4 x 4.7 cm in axial dimension, which extends from the right paratracheal region at the level of the thoracic inlet to the precarinal lesion is present with central regions of hypodensity suggesting necrotic change.
In addition, there is an enlarged 4.5 x 2.5 cm subcarinal lymph node.
Bulkiness in the right hilum is present as well.
Examination of the lung windows demonstrate a dominant 13 x 11 mm nodule within the right upper lobe, with a satellite lesion in the subpleural right apex measuring 7 mm in size.
In addition, there is a 5 mm nodular region in the subpleural right lower lobe, which has well- defined forbers.
The right lower lobe demonstrates mild atelectasis, possibly with a smaller degree of consolidation as well.
There is a trace right-sided pleural effusion.
The left lung is essentially clear, without evidence of pleural effusion.
There are some peripheral blebs suggestive of paraseptal emphysema.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for the noncontrast technique, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and small bowel appear unremarkable.
Adrenal glands are not clearly visualized due to the lack of IV contrast, and no bulky lymphadenopathy is the retroperitoneum or mesentery is noted.
There is no abdominal free fluid present.
Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes.
These have hypodense central regions suggestive or necrosis.
These would be most ammenable for transbronchial biopsy.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cervical cancer with pulmonary nodule and mediastinal mass and patient allergic to IV contrast for CT, for further evaluation to exclude metastatic disease.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
FINDINGS: In the right posterofrontal lobe, there are two small areas of signal abnormality seen within on the FLAIR images, one laterally along the anterior aspect of the central sulcus and the second superiorly to the posterior frontal lobe near the midline.
No other focal abnormalities are identified.
Specifically, no evidence of periventricular signal abnormalities are seen.
No evidence for midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.
IMPRESSION: Foci of signal abnormalities in the right frontal lobe with enhancement.
The differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease and demyelinating process, given patient's age.
However, given the clinical history and the location of the lesions, metastatic disease is considered more likely.
Brief Hospital Course: 37 year old female with h/o cervical cancer s/p TAH transferred from outside hospital with progressive chest discomfort, SOB, and weight loss with Left popliteal DVT, possible PE and chest xray/ CT evidence of mediastinal mass and multiple bilateral nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary nodules - On admission a chest xray suggested a small focal opacity in right upper lobe and right paratracheal opacity.
A chest CT the following day suggested a large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes with hypodense central regions suggestive of necrosis.
It also showed multiple nodules, two spiculated lung nodules at right lung apex.
These lesions were most consistent with lung cancer versus lymphoma so a mediastinoscopy was planned.
On [**7-11**] she had a MRI-brain, which showed two foci of signal abnormalities in the right frontal lobe with enhancement.
No edema or mass effect was seen secondary to the brain lesions.
Non-small cell lung cancer - Multiple necrotic lymph nodes radiographically and grossly, MRI of the brain with focal right frontal brain mets; and a 1 by 1 inch paraspinal hard, rubbery lesion on her Left upper back; presentation consistent with metastatic NSCLC.
Patient was told her diagnosis with her mother and grandfather in the room.
On the last day of admission, the patient noted blurriness in left periphery; no deficit on visual fields or neuro exam; the patient was advised to have a head ct to reevaluate for mass effect or bleeding in the brain lesions, but she refused and wanted to go home with no further treatment.
The patient's shortness of breath was stable during the admission; she required 2L oxygen especially during long conversations; the patient will be sent home on home oxygen.
Hypercoagulable state - DVT/PE/?RV thrombus - echo at outside hospital also with possible thrombus in RV; pt obviously hypercoagulable most likely secondary to primary lung malignancy; she was maintained on heparin throughout the admission and was switched to Lovenox and underwent Lovenox administration teaching prior to discharge  3.
Pericardial effusion - found on echo at [**Hospital1 **]; stable on chest CT at [**Hospital1 18**].Most likely secondary to the primary lung malignancy; patient did not experience any decreases in blood pressure, increased shortness of breath, or increased chest pain during the admission.
SHe was monitored throughout the admission for tamponade physiology and did not present with any.
Fevers - low grade throughout admission; most likely secondary to the malignancy; fungal, blood cultures were negative; lyme antibody was negative; patient never mounted an increased white blood cell count.
Pain/Nausea - The patient had back and chest (pleural) pain throughout the admission well controlled PRN dilaudid q 3-4 hours.
She was started on a fentanyl patch for pain on [**2161-7-13**] with dilaudid for breakthrough.
SHe also noted increased nausea with the dilaudid which was well controlled with phenergan.
After the mediastinoscopy, she had increased throat pain which was relieved with viscous lidocaine.
10 year hisory of perimenopausal symptoms - FSH, LH within normal limits; no further work-up during the admission  7.
PPX - She was maintained on a multivitamin and zantac during the admission with colace and senna to releive constipation in the setting of narcotics.)
Lidocaine HCl 2 % Solution Sig: One (1) ML Mucous membrane Q3-4H () as needed for throat pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-small cell lung cancer Left popliteal deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please go the the emergency department if you have increasing shortness of breath or chest pain or if you have worsening blurry vision or headaches.
