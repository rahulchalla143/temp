The pregnancy was notable for IVF twins; breech/transverse fetal positioning, and maternal hypothyroidism (on Synthroid).
Despite attempted tocolysis, labor continued and the infant was delivered by C-section due to fetal positioning.
Maternal anesthesia was spinal.
Perinatal sepsis risk factors include prematurity, preterm labor and unknown maternal GBS status or colonization.
No maternal fever.

Echo on day of     life #10 showed no PDA.No murmur heard currently.
Although infant was taking good volumes she     remained in hospital until her suck/swallow and breathing     were well coordinated, without choking, bradycardia or     desaturation.The infant is also on iron.
Recent hematocrit on day of     life #42 was 33.8 with a reticulocyte count of 5.4.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The infant initially had a 48-hour     rule out on day of life #2 with a negative blood culture,     and day of life #13 another 48-hour rule out sepsis with     a negative blood culture for temperature instability.
SKIN: [**Known lastname **] had a bluish area over her sternum that increased in size over time.
On the surface we measured it at 2x2 cms.It was described as being in the subcutaneous tissue with substantial vascularity and thought to be consistent with a hemangioma.
