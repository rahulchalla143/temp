Extremities: Upper extremity non-pitting edema L>R.
LE with non pitting edema bilat.
Skin:  Warm, No Rash Neurologic: Unresponsive off sedation.
No purposeful response to deep nail-bed pressure in upper or lower extremities.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification within the vertebral arteries and carotid siphons.
No loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute infarct.
There is fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Small ventricles.
EEG ([**5-12**]): ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow and disorganized pattern in the theta and delta range for the beginning of this recording with no clear lateralized features and with bursts of sharp waves in a generalized distribution with bifrontal predominance and sometimes also more focal sharp waves in the right frontal area.
This time, there were clear sharp and slow wave complexes seen in the right frontal area.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the above-mentioned bursts of sharp waves in the right frontal region as well as in the left frontal region and more widely distributed over both hemispheres with bifrontal  predominance.
During this event, the background activity was relatively of high voltage with sharp waves seen most prominently in the right frontal area reaching a frequency of 2 Hz for some of the time; however, there was no clear build-up of activity seen during this event.
However, there was no clear build-up of seizure activity during this event.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured three pushbutton activations for two episodes of eyelid twitching correlated with somewhat rhythmic sharper activity seen bifrontally, more on the right, with no clear build-up of ictal activity.
However, it also showed independent right more than left frontal sharp waves and sometimes more generalized sharp waves with bifrontal predominance.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to some dyssynchrony as well as hypokinesis of the basal septum.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The degree of mitral regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
ECHO TEE ([**5-18**]): No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The degree of mitral regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The gastroesophageal junction was not traversed due to gastric ulcer and clot visualized on EGD prior to TEE.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Bilateral small extra-axial proteinaceous collections, likely representing subdural effusions also support this hypothesis.
Central cerebral atrophy is present along with diffuse cortical atrophy with an "etat crible" appearance of ex vacuo dilatation of Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] spaces, centrally.
Moderate confluent periventricular white matter high-signal intensity on FLAIR imaging is most consistent with moderate chronic microvascular infarction.
Deep white matter and subcortical white matter high signal intensity surrounding the ventriculostomy tract on FLAIR sequence may represent a component of chronic white matter changes relating to catheter placement.
However, no evidence of blooming to suggest associated hemorrhage is detected.
No focus of restricted diffusion is present to suggest acute ischemia.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.
No specific finding to suggest anoxic/hypoxic brain injury.
Slit-like ventricles and thin bilateral extra- axial collections, likely subdural effusions, raise the possibility of "overshunting" in this setting.
Moderately severe age-related cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular infarction.
EEG ([**5-15**]): ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow and disorganized background in the delta and theta range most of the time alternating with bursts of rapid suppression of the background lasting for one to three seconds.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no clear epileptiform activity.
There was no epileptiform activity seen.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured three pushbutton activations for unclear events with no change in the background activity.
There was no ictal activity seen in this recording.
Interictally, there were infrequent sharp waves seen in the right parasagittal area.
The background activity had a burst suppression pattern for most of the recording, suggestive of a widespread moderate to severe encephalopathy, and focal slowing was seen in the right parasagittal area.
Portable CXR ([**5-16**]): PFI: New large left-sided pneumothorax and collapse of the left lung.
The left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, as well as one of the two brachial veins and the proximal left cephalic and basilic veins demonstrate occlusive thrombus with no evidence of flow.
Persistent small left pneumothorax.
Right greater than left moderate-sized pleural effusion.
Probable hemangioma in the liver.
Coronary artery calcification and mitral valve replacement.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.

# Altered mental status/unresponsiveness - Pt had recent intraventricular hemorrhage in the setting of anticoagulation for which she had been admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] and now was at a nursing home/rehab.
Pt's daughter reports that she is mentally clear, without dementia at baseline and was in her usual state of mental wellness one hour prior to becoming unresponsive on day of admission.
She was found to be profoundly hypoglycemic at time of presentation which could explain both her altered level of consciousness and PEA arrest.
A head CT was done that showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.
Neurology was consulted and performed an EEG that showed burst suppression pattern suggestive of encephalopathy but also showed independent right more than left frontal sharp waves and sometimes more generalized sharp waves with bifrontal predominance.
She was therefore started on phenytoin for possible seizure activity.
Over the next several days, patient had no improvement in neurological functional status with complete abscence of purposeful movements and no withdrawal to pain.
Concern was for hypoxic injury given prior PEA arrest therefore MRI was done which showed no evidence of ischemia.
MRI did show slit-like ventricles and findings suggestive of chronic over-shunting therefore Neurosurgery was consulted however did not feel that intervention was warranted.
Patient had no evidence of neurological recovery during 10 day hospital course with no purposeful movements and fixed pupils and neurology felt that this represented irreversible neurologic damage.
She failed spontaneous breathing trial on [**5-23**] secondary to episodes of apnea and a tracheostomy was placed on [**2124-5-25**].
# Pneumothorax: On hospital day #5, a portable chest X-ray was performed to evaluate for pulmonary infiltrate due to low grade temperature and rising leukocytosis.
No infiltrate was identified however a large left sided pneumothorax was identified.
A  left-sided subclavian line had been placed 5 days previously; subsequent films had been negative for pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax stabilized radiographically and pigtail catheter was removed on [**5-23**] with stable chest X-rays after removal.
# s/p Cardiac arrest: Trop leak and worsening ST depressions on EKG at OSH prior to arrival.
She underwent endoscopy upon arrival with identification of large adherent clot in the fundus below the GE junction.
The clot was not removed given that no active bleeding was identified.
Had melena subsequent to procedure, but no epsiodes of hematemesis and hematocrit remained stable.
On [**5-24**] she underwent repeat EGD which showed NO residual clot.
# s/p MVR (MECHANICAL VALVE): Had previously beeen anti-coagulated for what had been documented as a porcine valve; however, on arrival INR was subtherapeutic s/p FFP and vitamin K at OSH for acute UGIB.
Anti-coagulation was not reinitiated initially given that she had acute GI bleed and anti-coagulation would not be indicated for porcine valve.
# LUE and Iliac DVT:  The patient was noted to have LUE swelling on exam and subsequent LENI revealed a LUE DVT.
She was incidentally noted to have a iliac DVT on abdominal CT scan.
She was initially found to have MRSA bacteremia at OSH on [**2124-5-11**].
She has been pan-cultured mulitple times during this admission and never had positive blood, sputum, stool or urine cultures at [**Hospital1 18**].
Given her clot burden and mechanical valve, it was thought that the endovascular infection is the most likely cause of her recurrent fevers.
# Diabetes Mellitus, Type II: The patient is on a insulin sliding scale with long acting insulin and her fingersticks have been well controlled, ranging 100-176 in the past 24hrs.
# Hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH of 8 with slightly low free T 4 (0.9).
She is hypervolemic because of all of the fluids she has been given during this hospitalization.
She is quite volume overloaded on exam given that all her medications and fluids have been IV over the past 2 weeks.
Phenytoin 130 mg IV 0000AM Duration: 7 Days Last dose on [**5-31**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PEA Arrest Upper GI bleed Encephalopathy Hypoglycemia Pneumothorax Respiratory failure  Secondary diagnoses: -Bladder Cancer dx [**2123-11-4**] awaiting surgery postponed for numerous cardiac complications - Mitral Valve Replacment (St. Jude valve) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 82257**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**2124-2-21**] - Intraventricular Hemmorhage on [**4-19**] while being bridged with lovenox for bladder surgery, per report, intraventricular hemorrhage in the posterior aspect of right lateral ventricle, at [**Hospital1 2025**], hemorrhage within both lateral ventricles - Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy - Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Diabetes Mellitus Type II, dx ~[**2092**] - Congestive Heart Failure - Diabetic retinopathy - Peripheral Neuropathy - s/p Bilateral Cataract Surgery - Glaucoma - s/p Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed [**2094**] for hydrocephalus - h/o GIB [**2-21**] duodenal polyps   Discharge Condition: Very poor prognosis.
She was found to have a very low blood sugar and bleeding from her stomach.
She had a cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) and required palcement of a bretahing tube to help her breathe.
After several days, she had still not started to recover her mental function.
She had extensive evaluation by neurology and has a very poor prognosis for neurologic recovery.
Her hospitalization was complicated by MRSA bacteremia and LUE and iliac clot.
