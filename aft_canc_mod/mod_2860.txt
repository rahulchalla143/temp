The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] on [**2142-9-24**] complaining of 2 days of with SOB, cough, orthopnea and was thought to have a RLL infiltrate then treated for PNA.
She ultimatly was found to have positive troponins and had a diagnostic cathertization 90% LCx at [**Hospital3 1280**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI.
Past Medical History: DM II h/o GI bleed CHF AVR cirrhosis [**1-15**] hemochromatosis   Social History: Very active.
Neck: No thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
10cm JVD Chest: Her chest rose and fell with equal size, shape and symmetry, her lungs had bilateral crackles.
CV: PMI appreciated in the fifth ICS in the midclavicular line without heaves or thrills, RRR, normal S1 and loud S2.
[**1-19**] harsh systolic murmur Abd: Normoactive BS, NT and ND.
No masses or organomegaly Back: No spinal or CVA tenderness.
Ext: NO cyanosis, no clubbing or edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally Integument: no rash Neuro: CN II-XII symmetrically intact, PERRLA.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 78 year old woman intubated for CHF after cardiac cath.
AP CHEST: There are no studies for comparison.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
There is prominenc of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema.
Portable technique limits evaluation of the cardiac size.
No pneumothorax.
ECG: Atrial fibrillation Abnormal extreme QRS axis deviation - due to extensive myocardial infarctions Right bundle branch block Old inferior infarct Anterolateral infarct - age undetermined Generalized low QRS voltages No previous tracing  CATH: COMMENTS:   1.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The LAD had no flow-limiting lesions.
Resting hemodynamics showed central aortic hypertension.
Successful stenting of the LCX with a 3.5 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Respiratoty:  The patient had a Cypher stent placed without incident but then developed increased SOB after the case and was intubated for an ABG of 7.14/89/89.
She then had hypotension at the time and improved on dopamine which was quickly weaned.
During the intubation, the patient also had bleeding from the posterior nasopharynx [**1-15**] to NGT placement attempt.
After she was transferred to the floor, she had a slight O2 requirement that decreased with gentle diuresis.
Pump: The patient has preserved systolic function with diastolic failure possibly due to hemochromotosis or HTN.
The patient developed flash pulmonary edema as described above.
Rhythm:  The patient was in atrial fibriollation and was restarted on anticoagulation for stroke ppx.
Bleeding: The patient had a bleeding epidose in the setting of intergrillin after the cath which was described above.
The patient had an extensive workup inculding a bleeding scan which did not reveal a cause for her mutiple episodes of melana.
