Hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure  On admission to OMED service, he had acute renal failure with crn from 1.0 to max of 2.0, likely secondary to pre-renal azotemia with blood loss.
His chemistry was also significant for a new increased anion gap  metabolic acidosis on admission.
His ABG was significant for an increased anion gap acidosis with concomitant respiratory alkalosis.
All of this was consistent with hypovolemia.
Also of concern was sepsis as explanation for these metabolic abnormalities.
Potential sources would include his known UTI, SBP of his ascites; there was no evidence of infiltrate on CXR.
