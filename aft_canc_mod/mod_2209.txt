The patient denied any associated fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion or headaches.
This study revealed moderate diffuse abdominal and pelvic ascites.
There was an asymmetric fullness of the left adnexa.
Serum CA 125 level was found to be elevated at 746.
She noted a mild improvement of her symptoms after the paracentesis, however now reports increasing discomfort due to further abdominal distention.
Mild to moderate aortic stenosis; mild aortic regurgitation; moderate tricuspid regurg; moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (TTE done [**2166-12-19**]).
Patient hospitalized twice ([**2162**], [**2165**]) with CP which resolved with SL NTG; see most recent stress test below.

They appear to have increased central pallor, with scattered polychromatophils present.
Abnormal forms including target cells, ecchinocytes, and elliptocytes are also present.
Differential count shows 69% neutrophils, 5% monocytes, 2%lymphocytes, 1% basophils, 3% atypical mononuclear cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles within deep blue cytoplasm.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and shows several cellular spicules with many stripped nuclei.
Erythroid precursors are present in mildly megaloblastoid maturation.
There are large cells with intensely blue cytoplasm with vacuoles.
Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and demonstrates a fragmented cellular core (overall cellularity of 20-30%).
There are increased plasma cells and mast cells.
There is an eosinophilic background.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring in small clusters occupying 20% of marrow cellularity.
RADIOGRAPHIC DATA: CXR [**2166-12-22**]: There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarseness of interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
Apical pleural thickening bilaterally, more prominent on the right, consistent with old granulomatous disease.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Loss of height of a mid dorsal vertebra, most likely on a postmenopausal basis.
THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE OF CHRONIC TUBERCULOSIS OR ANOTHER CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS INFECTION.
BILATERAL CALCIFIED PLEURAL PLAQUES, WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY ALSO RELATED TO A CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS INFECTION.
SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.
9 MM LUCENT LESION IN THE LEFT GLENOID WITHOUT AGGRESSIVE FEATURES, WHICH MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS A SUBCHONDRAL CYST.
MODERATE COMPRESSION DEFORMITIES OF THE VERTEBRAL BODIES OF T7 AND T12, OF UNKNOWN CHRONICITY.
THERE IS ASYMMETRIC FULLNESS OF THE LEFT PELVIC ADNEXA BUT NO DEFINITE MASS IS IDENTIFIED.
SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.
OLD GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE.
The study is inadequate to fully assess aortic valve, however mild stenosis is suggested based on two-dimensional images.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Calcific aortic valve disease with mild regurgitation and probable mild stenosis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the resting portion of the prior stress study (images unavailable for review) of [**2163-9-9**], tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are now seen.
[**2167-1-2**] LE Ultrasound: The examination was negative for DVT in the lower extremities.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity and more focal left upper lobe subpleural opacity.
Findings most likely reflect an infectious process or drug-related alveolitis.
Interval progression of diffuse ground-glass opacity, which remains most consistent with an infectious process such as a viral or atypical pneumonia, or drug-reaction.
No pleural effusion.
Calcified pleural plaques and interstitial lung disease, may represent asbestos-related disease.
[**2167-1-25**] Shoulder film: Three views of the right shoulder demonstrate some mild degenerative changes with small osteophytes but no fracture is identified.
As seen in the chest CT from the prior day there is right apical pleural plaque and increased interstitial markings on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old female transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with CT findings of ascites, omental thickening, and left adnexal fullness, as well as an elevated CA-125, concerning for ovarian cancer versus primary peritoneal cancer, found to have Burkitt's lymphoma as well as likely peritoneal TB.
# Burkitt's Lymphoma: Patient was originally admitted to the gynecologic service for possible ovarian cancer.
Patient underwent CT guided mesenteric biopsy which demonstrated high proliferation fraction and lack of Bcl-2 expression consistent with Burkitt's Lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated MILDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND REACTIVE (POLYCLONAL) PLAMACYTOSIS, but did not show evidence of lymphoma.
Bone marrow acid-fast stain was negative for microorganisms.
MRI demonstrated no discrete lymphadenopathy and findings consistent with anasarca.
Pt completed part A of [**Last Name (un) 43427**] but was complicated by sepsis requiring ICU admission.
# Volume overload: The patient presented with ascites, lower extremity edema and pulmonary edema.
# Hypoxia: Initially, on the floor the patient required NRB for O2 sat 90-94%.
Pulmonary and cardiac shunt essentially negative: LENI negative, ECHO bubble no intra-cardiac shunt, V/Q scan indeterminate secondary to volume overload (unable to do CTA in setting of renal failure with lysis).
EKG showed no acute changes.
Thought to be secondary to fluid overload and atelectasis.
Hypoxia improved significantly with diuresis.
However, hypoxia returned days later without significant evidence of volume overload and concurrent fevers.
CT chest was performed showing diffuse ground glass opacities.
Pt became hypotensive, hypoxic, and febrile.
Pt underwent a broncoscopy on [**1-26**] for evaluation of persistant ground glass opacities.
# Peritoneal TB: The patient had a history of active TB (demonstrated on CT chest) without adequate treatment.
She ruled out for pulmonary TB with > 4 sputum samples negative for AFB.
# Hep B exposure: Patient surface antibody positive, viral load negative.
