Cardiology was consulted and recommended transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no abnormality.
Cardiology attributed this arrythmia to fever and inflammation and recommended a beta-blocker which was started.
Due to the degree of the patients abdominal distention preoperatively, distal aspect of the midline surgical incision adjacent to the ileoileostomy was not closely appropriately and was opened at the bedside and packed with a wet to dry dressing to be changed three times daily.
