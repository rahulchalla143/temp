She has had ongoing low back and leg pain which has not improved.
The patient is unable to give an accurate history because "the pain so bad, don't ask me any questions."
She denies any chest pain, SOB, or other symptoms.
She relates pain "through my legs and low back," which may have been worse over the past day or so.
She was given Dilaudid for pain control.
HTN Dyslipidemia Chronic right foot ulcer  Social History: Widowed, lives alone, and has one daughter.

Probable mild increase in enhancing epidural soft tissue, posterior to L5 through S3 vertebrae without evidence of canal stenosis.
Persistent enhancing soft tissue within the right psoas, anterior to the L5-S1 interspace, and surrounding the L5 nerve roots bilaterally.
L5/S1 Osteomyelitis: The patient was admitted for evaluation and treatment of her severe low back pain.
Repeat lumbar MRI was performed and compared with her study from six week prior; there was note of continued osteomyelitis and discitis at L5-S1, with slight interval increase in irregularity and T2 hyperintensity within the L5-S1 disc space.
There was probable mild increase in enhancing epidural soft tissue, posterior to L5 through S3 vertebrae and persistent enhancing soft tissue within the right psoas.
The pathology revealed bony changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.
Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 0.6 on admission.
She had a hypotensive episode prior to surgery which resulted in a MICU admission.
This was thought secondary to post-operative hypovolemia.
This was thought to be secondary to ATN from her hypotensive episode.
She also had a hypotensive episode prior to surgery.
She had a small NSTEMI at that time.
She underwent persantine mibi which demonstarted a moderate fixed inferior wall defect that was unchanged from prior study.
She also had global hypokinesis.
The LAD had patent proximal- to mid-vessel stents, and mild diffuse disease up to 40% otherwise.
The Left circumflex had a 40% proximal lesion, and was then occluded in the mid-portion.
A large OM1 branch had a 50% lesion proximally.
There was a 15-mmHg gradient across the aortic valve during simultaneous measurement of central arterial and LV pressures, consistent with mild aortic stenosis.
No interventions were performed ID had recommended that no stents be deployed as the plavix requirement would have delayed her necessary back surgery.
POBA would have been performed, but there were no lesions amenable to this treatment.
Congestive heart failure: Following her surgery and her acute renal failure episodes, the patient was noted to have worsening oxygenation and she developed SOB.
Chest x ray revealed congestive heart failure.
Peripheral vascular disease: the patient complained of severe pain in her lower extremities.
She has known severe PVD and is s/p left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft.
They felt that she continues to have severe PVD and requires additional vascular interventions, but that her PVD was not the etiology of her leg pain.
Back and lower extremity pain: the patient was noted to have severe low back pain and bilateral lower extremity pain.
It could not clearly be attributed to the osteomyelitis or the PVD.
This still only provided moderate pain control.
On  [**7-5**] she had acute change in mental status and was arousable only to sternal rub.
She was given narcan with some improvement in her mental status.
The etiology of her depressed mental status is likely multifactorial and included excessive sedation from opiates and delirium.
CLL: The patient has a chronically elevated WBC count in the 20s.
Hallucinations: In addition to her depressed mental status, the patient suffered from hallucinations.
She had trace OB positive stool from below.
The cause of her drop in her hematocrit was not found.
She should have a colonoscopy as an outpatient if her clinical course goes well.
It was thought that the Linezolid may have caused some of her thrombocytopenia.
Skin breakdown: The patient had mild skin breakdown on sacrum and left elbow.
She was given an air mattress and wound care was consulted.
She had had prophylaxis instituted to prevent heel ulcerations as well.
