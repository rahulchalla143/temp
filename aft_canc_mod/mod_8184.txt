After a Gastroenterology workup, it was eventually found that she had a malignant-appearing lesion in the proximal ascending colon with some arteriovenous malformations, and a cecal polyp, and diverticulosis.
After examining the patient and reviewing the images, it was felt that a right colectomy would be the best course of treatment for this patient given her cardiac history.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  In terms of her admission laboratories, as noted, when she came in her hematocrit was 19.3 at first check; for which she had multiple transfusions.
Otherwise, she was in no acute distress.
She had a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur, but was otherwise clear.
Her abdomen was soft and nondistended.
There was no hepatomegaly or ascites fluid wave appreciated.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's initial hospital course, as noted above, but on [**2152-3-17**] after cardiac clearance she underwent a right colectomy without note in intraoperative complications or excessive blood loss.
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for close monitoring of her hemodynamic status and her cardiac status.
She actually did fairly well while she was in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and did not have any notable cardiac events.
