Admission Date: [**2182-7-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2182-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-1-4**]        Sex:  F  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome transformed into acute myelogenous leukemia (type M6A) diagnosed one month ago who was initially admitted for treatment with low-dose Ara-C and Hydroxyurea.
Her disease was initially diagnosed secondary to pancytopenia with circulating blast forms and a bone marrow in [**2182-5-9**].
She was initially treated with Procrit and weekly transfusions with packed red blood cells and Danazol from which she developed an allergic reaction.
Over the last week prior to admission, she developed increased fatigue.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above, history of myelodysplastic syndrome transformed into acute myelogenous leukemia.
No prior surgeries or prior hospitalizations.
ALLERGIES:  DANAZOL (causes facial swelling and periorbital edema).
FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA ISSUES:  The patient had fevers up to    103 as well as neutropenia.
AmBisome was eventually started for    continued fevers, but then discontinued secondary to acute    renal failure and switched to voriconazole.
Vancomycin levels have been very elevated and was being dosed by levels.
Urine cultures from [**7-28**] grew 10:100,000 enterococcus with sensitivities pending.
She    continued to have a slow gastrointestinal bleed.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient developed hypotension    with mean arterial pressures in the 40s; asymptomatic.
The    differential diagnoses included sepsis, gastrointestinal    bleed, excessive losses from fever and rash as well as    capillary leak syndrome.
She was started on low-dose    dopamine for renal perfusion.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient developed acute    renal failure with a creatinine of up to 3.2.
The likely insult was hypotension in the setting    of a gastrointestinal bleed.
Urine also showed eosinophils -    possible acute interstitial nephritis from multiple drugs.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was continued on albuterol    and Atrovent nebulizers for chronic obstructive pulmonary    disease seen on computerized axial tomography with a    longstanding history of smoking.
RASH ISSUES:  The patient developed a diffuse erythematous    blanching rash which was likely secondary to drug effect -    cefepime versus vancomycin.
ACCESS ISSUES:  Hickman catheter and peripheral lines.
