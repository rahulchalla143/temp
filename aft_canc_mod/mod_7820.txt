HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42-year-old right-handed woman, with a history of hypertension, diabetes and CML in her chronic phase.
She has been having right arm symptoms for the past three or four weeks.
She reports that she started having right arm tingling and numbness which rapidly progressed to her right hand in seconds, followed immediately by right hand involuntary shaking.
She also has had post event tiredness.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke.
Her father had seizures while elderly.
Mental status exam - she is mildly inattentive.
Motor system - mild right pronator drift.
Weakness of the right wrist and finger extensors.
IMPRESSION:  A 42-year-old female with what appear to be focal seizures and a possible [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis.
Our concerns were for seizures versus stroke.
MRI obtained at the time of admission showed multiple small acute and subacute infarcts.
She had diffusion weighted imaging restriction in several areas of her left middle cerebral artery distribution following both the cortical and subcortical region, some of which were also positive on FLAIR, indicating a subacute presentation.
There was no evidence of chronic or acute hemorrhage.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Head MRI shows a flow signal graph in the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries bilaterally, loss of flow signal in both proximal and middle cerebral arteries, left greater than right, with occlusive disease suggested in the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
MRA imaging of her carotid arteries was also performed on [**3-4**] which showed no evidence of high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis.
During her admission, she subsequently developed an expressive aphasia with right hemiplegia.
On exam on [**3-2**], she was started on a heparin drip because of concerns for arterial stenosis.
Cranial nerve exam was significant for a very mild right facial weakness.
The EEG shows persistently focal, moderately severe slow wave abnormality in the left hemisphere, but no clear epileptiform discharges.
She also had an echocardiogram obtained on [**3-2**] which showed a very tiny patent foramen ovale which was present at rest.
The source of the bleed for her was discovered to be from her GI system.
A bleeding study was done with technetium-99 and showed that there was no evidence of acute GI hemorrhage, but GI was consulted and would like to see her in follow-up for a GI endoscopy.
Also, we held her diabetes medicines, but they should be restarted when she is an outpatient.
Because the patient showed a gradual and steady improvement, she was transferred to the floor on [**3-6**].
She had no right-left confusion, although she did have some extinction to double-simultaneous stimuli on right visual fields.
Her speech was not fluent or spontaneous.
She did have some paraphasic errors and a low-frequency object anomia.
She had difficulty following multistep commands.
