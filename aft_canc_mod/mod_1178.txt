He had presented earlier in the year with obstructive jaundice and a He was initially evaluated and cared for by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He had significant hemobilia at that time which was proven by ERCP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes and hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
A biopsy was taken of the mass which later revealed gallbladder adenocarcinoma.
He additionally was found to have a mucopurulent gallbladder wall.
Postoperative day #1 the patient was actually planned to be discharged home on empiric antibiotics but he developed a new arrhythmia which was consistent with atrial tachycardia or another SVT with a new right bundle branch block.
On postoperative day #2 he had ongoing problems controlling his rate.
He continued to require beta blockers for rate control.
When the patient's blood pressure became low, 70/44, the patient was cardioverted and loaded with Amiodarone and transferred to the SICU.
He did have intermittent episodes of SVT but none of them were sustained.
However, several hours after he had been transferred to medicine, the patient had an episode of hematemesis of bright red blood.
After discussion with his primary care physician it was decided that since his cancer carries such a poor prognosis, there is no point in subjecting him to long-term anticoagulation with the inherent risk of recurrent bleeds.
It was decided that although he may intermittently go into atrial fibrillation, we should send him home and give him as much time as possible with his family.
Atrial fibrillation.
