Admission Date:  [**2149-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-4-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement (Right)   History of Present Illness: 61 yo male with hx AML, s/p 7+3 induction chemo with idarubicin and cytarabine (Day 1=[**2149-11-23**]), complicated aspergillus pneumonia tx with voriconazole.
Also, pt found to have a newly depressed EF to 30-40% with focal hypokinesis.
He now presents with a chief complaint of chest pain starting this morning.
He describes the pain as dull/pressure, focused in the center of his chest, [**7-7**].
It was non-radiating and associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, but no dizziness, palpitations, nausea or vomiting.
Of note, he had similar chest pain several months ago while raking leaves (pain resolved on its own at that time).
Trop T was elevated to 0.12 and EKG showed no ischemic changes.
Per nursing report prior to transfer the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic when standing up.
He denied any chest pain or pressure but did report feeling unable to take a deep breath and feeling intermittent chills/rigors throughout the afternoon.
Additionally, he reported dysuria starting this morning.
He denied GI sx or productive cough.
His EKG showed some mild STE vs J point elevation changes in the anterior leads, cardiology felt it was not consistent with a instent thormbosis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies GI sx, no hematuria or prior dsyuria other than today, no cough, no vision changes, no neck stiffness.
Had a mild HA today.
-Tobacco history: denies -ETOH: denies -Illicit drugs: denies   Family History: Brother with AML s/p transplant here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2145**].
Father with a history of "multiple small heart attacks," but died in his 80s.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
2+ pulses LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, inferior septum, anterior free wall, lateral wall, and apex.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
There were separate ostia for the LAD and LCx.
The LAD had a 60-70% proximal eccentric lesion, a total occlusion of the mid-LAD and a 50-60% lesion of the diagonal branch.
The LCs had a 40% stenosis in a large OM and a 60-70% stenosis in the smaller distal LCx into the OM2.
There was a large patent ramus.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenoses.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
No focal abscess or overt infection in the abdomen or pelvis.
Interval development of bilateral moderate pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, left greater than right.
Area of focal consolidation vs mass in the left upper lobe as previously identified is not encompassed by today's study, however, is evident on scout radiograph.
Multiple bilateral sub-4 mm pulmonary nodules are better demonstrated on prior CT from [**2149-12-13**].
9-mm hypodense liver lesion is too small to fully characterize but likely represents a cyst.
Focal fatty infiltration in anterior left lobe of liver.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo m with hx of AML, s/p 7+3 induction chemo c/b presumed fungal pneumonia treated with voriconazole, and reduced EF (30-40%), CAD s/p PCI with BMS x3 in LAD([**2149-12-24**]) who now presents with chest pain and fevers/tachycardia.
# Fever/Leukocytosis/tachycardia: Pt had SIRS criteria, new leukocytosis and rigors on admission.
Pt has known lingular opacity seen on prior imaging last week, as well as OSH imaging that confirmed this finding that in the past was thought to be a Aspergillus infection, since the Ag was positive and B-glucan was present.
He denies GI sx, however, did have C. diff infection on [**2149-12-2**], and just completed flagyl 2 days prior to infection.
Also had mild hypotension concerning for sepsis at the time of admission.
He initially required an ICU stay for management of his hypotension and sepsis, he was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for a hospital acquired pneumonia and also continued on prior voriconazole.
# CAD, chest pain: As above, patient s/p PCI with BMS to LAD several days prior to admission, now with chest pain and elevated troponin.
Patient was seen by cardiology who felt that the bump in enzymes was related to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, and as a result did not feel that he needed to have a repeat catheterization.
# Atrial Fibrillation: during this hospitalization patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
# Heart Failure: Pt with chronic systolic heart failure with recent TTE showing EF worsened to 30-40%.
He did not have any signs of decompensated heart failure during his admission.
# Acute AML s/p induction chemotherapy: patient had a bone marrow biopsy during his stay that was to be followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

You are being treated with iv antibiotics for pneumonia and you had a PICC line placed.
This is for your abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation).
