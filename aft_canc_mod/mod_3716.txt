Admission Date:  [**2132-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-4-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: increased secretions  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: trach change  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 78y/o F with T3N0 supraglottic SCCA currently undergoing chemo/XRT, and s/p tracheotomy on [**2132-6-6**], who presents from [**Hospital1 **] w/ increased and thickened secretions with resultant difficulty breathing.
She has had some reddness over the anterior neck x several weeks and throat pain since starting XRT.
At [**Hospital1 **] she had an episode of stridor and was given solumedrol 125mg x2 and albuterol/atrovent nebs, however she continued to have SOB.
Given concern for edema/airway obstruction she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
Fiberoptic exam showed erythema but no airway edema.
Past Medical History: laryngeal SCCa s/p trach [**2132-6-6**], s/p G tube, currently undergoing chemo/XRT Afib w/ RVR h/o aspiration PNA HTN COPD Dyslipidemia  Social History: She has a 50-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking seven years ago.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.7  BP 120/43  HR  55  RR 14  99%35% TM General: Pleasant, well-appearing woman, no acute distress HEENT: MMM, EOMI, PERRL Neck: trach, erythema surrounding trach site Heart: Bradycardic, regular, no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses Ext: 1+ edema, warm, well-perfused Neuro: AAOx3  Pertinent Results: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: A tracheostomy tube appears in appropriate position.
A rounded opacity at the left cardiophrenic angle which causes opacity posteriorly on the lateral film is consistent with fat herniating the diaphragm as seen on previous chest CT. No focal pulmonary opacities to indicate pneumonia are seen.
There is flattening of the diaphragm and pruning of the pulmonary vasculature in the apices consistent with known emphysematous changes.
There is biapical scarring.
There is a convex right thoracolumbar scoliosis.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
ENT- Fiberoptic exam via nose: NP - no mass, posterior pharyngeal wall - no edema, valleculae w/ some pooled secretions, epiglottis slightly thickened (c/w XRT) with diffuse erythema, left TVF - not mobile, moderate thickened and erythematous mucosa over bil arytenoids, pooled thick yellow secretions in post cricoid space and piriforms .
ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the prior tracing of [**2132-6-12**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.

# SOB/increased secretions: airway evaluated by ENT in ED and showed no evidence of edema.
Increased secretions likely secondary to radiation-induced scarring of upper airway and/or use of passe-muir valve and lack of humidified air through trach.
However we could not rule out infection as source of increased secretions.
She should then have speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration risk.
When previously seen by speech and swallow at [**Hospital1 18**] at last admission, she was deemed to be an aspiration risk, but this may have improved after radiation and chemotherapy.
The gram positive rods are not considered to be pathogenic at this time.
No evidence of active bleeding .
# Neutropenia: White count low on admission at 0.9 with ANC of 780, this increased to 1480 on HD2.
Went into what was initially called atrial fibrillation during chest PT and converted to sinus spontaneously.
Review of prior ECGs does not clearly show atrial fibrillation.
She should see a cardiologist as an outpatient to consider Holter monitor/further diagnosis of atrial fibrillation vs. MAT, as well as consider anticoagulation for paroxysmal afib.
#Hypertension: BP well-controlled with ace-inhibitor and beta-blocker .
# COPD: No acute issues, continued Spiriva and albuterol .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Respiratory distress tracheostomy Laryngeal cancer atrial fibrillation .
Needs speech and swallow evaluation at [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for increased secretions into your tracheostomy tube.
These may have been due to a combination of infection perhaps due to aspiration, drying of secretions due to radiation therapy, lack of humidified air through the trach, and use of passe-muir valve.
Your tracheostomy was changed to one with an inner canula which will allow for more frequent cleaning.
When not speaking you should keep the trach cuff inflated and have continuous humidified oxygen running through the tubing.
You should be evaluated by speech and swallow services at [**Hospital1 **] for aspiration risk.
You had an episode of atrial fibrillation, you should be evaluated by a cardiologist.
This is to treat a possible infection causing increased secretions.
Please return to the hospital if you experience worsening respiratory difficulties, fevers, chills, or any other new or concerning symptoms.
