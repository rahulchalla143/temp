to wean from the vent status post trach and PEG placement, effusion status post VATS.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MVR/TVR with mosaic valve on [**2113-8-9**], complicated by failure to wean from the vent status post trach and PEG placement.
Serratia pneumonia.
Loculated effusion status post VATS.
Question of Dressler syndrome treated with steroids.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2097**].
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy in [**2108**], status post penile implant.
Colon cancer status post colectomy in [**2107**].
Pancytopenia with question of myelodysplastic syndrome.
HIT antibody positive.
Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
General:  The patient was in no acute distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Heart: Irregularly irregular rhythm.
No murmur appreciated.
No guarding or rebound.
Chest x-ray showed elevated right hemidiaphragm, interval development of right upper lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 116, normal axis, narrow QRS, T-wave inversions in II, III, and AVF.
Electrocardiogram from the Emergency Department similarly showed 134 beats per minute with ST depression in V3-V6.
His ST depressions resolved.
After initial rate control, problems with atrial fibrillation did not occur throughout his hospital stay.
He did intermittently have low blood pressures which responded to fluid resuscitation.
Pulmonary:  The patient appeared to have a new right upper lobe pneumonia.
He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn given his history of MRSA and coverage for vent acquired/nursing home acquired pneumonia.
He eventually did grow both MRSA and serratia from his sputum.
Several days into his hospital course, the Psychiatric Service was consulted for anxiety and depression as possible complications in weaning from the ventilator.
He did require one dose of Lasix for shortness of breath after being several liters positive and blood products positive, and his shortness of breath improved dramatically after the Lasix dose.
Heme:  The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation with a goal range of [**1-15**].
The patient is HIT antibody positive.
FEN:  The patient has had persistently elevated sodiums.
He received free-water boluses for elevated sodium, and eventually his sodium returned to the normal range.
Rheumatology:  The patient had been started on the previous hospital stay with steroids for a question of Dressler syndrome presenting as postcardiotomy pain.
There was some evidence of myopathy, and so during this hospitalization, his steroid dose was tapered.
Wound care:  The patient had a wound at the medial edge of this thoracotomy scar that had enlarged since his previous hospital stay.
In the surgical wound, there was a sinus track which was probed by Plastic Surgery who felt that it was shallow and did not require any different care.
Pleural effusion:  Late in the hospital course, the patient was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right side.
