No head trauma.
He was noted to have an acute MS change within 30 minutes.
ED COURSE: -- U/A - 11-20 WBCs, occasional bacteria -- WBCs - 28.9 w/ 91% lymphs -- UCx and BCx sent -- ceftriaxone and vancomycin started -- CXR - Abnormal opacity involving both lungs.
The finding represents both airspace and interstitial disease.
Diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic interstitial changes.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present as well.
-- CT CHEST - Severe emphysema and moderate pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe consolidation could represent pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.
Mild stranding in left upper quadrant around the splenic flexure of uncertain etiology.
-- CT HEAD - negative -- EKG - sinus tachycardia, PVCs, nl axis, nl intervals, no significant ST interval or T wave changes.
Past Medical History: PMH: -- PAF -- htn -- dyslipidemia -- Transitional Cell bladder CA -- BCG tx -- Lung mass (seen on staging CT [**7-/2106**]) -- left lower lobe 4x4x3cm, concerning for malignancy.
-- glaucoma -- osteoporosis .
Multiple punctate foci of increased diffusion signal are suggestive of multiple watershed infarcts in the cortex between the MCA/ACA distribution and MCA/PCA distribution.
This could be secondary to an episode of global hypotension and/or hypoxia.
No evidence of intracranial mass.
Fluid layering in the nasopharynx, possibly secondary to patient unresponsive state or intubation.
He was noted to have had a fall complicated by altered mental status.
Non-contrast head CT was negative for intracranial bleed.
There was high concern for an infectious process due to a leukocytosis.
CT torso revealed no focal inectious etiology.
The patient was noted to have a positive UA and a question of a pneumonia.
LP was not done due to elevated INR and minimal clinical indications.
These were felt to be consistent with either an episode of hypotension (which the patient was not known to have had) or embolic phenomena.
The patient was known to have A. Fib but TTE did not reveal any intra-cardiac thrombi.
It is possible that the patient is hypercoaguable secondary to malignancy.

The patient expired at 09:55AM on [**2107-2-1**] when he was found to have no pulse, no spontaneous breaths and no pupillary reflex.
