One third of the way through infusion of carboplatin during cycle 2 of chemotherapy on [**2183-9-2**], she developed an intense feeling of heat and generalized body tingling, numbness and tingling of the lips, and chest tightness.
Her vital signs remained stable, but she later had vomiting and headache.
Past Medical History: - Stage IIIC poorly differentiated primary peritoneal serous carcinoma - Thalassemia - Hypertension (per patient never treated with home medication, only when in hospital or seeing doctors) - Gastritis/Reflux  Oncologic history - CT abd/pelvis on [**2182-2-28**] revealed a large mass centered in the sigmoid colon with pelvic lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- A colonoscopy revealed a fungating, ulcerated mass within the sigmoid colon causing a partial obstruction.
The biopsy of this mass revealed adenocarcinoma with papillary formation, suggestive of an ovarian primary.
This was a suboptimal tumor debulking.
Extensive firm retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was appreciated.
There was no evidence of carcinomatosis.
Pathology examination revealed serous carcinoma involving full thickness of the rectal wall.
Seven of eight lymph nodes were positive for malignancy.
Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were negative for malignancy.
- [**Date range (3) 88205**]: 5 cycles of chemotherapy with Carboplatin q21 days and weekly Taxol, [**2182-8-15**] 6th cycle of chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Taxotere in place of Taxol due to neurotoxicity - [**2183-7-12**]: MRI of the L-spine shows new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy consistent with disease recurrence.
- [**2183-8-11**] started chemotherapy according to the clinical trial [**Company 2860**] #11-228 (Phase II, multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of ombrabulin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer treated with Carboplatin/Paclitaxel)   Social History: Immigrated from [**Country 3587**] in youth.
Family history of thalassemia.
She denies family history of cancer, CAD, or hypertension.

# Carboplatin desensitization: Cycle 2 was complicated by an allergic reaction after infusion of carboplatin which included a feeling of heat, generalized body tingling, numbness of the lips, chest tightness, nausea, and headache.
# Stage IIIc poorly differentiated primary peritoneal serous carcinoma: Status post sub-optimal debulking surgery ([**2182-3-14**]) and 6 cycles of chemotherapy ([**4-/2182**]/[**2182**]); five cycles with Carboplatin and weekly Taxol and 1 cycle with Carboplatin and Taxotere.
On [**8-11**], she started chemotherapy according to the clinical trial [**Company 2860**] #11-228 (Phase II, multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of ombrabulin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer treated with Carboplatin/Paclitaxel).
The second cycle was complicated by an allergic reaction to carboplatin (see above), but cycles 3 and 4 were administered per the carboplatin desensitization protocol without complication.
Restaging CT torso performed on [**10-11**] showed no new lesions, but there is mild interval enlargement of right retroperitoneal lymph nodes and left external iliac chain lymph node which could reflect progression of metastatic disease.
You were hospitalized to make sure that you did not have an adverse reaction while receiving your chemotherapy medications.
