Stable appearance of numerous tiny bilateral pulmonary nodules.
No new pulmonary nodules identified.
20 x 13 mm subcutaneous lesion of the anterior left shoulder with internal hounsfield density consistent with air.
He was initially started on Cefepime and Vancomycin due to a history of MRSA abscess, as well as Flagyl for gram negative coverage).
Pt was also transfused 1 unit pRBC for anemia (HCt24.2, increased to 27.5).
Two days after admission he remained febrile as high as 104F, became tachycardic and hypotensive with good response to fluid boluses.
Rash was also noted across face, chest, arms - non pruritic, non painful thought to be secondary to drug rash vs. reaction to blood transfusion.
Pt was pan cultured and sent to the OR for double lumen porta cath removal (empiric for ?line sepsis) and admitted to the ICU for sepsis management, hypoxemia and hypotension.
On admission to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt had [**Name (NI) **], cough, fatigue/weakness, some diarrhea and unknown source of infection.
He was continued with aggressive fluid resuscitation (central line - RIJ -placed [**6-27**]), Vancomycin, Flagyl, Aztreonam, voriconazole were continued, Levofloxacin was d/ced due to ?drug rash and history of cipro allergy.
Gentamicin was added for double gram neg coverage.
Pt's blood pressure stabilized with fluid resuscitation and fever defervesced with Abx and Tylenol/Ibuprofen.
CXR revealed congestion and pt obtained diuresis with relief of [**Month/Year (2) **], thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to chemo induced cardiomyopathy.
Voriconazole and Flagyl discontinued at that time as fevers were thought to be secondary to drug reaction vs. underlying lymphoma.
Pt came to the floor feeling much better but still having fevers of unknown etiology.
Sources included the healing abscess in the neck, chest wound after catheter removal, drug reaction?
All cultures still negative but patient became febrile to 102.
MRI of the neck did not show persistence/recurrence of abscess or osteomyelitis.
C. Diff, galactomannin and strongyloides sent and were negative due to persistent diarrhea.
Pt was re-evaluated by the ICU due to persistent fevers, diarrhea and tachycardia.
During his stay on the floor he received his third dose of chemo during which time antibiotics were held.
Pt stabilized but remained with intermittent fevers and tachycardia.
Neutropenia resolved with stable WBC.
Wound cultures taken from the site of line removal grew resistant coagulase positive staph aureus for which he was empirically covered by Vancomycin.
?pneumonia as source of infection vs. overlying PCP (HIV status and immunocompromised from chemo, plus continually rising LDH) vs. fluid overload from resuscitative fluids vs. [**1-19**] generalized infection.
CXR on presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] demonstrated b/l pulm congestion vs. pneumonia.
EF on [**5-16**] = 55%, repeat EF on ECHO ([**6-27**]) = 40-45% therefore decreased likelihood cardiogenic pulm congestion, although still possibility of chemo-induced cardiac dysfunction given the newer lower EF, but could be pulm congestion [**1-19**] early sepsis w/ leaky capillaries or PCP.
Tachycardia - related to fever vs. functional heart changes [**1-19**] chemo vs. pericardial effusion vs. PE (low on differential).
Pt remained tachycardic in ICU, but per patient and patient's partner, baseline HR = 100.
Therefore, ECHO was obtained [**6-27**] and r/o for structural heart abnormality as cause of tachycardia - therefore was just monitored during ICU stay.
Patient remained intermittently tachycardic upon return to the floor, thought to be secondary to insensible loses due to continued fever, underlying condition, infection?
Patient remained stable until discharge with low grade tachycardia.
Rash:  Pt developed a rash across face, trunk, UE>LE, developed [**6-25**].
Diarrhea - pt c/o diarrhea since admission, profuse, yellow in color and watery.
Initial C Diff on presentation neg - repeat also negative.
Viral stool cxs positive for adenovirus.
LDH= 194 ([**6-23**])-> 811([**6-28**]) as indication of tumor burden vs. related to transfusion of pRBC vs. ?PCP.
Anemia - Pt with history of anemia - s/p transfusion 1 unit pRBC on floor.
[**Name (NI) 5779**] - pt with mildly elevated AST, ALT, Alk phos likely secondary to medications/illness.
Liver function remained stable, discharged with mildly elevated enzymes.
HAART held for now due to Burkitt's lymphoma and therapy.
CD4 resent during hospitalization = 147 ([**6-27**]) ?accurate due to acute infection.
Prophylaxis: heparin, protonix, pneumoboots, OOB to chair w/ assistance, patient later became stronger, ambulating without difficulty .
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Sepsis 2.
Burkitts Lymphoma 3.
Febrile neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Good; low grade fevers  Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please contact physician or come to hospital if increased shortness of breath, fever greater than 100.4, any other signs or symptoms of infection.
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (hematologist/oncologist) as directed for treatment of Burkitt's Lymphoma.
