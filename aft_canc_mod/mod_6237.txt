The patient states the pain started 5 weeks prior to admission.
He had a workup at [**Hospital6 34976**] and was found to have a large right hepatic lobe mass, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma on biopsy.
He was scheduled for outpatient oncology, but was unable to tolerate the pain, and so presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further pain management.
The pain is stabbing, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], alleviated by lying on the right side, worsened by lying on his left side.

Palliative care and Oncology were consulted for management of hepatic mass.
