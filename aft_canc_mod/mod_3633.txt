Admission Date:  [**2106-11-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-12-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-7-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Lasix / Monosodium Glutamate / Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus) / lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**] Chief Complaint: fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2106-11-27**] - Synchronized electrical cardioversion [**2106-11-29**] - AVNRT ablation   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 77 year old male with medical history that includes non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to velcade/rituxan (now with normalized left ventricular function), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, supraventricular tachycardia,  severe tricuspid regurgitation, ESRD secondary to waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, and metastatic prostate cancer who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with hypotension and supraventricular tachycardia.
At baseline his functional status is limited as he becomes dyspniec with ambulation of 10-20feet.
Lately, however he becomes short of breath just with transitioning from sitting to standing or any ambulation.
He also endorses worsening lower extremity edema but is not clear if his weight has changed.
He reports stable bone pain related to his metastatic prostate cancer.
At dialysis this past week, he was felt to be volume overloaded and underwent extra ultrafiltration with removal of 6.5kg Tuesday, 2.5kg Wednesday, and 1kg Thursday with some improvement in his breathing and lower extremity edema.
He is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] for cardiomyopathy and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **] for evaluation of supraventricular tachycardia.
In [**5-/2106**], he underwent successful DCCV for atrial fibrillation.
He underwent Holter monotoring where he was predominantly in an ectopic atrial rhythm with  episodes up to 14hrs in duration of atrial tachycardia.
He presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2106-11-26**] complaining of generalized weakness and fatigue where initial vitals were 98.2 82/53, HR 129, and 98%RA.
He was felt to be volume overloaded on exam.
Cardiology recommended starting dobutamine for hypotension.
EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia with rate of 148 with long R-P interval.
He was given adesonine 6mg and then 12mg without significant change in rate (130s) or rhythm.
Bedside TTE showed hyperdynamic LV and dilated RV with adequate wall motion and moderate/severe TR.
He was then given 2 mg versed and underwent DCCV 200J after which he transiently went into an atrial ectopic rhythm with rate in 80s and then atrial fibrillation with rates in 80s-90s.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Brief Hospital Course: 77M with medical history that includes non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to velcade/rituxan (now with normalized left ventricular function), history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, supraventricular tachycardia, severe tricuspid regurgitation, ESRD secondary to Waldenstrom?????
?s macroglobulinemia, and metastatic prostate cancer who [**Hospital 76343**] transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with hemodynamically unstable supraventricular tachycardia with improvement in blood pressure following electrical cardioversion.
In the past he was not interested in formal EP studies and potential ablation but this was re-addressed this admission.
Following electrical cardioversion, his rhythm converted to atrial fibrillation with a HR in the 80-90 bpm range; he reverted back to an atypical tachyarrhythmia with a rate of 130-140 bpm within 1-2 hours following cardioversion.
He was prepared for an electrophysiology study on [**2106-11-29**] given his persistent rhythm issues.
We also initially held his anticoagulation (indication being atrial fibrillation) on admission, given that his INR was 5.4 - and he received 3 mg Vitamin K PO x 1 given his supratherapeutic INR and the need for an EP study.
He was also transitioned to Amiodarone 200 mg PO daily following the procedure, however, he developed thrombocytopenia which was thought to be related to the IV amiodarone load he received, and this was briefly discontinued.
Prior to discharge, he had reverted back into Afib and will be restarted on amiodarone in an attempt to maintain NSR.
The thrombocytopenia was thought to be related to the IV amiodarone as he had previously tolerated IV amio with no observed drop in platelets.
# HYPOTENSION - The patient presented with hypotension in the setting of a supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmia, improved following electrical cardioversion initially, but then he spontaneously reverted to an atypical tachyarrhythmia with a blood pressure in the 70/50 mmHg range.
While he met SIRS criteria on admission, there was no clear source of infection at that time.
His admission CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence of consolidation.
# DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION - The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a previous ejection fraction of 50-55% on most recent echocardiogram (prior LVEF was 20% while on chemotherapy agents).
He has stage III/IV NYHA heart failure and appeared to be volume overloaded on exam when admitted (lower extremity edema, JVD in setting of moderate-severe TR).
His labs (elevated BNP) and imaging studies (pleural effusions, mild pulmonary edema) supported these findings.
He appeared to have moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with a dilated right ventricle and severe (4+) tricuspid regurgitation with overall worsened right ventricular function compared to his prior exam; with abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload (LVEF 55%).
The development of his tachyarrhythmia likely contributed to this acute decompensation.
Nephrology was consulted given the concern for volume overload and the need for ultrafiltration.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: During this admission, his platelets trended down from 100-150 at admission to 15 on HD5.
The patient did not have any bleeding.
No evidence of DIC on labs.
The etiology of his thrombocytopenia was thought to be antibody-mediated amiodarone toxicity from the IV amiodarone load he received at admission.
# ESRD ON HEMODIALYSIS - Thought to be secondary to light chain cast nephropathy from Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, on hemodialysis since [**2102**].
He presented with volume overload, but without significant metabolic derangements warranting urgent dialysis.
# PROSTATE CANCER - The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer that has been refractory to Docetaxel with a rising PSA (most recently 1883 in [**2106-10-19**]) on Zytiga and prednisone at home.
He has also received radiation to his right hip in the past for metastatic disease.
# ANEMIA/LEUKOPENIA - His anemia and leukopenia are stable compared to prior recent labs and are thought to be due to bone marrow involvement of his prostate cancer; less likely due to Waldenstrom's.

We treated you with an antiarrhythmic drug called amiodarone and performed an ablation procedure in an attempt to prevent this event from happening again.
