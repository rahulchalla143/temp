Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL & OBSTETRIC HISTORY: per [**Hospital1 2025**] records Prenatal Course: *) EDC [**2200-5-12**] by LMP [**2199-8-5**] *) Labs: B+/Ab-/RI/RPRNR/HbsAg-/HIV-/HCV-/GLT 110 *) US: FFS normal with low-lying placenta *) Screening: Low risk Quad Screen, normal hemoglobin electrophoresis *) Issues: - Moved from [**Country 651**] to US in [**Month (only) **], initial PNV at 15w6d - Prior hepatitis B infx, no detectable viral load: HbsAg-/HbsAb+/HbeAg-/HbeAb+/HbcAb- (IgM) - thus evidence for non-chronic state, this represents clearance/resolution - Low lying placenta on FFS -> follow-up ultrasound @ bedside non-confirmatory of resolution - Has been normotensive through prenatal course thus far with no proteinuria, last visit [**2200-2-17**]  OB History: TAb x 1 (6 weeks) in [**Country 651**]  Gyn History: reports normal Pap smear in [**Country 651**] prior to pregnancy  Past Medical/Surgical History: No history of seizures Hepatitis B -> cleared, no detectable viral loand and normal LFTs in early pregnancy D&C x 1  Medications: none per [**Hospital1 2025**] record Allergies: none per [**Hospital1 2025**] record   Social History: No EtOH use, no smoking, illicit drug use.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch, propioception  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger stable stand or gait  Discharge: pleasant and cooperative incision is c/d/i AAOx3, PERRL, EOM intact, face symmetric, MAEs, no pronator sensory intact   Pertinent Results: [**2200-9-5**] Brain MRI 1.
No significant change in the previously noted mass lesion in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 3.8 cm in the transverse dimension, accurate assessment of size is somewhat difficult given the irregular shape of the lesion.
No new lesions noted.
The cerebellar tonsils are minimally low lying, approximately 3 mm below the margins of foramen magnum and may be within the expected limits.
[**9-10**] Brain MRI Demonstration of moderate-sized hypointense lesion in the left frontal lobe, with few adjacent vessels around/coursing within, for surgical planning.
No significant mass effect.
No hydrocephalus  [**9-10**] CT Brain Status post recent left frontal craniotomy with expected post-operative changes including fluid, small amount of blood and pneumocephalus at the resection bed, as well as extra-axial pneumocephalus.
Extent of surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect is unchanged from pre-operative MR study.
Expected post-surgical findings including small extra-axial left frontal pneumocephalus, small amount of blood products and dural enhancement at the resection site, similar to the postsurgical CT from the day before.
No territorial infarction and no intracranial herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented electively on [**9-10**] for left frontal craniotomy for mass resection.
Post op Head CT demonstrated no acute infarct or increase in hemorrhage.
A brain MRI post operatively was obtained which showed gross total resection.
Disp:*9 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Frontal Brain Mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-17**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
