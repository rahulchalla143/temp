Admission Date:  [**2115-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-6-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-11-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Global Aphasia, Right Sided Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra-arterial tPA administration PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 111870**] is a 69 year-old right handed woman with past medical history of hypertension, chronic back pain and a left shoulder fracture one month prior who presented as an OSH transfer Code Stroke for reported sudden onset aphasia and right sided weakness.
She was last reported without symptoms (as noted by husband) at 1700hrs on [**2115-6-5**].
After finding her at 1730hrs on the floor not speaking, he called EMS who on arrival noted right sided weakness and a left gaze deviation.
A CT scan obtained at [**Hospital3 **] was negative for hemorrhage or acute process (comfirmed upon [**Hospital1 18**] review), but because she was intubated [**Hospital1 487**] reported inability to obtain a clear exam to warrant tPA administration.
Therefore, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible tPA and/or intervention.
She arrived intubated and sedated at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, with right-sided weakness when weaned off of sedation.
However, given the shortcomings inherent with an intubated examination and her difficulty arousing from sedation, she went to CT/CTA/CTP, which showed a left MCA clot at the bifurcation and left MCA stroke with perfusion mismatch on imaging.

Evolving infarct in the left MCA territory with hypoattenuation and effacement in the left insular ribbon.
Thyroid asymmetry with right lobe coarse calcification.
Evolving infarct in the left MCA territory with hypoattenuation and effacement in the left insular ribbon.
Thyroid asymmetry with right lobe coarse calcification.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the site of prior left MCA infarct.
Small left subdural hematoma layering on the tentorium, new from prior.
No midline shift or evidence of transtentorial herniation.
No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
[**6-6**] CT Head Hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe with mild sulcal effacement, likely represents diffusion of permeated contrast after angiography rather than hemorrhagic transformation in an area of left MCA stroke.
No evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage.
Multiple bilateral rib fractures at various stages of healing from acute to remote.
Moderate complex right pleural effusion, likely hemorrhagic and related to rib fractures.
Trace left pleural effusion.
Small intramuscular hemmorhage related to fourth right rib fracture.
Small hyperdense rounded lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney, may represent hemorrhagic cyst, though cannot exclude malignancy.
Recommend further evaluation with ultrasound.
Nodular thickening of medial limb of left adrenal gland may represent underlying nodule, or given recent trauma, a small hemmorrhage.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Vasculature not completely evaluated on this study, as an MRA of the brain was not performed due to patient's deteriorating condition.
Sphenoid sinus disease.
Sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
[**6-8**] MRA brain Resolution of occlusion of the left M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery, with persistent diminished flow in its branches compared to the right.
Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: The patient presented with sudden onset aphasia and right sided weakness at approximately 1730 on [**2115-6-5**].
EMS was called, and patient was intubated secondary to GCS = 3 and poor respiratory drive.
At [**Hospital6 3105**], patient noted to have right-sided weakness and left eye deviation.
Initial OSH CT scan was negative for hemorrhage or acute process.
Patient transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]; OSH concerned with administering thrombolytics in setting of sedated patient without conclusive exam.
Per ED Evaluation of patient, right sided weakness and left gaze preference were evident when weaned from sedation.
Emergent CT/CTA performed revealing left MCA clot at bifurcation with perfusion mismatch consistent with territory stroke.
Pt was extubated in AM without complication and transferred to the stroke service on [**6-7**].
The patient was seen to have failed several speech and swallow evaluations for which her family authorized the placement of a PEG tube, accomplished on [**6-13**].
During this procedure, anesthesia noted a traumatic intubation and as a result the patient could not be immediately extubated and required mechanical ventilation in the ICU with plans to attempt later extubation.
The patient was sedated with seroquel and propofol for a short course and was able to be successfully extubated on [**6-16**], at which point repeat neurologic evaluation revealed her to remain globally aphasic with minimal responsiveness to command, but showed increased strength in her right extremities.
On [**6-18**] the patient was observed to have right facial twitching as well as decreased alertness.
Cardiac: The patient on admission was allowed to autoregulate blood pressure with anti-hypertensives prescribed on an as needed basis for more severe hypertension.
Workup for this cerebrovascular event included a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, and normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Due to the traumatic intubation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was deferred and a cardiac MR was obtained.
This was a poor study due to patient movement but it did not reveal any thrombus in the atrium or aorta.
Heme: The patient was noted to have anemia with hematocrit to the mid-low 20s so CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained to assess for source of bleed but none was noted.
The CT did note "Small hyperdense rounded lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney" which will need to be followed up.
Concurrent with this anemia was a thrombocytosis and elevated WBC in the 20s with the only infection nidus from a pan-culture found to be a positive urine culture.
Per the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has had a chronic leukocytosis and had refused previous outpatient workup.
They felt the patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytosis are most likely reactive, perhaps due to continued aspiration while she was in the hospital.
ID: A urine culture was obtained grew enterococcus requiring a course of Amoxicillin therapy.
Repeat urine cultures grew no further bacteria.
Her oxygen saturation remained stable and she remained afebrile despite elevated WBC counts.
GI: The patient was started on prophylaxis against gastroesophageal acid reflux and after several failed attempts at swallow evaluation, a PEG tube was placed for enteral feeding successfully.
Dysphagia screening before any PO intake?

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Known lastname 111870**],  You were admitted for an ischemic stroke.
You had a cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated no cardioembolic source.
You also had some abnormal blood tests for which we consulted the hematology service.
They feel that this is most likely due to a reaction of your body to acute illness but you will need to follow up with them when you are better.
Followup Instructions: You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-20**] 4:30pm  call to register ASAP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87261**]  Call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office of Hematology  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9645**] if you decide to persue further evaluation for your elevated white blood cells and platelet or if CBC in 1 month is still not normal.
