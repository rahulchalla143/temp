Admission Date:  [**2145-6-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-5-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for hypoxia and bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation pulmonary artery catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 68 y/o male with a history of angioimmunoblastic T cell Lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy diagnosed in [**2144-9-23**] on [**6-9**] with increasing hypoxia (90% on RA), orthopnea, decreasing appetite, increasing weakness and increasing abdominal girth.
He was thought to be in decompensated CHF with pulmonary edema and ascites and underwent aggressive diuresis with no improvement in his symptoms.
A 2.5 cm left perihilar mass and and 8 mm nodule in  left lung near the descending aorta.
Right sided pleural effusion.
Small bilateral renal calculi with no obstructive changes.
He underwent CT neck which revealed stable LN dz in neck, and LN enlargement in mediastinum  He underwent echo with normal EF and was evaluated by cardiology who felt his symptoms were consistent with CHF.
His hospital course was complicated by the development of acute renal failure with a Cr of 4.6 and agitation requiring haldol.
Worsening of his rapid afib with RVR to the 140s for which he was started on diltiazem.
There were also rate related ST depressions reported.
He underwent diagnostic paracentesis which revealed atypical cells on cytology and WBC 14,030,  RBC 38,000, with 41% Neutropil concerning for SBP.
Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of chop diagnosed in late [**2144-9-23**] due to symptoms of night sweats, weight loss and bulky adenopathy in the neck.
2 COPD with FEV1/FVC 124% predicted, FEV1 42%, FVC 34%, TLC 76 % predicted 3 atrial fibrillation 4. coronary artery disease 5. diabetes mellitus 6.
sclera non-icteric.
no murmurs abd- distended, not tense; no pain- except mild pain at L-sided paracentesis site (no erythema or pus at this area).
+ fluid wave.
no spider angiomas.
ext- trace b/l LE edema to ankles.
neuro- able to respond to yes/no questions, and follow simple commands, but speech is mostly incoherent; pt is mildly agitated, pulling at lines.
EKG:  atrial fibrillation at 100 .
Radiologic Studies: ------------------ CXR [**6-17**]: There are diffuse bilateral opacities and this is a cardiomegaly, consistent with CHF.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENT TEST FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (Final [**2145-6-18**]): PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII NOT SEEN.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o male with progressive pulmonary decline unresponsive to diuresis and broad spectrum antibiotics and new onset of ascites concerning for rapidly progressive metastatic lymphoma and new acute renal failure.
Intubated emergently for refractory hypoxemia on [**6-17**] w/prolonged ICU stay c/b vent-assoc MRSA PNA, periods of rapid Afib, drug rash, and diffuculty weaning off ventilator.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/SIRS: Emergently intubated on admission to the ICU for refractory hypoxemia.
The cause of his respiratory failure was unclear.
Was on Vanco/CTX/Azithro/Vori x 14 days([**Date range (1) 62192**]), on Zosyn for increased fever and secretions, 7 day course ([**7-1**]- [**7-8**]).
Bronchoscopy/BAL was performed and was negative for AFB, PCP or bacterial microorganisms.
Induced sputum was also negative.
He was continued empirically on antibiotics given his clinical decline with sepsis physiology.
Tumor burden with lymphangitic spread was also considered as a potential etiology of his respiratory distress, but was felt less likely given the stable appearance of his tumor on imaging studies.
CTA was negative for PE as a potential source.
Weaning was complicated by large amount of bleeding from tracheostomy while on heparin and by large amounts of secretions leading to mucous plugging.
He improved greatly with decreased secretions with Vancomycin.
# Hypotension: Hypotension felt to be septic in etiology given its distributive nature.
However, he remained persistently hypotensive, with decreasing SVR's.
He was also noted to have initial evidence of low-grade DIC with increasing PT/PTT, and decreasing fibrinogen and platelets.
He did not require cryoprecipitate or FFP transfusions.
In addition he had no noted bleeding complications w/ APC.
Currently he is normotensive with BP 130's-150's/50's-80's without use of pressors - given improvement of hypotension with antibiotic treatment, likely etiology was sepsis.
# Ascites: Cytology from outside hospital consistent with lymphoma and SBP.
Repeat ultrasound showed loculated abdominal ascites, not felt to be ammenable to paracentesis.
Repeat ultrasound [**7-13**] showed small amount of ascites.
# Mental Status:  Patient with episodes of delirium since admission to ICU - most commonly in morning then becomes more lucid later in day.
Possibly [**2-24**] to lack of sleep, infection, medications, or combination.
Ativan 2mg was effective in assisting the patient to sleep, and patient has not had delirium since this time.
He is currently awake and alert, oriented to being in [**Location (un) 86**], but remains slightly confused when asked if he knows what type of building he is in.
# Lymphoma: initially presented with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and acute renal failure, concern for suspected tumor lysis.
# Acute renal failure -??????
Initially, pt had elevation of BUN, Cr, which resolved with fluid resuscitation.
# Afib -- Loaded with Digoxin, and continued on 0.125 mg daily.
Initially on heparin, but discontinued because of large amount of bleeding from trach site.
However, had extensive bloody secretions and anticoagulation was subsequently stopped.
Once he is able to take po's this medication may be restarted should he have rapid ventricular rates.
# Pulmonary Hypertension -- an echo on [**7-2**] showed severe pulmonary HTN associated with 2+ mitral regurgitation.
It was unclear whether this could be due to the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pulmonary emboli.
Furthermore, MR was felt to be more likely the cause of the pulmonary hypertension.
Pt had post-pyloric feeding tube inserted twice, both of which he pulled out while in episodes of confusion/delirium.
He failed a bedside swallowing study, and we were unable to place a PEG [**2-24**] ascites.
# Rash and eosinophilia ??????
rash started after starting multiple antibiotics, biopsy performed, felt to be drug rash associated with antibiotics most likely ceftriaxone, improved on steroids.
# CAD ??????
# Anemia ??????
stable hct - pt previously with bleeding from trach when on heparin, now stopped.
No evidence of bleeding.
# ppx - heparin stopped because of bloody secretions - restarted in TPN.
# Access ??????
pt pulled out TLC and A-line.
