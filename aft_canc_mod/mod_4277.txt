Pt has history of RCC, first dx 12 yrs ago sp resection, then recurred in [**2132**] with mets to R lung and endobronchial disease sp bronchial stenting in [**2133**] with multiple episodes of non-massive hemoptysis and recent rigid bronchoscopy with balloon dilation of bronchus intermedius.
Pt was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] (pulm surgery) last week for hemoptysis (discharged [**2134-2-4**]) where he had scope that showed fractured bronchus intermedius stent with friable tissue around it causing main stem bleeding.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] had plans to open a stent in the near future.
Told to call GI again if any fresh blood in OG tube.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: - in [**4-/2122**] Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] had a right-sided kidney lesion found incidentally.
Ureteral & vascular margins were  free of tumor, no vascular invasion was seen.
- in late [**2132**], developed recurrent hemoptysis which prompted ENT  evaluation & chest imaging, which showed a compressive mass in  the right bronchus.
He had a flexible bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] complicated by significant bleeding & was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2133-1-14**].
Chest CT showed a mass encasing the right pulmonary artery & invading the bronchus intermedius.
- on [**2133-6-18**] developed hemoptysis requiring Sutent hold through  [**2133-6-23**] & again [**Date range (1) 36573**].
He returned [**2133-8-25**] & reported scant hemoptysis x 2 days & his Sutent was stopped.
- on [**2133-11-25**], saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for bronchoscopy which showed stent in good position, no endobronchial lesions were seen.
- [**2133-12-29**] with ongoing cough, sputum production.
- in follow-up [**2134-2-2**], his cough had improved but plts were low, necessitating hold - on [**2134-2-17**], restarted once plts 98 - follow-up [**2134-3-2**], He was doing well apart from ongoing respiratory symptoms of cough, sputum production & scant hemoptysis/mild epistaxis.
At that time  we discussed possibly resuming Sutent earlier than 2 weeks off therapy if respiratory symptoms persisted.
He had stopped Flonase due to epistaxis.
- on [**2134-4-1**] bronchoscopy w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which showed a large endobronchial lesion in the [**Hospital1 **], friable w/ stent [**03**]% occluded.
- on [**2134-6-8**], for follow up, doing well apart from 2-3 days of pruritic rash on left sided torso consistent with herpes zoster.
He developed pain at  the site which continued despite use of Tylenol and was prescribed a lidocaine patch.
- On [**2134-7-13**] CT appeared to show overall minimal decrease to affected area and decreased compression of the right main stem  bronchus.
Notable is interval development of a left adrenal nodule with rim of enhancement given characteristics and rapid growth concerning for metastasis.
Interval resolution of the right pleural effusion.
- On [**2134-9-30**] pulm rigid bronch revealed his metal stent well-covered with granulation tissue was visualized in the bronchus intermedius.
An 80% stenosis to the right lower lobe was seen distal to the stent, and the bronchoscope could not pass.
His wife was recently diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and is being seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**] from Breast Oncology.

Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was a lovely 86-year-old gentleman with metastatic RCC (s/p multiple interventional pulmonary procedures for endobronchial bleeding) who was admitted from an outside hospital with hematemesis in setting of right bronchial artery bleed.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was given 1 unit of PRBCs on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], and another unit was ordered for transfusion during procedures.
Family was aware of high risks of this procedure, but wanted to proceed in the event that there was any way to palliate symptoms.
