[**2200-12-17**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: Since the previous chest radiograph, bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion have improved and are now minimal.
No new consolidation, left lower lobe atelectasis also improved with partial reappearance of the left hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Overall improvement in pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular congestion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is a borderline pelvocaliectasis seen in the left kidney which appears unchanged from the CT of yesterday.
No hydronephrosis is seen in the right kidney.
IMPRESSION: Mild fullness of the left kidney, unchanged from the CT of [**2200-12-15**].
[**2200-12-15**] CT abd/pelvis without IV contrast: There is bibasilar subsegmental dependent atelectasis at the lung bases.
Coronary artery atherosclerotic calcification is noted.
The pancreas demonstrates mild fatty atrophy.
The left kidney appears slightly edematous compared to the right and there is mild left perinephric stranding.
In addition, there is slight engorgement of the left renal pelvis.
There is a 2.5-mm radiodensity along the expected course of the left mid ureter (2:38) which likely represents a ureteral calculus.
No other calculi are identified.
There is extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and several branches.
A saccular infrarenal aortic aneurysm is again noted measuring 3.0 (TRV) x 2.9 (AP) x 2.5 (CCN) is not significantly increased from prior when it measured 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.
No free air or fluid is noted in the abdomen.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement is noted.
There is no free fluid or pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy noted.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified.
Left mid ureteral 2.5-mm stone with associated left perinephric stranding and mild renal edema.
No evidence of mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis or acute aortic pathology, although evaluation is somewhat limited on this non-contrast-enhanced CT. 3.
No significant change in the saccular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm compared to [**2200-2-27**].
[**2200-12-16**] EKG: "Fine" atrial fibrillation with ventricuilar premature beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy and left anterior fascicular block.
ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, intraventricular conduction delay and/or possible ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2200-12-14**] no significant change.

A CT scan done initially showed perinephric stranding and a stone in the left ureter.
The patient developed ARF secondary to obstructive uropathy (see below), but maintained good urine output.
He was initially treated with iv dilaudid (which was switched to tylenol and oxycodone secondary to ileus) and ivfs, which was stopped secondary to volume overload (see below).
A repeat CT scan was done that showed an obstructive stone in the UV junction with hydronephrosis and urology recommended observation.
Hypoxia: On presentation patient received fluid hydration for nephrolithiasis and subsequently, developed hypoxia.
Patient was ruled out for myocardial damage and CXR did not show evidence of consolidation.
His hypoxia was thought to be secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy and acute on chronic kidney disease (see below).
Throughout hospitalization Cr peaked to 3.2 and subsequently trended down after passing of multiple stones.
Nephrology was consulted and initially, the team suspected a pre-renal vs vascular disease as possible etiology of his ARF.
However, a repeat CT abdomen was done that showed worsening hydronephrosis and a ~4mm stone at the UV junction.
Patient passed a stone [**12-22**] and subsequent to this Creatine improved to baseline and began putting out large amounts of urine.
It was ultimately felt that his ARF was likely secondary to obstructive uropathy with resolution of passing of stone and post-obstructive diuresis.
Ileus: Patient developed ileus secondary to large quantity of narcotics and was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen with resolution of his symptoms.
Hypertension: His lisinopril was held in the setting of acute on chronic renal desease.
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Patient had pulmonary edema (see above) secondary to fluid overload and was diuresed in the MICU.

You were admitted to the hospital because you had abdominal pain from kidney stones.
However, because of your kidney dysfunction and heart failure you developed difficulty breathing because of volume overload, and so you were treated with lasix.
