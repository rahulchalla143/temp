Admission Date:  [**2160-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-10-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-1-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotrachial intubation Triple Lumen Central Venous Line Placement Arterial Line Placement Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 66 year old gentelman, with DM, CAD, chronic Afib, hiatal hernia, [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus with mutliple esophageal dilatations who had robotic prostatectomy for T1C prostate adenocarcinoma on [**2160-9-18**] at OSH.
During the surgery he lost about 150 cc blood however post-op he became anemic and had exp-lap on [**9-20**] for evacuation of clots and hemostatis.
PEG was considered (alb 1.6), however anesthesia at OSH considered him high risk and thought of Dobhoff.
After dobhoff was placed unsuccessfully [**10-4**], he started to have upper airway bleeding requiring intubation.
Also, regarding his 4 blasts on his differentials of count, heme consult at OSH thought it is most likely a leukomoid reaction but could not exclude underlying hematological malignancy.
Post-op he also developed pneumonia for which he was placed on vanc, ceftaz.
On [**10-6**] ID thought there is no active pneumonia anymore, stopped tobra, and recommended completing ceftaz [**10-3**] days.
Also post-op, he had Afib with RVR that required IV dilt and esmolol and digoxin.
Echo on [**9-24**] showed EF 55%, Aortic thickening but no stenosis, mikld MR, LAE, normal wall motion.
Past Medical History: HL Afib HTN CAD DM Hypothyroidism Acoustic Neuroma Bell's palsy Hiatal hernia GERD OA Depression   Social History: Married with adult children.
Lives in [**Location 686**]  Family History: No family h/o hematological malignancy  Physical Exam: Admission Phsyical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.8 BP: 134/84 P: 98 irregular R: [**12-4**] O2: 100% General: intubated, sedated, not responding to voice, sternal rub, resisted opening left eye, moved left eyebrow when name called.
Right eye open Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, right IJ Lungs: good air entry bilaterally anteriorly and axillary, with faint insp rhonchi bilaterally, no crackles.
reduced breath sounds on right side CV: irregular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, no palpable masses or organomegaly.
surgical clean wounds with steristrips, echymotic patch at left and right lower quadrant, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: 1+ pulses, slight pitting edema bilaterally up to knees, right UE PICC .
Heterogeneous but widespread opacities in each lung, predominantly of ground glass attenuation.
Major differential considerations include multifocal pneumonia, although other processes could be considered such as heterogeneous involvement with edema, respiratory distress syndrome or even hemorrhage in the appropriate clinical setting.
Extensive left lower lobe atelectasis with mucus plugging and hyperdense material, potentially due to aspiration of barium or other hyperdense substance.
Large hiatal hernia.
Minimal colonic wall thickening, which can probably be explained in the setting of widespread edema.
Fluid collections in the pelvis which would be compatible with resolving hematomas.
Small nodule in the anterior subcutaneous fat of the right lower quadrant, probably benign, but correlation with physical findings and attention in follow-up is suggested.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect .
Large area of hypodensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the remote craniotomy, presumably prior insult; correlate with history.
If there is continued concern for parenchymal changes and acute infarcs, MRI is more sensitive and can be considered if not contra-indicated.
Left mastoid air cells -opacification from fluid/mucosal thickening.
TTE ([**2160-10-9**]) Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
No significant valvular abnormality.
Mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred from OSH for further management of his respiratory failure and increasing leukocytosis and blast forms.
The preliminary read reported dysplasia with approximately 30% blasts.
A MRI of the head was planned to better evaluate the posterior fossa, however it was determined that the patient was too unstable to leave the floor after an episode of tachycardia and tachypneic followed by bradycardia.
The patients foley was replaced and began to drain dark bloody urine with clots.
Urology was consulted and felt that a clot from his previous procedure may have been dislodged and that the bladder should be hand irrigated.
He had some difficulty tolerating the vent settings, and had to have an increase in his tidal volume transiently.
A bronchoscopy was done which revealed bloody fluid in the left lower lobe.
The patient had difficulty maintaining his oxygen saturation and appeared dyssynchronous with the vent, even with the higher tidal volumes.
During this time, the patient also began to be hypotensive and required pressors.
Over the course of the evening, he became increasing acidotic requiring bicarbonate.
He became asystolic around 710am and it was felt hat CPR was not medically indicated.
