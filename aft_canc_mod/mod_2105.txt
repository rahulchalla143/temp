She presented with episodes of pre-syncope and atrial fribrillation.
[**Last Name (un) **] has also noticed increased frequency of her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Medications were adjusted and currently Flecainide has helped cease the breakthrough episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Echo and cathetreization performed in mid [**Month (only) 547**] revealed severe aortic stenosis, preserved LV function, normal coronaries and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Given the progression of her symptoms and severity of her disease, she has been referred for surgical intervention.

A very large aneurysmal sac is protruding 2cm into the RA.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at with Valsalva maneuver after injection of agitated saline contrast.. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is trace valvular AI.

Small right pleural effusion is growing.
Moderate left pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse, severe pulmonary edema are stable.
Mild pulmonary edema has worsened.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement, atrial lead follows a more medial than normal course and is either beyond the tricuspid valve or in a very large right atrium, but it has not changed in position over many prior studies.
She had recucurrent rapid atrial fibrillation postoperatively which was treated with IV Amiodarone, beta blockers and was somewhat refractory to treatment.
Electrophysiology was consulted and Amiodarone was continued for the rapid ventricular response.
She went on to develop a mild contraction alkalosis and was started on a short course of Acetazolamide which will continue at rehab.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 -2.5.
Coumadin was held for several days prior to discharge to rehab due to a slightly supratherapeutic INR.
All wounds were clean and healing well at discharge and there was only a trace of leg edema.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every [**7-6**] hours as needed for fever or pain.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
