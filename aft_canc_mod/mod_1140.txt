He underwent a thorough urological evaluation at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital that was apparently negative for urogenital anomalies.
There appeared to be some small cystic areas that may be focal dilated bile ducts.
No other abnormalities were noted.
On [**2193-3-1**], he underwent an MRI of the abdomen with contrast which demonstrated an ill-defined mass in segment V to the right of the gallbladder fossa with associated segmental biliary ductal dilatation.
This was most suspicious for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
No other abnormalities were noted except for a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery.
The patient is completely asymptomatic.
He has no history of smoking, IV drug use, tatoos, marijuana use, hepatitis, blood transfusions, or piercings.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Abdomen:  Normal bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, masses, or tenderness.
Extremities:  No peripheral edema.
Intraoperatively, the patient had an approximately 5 liter estimated blood loss for which he received 5 units of packed red blood cells for blood loss anemia as well as 2 units of FFP to correct intraoperative coagulopathy.
He did receive subcutaneous heparin and Venodynes for DVT prophylaxis.
Epidural was in place for analgesia which appeared to work well immediately postoperatively.
The patient was extubated successfully on postoperative day number one after a chest x-ray ruled out any significant pulmonary edema and the patient made good response on the lowest settings available of the ventilator.
As well, the patient had a very high output through his JP drain.
Concern was raised for possible portal vein thrombosis causing a high amount of ascitic fluid.
The patient did receive a right upper quadrant ultrasound which ruled out any vascular abnormalities to the liver.
The patient will follow-up early next week with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the clinic at which time the JP may be removed if output is low enough.
He will at that time also have repeat laboratories.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient has been instructed to return for fever greater than 101.0, change in the JP drainage to a cloudy or green color, or vomiting.
