He had a CT of the head which showed a prominent extraaxial space in the right posterior fossa which could represent a subdural hematoma versus CSF hydroma.
He denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.

Prominent extra-axial space in the right posterior fossa, which may reflect a chronic subdural hematoma versus CSF hygroma.
Mucosal thickening involving the bilateral ethmoid sinuses and secretions within the left maxillary sinus.
Opacification of the mastoid air cells right greater than left s/p partial resection of the right mastoid air cells.
[**9-18**] CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary disease .
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response interspersed with sinus beats.
Normal axis, normal intervals, no acute ST segment changes, no priors for comparison.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presents with seizures and visual hallucinations with a serum alcohol level of 338 on presentation.
# Alcohol Withdrawal:  Patient remained hemodynamically stable but endorsed visual hallucinations and with a reported history of seizure on admission (although very elevated serum alcohol on presentation).
Presentation concerning for alcohol withdrawal and delerium tremens, although benzodiazepine intoxication can also appear similarly.
Time course is not appropriate for delerium tremens as last drink was less than 24 hours ago.
IVF were given for anion gap acidosis.
Of note: Pt is very anxious at baseline so this was taken into account when doing CIWA.
small subdural but neurosurgery has evaluated him and did not think likely this was a seizure focus.
No history of epilepsy.
After discussion with neurosurgery, pt was felt to have chronic hygroma, which does not require anti-seizure medications, intervention, or further follow-up.
# Atrial fibrillation:  New onset, in ICU.
No known history of arrhythmia.
TTE revealed slighltly depressed EF 50%, 1+AR.
# Anion gap acidosis:  Bicarbonate slightly decreased with an anion gap of 22 upon admission, closed with hydration.
# Hepatitis C:  Followed at [**Hospital1 2177**].
Transaminases elevated in the 200s, which may be related to combination of alcohol and viral illness.
Pt instructed to have outpatient followup.
# DISPOSITION: As above, pt found to have eloped prior to being given discharge paperwork, and AMA form.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: alcohol withdrawl paroxysmal atrial fibrillation right side hygroma on CT HEAD   Discharge Condition: vital signs stable, receivd 10mg PO valium 4 hours prior to discharge on day of discharge, understands risks of leaving AMA given results of echocardiogram pending.
your CT scan revealed a right side hygroma, you were seen by the neurosurgical service.
this does not require further intervention or follow-up.
you were found to have an abnormal heart rythym, called atrial fibrillation, and were started on a medication called metoprolol, and aspirin to prevent risk of stroke.
If you develop symptoms of headache, reccurent seizures, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other worrisome symptoms please contact your emergency department or primary care physician.
