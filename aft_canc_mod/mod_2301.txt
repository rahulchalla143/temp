Admission Date:  [**2135-12-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-12-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: 82M w/STIV NSCLC last admitted [**Date range (2) 35795**] for effusion; during that admission, pleuroscopy and talc pleurodesis were performed.
Today, he reported to the ED w/3 days of severe pleuritic, non-radiating substernal CP, SOB, and L leg pain.
On CTA, he was found to have PEs in the RUL, RLL and R pleural effusion.
Troponin elevated and TTE w/global decrease in function compared to prior.
Past Medical History: -Stage IV NSCLC w/ L malignant pleural effusion -CAD s/p stent LAD [**3-/2132**] -CHF (EF 30-40% [**2135-12-22**]) -RCC s/p left nephrectomy [**2113**] -Renal artery stenosis -CRI-baseline Cr 1.5 -Left CEA -HTN -DM II -hypercholesterolemia Gout Pulmonary hypertension.
ECG: ST @ 105/min w/1st degree HB (PR 188) and lateral ST depression increased since prior .
CTA: acute pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary arteries to the right upper and right lower lobes.
unchanged lung mets in the left lower lobe, right upper lobes.
new right pleural effusion.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, posterior wall, and lateral wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-12-12**], the left ventricular ejection fraction appears somewhat further reduced with more extensive regional wall motion abnormalities (but the ejction fraction may have been overestimated on the prior report).
LENIS b/l: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
This patient has multiple poor prognostic factors for this PE, including initially elevated troponin, decreased cardiac function on TTE compared to ten days prior, and strain on ECG.
Pleural Effusion- CTA showed thick rind around the left pleural surface, most likely representing malignant pleural disease.
In addition, a new small right pleural effusion was detected.
While PE can cause effusion, most likely re-accumulation secondary to malignancy.
Pain over old pleurodesis site was controlled with IV and PO narcotics.
Patient was discharged on Tylenol and PO Dilaudid PRN pain which optimally suppressed his symptoms.
Given productive cough, it was considered to represent a postobstructive pneumonia.
Elevations most likely reflected CRI and cardiac strain in setting of PE rather than active ischemia.
In addition, patient was already on a heparin drip as part of his PE management.
Low iron, high ferritin and low TIBC were in line with ACD.
Code- Discussed poor prognosis in the context of metastatic cancer and large PEs.
Dilaudid 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 14 days.
Post-obstructive pneumonia 4.
CAD 5.
Hypertension 2.
Type II diabetes 4.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, spontaneous bleeding or any other concerning symptoms.
