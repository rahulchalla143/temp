Admission Date:  [**2121-6-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-6-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2053-8-22**]     Sex:  F  Service:  UROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 11270**] is a 67-year-old female with a history of colon cancer status post [**3-30**] years ago followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
She recently developed vaginal bleeding which led to a CT scan and MRI which showed a large parasacral mass She underwent resection of the large parasacral mass along with reconstruction of the left uretero-ureteral anastomosis.
Approximately one week later, she had a CT scan which showed a large pelvic fluid collection with delayed contrast.
A drain was placed, and subsequent cystogram demonstrated a vesicovaginal fistula.
Cystoscopy with left retrograde pyelography demonstrated that the left ureter was intact without evidence of fistula at the site of previous repair.
Mitral valve prolapse.
Colon cancer status post chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
Ventral hernia repair.
Resection of parasacral pelvic mass.
ALLERGIES:  No known diagnostic allergies.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
Left carotid bruit present.
Extremities:  Nontender, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Her preoperative electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
She also had a revision colostomy along with removal replacement of the left ureteral stent and a sigmoid conduit urinary diversion.
The patient had an estimated blood loss of 1,000 cc and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
That evening she was noted to have a low blood pressure with low urine output and a low CVP and received multiple boluses of IV fluids and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
Her blood pressure and heart rate remained well controlled with IV metoprolol and her pain was controlled with the epidural until approximately postoperative day five.
She had no complications during this time, although her nasogastric tube was kept in place because she had no bowel activity at this time.
On postoperative day seven, a flat plate of the abdomen was obtained because it was thought that the patient may have an ileus versus a mechanical bowel obstruction.
An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
On the morning of postoperative day 10, the patient complained of dizziness, which resolved after transferring bed to the chair.
An electrocardiogram obtained at that time revealed atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled and converted to sinus rhythm with 5 mg of IV diltiazem.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, and the Cardiology service was notified.
She was again converted with an increased dose of Lopressor and she remained comfortable and hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of her hospitalization.
She did have some difficulty being weaned from oxygen throughout the course of her stay.
This is thought to be do to some minor effusions secondary to the fluid shifts from surgery.
The patient remained asymptomatic, was free of pain, was ambulating without difficulty, and was tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge.
Her echocardiogram performed hospitalization revealed an ejection fraction of 25% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesia.
They felt that she was asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, and probably developed the atrial fibrillation as a result of fluid shifts during surgery.
Vesicovaginal fistula.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Ischemic heart disease.
Mitral valve prolapse.
