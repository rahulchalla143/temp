He was transferred form the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath and vomiting x1.
Left ventricular Hypertrophy 4.
CHF EF 50% last echo [**2184**] PSH: [**5-18**] Replacement of the arch ascending aorta and aortic valve with a valve conduit composite using a [**Street Address(2) 11688**].
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical prosthesis and a separate piece of 25 mm weave tube graft with profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest, and direct reimplantation of the coronary ostia.
There is a 7.3 cm x 7.5 cm contained hematoma within the surgical bed of recent appendectomy, just inferior to the suture line.
There is a hematocrit effect indicating recent bleed without evidence of active extravasation.
Moderate amount of high density free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis, suggesting intra-peritoneal extension of the bleed into the abdomen and pelvis.
Airspace opacity within the lingula consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis.
Multiple compression fractures within the spine with post-vertebroplasty changes at L1, L3, and L5.
These fractures are old and no evidence of acute fracture is identified.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-4-4**]  12:07:18 PM Atrial fibrillation Ventricular paced beat Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2187-7-26**], atrial fibrillation now present     Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 73 0 88 400/425.57 0 34 -50  .
Simple-appearing right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, without evidence of hemorrhage or enhancement.
Persistent hemorrhagic ascites around the liver and spleen.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-14**] 3:19 PM IMPRESSION: Increased right pleural effusion and adjacent opacity representing atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Interval increase in the left retrocardiac opacity and left pleural effusion as well.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-16**] 9:48 AM SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: When compared to prior study performed the day before, there has been mild interval increase in moderate right pleural effusion and associated right lower lobe atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
Probable small increase in size of right-sided pleural effusion with increased right lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
Small left apical lucency is likely related to technical artifact from lordotic view with pneumothorax felt unlikely.
If there is clinical concern, a repeat radiograph may be obtained sooner.
This has been evacuated, and there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions present.
Consolidation in the right lower lobe has progressed as has the consolidation in the left lower lobe.
2) Right upper extremity fat containing mass inadequately assessed on this study.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-26**] 9:59 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-20**] through 5: Mild pulmonary edema has worsened and small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, have increased since [**4-22**].
No pneumothorax.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left axillary pacemaker and unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-29**] 8:58 AM INDICATION: Status post right-sided VATS procedure.
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position, and analysis is performed in direct comparison with a similar study dated [**2190-4-27**].
Pulmonary vasculature with bilateral considerable perivascular haze and diffuse densities on the bases consistent with bilateral pleural effusions.
No significant interval change is identified during the recent examination interval [**4-27**] through [**4-29**].
Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted on [**2190-4-4**] and he was transfused 3 FFP and 1 unit PRBC, and 10mg Vit K.  Resp: On CT, he was noted to have right sided pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis.
On [**4-5**], he had a increasing moderate size pleural effusion and he had a US guided tap for ~400cc fluid.
A repeat CT on [**2190-4-9**] showed Right basal chest tube in place, with overall decrease in amount of right pleural fluid, with small loculated component along the right major fissure.
Also, interval increase in size of small left pleural effusion.
He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress on and was eventually intubated.
Due to the persistent effusion and repeated taps and tPA of the chest tubes on the right side, the Thoracic team took him to the OR on [**2190-4-14**] for a VATS.
He had a Right-sided pneumonia and right complex parapneumonic effusion.
On [**2190-4-20**] he had a Flexible bronchoscopy for Respiratory failure, ventilator- associated pneumonia, and moderate-to-severe tracheal bronchomalacia.
ID: He was started on Levaquin for evidence of pneumonia.
