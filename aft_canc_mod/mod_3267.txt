He reports 5-6 days of URI symptoms, myalgias, cough productive of yellow sputum, decreased appetite, and poor PO intake.
He presented to heme/onc clinic today and reported headache and nausea with improved after 1L NS.
He was afebrile but hypoxic to 90% on RA, which improved to 94% on 2L.
BMT wanted to give IVIG due to low IgG, but pt was too hypoxic.
Pt c/o resp fatigue.

[**2147-2-3**] 4:07 am URINE Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2147-2-3**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2147-2-6**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       YEAST.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2147-2-6**]):       Negative for Influenza B.
Bibasilar bronchiectasis, unchanged compared with yesterdays examination with mulktilobar peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity with a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] configuration.
This pattern is nonspecific infectious or inflammatory, and consistent with small airways infection, atypical infections including fungal infection such as aspergillosis.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
Echocardiography [**1-30**]: Poor image quality.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 56M with h/o AML s/p allo SCT c/b chronic skin/pulmonary GVHD, who presented to clinic with URI symptoms, myalgias, and decreased PO intake and was found to be hypoxic, admitted on [**2147-1-27**] and discharged on [**2147-2-12**].
# Hypoxia: On admission was hypoxic to 90% on RA, febrile and w/o leukocytosis then rapidly developed more profound hypoxia on the floor.
Underwent CTA which demonstrated multifocal tree-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities consistent with bronchiolitis and ruled out PE.
Nasal swab DFA Was positive for influenza.
His high oxygen demand was thought to be multifactorial with viral bronchiolitis/pneumonitis and possibly exacerbation of underlying chronic pulmonary GVH.
Other contributing mechanisms were atelectasis, under-recruitment and sleep apnea as evidenced by his improved oxygenation with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
Significant Heart Failure was ruled out per [**Male First Name (un) 72257**] and normal echocardiography.
D/t to his high risk of superinfection as well as possible LLL infiltrate he was also covered with Abx: Vanco+Aztereonem+Azithro were started on [**1-27**], on [**2-2**] aztreonem was changed to meropenem for more wide spectrum coverage.
IVIG was given on [**1-30**] for hypogammaglobulinemia and influenza infection without complications.
Patient continued to require 60-80% of Oxygen throughout most of his ICU stay which we were able to wean to 50% on non-invasive ventilation, but patient did not tolerated this due to discomfort from the mask.
He was instructed to have follow up appointment with his doctor to determine further need for oxygen requirement as his pneumonia improves.
# AML: s/p SCT ([**6-/2143**]), c/b chronic GVHD of skin/lungs.
# Hypogammaglobulinemia.
# H/o PE:  Patient was intially supertheraputic d/t azithromycin therapy, recieved vitamin K and warfarine was held.
He then became undertheraputic and was bridged with Lovenox.
# Type 2 DM.
# Hypertension.
# Hyperlipidemia.
# Previous EKG changes: Early in ICU course patient noted to have transient lateral/posterior ST depressions in V4-V6, I and AvL.
This was likely demand ischemia in this patient with multiple coronary risk factors but no known CAD.
Pulse dose for portability.

You were admitted to the hospital for cough and increased trouble with breathing.
In the hospital, it was found that you have influenza pneumonia.
Because of your increased oxygen use, you were transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
You were treated with an antiviral for the flu as well as antibiotics for possible bacterial pneumonia as well.
Please note the following changes in your medications: - Please START supplemental oxygen at 2-3L/min, continuously, until your pneumonia and shortness of breath have resolved.
