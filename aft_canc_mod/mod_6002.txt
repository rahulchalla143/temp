She denies any pleuritic component to this L lower chest pain, without radiation to her back or neck/arm.
She denies any [**Month/Day/Year 9140**] SOB, or dyspnea on exertion from her prior baseline.
She does state that she has had [**Month/Day/Year 9140**] abdominal distension and describes her LUQ abd pain as "gurgling" in nature.
No hematemesis, diarrhea.

Lung CA:  father, sister   Physical Exam: VS: T95.5  HR135  BP 104/78  RR 28 o2sat: 96% on 4L NC GEN: Appears stated age, mild discomfort due to pain, able to speak in full sentences HEENT: Anicteric sclera bilat.
NECK: No elevated JVP CV: Tachycardic.
No murmurs RESP: Decreased BS at bases R>L, crackles @ both bases.
Decreased percussion bilat.
CHEST/ABD: Mild TTP over distal ribs on L chest.
No fluid wave.
EXT:  No edema bilat.
No ST or TW changes.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anteriorspace which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Chronic pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and right lower lobe pulmonary artery with interval retraction of left main PA clot.
No acute pulmonary embolism identified.
New moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar consolidation, probably atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No significant change in appearance of the right hemithorax including moderate right pleural effusion, concentric pleural thickening, and right lower lobe consolidation with interstitial thickening possibly indicating lymphangitic spread of tumor.
No significant change in mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Interval [**Month/Day (4) 9140**] in now moderate-to-severe ascites and increased omental soft tissue consistent with [**Month/Day (4) 9140**] omental carcinomatosis.
No significant change in innumerable hepatic metastases.
No significant change in diffuse osseous metastases.
Enlarged subcutaneous soft tissue densities of the abdominal wall may represent injection sites or less likely metastatic foci.
Brief Hospital Course: This was a 53 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA unresponsive to previous chemo regimens, chronic PE on Lovenox, and asthma who presented with hypoxia and abdominal pain.
#HYPOXIA The patient had a known chronic R pleural effusion, with stable chronic PEs who presented with SOB and new L pleural effusion.
Her new L pleural effusion likely represents a malignant effusion given lack of infectious symptoms and h/o R malignant effusion.
#HYPOTENSION/TACHYCARDIA Likely etiology of hypotension is hypovolemia secondary to decreased PO intake.
No PE was seen on CT.  3L of ascites fluid was drained in ED without evidence of SBP or other systemic infection.
There may have been an element of adrenal insufficiency given metastatic involvement of R adrenal gland and prior removal.
#L CHEST/ABD PAIN This likely represented an element of musculoskeletal pain from osteolytic lesions as seen on CT torso, with a component of hypercalcemia.
#Hypercalcemia This was thought to be due to malignancy.
# Hx of PE She was continued on her treatment regimen of Lovenox 70mg SC bid.
There was no evidence of new/[**Month/Day (4) 9140**] clot burden at this time.
#Breast CA Pt with metastatic breast CA that has not responded to tx as above.
Recently started on doxorubicin 1 month ago for refractory metastatic breast CA.
CT torso today revealed [**Month/Day (4) 9140**] metastatic disease with [**Month/Day (4) 9140**] omental carcinomatosis.
Please return to the emergency room should you experience severe nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, diarrhea or other symptoms that concern you.
