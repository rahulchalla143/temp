HPI: Screening chest CT [**2165-8-2**] revealing a large pericardial effusion measuring 3.4cm in thickness which was new compared to CT scan [**2165-6-14**].
He has had dyspnea on exertion and at rest for last week.
No evidence of clinical tamponade: pulsus 8-10 mm hg, no elevation in JVP, normotensive.
Echo yesterday confirmed large effusion, 1.5-2cm circumferential; + respiratory variation in inflow, brief RA invagination, no RV collapse.
CT surgery saw pt for window & are suggesting pericariocentesis, feel likely post-op rather than malignant.
father died of MI in 60s.
mother died of MI in 80s.

Flow-Volume Loop:  Reduced volume excursion.
Volumes:    The TLC is mildly reduced while the FRC, RV and RV/TLC ratio are             within normal limits.
DLCO:       Mildly reduced.
Impression: Mild restrictive ventilatory defect [**2165-4-11**] ECHO:  Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
(Pleura) (A):Fragment of fibrous tissue with malignant and mesothelioma.
2)  Tumor focally invading into lung parenchyma and soft tissue of chest wall, and is focally within less than 1 mm of the black inked resection margin.
4)  Lymphangiovascular tumor invasion present.
5)  Thirteen hilar lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/13).
Uninvolved lung parenchyma show mild emphysematous changes.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No color doppler was performed across the mitral valve to assess for the presence of AI.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No color doppler performed across the aortic valve to assess for the presence of MR. 6.There is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is no pericardial thickening.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
However, there is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
No evidence of tamponade.
4.There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade [**2165-8-8**] CXR: Patient s/p right pneumonectomy with large amount of fluid occupying the right hemithorax.
No left effusion is identified.
No pneumothorax is seen on the left side.

A repeat echo showed minimal pericardial effusion and drain was pulled after being in place for 24 hours.
His pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells but did contain numerous lymphocytes, red blood cells, macrophages and rare reactive mesothelial cells.
