TEE revealed 3+AI without aortic valve vegetation.
He was d/c'd home on a 4 week course of cefazolin only to return [**3-2**] with fever and rash.
TEE was repeated on [**3-8**] and revealed small (0.5x0.6) vegetation on the aortic valve and 4+AI.
Additionally, he developed diplopia which was worked up and concluded to be a new septic embolus.
The patient was discharged with the plan of 6 weeks of vancomycin, and AVR following completion of antibiotic course.
TEE showing no interval change in known aortic vegetation.
Pt had CT abd/pelvis showing improvement in splenic emboli/infarctions, no other abscesses or other sources of infection.
Pt developed diffuse erythematous rash on back, face, chest, all extremities, which improved quickly and was thought to be related to the Vancomycin and IV contrast he had received for the CT scan.

[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is fibrinous material seen on both the leaflets of the aortic valve towards the left ventricular outflow tract region.
There is also associated leaflet perforation.There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
