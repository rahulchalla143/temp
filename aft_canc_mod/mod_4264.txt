This was completely excised and there was a scar consistent with a prior excision.
He did well until [**2129-10-11**] at which time he was noted to have a swelling in the region of the tail of the right parotid.
Past Medical History: Past medical history remarkable for coronary artery disease with cardiac catheterization showing 2 completely blocked arteries that were not stentable.
He is status post herniorrhaphy and has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, with most recent platelet count being 101,000.
Physical Exam: Elderly man in no acute distress.
NECK: There was a soft tissue mass approximately 3 cm in diameter in the tail of the right parotid gland.
