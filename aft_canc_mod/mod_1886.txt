Admission Date:  [**2173-10-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-11-1**]   Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old gentleman status post left lower lobe lung lobectomy who was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit team from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit team on [**2173-10-30**] for failure to wean off ventilation.
The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of throat cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2173-5-28**] for leg claudication and at that time an admission chest x-ray showed right upper lobe and left lower lobe lung masses.
At that time he had a right upper lobe wedge resection and pleural biopsy which was negative for malignancy on pathology, and he also had a negative bone scan and head MRI for metastatic disease.
In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year he was admitted again for an uncomplicated left femoral peroneal bypass surgery for his leg claudication, and further workup at that time revealed a left lower lobe 3-cm mass.
So, he was electively admitted on [**2173-10-15**] for a left lower lobectomy.
He had no immediate complications post surgery and was easily extubated.
However, on postoperative day one he had an episode of atrial fibrillation and hypotension, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
He was aggressively volume resuscitated and then intubated for progressive respiratory distress.
He also had several bronchoscopies during this admission which showed multiple mucous plugs and left upper lobe collapse.
Sputum from the bronchoscopy grew Klebsiella and Serratia which were pan sensitive, and he was started on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.
He was briefly extubated between [**10-21**] and [**10-22**]; however, he was reintubated for respiratory distress on [**10-22**].
His chest x-ray showed progressive bilateral multilobar pneumonia versus acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Efforts at weaning were limited by secretions, high oxygen requirement, and increased respiratory rate if pressure support was decreased, and he was requested to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Throat cancer, status post radiation therapy complicated by esophageal stricture requiring dilation.
Bilateral leg claudication, status post left femoral peroneal bypass in [**2173-7-28**].
Cervical spine fusion.
Status post colectomy secondary to diverticulitis.
Bilateral carotid asymptomatic 60% stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HEENT revealed pinpoint pupils, minimally reactive.
No jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed left lung with coarse breath sounds, right upper quadrant coarse breath sounds.
Abdomen was soft, slightly distended, very hypoactive bowel sounds.
Pulmonary function tests on [**2173-8-16**] revealed FEV1 of 1.34 (57% of predicted), FEV1:FVC 106% of predicted, TLC 75% of predicted, DSBVA 53% of predicted, BL/VA 85% of predicted; with conclusion consistent with an interstitial process.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray on [**2173-9-29**] revealed extensive left lung consolidation throughout, right upper lobe consolidation, probable left lower lobe effusion.
Most recent electrocardiogram on [**2173-10-25**] revealed sinus at 90, normal axis, intervals 0.2/0.12/0.36, diffuse T wave flattening in limb leads which were new compared to preoperative electrocardiogram on [**2173-9-30**].
No acute ST-T wave changes.
Echocardiogram stress in [**2173-5-28**] showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 70%, no wall motion abnormalities, no ischemia.
Left lower lobe pathology revealed squamous cell carcinoma with no lymph node involvement.
IMPRESSION:  A 77-year-old gentleman status post left lower lobectomy on postoperative day 15 with diffuse alveolar infiltrates and consolidations suggestive of pneumonia bilaterally; now with difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.
This fact, and his diffuse pneumonia would cause a decrease in ventilation.
He also had a decreased compliance suggestive of possible acute respiratory distress syndrome.
His hypercarbia was secondary to poorly ventilated areas of his lungs.
He became progressively acidotic by his followed arterial blood gas, and his set respiratory rate was increased to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
A repeat chest x-ray showed continuation of diffuse alveolar infiltrations bilaterally, left greater than right.
His metabolic acidosis was most likely secondary to his progressive renal failure.
On the night of [**10-31**], he was started on a bicarbonate drip given his worsening acidosis.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  RHYTHM:  His of atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular rate.
He was started on procainamide drip by the surgical team; however, since postoperative day one he had normal runs of atrial fibrillation and once he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the procainamide drip stopped.
He had no more runs of atrial fibrillation under the Medical Intensive Care Unit's care.
However, in order to rule out cardiogenic shock, and echocardiogram was done on [**11-1**] which was within normal limits.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing Klebsiella and Serratia pan sensitive.
His subclavian tip grew vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus and was removed.
On [**10-31**], two more blood cultures were checked as they were on [**11-1**] given his rising temperature.
His white blood cell count continued to rise despite his antibiotic treatment, and with his hypotension this was consistent with a septic picture.
RENAL:  The patient developed progressive acute renal failure.
This was thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis from his hypotension.
Urine electrolytes were checked, and his FENa was calculated at 1.3; not consistent with a prerenal etiology.
All of his medications were renally doses on [**11-1**], and his urine output progressively decreased and became darker in coloration.
He had a Dobbhoff feeding tube in place situated correctly in post pyloric; however, because of his increasing liver function tests tube feeds were held off, and then they were never started because of his lack of bowel sounds and lack of peristalsis.
This was thought to be secondary to mixed picture of shocked liver versus obstructive due to total parenteral nutrition versus ceftazidime or other medications causing hepatic obstruction.
Enzyme elevation:  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done on [**10-31**] which revealed no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, no biliary obstruction.
Coarse hypoechoic appearance to the liver which was suggestive of fatty liver versus other forms of liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis; unchanged from his previous right upper quadrant.
Because of his increasing blood glucose levels the amount of insulin in his total parenteral nutrition was increased accordingly.
However, he did have diarrhea on [**11-1**] which was guaiac-negative.
His phosphorous was climbing with his renal insufficiency, and therefore it was not added to his total parenteral nutrition.
His blood glucose did increase, most likely secondary to the total parenteral nutrition and insulin was added to the total parenteral nutrition.
Peripheral access, Protonix, and subcutaneous heparin.
PULMONARY:  He was ventilator dependent, increasingly so, requiring increased sedation to passively ventilate him.
His recent left lower lobectomy which reduced his lung volumes, his multilobar pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
He was approaching intubation for 10 days, and therefore if aggressive care was continued a tracheostomy would be considered; however, in his current status he may not tolerate a tracheostomy placement especially given his underlying throat cancer.
RENAL:  The patient was in worsening renal failure and worsening acidosis as a result with decreased urine output, and the next therapeutic step would be to involve the Renal team and initiate hemodialysis.
HEMODYNAMICS:  Hemodynamic wise, he was hypotensive and dependent on two pressors; namely, Levophed and vasopressin drip to maintain his blood pressure.
He also had the history of atrial fibrillation during his hospital stay.
LIVER:  The patient has having increasing liver function tests and was in moderate liver dysfunction.
It was discussed that his prognosis was very grave given this multisystem failure and that there was a small chance of survival and recovery from this.
His wife brought with her the patient's living will which was signed by him in [**2161**] in which he states that if he is in no position to speak for himself and in a state from which there was no hope of recovery he would desire no means of life-sustaining methods including no artifical ventilation, antibiotics or hemodialysis.
The patient was recently in acute acidotic coma, and when he recovered expressed regret at surviving through hit.
The patient's blood pressure and heart rate continued to decline off of the pressors, and at approximately 7:30 p.m. his monitor showed a flat line.
He had no pulse.
