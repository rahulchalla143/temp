Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-1-28**], no major change is evident.
Evidence of chronic thromboembolic disease and pulmonary hypertension with pruning and narrowing of distal branches.
Right hilar mass which encases a pulmonary artery and appears to slightly compress the right bronchi.
Slightly increased attenuation material within the bronchi is seen -- while this may represent mucoid material or thrombus, invasion of a malignant tumor into the bronchus cannot be excluded.
Left flank hernia involving a small portion of the descending colon.
Unchanged appearance of emphysema and chronic lung disease.
Slight increase in probable left pleural effusion.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
CXR: [**2149-5-30**]: INDICATION FOR STUDY: Right hilar mass with hemoptysis, status post bronchoscopy, evaluate for any interval change.
These features are superimposed on emphysema and chronic lung disease.
The left pleural effusion is again noted and not significantly changed.
IMPRESSION: New right lower lobe and probable left lower lobe consolidation in this patient with a right hilar mass.
[**5-31**]: Biopsy of R lung mass: Lung, right lower lobe, biopsy:  Organizing hemorrhage and scant bronchial tissue with squamous metaplasia; no malignancy identified.
Progression of small foci of consolidation in the right upper lobe over the past three days, most likely pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis unchanged.
Mild interstitial edema and moderate cardiomegaly stable.
Right ventricular pacer defibrillator and right atrial and ventricular pacer leads unchanged in their respective positions.
[**2149-6-4**]; CXR: FINDINGS: Pulmonary edema continues.
Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged as well as bibasilar atelectasis.
Bronchial mucosa with distorted atypical cells suspicious for large cell carcinoma, see level 1 recut.
[**6-5**]: IR Procedure: IMPRESSION:  No active bleeding was identified doing right pulmonary artery arteriogram and right brachial artery arteriogram.No abnormal arteries identified .
[**6-10**]: IR Embolization: FINDINGS:  Right fifth intercostal arteriogram demonstrates a patent artery with no evidence of blood supply to the lung.
The right sixth intercostal artery origin from the aorta bifurcates early and supplies the right sixth and seventh intercostal spaces.
No definite blood supply to the lung from either level.
Descending thoracic aortogram demonstrates patency of the descending thoracic aorta with mild mural irregularity and calcification consistent with atherosclerosis.
A dilated tortuous right bronchial artery is identified.
Right bronchial arteriography demonstrates a dilated tortuous patent right bronchial artery with collateral flow to a second more inferior artery.
In addition, there is evidence of bronchial artery to pulmonary artery shunting in the right lower lobe.
Right bronchial arteriography through the microcatheter was performed at two stations to confirm on going patency and inflow of blood into the bronchial artery, which was present.
In addition, based on the findings of these diagnostic arteriogram, it was determined that the patient was a suitable candidate for and may benefit from right bronchial artery embolization.
IMPRESSION:  Dilated tortuous right bronchial artery with supply to lung in the expected region of the known hilar mass.
Partial embolization of the region of the mass was performed with 700-900 micrometer embospheres.
[**6-12**]: PET-CT: There is no focally abnormal increase of uptake of FDG within the lungs at distant sites.
CT images show multiple paratracheal/precarinal lymph nodes which have FDG avidity similar to the remainder to the mediastinum.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, associated with atelectasis, ground-glass opacities, and regions of bronchial calcification/collapse at the right lower lobe with endobronchial opacities are present.
The right kidney has a somewhat irregular contour, possibly secondary to scarring.
IVC filter is seen, and extensive vascular calcifications are seen within the great vessels as well as coronary arteries.
Air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus is consistent with sinusitis.
Physiologic uptake is seen in the heart, distal right ureter, and bladder.
Sensitivity of examination for detection of neoplasm is slightly decreased due to the redistribution of FDG to the skeletal muscles.
No suspicious regions of FDG avidity are seen, neither in the right hilum nor at distant sites.
[**6-12**]: CT Head with Contrast: CONCLUSION:  No significant changes since [**2148-12-20**].
Evidence of old infarction with no evidence of metastatic disease.
Note that MR with contrast is more sensitive than CT for detecting metastasis .
[**6-12**]: CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an apparent right-sided infrahilar mass which is seen compressing the right lower lobe bronchus and arteries and extends into the subcarinal region.
There is mucous plugging involving the bronchi to the right lower lobe with partial collapse of the right lower lobe.
Mural thrombus is identified within the left lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery which appears slightly decreased from the previous exam, consistent with chronic thromboembolic disease.
There are small, bilateral pleural effusions.
There are prominent mediastinal lymph nodes with a right paratracheal node measuring 2.6 x 1.5 cm and multiple left hilar nodes, the largest measuring 1.5 x 1.0 cm.
The lung windows show increased septal lines with scattered ground-glass opacities suggesting fluid overload.

BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Degenerative changes are seen within the lumbar spine and hips.
Apparent soft tissue mass within the right infrahilar region which appears to be extending into the subcarinal region.
This mass is obstructing the right inferior lobe bronchus and attenuating the right inferior lobe pulmonary artery.
There is mucous plugging and partial collapse of the right lower lobe.
Prominent mediastinal and left-sided hilar lymph nodes.
Findings consistent with chronic thromboembolic disease as seen previously.

The patient underwent CT scan in the ED, which showed encasement of the right pulmonary artery/bronchus by a lung mass on admission.
HOD #2: The patient continued to have hemoptysis on the floor.
On HD #3 decision was made to defer bronchoscopy due to elevated INR.
He received 2.5 mg of PO Vitamin K.  The patient continued to have small (1 tsp) episodes of hemoptysis on the floor.
During the flexible bronchoscopy, he was found to have significant bleeding and his R bronchus intermedius was occluded by a blood clot, which could not be aspirated.
IP was emergently consulted and felt that the patient needed a rigid bronchoscopy.
He was given 3 more units of FFP and 1U PRBC and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring, and to await rigid bronchoscopy by Interventional Pulmonology.
On HD #5, IP then did a rigid bronch and found a tumor/clot in the basilar RLL and superior segment of RLL.
Upon subsequent extubatation, his hemoptysis resolved and he had blood tinged yellow sputum.
He continued to have hemoptysis on the floor (5-6 episodes of maroon/red sputum) and pulmonary and Rad Onc were consulted.
He underwent the transbronchial needle aspiration and biopsy and argon plasma coagulation procedure;  during the procedure, he was noted to have massive hemoptysis.
He was taken to IR - where he had both a R pulmonary artery and R bronchial artery arteriograms, but no clear source of bleeding could be identified for embolization.
HD #15: Underwent embolization of R bronchial artery supplying superior segment of RLL.
Briefly, he is likely a stage IIIB NSCLC - if we interpret his limited pathology as correct and given that he has contralateral medistinal LAD.
His PET CT suffered from diminished sensitivity because patient ate prior to scan.
Because of his multiple comorbidities, he may not have a high enough performance status to receive chemotherapy; this is to be discussed further with patient and his oncologist.
The secondary benefit of receiving XRT is that once the course is completed, that will be the point where the patient can restart his anticoagulation for his chronic PEs/DVTs.
His additional problems were managed as follows:  # Hemoptysis/lung mass: - as above .
Normocytic Anemia with elevated RDW in setting of recent pulm bleed.
Likely anemia of chronic disease.
- B12, folate wnl - low iron, increased ferritin, low transferrin c/w anemia of chronic disease -> hence no benefit of Fe supplementation.
Underlying neoplastic processes likely contributing; patient also has other chronic diseases.
Coumadin held due to bleeding risk.
Blood cultures were negative, but his urine culture grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive to Ceftriaxone.
Rate / Rhythm: Has BiV pacer, ICD - Dig level 1.1 - no events on tele while in house .
He was intermittently given lasix as needed for mild overload.
# CRI: at baseline.
- Daily weights, I/Os, given h/o CHF - I/O goal: even to net negative .
# L heel ulcer: - daily dressing changes - multipodus splints and vitamin C/Zinc .
# Code: Full.
