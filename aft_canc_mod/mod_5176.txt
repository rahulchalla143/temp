Unchanged appearance of osseous metastasis  .
Brief Hospital Course: # acute blood loss anemia/hemoperitoneum: Likely bleeding from hepatic tumors, however, angio did not identify obviously bleeding lesions, so no embolization performed initially.
Pt then had increased abdominal distension and pain; repeat CT scan did not show demonstrable change in hemoperitoneum, but could not rule out continued oozing from liver lesions.
R hepatic artery was therefore embolized with Gel-foam to prevent further/future bleeding.
# Fevers: No clinical signs that would indicate current infection, as pt w/o cough, SOB, dysuria, or diahrea.
Fevers believed to be secondary either to diffuse cancer or blood in peritoneum.
Pain due to carcinomatosis of abdomien.
As pt has failed multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, felt that would not gain advantage from additional treatment.
