Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the PACU to the gynecology service after her total laparoscopic hysterectomy/ cystoscopy ([**2195-11-17**]) given extended length of procedure as well as post-op dizziness and tachycardia.
Patient did well the night of POD #0 however had persistent low grade tachycardia with heart rate in the ~100's.
POD #1, patient was started on clears, transitioned to PO pain meds, and her IV was saline locked.
Throughout the day her vitals remained stable with persistent low grade tachycardia.
She had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia without ST changes.
In the evening she began to feel slightly distended and was taking less orally due to feeling of fullness.
Given unexplained persistent tachycardia she had a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism.
This study was negative for pulmonary embolism but revealed pneumoperitoneum.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was ordered to assess her bowel injury given the aptient's increasing abdominal distention and new symptoms of nausea and vomiting suspicious for a post-operative bowel injury likely related to her recent laparosocpic hysterectomy.
The general surgery team performed a exploratory laparotomy and found a 1.5 cm bowel perforation and stool in the abdominal cavity.
A small bowel resection and reanastomosis procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and the general surgery team (greatly appreciated).
Her abdominal incision was closed primarily with staples on the skin and with wicks spaced between the skin staples.
Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid PCA and Toradol.
On ICU day two the patient's WBC count was trending down, she was afebrile and blood cultures remained negative.
The patient had one episode of chest tightness that lasted for several minutes.
There were no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient then complained of abdominal discomfort and Abdom XRay showed findings consistent with an ileus.
CXR also done at this time showed increased pleural fluid so the patient was given 10 IV Lasix with good urine output.
She did have an isolated T max of 101.0 on [**11-22**], and spontaneously defervesced to 97.6.
The NGT was kept in place until [**11-23**], when a clamp trial revealed low residual, so it was removed.
However, she did spike a fever to 101.0 again on the evening of [**11-23**], and had new complaint of abdominal pain; blood and urine cultures were done, as was a CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
The final read on this revealed no anastomotic leak, but did find an infrasplenic fluid collection, which was read as amenable to drainage.
The patient did continue to complain of bilateral flank and upper-abdominal pain, but denied nausea or vomiting and continued to tolerate sips.
She did have dizziness with walking.
She did complain of feeling urgency to have a bowel movement and continued to have "upset stomach" but had been tolerating her clear diet well.
She also c/o some mild chest discomfort, which was thought to be likely due to subcutaneous air.
This pain appeared to resolve.
A set of LFTs were done which revealed a mild transaminitis as well as elevated amylase and lipase.
On POD #[**10-19**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] complained of retching and nausea.
She remained afebrile but had a white count of 16.5.
She had been kept NPO overnight for drainage of the perisplenic fluid collection to assess for an abscess.
Her LFTs continued to be mildly elevated, and it was felt she had TPN-related transaminitis.
Her abdominal exam remained benign and she had no further episodes of nausea or retching.
Nothing grew out of the perisplenic fluid collection.
This was done on [**12-1**] (POD#14/12), and revealed no acute findings.
She ambulated around the floor frequently, produced appropriate amounts of urine, had resolution of diarrhea, continued to be afebrile, and tolerated a regular diet.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
