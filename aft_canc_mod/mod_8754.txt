EGD [**2133-2-26**]: Normal mucosa in the esophagus Patchy gastritis in antrum and fundus Patchy duodenitis in duodenal bulb Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Our findings do not account for a bleeding source from esophagus to second part of duodenum Continue high dose PPI   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 83 y/o man with PMH of CAD s/p 3V CABG in [**2122**], NSTEMI in [**2-2**] with DES in left main, ESRD on HD, PVD, AAA s/p repair, bullous pemphigoid, h/o UGIB 2 months ago, ischemic colitis [**3-6**], was originally admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2133-2-22**] with black stool and epistaxis.
Melena/Epistaxis - Given patient's history, initial concern for UGIB due to melanotic stools and history of PUD.
However, patient had history of severe epistaxis lasting for several hours that corresponded with the onset of melena.
Initial Hct drop since prior discharge led to 1 unit PRBC transfusion in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], though patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during his ICU course with no further bleeding requiring aggressive resuscitation.
Did not have any further episodes of melena of epistaxis.
GI team was re-consulted to discuss utility of scoping procedure given indeterminate source of bleeding in setting of high bleeding risk (chronic aspirin, long-term prednisone for bullous pemphigoid, platelet dysfunction with ESRD) and prior significant UGIB.
Patient underwent EGD, which did not show any source of bleed to cause melena.
Anemia - Upon admission, hematocrit found to be 29, which is significantly lower from 37 approximately 2 months prior.
Anemia in this patient likely multifactorial.
Patient with ESRD on HD, diverticulosis, recent epistaxis, history of PUD, with ferritin of 510, TIBC 192, Iron 23, Trans 148, Folate 15.2, B12 865 on [**11-5**].
CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG in [**2122**] and NSTEMI s/p DES in [**2130**].
Pt chest pain free and with normal ECG.
Aspirin was initially held in the setting of melena and hematocrit drop but will be restarted as an outpatient at dose of 81mg daily on [**2133-3-12**], 2 weeks after normal EGD.
# Squamous Cell CA of tongue - Patient is currently deferring treatment with radiation or chemotherapy.
