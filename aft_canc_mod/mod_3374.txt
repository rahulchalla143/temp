Ext: PICC site on the Left demonstrates no tenderness to palpation.
No streaking or cellulitis present.
Lower extremeties demonstrated diffuse extreme pitting edema.
Non-specific ST segment changes in the precordial leads and in the inferior leads.
[**2143-6-29**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2143-6-29**] 11:00 AM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76388**] CTA ABD & PELVIS and CHEST  1.
No evidence of acute aortic syndrome, no aortic dissection.
Focal area of hypoenhancement and edema centered in the pacreatic head and neck, consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Moderate amount of simple free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis is new since [**2142-1-15**] exam and likely relates to underlying panreatitis.
No pseudcyst formation or vascular complications at this time.
Coarse hepatic calcification is longstanding and likely represents sequela of prior infection or trauma.
Severe coronary artery calcifications.
Persistent thrombosis of the infrarenal aorta.
[**2143-6-30**] 9:02 AM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76389**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US-IMPRESSION: Sludge ball in the gallbladder neck, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis on US.
Normal 5-mm CBD without evidence of obstruction.
Diffuse signal abnormality involving the pancreas with hypointensity on the T1 sequences and hyperintensity on the T2 sequences most consistent with diffuse pancreatitis.
1.2 cm pancreatic cyst.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
This may represent acute ischemia or, more likely, an electrolyte abnormality.
New focus of gas within paripancreatic fluid anterior to the pancreatic head is highly concerning for infection.
No drainable collections are present.
Markedly increased stranding and neighboring fluid throughout the pancreas, with two evolving foci of necrosis within the pancreatic head.
New moderate narrowing of the SMV/portal vein confluence; the vessels remain patent.
New moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis is new since [**2143-6-29**].
Moderate amount of fluid surrounding the inferior aspect of the liver and along the right paracolic gutter.
Chronic occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
[**2143-7-13**]   Radiology PORTABLE ABDOMEN There is no interval development of substantial bowel dilatation, neither small nor large.
Calcification projecting over the liver is redemonstrated, known.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
Interval increase in size of hemorrhagic peripancreatic collections and increased size of right subhepatic collection.
Extrinsic compression of the distal CBD by the enlarged peripancreatic collection at the pancreatic head.
Severely attenuated portal vein, splenic vein, SMV and splenic artery, again secondary to compression by the peripancreatic collections.
No definite evidence of thrombus or pseudoaneurysm formation; focal contour deformity of the main portal vein is unchanged and probably secondary to mass effect from adjacent inflammatory change and collections; nonocclusive thrombus is felt less likely.
Decreased amount of free fluid within the peritoneal cavity.
Occluded infrarenal abdominal aorta with patent axillary [**Hospital1 **]-fem bypass graft.
3.2 cm calcified lesion within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/VIII of the liver - this is unchanged since [**2140**] and could be secondary to previous infection or trauma or calcification of a nonaggressive lesion.
[**2143-7-15**] 11:01 AM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76391**]   CHEST (PORTABLE AP) CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-9**], there is increasing prominence of interstitial markings consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
The tip is located 8 cm below the level of the carina and it is recommended to withdraw the line by 5 cm so to have optimal position in the mid portion of the SVC.
In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of [**2139-7-15**], no new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities identified.
No pneumothorax is seen.
[**2143-7-25**]   Radiology UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
LINE PLACEM CONCLUSION:  New left-sided PICC line is somewhere in the neck in left jugular vein.
IV nurse has been contact[**Name (NI) **] for the results.
Successful exchange of a left-sided PICC with tip in the distal SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with history of AAA s/p repair presenting with chest/abd pain x 2d with labs and imaging consistent with pancreatitis.
Active Diagnoses # Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient diagnosed with pancreatitis given classic pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase, and findings on CT c/w pancreatitis.
In terms of etiology, gallstone pancreatitis is most likely, given evidence of gallstones on MRCP and mild transaminitis, despite no evidence of ductal dilitation (likely stone passed).
Ischemic pancreatitis initially considered due to significant vascular history; however, improved with fluid resuscitatation.
No clear medication or viral cause.
BISAP initially 2 but elevated Hct and Cr raised concern for severe pancreatitis.
By [**2143-7-2**], he was tolerating a full diet and his pain had resolved.
On [**7-8**] he developed fever and CT scanning noted air with an area of pancreatic necrosis concerning for infection; he was started on meropenem/flagyl for infected necrotizing pancreatitis and continued for a full 14 day course.
On [**7-13**] he was noted with increasing LFTs and lipase; MRCP was performed which showed worsening pancreatic necrosis and edema as well as worsening hemorrhagic collections around the pancreas (at this time he was coagulopathic with an INR of ~6).
The edema was felt to be extrinsically compressing the ductal system causing biliary obstruction.
The drain initially had ~1L per day output which tapered off to ~100-200cc daily, suggesting (per GI) that his duodenal edema had resolved and the ampulla was no longer extrinsically compressed or obstructed.
His diet was advanced to full liquids and tolerated well; when attempting to advance to a bland solid diet, he experienced GI upset with some abdominal discomfort and a small elevation in his lipase, suggesting that he would require a prolonged course of gradual dietary advancement prior to being able to eat normally.
# Volume overload: due to volume resuscitation for severe pancreatitis, patient has developed extensive third spacing of fluid including ascites, pleural effusions (initially had O2 requirement, no longer) and extensive anasarca with pitting edema throughout.
He was placed on daily lasix 20mg IV for goal diuresis 1L net negative daily; IV was utilized throughout due to concern of bowel edema and poor PO absorption.
He should receive standing lasix IV daily with daily chemistry panels until his edema has improved.
# Peripheral vascular disease: noted with complicated history from AAA repair that clotted off requiring conversion to an axillobifemoral bypass graft that is high risk for clot.
He was on coumadin which was allowed to downtrend as he remained coagulopathic.
As above, when he was noted to have hemorrhagic conversion of his pancreatitis his INR was reversed with IV vitamin K and his anticoagulation was managed with a heparin drip up until the day of discharge.
Perhaps related to his history of MDS compounded by critical illness and marrow suppression.
# Elevated INR to 4.7: Possibly due to nutritional changes versus illness.
No recent antibiotics.
This was then turned off when he became coagulopathic again; he was finally reversed with IV vitamin K after hemorrhagic pancreatitis was noted on MRCP on [**7-13**].
# DM: at home on GlipiZIDE 5 mg PO QHS and GlipiZIDE 2.5 mg PO QAM.
Due to his worsening pancreatic function, he required escalating doses of insulin eventually stabilizing on 34u lantus daily with an aggresive sliding scale.
Chronic Diagnoses # HTN: at home, on home Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY and Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID.
# HL: at home, on Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY.
Transitional Issues # Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76393**] # [**Name2 (NI) 7092**]: Full (confirmed) - percutaneous cholecystostomy tube to remain in place and course dictated by pancreaticobiliary surgery - cholecystectomy at some point to be determined by surgery - ongoing heparin bridge to coumadin, goal INR [**1-25**] for bypass graft - ongoing gradual diet advancement with continuation of tube feeds till regular low fat diet is acheived without abdominal symptoms or LFT/lipase elevation - ongoing evaluation for insulin requirement - restarting home blood pressure medications when more medically stable and required - daily diuresis with IV lasix for goal of -1L net negative - pancreatic cyst noted on initial MRCP - will need repeat in 6 months.
Hold for loose stools.
