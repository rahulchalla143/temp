MRI [**10-17**]:Left cerebellar hemisphere lesion as described above demonstrating faint peripheral enhancement.
There are at least three additional enhancing lesions within the cerebral hemispheres.
These findings are most suggestive of metastatic disease.
CT [**10-20**]: Large mediastinal adenopathy with left perihilar mass and left adrenal nodule.
In this patient with known cerebellar masses, overall findings suggest lung cancer with left perihilar primary mass with mediastinal nodal involvement and metastasis to the left adrenal gland.
FNA of Subcarinal Mass: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   consistent with small cell carcinoma.
In light of the small cell histological pattern, the findings are most compatible with SMALL CELL CARCINOMA.
Brief Hospital Course: After being admitted she was brought to the OR for steriotactic biopsy and evacuation of the cystic cerebellar mass.
While here, she tolerated regular diet, her pain was well controlled, her foley was removed and she voided without difficulty.
