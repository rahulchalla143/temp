History of Present Illness: 51yo F with metastatc breast cancer presents with acute shortness of breath today after receiving a blood x-fusion at her oncologists office the day prior to admission.
Per her brother she has had a stuttering course of dyspnea over the past several weeks and the morning of admission she awoke with acute dyspnea lasting fifteen minutes which was somewhat responsive to her inhalers.
In the ED she was noted to be in resp distress with RR 34, O2sat 97% on 4L, 101.4, 160/90, HR 144.
A CXR showed a stable left pleural effusion and progression of a right pleural effusion.
She was intubated due to resp distress and given one dose of cefepime and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Of note she had a recent admission ([**Date range (1) 97780**]) for dyspnea which seemed to improve without major intervention - left thoracentecis revealed an exudative effusion with negative cytology.
Past Medical History: - breast cancer diagnosed in [**2179**](ER+ Her2neu-)followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] .Chest CT in [**2187-11-8**] showed pulmonary nodules and enlarged lymph nodes in chest and abdomen.
SHe also has left parietal brain mets s/p resection and XRT.
She also has widespread bony metastasis.
Small bilateral pulmonary nodule and brain mass now stable, CSF negative [**1-14**] - diabetes x10 years - hypercholesterolemia - cervical disc disease - psoriasis.

Imaging: [**2-20**] CXR: Stable left loculated effusion and progression of right pleural effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Increased metastatic disease within the chest with increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left), slightly increased infiltrative soft tissue in the right hilum encasing pulmonary vessels and segmental bronchi, slightly increased size of several pulmonary nodules, and opacity in the left lower lobe representing atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Unchanged widespread osseous metastatic lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: 51yo F with widely metastatic breast cancer with recent history of increasing shortness of breath admitted for dyspnea requiring intubation.
# Dyspnea: The initial DDx in the ICU included reactive airways as she sounded wheezy on exam, fluid overload given recent transfusion, TRALI, cardiac ischemia, progression of lymphangitic spread of pulmonary metastastases, thromboembolic disease given fairly acute onset of symptoms, and an atypical or community acquired pneumonia.
A chest CT was negative for a PE but did show progression of her metastatic disease and some areas of ground glass opacity.
A flu test was negative and a sputum sample showed only sparse oropharyngeal flora.
She was ruled out for MI with 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Sx were ultimately thought to be [**1-10**] RAD [**1-10**] a viral infection + perhaps a component of fluid overload + perhaps lymphangitic spread of known CA.
She was treated with inhalers for symptomatic wheezing.
# Metastatic breast CA: Her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] followed throughout her course.
Overall prognosis quite poor, there are likely few therapeutic modalities left.
# Diabetes: Her outpatient glipizide was continued but her avandia was held as this has a side effect of edema and congestive heart failure.
