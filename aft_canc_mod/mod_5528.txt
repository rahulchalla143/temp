was complaining of lower back pain and LUQ abd pain.
fell 3 days ago, that she has been increasingly confused over the past few days, that her speech has been "slightly slurred," and that she has had generalized weakness for several days.
was brought to an OSH, where head CT showed age-related atrophy but no infarcts.
CT abd performed and showed R renal artery embolus and diverticulosis with chronic-appearing intramural abscess.
CXR showed a hilar mass.
Vascular surgery recommended medical management of renal embolus due to new finding of hilar [**Hospital3 **] surgery recommended antibiotics and NPO status to manage diverticular abscess.
Denies fever or chills.
10 pound weight loss over past 6 months.
Denied headache, cough, chest pain.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: HTN Hypercholesterolemia Rheumatoid arthritis Vertebral fracture Multiple falls per pt., etiology unclear spont pneumothorax - [**2097**]   Social History: lives alone in [**Location (un) 4047**] with home health asst several times a week.
No EtOH, no illicits.
MMM, OP without lesions Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulm: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, + BS, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Ext: No clubbing cyanosis or edema.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
CXR [**9-6**]: Right hilar mass, with associated airspace opacity within the right upper lobe.
These findings are concerning for malignancy within the right hilum, and secondary post-obstructive pneumonia or consolidation.
Tubular filling defect measuring 1.2 cm in proximal right renal artery with hypoperfusion of right kidney, most likely representing right renal artery emboli.
Inflammatory changes in sigmoid colon with fat stranding, and 1.3 cm fluid collection versus small abscess.
Compression fracture of lower thoracic vertebra.
Right hilar mass noted on chest x-ray was not imaged on this abdominal CTA.
CAROTID U/S [**9-8**]: No plaque or wall thickening of either carotid artery.
Diffuse low velocity seen b/l suggesting low cardiac output.
A very large heterogeneous right hilar mass measuring 7 cm with multiple areas of central necrosis extending to the level of the thyroid with associated mediastinal adenopathy.
The mass extends into the SVC as well as the right mainstem bronchus with a short segment demonstrating 50% occlusion.
Multiple hypodensities in the liver, the largest representing a simple cyst, the smallest too small to characterize, but may also represent cysts.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There a moderate-sized (1.2 cm-thick) echogenic anterior space which most likely represents an epicardial fat pad, though a loculated, organized anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Likely small fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm which was seen on the prior CTA abdomen of [**2144-9-6**].
FNA, Right supraclavicular lymph node [**9-10**]:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
CT Head with Contrast [**9-12**]: Single focus of low density within the white matter of the right frontal lobe likely representing chronic microvascular infarct.
No evidence of enhancing lesions to suggest metastatic disease.
Worsening right upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia secondary to right hilar mass.
Bilateral pleural effusions .
RUQ US [**9-14**]: No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19961**] is a 74 year old female with a history of HTN, RA, hypercholesterolemia, who presents from OSH for work up of R renal artery embolus and sigmoid diverticulosis with intramural abscess, delirum and slurred speech, now with hypercalcemia and likely nephrogenic DI.
Right hilar mass - This was concerning for malignancy given history of tobacco and appearance on imaging.
The CT scan found a 7cm mass in the right lung which invades into the SVC and right mainstem bronchus.
The FNA preliminarily showed malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
A bone scan was to be performed to look for bony mets on day of discharge, but this was discontinued secondary to a change in the patient's treatment goals (see below).
On the last night of admission, the patient had an acute increased need for oxygen therapy (she was on room air prior).
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary effusions and a RUL infiltrate suggestive of post-obstructive pneumonia vs lobe collapse.
The patient remains afebrile but her WBC was elevated to 20K on discharge from 16K and 18K a fews days prior.
She was already receiving levofloxacin and metronidazole for the diverticular abscess, and she was given furosemide to help with the pleural effusions.
Hypercalcemia - The patient presented with delirium and slurred speech.
She was found to have hypercalcemia and hypernatremia which was thought to be a paraneoplastic syndrome.
Her PTHrp was found to be elevated at 8.6.
Her hypercalcemia was causatively linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Renal consult was placed and she was agressively treated with IVF, furosemide, calcitonin, and pamidronate to decrease her calcium levels.
Once they were within normal limits, her sodium levels dropped to normal range and she was no longer delirious.
Hypernatremia - secondary to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Diverticulitis with localized abscess - surgery consult was obtained and they recommened conservative treatment given her comorbidities.
Right renal emboli - Normal renal function on admission but large renal artery emboli noted.
At first this was thought to be likely due to cholesterol emboli per the renal team given h/o hypercholesterolemia and did not require anticoagulation.
At discharge it was unclear whether this thrombus is secondary to cholesterol emboli or to her hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
Leukocytosis - The patient's WBC was stable around 16K on levofloxacin and metronidazole for her diverticular abscess.
Work up showed no urinary tract infection (patient had foley cath in place for close monitoring of ins/outs for DI treatment) and a RUQ ultrasound showed no cholecystitis (patient had RUQ pain on exam on the day prior to discharge.
The chest x-ray the night prior to admission showed possible post-obstructive pneumonia which may account for her increased WBC.
Anemia - iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
No transfusion was required.
During admission, the patient complained of lower back pain and a lumbar spine x-ray showed only an old compression fracture of L1.
No new fractures.
A bone scan was to be performed to look for bony mets on day of discharge, but this was discontinued secondary to a change in the patient's treatment goals.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Lung cancer- cytology consistent with NSCLC Hypercalcemia causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Right renal artery embolus Intramural sigmoid abscess .
Secondary diagnosis: Anemia Rheumatoid arthritis   Discharge Condition: stable, on 5L oxygen via nasal canual   Discharge Instructions: You have been diagnosed with lung cancer and are being discharged to a hospice facility to make you comfortable.
You have been prescribed antibiotics for a pneumonia.
You have also been given morphine and lorazepam to help with the back pain and shortness of breath.
