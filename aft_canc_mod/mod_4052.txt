History of Present Illness: Reason for MICU transfer:  monitor for airway obstruction  History of Present Illness: 69 year old female with history of HTN, Hep B, pulmonary sarcoid, and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer to the supraclavicaular lymph nodes, now s/p bilateral modified radical neck dissection (in which they removed lymph nodes and the L IJ) on [**7-23**], now POD2.
She has had continued oozing from superficial b/l wound sites on neck since the surgery.
Repeat afternoon scope showed worsening edema b/l with significant epiglottic, AE fold, and post-cricoid edema with epiglottic ecchymosis.
Heme was consulted for concern that edema and oozing were [**2-19**] coagluopathy.
A CT neck was done to r/o fluid collection.
Per wet read, CT scan showed laryngeal edema but no fluid collection.
A subsuquent scope was planned for 9 pm to follow up edema and assess for need for possible elective intubation.
Past Medical History: Metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid: Diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in [**2095**], when she was found to have a thyroid nodule.
In [**2111**], she was found to have enlarged L neck lymph nodes that was attributed to a local recurrence and underwent completion right thyroidectomy, followed by radioactive iodine treatment.
In [**2114-8-19**], she developed new lymphadenopathy in the thyroid bed and received additional radioactive iodine treatment.
In [**2117**], she was again found to have multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the thyroidectomy bed and a biopsy-proven metastasis in a left supraclavicular node.
In [**2119-3-19**], she had an ultrasound that revealed interval enlargement of the metastasis along the left cervical chain and a stable left supraclavicular node.
In [**2119-5-19**], she had a left neck dissection with an excision of 27 lymph nodes with one being positive for metastatic papillary  carcinoma of the thyroid.
One left cervical lymph node that  contained thyroid carcinoma on biopsy was unable to be removed  due to its proximity to the carotid artery and jugular vein.
More recently, she has had further enlargement of the left neck lymphadenopathy and left paratracheal mass.
CT of the neck with contrast on [**2121-10-14**], revealed a 2.9 x 2.5 x 2.8 cm paratracheal mass at the site of the thyroid gland, which was in close contact with the vertebral artery posteriorly and the left common carotid artery anteromedially.
There were also multiple enlarged lymph nodes in levels 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3 in the supraclavicular region on the left side, the largest measuring 2 x 1.6 cm at the level 1B on the left.
There are also enlarged lymph nodes in level 2A on the right.
- Hepatitis B - Heart murmur - Hypertension - Pulmonary Sarcoid   Social History: She is originally from the [**Country 31115**] and immigrated to the US in [**2086**].
Family History: Her brother had thyroid carcinoma and died at age 49.
No family history of bleeding disroders.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI Neck: b/l neck incision with clean dressings, wound is clean, no current oozing CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-distended, no organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, trace pedal edema which the patient states is her baseline Neuro: grossly intact   Pertinent Results: [**2122-7-26**] 04:04AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-3.38* Hgb-10.9* Hct-32.2* MCV-95 MCH-32.2* MCHC-33.7 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-136*  Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  69 year-old with PMH of HTN, Hepatitis B, pulmonary sarcoid, and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer to the supraclavicaular lymph nodes, now s/p bilateral modified radical neck dissection POD2.
She has been oozing from the surgical site b/l for the last 2 days, and developed laryngeal edema seen on scope that worsened during the day, prompting transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close airway monitoring.
ACUTE ISSUES: -------------  # Laryngeal edema: During her admission the patient was monitored closely for signs of airway obstruction or labored breathing labored breathing.
Her laryngeal edema continued to improve on steroids until the date of discharge ([**2122-7-28**]).
# Metastatic papillary thyroid cancer: The patient was continued on her home dose of levothyroxine and will follow up with ENT regarding treatment of her cancer.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ------------------- Will need follow-up with ENT regarding treatment of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer.
