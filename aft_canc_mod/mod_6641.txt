She presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2155-9-3**] with worsening mid to upper back pain and inability to walk.
She awoke at 3:30 AM prior to admission with upper back pain that prevented her from standing.
She had no numbness, bowl or bladder sx, tingling, weakness, or shooting pain.
She had CT torso showing bilateral pulmonary emboli and right-hilar and lower-lobe infiltrate mass, consistent with bronchogenic carcinoma with mets to back and liver.
She had back pain that was concerning and weakness that was concerning for cord compression vs. limitation from pain.
She had spine MRI that showed multiple small foci of enhancement in the brain and spine mets with cord edema.
She had Q1H neuro exams with no focal deficits.
She remained hemodynamically stable w/r/t her PE with a sat of 100% on RA and no right heart strain on EKG.
Currently she notes minimal ([**2156-1-31**]) back pain located on the left in the mid-thoracic region without radiation or pleuritic component.
She notes nausea with pain medications.
Past Medical History: Herniated Disk Back surgery in [**Country 4194**] Left clavicular fracture repair Left eye glaucoma, remote history Herpes opthhalmicus on acyclovir  Oncology History: Found to have a pulmonary nodule in [**3-9**] in [**Country 4194**], with no follow up.
She was then seen at [**Hospital1 3793**] in [**2155-7-22**] for left clavicular pain after hitting a table and breaking her clavicle.

Complete collapse of vertebral body of T6, likely pathologic fracture, with metastatic involvement of the right pedicle at this level.
Metastatic involvement of vertebral body of L1, lower left portion, with involvement of the left pedicle.
Lucent lesion in the right iliac bone, with cortical destruction and extension in the soft tissue.
Right hilar mass, with associated atelectasis, in keeping with diagnosis of known lung cancer.
Atelectasis at the left lung.
Prominent lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilum.
Prominence of the adrenal glands bilaterally, likely metastatic involvement.
Lesion in the liver, likely metastatic deposit.
Final Attending Comment: In addition to above there is likely epidural tumor at T6 indenting the cord which would be better assessed by MRI.There is epidural soft tissue at L1 also which could represent prominent vein versus epidural tumor.
Extensive mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy with right lower lobe lung mass as described above.
There is encasement of the right lower lobe superior segment, causing worsening atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
Metastatic deposit within the liver, left adrenal gland and osseous structures as described above.
Small pulmonary embolus in right middle lobe pulmonary artery and thrombus in situ in IVC filter.

Squamous cell carcinoma of lung metastatic to brain/spine/bones/liver/adrenals: Diagnosis made from tissue obtained by bronchoscopy on [**9-5**].
Pathology results showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Orthopedic oncology was consulted for left femoral head tumor and they did not recommend any surgical intervention at this time given that patient was ambulatory and pain free in her leg.
Pt given fentanyl patch for pain control and prn narcotics along with a robust bowel regimen.
