Per family, he had started having chest pain/rib pain and fever with cough a number of days prior.
On the day of admission to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital he complained of difficulty breathing and talking, a severe headache with dizziness, hemoptysis and some swelling and erythema in his right arm.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], he reportly told ED physician there that he had gotten hurt in a Bar fight or a dirt bike accident.
Bedside echo was done without any epicardial effusion/cardiac abnormality.
aspiration/pneumonia/pulmonary contusion), no rib fracture, no acute intraabdominal traumatic injury, HSM with diffused hepatic steatosis, no fracture/subluxation of spine; CT C-spine - wnl.
He was placed on versed and fentanyl but due to agitation he was switched to propafol, which cause him to become hypotensive and requiring levophed and neo.
Bedside echo- no effusion, good movement, no obvious vegetations.

Outside Hospital blood cultures [**2147-7-30**] ([**Hospital 24356**] hospital): Group C strep and Fusobacterium.
Hazy diffuse opacity of the left hemithorax, could be due to aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
More focal opacity in the left lung base may be atelectasis or aspiration.
Heart is of normal size without pericardial effusions.

............... CT chest [**2147-7-31**]: Extensive bilateral multifocal pneumonia with multiple areas of consolidation, air bronchograms as well as ground-glass like bilateral nodule-like opacities.
No evidence of larger pleural fluid collections, notably no evidence of empyema.
Small loculated left lower pleural fluid collection with slight interval increase in size since [**2147-8-1**] suggesting empyema or complex exudative effusions.
Marked interval improvement in bilateral lower lobe consolidations consistent with improving pneumonia.
Multifocal upper lobe ground-glass opacities are unchanged since previous imaging and likely due to residual foci of infection.
0.7-cm hyperechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver, likely a hemangioma but a small non-liquefied abscess cannot be excluded.
Small pericardial effusion.
Left distal lower forearm sub-cm subcutaneous nodule, could represent a small phlegmon or a small fluid collection.

The cerebellar tonsils terminate approximately 7 mm below the foramen magnum, consistent with a Chiari I malformation.
No evidence of a syrinx.
Mildly narrow cervical spinal canal due to short pedicles.
..............      Brief Hospital Course: 24yo male with history of anxiety and anabolic steroid injections who was transferred from [**Hospital 24356**] Hospital with sepsis and septic shock  and had a 7 day MICU course with subsequent management on the internal medicine floor.
# Septic shock: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was originally air-transferred to our institution from [**Hospital 24356**] hospital where he presented with high fever, low blood pressures and AMS.
He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**8-6**] and was HD stable, well saturated on room air and afebrile through-out his course on the floor.
# polymicrobial bacteremia: Blood cultures at [**Hospital 24356**] Hospital grew group C strep (Strep milleri) and Fusobacterium.
As for possible sources/foci of infection, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a LLL pneumonia with growth of group C strep from sputum; He had 2 small RUE abscesses with rare culture growth of coag negative staphylococci from drained content; He also had pus draining from his ear with growth of pan sensitive CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX and coagulase negative staphylococci.
It is difficult to say which one of these foci if any was the original focus of infection and which resulted from hematogenous spread but a primary RUE cellulitis which later caused bacteremia, sepsis and seeding of lung and ear is not unlikely though the patient denied any history of IVDU.
A TTE was obtained with clear visualization of the cardiac valves which showed no evidence of endocardial vegetations and repeated blood cultures were, as already mentioned, negative.
# pneumonia and left pleural fluid collection: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with bilateral lower lobe consolidations and diffuse bil opacities which improved on follow up imagings with a residual LLL infiltrate and resolution of previous diffuse opacities on his last pre-discharge CXR.
Repeated Chest CTs also demonstrated a small loculated left lower pleural collection which was initially suspected to represent empyema or a complex exudative effusion.
Interventional Pulmonology and Cardio-Thoracic Surgery consults were obtained, the collection was deemed too small for percutaneous drainage and, in-light of the patient's clinical improvement and stable condition, a conservative approach was advocated with continued Abx treatment and follow-up CT 2 weeks post discharge.
# Ear infection - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had drainage of Pus from his ear which resolved with systemic antibiotics.
Cultures were positive for CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX and coagulase negative staphylococci.
Later otoscopic exams revealed bilateral Otitis Media W/ Effusion which was attributed to his intubation and supine posture.
No clinical signs of mastoiditis were observed and CT scan of the head and temporal bones was negative for mastoiditis/bone destruction.
# RUE abscesses: 2 small abscesses in RUE were identified on clinical examination and corroborated by RUE US, one of these was incised and drained pussy content with many WBC but no bacteria per gram stain and rare growth of coag negative staphylococci in culture; The tract was left open for secondary healing which proceeded without complication.
#Transaminitis and elevated INR:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had mild elevations of AST, ALT, ALKP and INR during his hospital course.
RUQ U/S was normal except for a 0.7-cm hyperechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver which was consistent with a hemangioma.
This study was revised a number of times with radiology and a differential diagnosis of liver abscess was thought very unlikely for this finding.
Liver functions trended down on subsequent follow-up and the transient elevation was thought to be most likely drug induced or a reflection of mild shock liver.
Serology for viral hepatitis was negative.
Liver functions and INR will continue to be followed in the out patient setting until complete normalization.
#acute renal failure - Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented with Creatinin and BUN levels of 3.2 and 91 respectively.
This picture was consistent with acute pre-renal failure secondary to septic shock and hypovolemia.
#anemia and thrombocytopenia - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a hematocrit drop to a minimum of 28.7 and a drop in platelet count to a nadir of 72,000.
This was most likely attributable to BM suppression in the setting of septic shock.
His stool guaiacs were negative and he had no signs or symptoms of bleeding or hemolysis.
#anxiety - Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of generalized anxiety disorder as well as medical narcotics abuse and tobacco smoking.
Prior to his hospitalization he was treated with Xanax and clonidine for his anxiety and Suboxone for narcotic dependence.
He had a high sedative requirement in the ICU and upon transfer to the floor had initially complained of anxiety which he said was only mildly worse than not his base-line state of anxiety.
His anxiety was attributed to his known anxiety condition with a possible additional contribution of narcotic withdrawal as his suboxone was not continued during his hospital course.
Valium was gradually weaned with no apparent worsening of his anxiety.
Clonidine was not renewed due to his recent history of hypotension and borderline blood pressures.
He will continue out patient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87441**] for treatment of his anxiety and substance dependence.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Home Solutions  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic shock Pneumonia Right Upper Extremity abscesses   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were airlifted to our institution in a state of "septic shock" which happens when germs enter your blood-stream causing a severe reaction including high fever and low blood pressure.
A tube was placed in your airway and you were connected to a breathing machine because the infection involved your lungs and was preventing you from breathing effectively.
Besides the infection in your lungs you were also found to have two pockets of infection in your right forearm, pus draining from an infection in your ear, and another pocket of infection near your left lung.
Although you have been feeling much better and will continue to improve this prolonged treatment course is neccessary to get rid of all the pockets of infection and prevent its reccurrence.
You will need to have another chest CT and be followed by our chest surgeons inorder to make sure that the pocket of infection near your left lung resolves.
