Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**], You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
During the replacement of your tracheostomy, the procedure was complicated by a pneumothorax (left lung collapse) and you had a chest tube placed.
No other changes were made to your medication regimen.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pain, worsening cough or sputum production, blood from around your trach site or any other concerning symptoms.
