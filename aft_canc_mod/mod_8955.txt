His PCP referred him to a hematologist who sent him for a CXR because he had a chronic, dry cough.
The CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrate, but he had a chest CT to characterize it further.
His pulmonologist noted peripheral eosinophilia and started him on a course of prednisone 80mg PO daily x 3 days with a 20mg taper every 3 days which ended about a week ago.
The prednisone improved his breathing and dry cough somewhat.
Repeat CBC approximately one week prior to admission showed WBC of 22K with immature cells in the periphery.
He underwent a BMBx and afterwards complained of right leg pain and swelling.
His BMBx and peripheral flow cytometry returned which was consistent with APML.
On arrival, he states that he has had fatigue, anorexia, insomnia, and 25 lb weight loss for the past 1-2 months.
He also has a mild global HA and RLE swelling and soreness but no other acute concerns.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68M with a h/o HTN who was admittedon  [**3-18**] to the BMT service with newly diagnosed AML and DVT/PE on heparin.
He was transferred to the CCU after patient developed an acute STEMI; cath demonstrated an acute thrombous in the LAD and he underwent PTCA and thrombectomy; no stents were deployed.
His CCU course was notable for tachycardia, volume overload (requiring IV lasix prn), several fevers with an episode of hypotension prompting the initiation of Abx in the setting of neutropenia, and initiation of chemo with etoposide and cytarabine for his AML.
He was later admitted to the MICU because of hypotension and tachypnea in the setting of diuresis.
His course was c/b ARDS and hypoxic respiratory failure, renal failure and volume overload requiring CVVH, and pericardial tamponade.
His respiratory status waxed and waned but then progressively declined; he also had a persistent pressor requirement to maintain his pressures while on CVVH.
#s/p STEMI: On BMT floor on day after admission, pt developed an acute STEMI.
In the cath lab he was found to have an acute thrombous in the LAD and underwent PTCA and thrombectomy; no stents were deployed.
A small pericardial effusion seen on [**3-26**] TTE; no tamponade or physiologic changes; thought by cards to be clinically insignificant.
He had tachycardia to 120-130s for several days in the CCU, but after call-out had a HR in the 80-90s.
#Pericardial tamponade: The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2104-4-24**] in the setting of decreased blood pressures and echocardiographic evidence of pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Drain put out 150mL bloody fluid overnight and then stopped draining the morning after it was placed.
Repeat echo on [**4-25**] AM showed very small pericardial effusion.
Pt tolerated procedure well with no complications.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multifocal PNA/ARDS.
Mini- BAL from [**4-19**] showed Pseudomonas fluorescens resistant to cefepime, sensitive to zosyn, intermediate to meropenem.
CT chest [**4-16**] showed worsening of bilateral diffuse opacifications compared to prior, possibly due to further volume overload.
# Hypotension, persistent pressor requirement:  likely related to prolonged shock/sepsis.
Although CVVH was able to remove volume occasionally, volume removal was limited due to tenuous BP's.
# Apical hypokinesis and PAF: He was s/p DCCV x3 on [**4-9**] for atrial tachyarrhythmia.
