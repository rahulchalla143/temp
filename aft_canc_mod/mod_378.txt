Findings are concerning for obstructed stent.
Echogenic material within the bile ducts is of unclear etiology.
Hepatic metastasis (as in the provided clinical history) not visualized.
[**2116-6-24**] CXR:  Allowing for the AP projection, the heart is mildly enlarged.
There is added density in the right paratracheal stripe with mild shift of the trachea to the left, most likely representing retrosternal extension of the thyroid gland.
There are calcifications present in the aortic arch.
There are degenerative changes present at the right acromioclavicular joint with apparent inferior subluxation of the lateral end of the clavicle.
This most likely is chronic longstanding.
[**2116-6-24**] ERCP Impression: A metal stent was found in the upper third of the common bile duct A balloon sweep was performed without stone, sludge or debris Given presentation, decision made to place CBD stent Previous intervention in the major papilla  Five images are submitted for evaluation.
The patient has a metal endoprosthesis.
No opacification of the left hepatic duct was observed.
[**2116-6-26**] CXR: There is a left ventricular configuration.
There ishazy opacity at the right base consistent with atelectasis, possibly slightly improved compared with one day earlier.
There is minimal atelectasis at theleft base.
No focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
Poorly visualized in the upper abdomen are stents and other iatrogenic structures.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Stent in place with persistent intrahepatic biliary dilatation involving both lobes of the liver.
No definite neoplasm seen.
As on CT, thin enhancing tissue at the level of the obstructed ducts and the stent could be reactive inflammation, fibrous tissue, or neoplasm such as cholangiocarcinoma.
Multilobulated cystic lesion measuring approximately 9.4mm AP x 23mm transverse x 36mm CC.
Differential considerations include necrotic lymph node (though the marked fluid signal intensity argues against this) or primary neoplasm such as a neurogenic or neuroendocrine tumor.
Subcarinal lymph node: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchial cells and lymphocytes, suggestive of lymph node sampling.
Paratracheal Mass: NON-DIAGNOSTIC due to insufficient tissue sampling.
Bronchial washings neg for malignant cells.
FLOW CYTOLOGY: INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen on a limited panel.
PARATRACHEAL PATHOLOGY: GROSS Sample results pending.
Cholangitis: patient with fever, chills, and biliary obstruction (cause of obstruction unclear).
No positive blood cultures.
LFTs trended down after ERCP, though imaging demonstrated that intrahepatic biliary obstruction remained.
Both CT and MRCP done of abdomen to elucidate cause of biliary obstruction without definitive result.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: given her history of breast cancer (asymmetrically prominent internal mammary LN on side of mastectomy) and bilateral thyroid nodules, the patient underwent IP/Bronchoscopy and lymph node biopsy.
Preliminary biopsy results available at discharge:  Subcarinal lymph node: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchial cells and lymphocytes, suggestive of lymph node sampling.
Anemia: had an acute hematocrit drop to 19 during the hospitalization, requiring blood transfusions.
She has a history of PUD as well as known bleeding colonic mass.
She has a history of demand ischemia/NSTEMI in the setting of acute blood loss.
Magnesium oxide 400mg daily  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Ascending Cholangitis secondary to Biliary obstruction  Secondary diagnosis: # Metastatic colon cancer (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma) primary biopsy at 65 cm via colonoscopy, diagnosed [**2116-2-21**] (could not locate documentation of metastases from MRs).
#  Anemia #  GI bleed, upper and lower suspected #  History of breast cancer s/p mastectomy.
#  History of lower extremity DVT, S/P IVC filter in [**2-/2116**] #  Hypertension #  Hyperlipidemia #  Coronary Artery Diseast, history of NSTEMI #  Common bile duct obstruction x3, s/p stent x3 #  Cholycystectomy   Discharge Condition: GOOD   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with fever, chills, abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting.
You were found to have obstruction of your bile duct stent and underwent a procedure to remove the old stent and place a new one.
You were also treated with antibiotics for fevers and chills due to a suspected infection.
While in the hospital you were noted to have a low blood cell count.
Because a bleed from you abdomen was suspected, you were given red blood cells and your aspirin was stopped to prevent further bleeding.
It is possible that the source of this blood loss is your colon cancer.
Should you experience any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, lightheadedness, chest pressure or pain, shortness of breath, note any black tarry or bloody stools, or any other symptom concerning to you, please call your primary care provider or go to the nearest emergency room.
