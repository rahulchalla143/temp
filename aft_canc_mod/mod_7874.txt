Pt was in USOH until ~ 2 months ago, he presented w/ weakness, incoordination and inability to walk.
He was hypotensive despite 6L of fluids and levophed was started.
Pt had chronic cough, worsening x 1 week, nonproductive.
He also c/o RUQ pain, no N/V/or fevers at home.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric Neck: no LAD Heart: RRR, S1, S2, no m/r/g LUngs: coarse BS b/l, R coarse crackles diffusely, some transmitted upper resp sounds Abd: +BS/S/RUQ w/ palpation, min distended, no masses; mult hemangiomas Ext: no edema Neuro: CN II-XII intact; motor 4+/5 b/l UE/LE (mild R motor weakness c/w L, stable)   Pertinent Results: [**2126-10-20**] 10:15AM   WBC-13.0* RBC-3.58* HGB-11.2* HCT-32.9* MCV-92 MCH-31.1 MCHC-33.9 RDW-15.3 [**2126-10-20**] 10:15AM   NEUTS-87.8* LYMPHS-6.8* MONOS-4.9 EOS-0.2 BASOS-0.3 [**2126-10-20**] 10:15AM   GLUCOSE-143* UREA N-65* CREAT-2.9*# SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-6.7* CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-18CT BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST: Within the left posterior frontal lobe near the vertex, there is an area of hypodensity just deep to the patient's craniotomy, consistent with post-operative changes status-post resection of the previously identified posterior frontal lobe mass.
The region of hypodensity corresponds to the region of increased T2 signal noted at the time of prior MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white differentiation is otherwise preserved, without evidence of acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION: Hypodensity within the left posterior frontal lobe, just deep to the patient's craniotomy, consistent with post-operative changes following resection of left posterior frontal metastatic focus.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect identified.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient is in gross pulmonary edema with increased opacification of the right base most likely representing pleural fluid.
No pneumothorax.
Positive study for pulmonary embolism in a right middle and right upper lobe artery [**Last Name (un) 94110**].
Interval increase of bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left).
The right pleural effusion appears to be slightly loculated.
Diffuse interstitial lung ground glass opacities sparing the right apex that could represent pulmonary edema, hemorrhage or drug reaction.
Brief Hospital Course: 70M w/hx lung CA, mets renal CA (to brain and lungs) s/p recent resection ago p/w Klebesilla septic shock, PNA, UTI, ARF and worsening weakness and ataxia.
# Septic shock/Urosepsis ?????
?He presented with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea w/ elevated wbc and hypoxia requiring intubation and pressor support.
He was found to have pansensitive klebsiella sepsis.
# Hypoxia: [**12-24**] pulmonary edema, pleural effusion (too small to tap per IP on [**10-25**]), PE, Vent associated PNA .
# ARF: no hydronephrosis on US; was likely pre-renal, now resolved  # Renal CA: He has widespread metastis and this is terminal.
# Anemia/ GI bleed- likely [**12-24**] chronic dz, The patient had one episode of coffee ground emesis in the setting of heparin gtt.
Hi HCT was stable after this until [**10-29**]  when he had a 11 point HCT drop.
He likely has a GI bleed or is bleeding into his abdominal mass.
the paitnet understands that he may not have long to live given possible GI bleed abd oregression of his CA.
