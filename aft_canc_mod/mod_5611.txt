Admission Date:  [**2112-2-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-2-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2033-2-26**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CV MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female, with a past medical history significant for metastatic breast carcinoma with stable metastases to the lung, as demonstrated on a CT scan in [**11/2111**], who presents with a 1-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
She also states that she has shortness of breath at rest, and reports mild chest pressure with exertion and at rest.
She also reports bilateral lower extremity edema increasing over the last 1 month.
For work-up of this, her primary care provider had the patient undergo a cardiac stress test on [**2112-2-2**] which was negative for reversible perfusion defects.
However, the patient did experience atrial fibrillation at that time.
She also did have an echocardiogram done on [**2112-2-4**], which showed a moderate pericardial effusion which had increased slightly since her previous echo.
The patient denied any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or syncope.
She denies fevers and cough.
New atrial fibrillation.
Pericardial effusion status post echo [**2112-2-4**], which showed moderate pericardial effusion, no tamponade physiology, ejection fraction of 60%, mild MR, moderate TR.
History of metastatic breast cancer, status post CT in [**2111-11-23**] which showed stable lung metastases, and at that time stable pericardial effusion.
Status post Persantine-MIBI [**2112-2-2**], which showed no reversible perfusion defects.
Chronic renal insufficiency, status post nephrectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol.
The patient does have stressors at home, including her husband who has bipolar disease longstanding.
CHEST:  She had bilateral crackles, left greater than right.
CARDIAC EXAM:  She was irregularly irregular with a II/VI harsh systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Of note, she had no pulses paradoxus on exam.
Chest x-ray showed right heart border was obscured with possible infiltrate.
EKG was irregular with poor R wave progression, which was new.
She went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where under fluoro guidance she had a pericardiocentesis and drain placement, and 450 cc of straw-colored fluid was removed.
Ventricular wall thickness and cavity size were also normal.
She also had mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and she showed only a small pericardial effusion.
No tamponade.
A total of approximately 460 cc of pericardial fluid was collected in the drain post her pericardiocentesis for a total of approximately 900 cc of straw-colored fluid removed.
There, she did have atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin therapy was not started secondary to her known metastatic disease.
The patient did not spike any further fevers after that initial temperature of 101.
The patient also had increasing oxygen requirement during the end of her hospital stay.
It was believed this was secondary to pneumonia, but more importantly signs of congestive heart failure.
She had serial x-rays which showed worsening pulmonary congestion.
The CCU team also felt that her hypoxia could be attributable to either obstructive sleep apnea, or hypoxia secondary to obesity, considering that a number of her oxygen desaturations occurred at night.
The patient was continued on her Vitamin B12 for her anemia, and for her atrial fibrillation no Coumadin was started, again because of her known metastatic disease.
Pericardial effusion, status post pericardiocentesis and drain placement.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Metastatic breast cancer.
Arimidex 1 mg po qd as treatment for breast cancer.
