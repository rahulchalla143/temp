Patient denies orthopnea and states he only gets short of breath with activity, which is also limited by his lack of strength.
The patient was also recently admitted from [**2142-11-28**] to [**2142-12-26**] for resistant HSV c/b CHF exacerbation.
In [**11-19**] showed EF 20% and moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.
He had appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] today and Echo was done showing large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: CLL, diagnosed in [**2137**] Treated with fludarabine then relapsed allo-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**] from his brother in [**2-16**] c/b grade I skin and hepatic GVHD, and febrile neutropenia.
-s/p inguinal hernia repair -Cardiomyopathy: Moderate pericardial effusion and markedly reduced EF (20%) noted on echo in [**9-19**], presumed viral vs. chemotherapy induced.
No tobacco or etoh   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T 97.3  HR 115 bp 106/79  RR 24 100% 2L n.c. pulsus 4 Gen: AOx3, lying flat, NAD HEENT: Mucous membranes slightly dry CV: S1, S2 (+) S3, S4, tachycardic, no murmurs appreciated Pulm: CTA-anteriorly Abd: (+) BS, soft, ND/NT right groin: dsg c/d/i, no hematoma or bruit Ext: WWP, 2+ DP pulses b/l  Pertinent Results: EKG: Sinus tachy 120, Nl axis, nl intervals, non-specific T wave flattening in I, aVL, II, III, aVF, TWIs V5.
Large circumferential pericardial effusion, measuring 1.3 cm in diastole in front of the right ventricle, and 2.4 cm in front of the right atrium.
Brief invagination of the right atrium in late diastole, and of right ventricle, though no sustained chamber collapse.
1.There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is a large right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Images of the abdomen demonstrate a dense liver likely secondary to blood transfusions and iron deposition.
There is no biliary dilatation.
Low density is present in the left lobe of the liver which was not seen previously but has a nonspecific appearance on this non-contrast study.
There is mild splenomegaly again noted.
There is poor visualization of the pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys.
There are no dilated bowel loops.
There is no hyperdense fluid in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space.
Dense lymph nodes are present in the porta hepatis and in the paraaortic regions which were seen on the CT from [**2141-8-15**].
CT PELVIS FINDINGS: There is a small focus of gas in the urinary bladder.
Surgical clips are present in the anterior lower pelvic wall, suggestive of prior hernia repair.
There is mild atherosclerosis.
Bone windows demonstrate a mottled appearance of the ilia and proximal femora is seen bilaterally and is unchanged.
No peritoneal or retroperitoneal bleed as clinically questioned.
Large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
Hematocrit trend: [**1-2**] Hct 31.3 [**1-3**] Hct 23.2 [**1-3**] Hct 26.3 [**1-4**] Hct 22.7 [**1-4**] Hct 23.5 [**1-5**] Hct 25.2 [**1-5**] Hct 36.8  Brief Hospital Course: 49 year old male with CLL with cardiomyopathy, EF 10-15% and pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade s/p pericardial drain.
There was an initial concern of septic shock given his immunosuppression and he was started on stress dose steroids as well as Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Patient likely had decreasing hematocrit because he is transfusion dependent at baseline requiring [**12-17**] transfusion/week also in setting of positive fluid balance by 1-2 liters/day as he was dehydrated on admission.
Echo checked post-procedure and no evidence of reaccumulation of effusion.
Patient never had a pulsus during admission.
Patient appeared hypovolemic on admission based on low pericardial and RA pressures.
Goal to keep i's and o's even to slightly positive on admission.
Lasix dose had recently been increased to 60 mg po qday, and patient was dehydrated on admission as evidenced by swan ganz readings in catheterization lab during pericardial drain placement.
Ischemia: no evidence of ischemia.
Voriconazole for resistant oral [**Female First Name (un) **] and aspergillosis seen on BAL in the past.
Started on Vanco and Cefepime when sbp dropped and temp 99F but these were d/c'ed after 2 days when no infectious source found and all cultures without growth.
Discharge Diagnosis: pericardial effusion cardiomyopathy, EF 10-15% chronic lymphocytic leukemia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or other concerning symptoms.
