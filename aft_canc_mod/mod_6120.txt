CT Head [**2126-10-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No significant change in bifrontal vasogenic edema since [**10-7**], [**2126**].
Please note, CT is not as sensitive as MRI in the detection of intracranial lesions or metastasis.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is suggested for possible in part chronic pulmonary disease and possible ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Extensive bilateral acute pulmonary embolism as described above.
No evidence of right heart strain.
Redemonstration of left lower lobe lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Echo [**2126-10-22**]:  Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
CXR [**2126-10-22**]: Since yesterday, mild bibasal atelectasis slightly increased.
Left perihilar mass is unchanged.
There is no new area of consolidation and no pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion.
CXR [**2126-10-23**]: No significant interval change was demonstrated.
The bilateral hilar enlargement might represent pulmonary hypertension due to massive pulmonary embolism.
The known superior segment left lower lobe large neoplastic mass is demonstrated abating the left hilus, unchanged.
CXR [**10-24**]: There is slight interval worsening in right upper lobe opacities which might represent developing pneumonia given its absence on [**2126-10-22**].
No change in the known left mass and hilar lymphadenopathy is present.
Small amount of left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
CXR [**10-26**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung mass is unchanged.
The pre-existing right upper lobe opacity is increasing in density.
Minimal increase in density is also observed in the right pericardiac parts of the lung.
CXR [**10-30**]: Previous large right upper lobe pneumonia is slightly improved since [**10-26**].
Large left hilar mass unchanged.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion developed between [**10-22**] and 27, subsequently stable.
Interval decrease in heart size, now normal, could reflect resolving pericardial effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 11923**] is a 68 year old with metastatic NSCLC with brain mets presenting with palpitations and feeling unwell x 2 days, found to have a saddle PE.
# Pulmonary Embolism: Patient found to have PE on CTA in setting of palpitations, some findings consistent with right ventricular strain on EKG and physical exam.
Echo showed RV cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.Cardiac enzymes also elevated likely secondary to RV strain and PE.
She continued to have wheezes on exam and tachypnea at baseline but improved slowly during her admission.
She was kept on telemetry and remained tachycardic at baseline, however her blood pressure remained stable.
# Bandemia: On decadron for brain mets as well as vertebral mets.
Given her progressive stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (has gotten brain irradiation with plans for cyber knife treatment)it is likely the PE is due to underlying malignancy.
