Past Medical History: back pain, L5-S1 MD, L4-5 HNP, musculoskeletal disease, thoracotomy for pneumothorax bilaterally, Hep C, right keratitis, GI upset, R epididymo-orchitis   Social History: tobacco use 1ppd for > 20 years, IV drug use-recent detox, h/o incarceration.
HEENT: Pupils: 3-1.5 EOMs intact, fundoscopic exam suspicious for papilledema.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
On Discharge: A&Ox3 PERRL EOMs intact Face symmetrical tongue midline Motor: full Incision: c/d/i with sutures in place No pronator drift  Pertinent Results: CT from OSH with hydrocephalus, tonsilar herniation and possible mass.
Cerebellar edema with effacement of the fourth ventricle due to a cerebellar mass, better evaluated on subsequent MRI Head, likely a metastasis given the lung mass on concurrent CT torso.
7.6 x 7.3 x 6 cm soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe of the lung concerning for lung cancer 2.
7 mm right lower lobe nodule and a 6.5 mm right middle lobe nodule are indeterminate, but may represent metastases 3.
Small loculated right pleural effusion adjacent to the large mass.
Severe emphysematous changes with bullous formation in the lungs bilaterally.
5 mm lytic foci in the left ilium which, raise the possibility of metastatic disease and could be further evaluated with a bone scan.
Wedge deformity of T12 vertebra of indeterminate age; however, degenerative changes in that area indicate that this is likely chronic due to prior trauma.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-8-5**] 9:38 PM IMPRESSION:  Isolated posterior fossa mass with significant surrounding edema consistent with a metastatic lesion.
Mass causes compression upon the fourth ventricle and subsequent acute hydrocephalus of the third and lateral ventricles.
Continued cerebellar swelling with posterior fossa mass effect, but substantially reduced in severity since [**2117-8-5**].
Post-surgical findings as above, with small foci of enhancement along the resection margin that are likely vascular in etiology 2.
Brain MRI with and without contrast which was consistent with Isolated posterior fossa mass with significant surrounding edema consistent with a metastatic lesion.
Mass causes compression upon the fourth ventricle and subsequent acute hydrocephalus of the third and lateral ventricles per the radiology final impression.
7.6 x 7.3 x 6 cm soft tissue mass in the right lower lobe of the lung concerning for lung cancer2.
7 mm right lower lobe nodule and a 6.5 mm right middle lobe nodule are indeterminate, but may represent metastases 3.
Small loculated right pleural effusion adjacent to the large mass.
Severe emphysematous changes with bullous formation in the lungs bilaterally.
5 mm lytic foci in the left ilium which, raise the possibility of metastatic disease and could be further evaluated with a bone scan.
Wedge deformity of T12 vertebra of indeterminate age; however, degenerative changes in that area indicate that this is likely chronic due to prior trauma.
On [**8-6**], On exam the patient was alert and oriented to person , place, and time without focal deficits.
The patient reports a history of various abcesses developing at site where he inject heroin improperly.
Surgery was without complication.
On [**8-11**] he was still complaining of discomfort in his head and neck.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
