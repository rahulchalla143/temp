Patient had originally presented yesterday at 4pm to [**Hospital3 13313**] ED with RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting x 1 (nonbloody, nonbilious).
Additionally, he had no tongue biting, no convulsions, no loss of continence, no history of seizures.
CT was done, which reportedly showed ascites, calcifications, multiple lesions.
No paracentesis was done.
Ultrasound was done to assess for portal vein thrombosis, which showed patent portal vein but suggestion of IVC infiltration by malignancy/?thrombus.
No head CT done.
In the MICU, patient has no complaints.
On ROS he also mentions that earlier in the day he was having chest discomfort, [**1-1**], nonradiating, assoc w/ mild SOB/no diaphoresis.
Also c/o subjective fevers/chills.
Hepatitis B cirrhosis c/b HCC.
Diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 07/[**2192**].
Pathology revealed a 11 cm tumor with numerous satellite nodules.
Postoperative imaging demonstrated small left-sided lesions, and he underwent left liver TACE in 03/[**2193**].
Surveillance imaging in [**2-/2194**] identified an 11 mm lesion in segment II, and he was referred for radiofrequency ablation.
In [**8-/2194**], segment II lesion noted to be larger, demonstrating mass effect on adjacent IVC and abutting pericardial surface.

Multiple hepatic lesions, unchanged from those described on recent CT, as best can be compared across modalities.
Isoechoic material within the IVC is noted.
This raises the possibility of partial IVC thrombus and this possibility could be further evaluated via CT/MRI as clinically appropriate.
CT HEAD [**2194-10-17**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
The lesion also invades the superior infradiaphragmatic portion of the IVC for a short segment.
More caudally, there is a partially obstructive bland thrombus involving the entire length of IVC down to the iliac vein confluence.
There is no sign of esophageal invasion as a fat plane is seen between the esophagus and the tumor.
There is heterogenous appearance of the parenchyma of the segment IIA with faint arterial flow to this segment consistent with post-TACE changes.
There is no portal vein thrombosis.
There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the celiac region, the largest measuring 3 cm in diameter with central necrosis.
No renal vein thrombosis or collateral formation.
There is moderate amount of perihepatic ascites and a small amount of perisplenic free fluid.
The right hemidiaphragm is slightly thickened anteriorly.
No nodularity to suggest neoplastic involvement of the diaphragm.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series (112 and 113).
IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of segment II hepatocellular carcinoma with clear invasion of the subdiaphragmatic IVC for a short segment and right atrial component.
Partial occlusive bland thrombus below the tumor involving the entire length of IVC without extension to the renal veins.
Interval increase in size of metastatic upper abdominal adenopathy.
Bilateral pleural effusions and perisplenic and perihepatic ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3443**] is a 58 year-old man with history of Hepatitis B complicated by slowly progressive HCC s/p lobectomy/TACE/radiofreqency ablation who presents from OSH with elevated transaminases, elevated creatinine, and lactic acidosis.
Also with elevation in coags, bili c/w acute liver insult.
Differential diagnosis included shock liver in setting of hypotension, Budd-Chiari syndrome from IVC thrombus vs. HCC invasion (lesion in segment II previously noted next to IVC), toxin exposure, ingestion of herbal supplements.
No evidence of portal v thrombosis on imaging.
Pt was given a ceftriaxone 1 g and flagyl 500mg in ED for possible SBP, but this was discontinued as he had no evidence of SBP on exam.
Given the presentation of elevated transaminases with acute renal failure that improved with volume resuscitation, it is likely the patient had hemodynamic compromise (possibly from IVC thrombus and/or tumor invasion into IVC) that led to shock liver and pre-renal azotemia.
Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline is creatinine 1, At discharge the patient's creatinine was back to baseline.
Possibly due to poor forward flow if episode of hypotension as hypothesized above.
[**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to underlying liver disease, would be exacerbated by acute insult to liver.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Fibrinogen continued to trend down, likely due to poor liver function.
His fibrinogen and thrombocytopenia stabilized as his liver function improved.
Syncope: Unclear trigger, sounds as though initially presyncopal and wonder if this was related to hypotension/poor perfusion state leading to lactic acidosis and end organ ischemia.
No history of seizures.
Now with elevated cardiac enzymes, but unlikely that this was inciting event as no ST/T wave changes on EKG and fits demand ischemia picture.
Head CT was negative in setting of trauma and supratherapeutic INR.
Lactic acidosis: Unclear trigger- possible hypotensive episode leading to syncope) causing shock liver and poor tissue perfusion/lactic acidosis.
Blood and urine cultures revealed no evidence of infection.
Elevated cardiac enzymes: Likely secondary to demand ischemia, CKs elevated by MBs flat.
Could also be secondary to ischemic/necrotic liver.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had an MI due to hypoperfusion, but less likely.
MRI showed enlargement of tumor and extension into IVC.

You were admitted for abdominal pain and very high liver enzymes.
You were found to have a blood clot near your liver.
We stopped the blood thinning medication, because we were concerned that you are at risk for bleeding because your body's clotting factors are not functioning properly because you have liver disease.
You had an MRI that showed your tumor has spread - this may have caused the liver failue that brought you into the hospital.
Please make the following changes to your medications: -Added colace 100 mg daily for constipation -Added Bisacodyl 10 mg daily as needed for constipation -Added Senna 1 tab, twice a day as needed for constipation .
