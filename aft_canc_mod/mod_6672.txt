GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
OCTREOTIDE SCAN [**2102-4-17**]: No abnormal focus of tracer uptake at 4 hrs to suggest carcinoid.
Pulmonary uptake is likely secondary to infiltrates.
Routine 24 hr and SPECT/CT images were not obtained secondary to patient clinical instability as above.
Lateral apical opacities, although might represent area of pulmonary edema, on the other hand can represent worsening of infectious process demonstrated on [**4-17**], [**2101**] radiograph.
No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.
No pneumothorax is noted.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mildly depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant aortic or mitral valve stenosis or regurgitation.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-4-21**], the global left ventricular systolic function appears to have improved slightly, although this may in part be secondary to tachycardia (HR 119 currently, 63 on prior).
Diffuse ground-glass opacities involving the majority of both lungs with focal areas of nodularity.
Increased severity and extent compared to prior examination.
Differential is broad and includes infection (atypical or fungal) or possibly non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ie ARDS, TRALI, drug toxicity, etc.)
No acute intra-abdominal pathology or abscess.
CXR [**2102-5-7**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**5-6**].
The large areas of bilateral pneumonia, which worsened on the right between [**5-3**] and [**5-6**], are subsequently stable.
Small right pleural effusion and borderline cardiomegaly are unchanged.
In addition to the dense area of left suprahilar consolidation, improved since [**4-30**] and subsequently stable, there is suggestion of new nodularity in the right lung as well as new right pleural effusion.
All of these findings could be infectious, including septic embolism.
Right internal jugular line ends approximately a centimeter below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo M with AML s/p double cord transplant presenting with 3 days of watery diarrhea and abdominal pain.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Admitted to ICU [**4-22**] with an acute episode of worsening tachypnea to the 40s, shortness of breath, wheezing, and tachycardia to the 180s in the setting of walking to and from the commode.
An EKG showed a supraventricular tachycardia.
He was given 2mg of morphine and 40mg of IV Lasix for concern of flash pulmonary edema and was transferred to the ICU satting 100% on a NRB.
Respiratory distress thought to be in settting of parainfluenza type 3 PNA as he had been dyspneic and wheezing for days since diagnosis.
Also thought to be in setting of flash pulmonary edema.
Weaning from the vent proved difficult, as he would develop agitation and increased work of breathing during subsequent spontaneous breathing trials that were concerning for flash pulmonary edema.
Imaging showed a diffuse multifocal pneumonia.
His antibiotics had already included vancomycin from a [**4-3**] blood culture of coag positive and negative staph, though per BMT recs these antibiotics were re-expanded to vancomycin and cefepime on [**4-27**] for fevers and hypotension.
Meropenem was substituted for cefepime on [**2102-4-28**], and PO vanco was added for empiric c dif coverage at that time as well.
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed at that time for suspected pulmonary source of infection, demonstrating positive parainfluenza 3 though negative PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**], bacterial cultures.
A galactomanan was positive x2 but was felt to represent a false positive due to recent IVIG treatment.
He underwent CT torso on [**2102-4-29**] due to worsening fever and leukocytosis, showing significantly worse diffuse bilateral groundglass increased in extent and confluent from [**4-14**], thickening bronchial walls, more dense consolidation in the right upper lobe, and left upper lobe concerning for diffuse infection with bacterial superinfection on atypical process.
Other ICU events that were notable included an NSTEMI on [**2102-4-22**], which the cardiology consult team felt was consistent with acute plaque rupture.
TTE showed no valvular disease or WMA though the quality of the study was limited.
Patient also developed a metabolic acidosis thought likely to be [**12-28**] renal tubular acidosis on [**4-23**].
Renal team was consulted who recommended sodium bicarb infusions, also recommended renal ultrasound which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
He initially presented with diarrhea felt to be due to GVHD.
He was found to have an elevated chromogranin-A level 42, and was therefore sent for an octreodtide scan to rule out carcinoid which was negative.
Patient also had LUE swelling, US showed partially occlusive left IJ thrombus.
He was also noted to have transaminits throughout admission which peaked then normalized, then peaked again.
