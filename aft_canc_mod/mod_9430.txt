Chief Complaint: transfer from Ortho service for atrial fibrillation   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L3 mass excision with L1-5 posterior fusion with instrumentation.
History of Present Illness: 86 M w/ PMH locally advanced prostate cancer responsive to hormone therapy, MGUS, and presumed plasmacytoma of L3 region, hx of tachyarrhythmias, trasfered care to medicine team for atrial fibrillation.
Pt initially presented to the ED on [**9-15**] with a 1 day history of urinary incontinence, severe low back pain, altered mental status concerning for spinal cord compression, but with MRI demonstrating compression due to L3 lesion.
Of note patient has hx of atrial fibrillation occuring prior to a colonoscopy.
Ortho consulted and in discussion with oncology felt surgical intervention best for treatment of severe symptoms.
In atrial fibrillation.
Of note patient not on his beta blocker for one week, and 3 units PRBC's given, though chest x-ray with no strong evidence of failure.
Coronary artery disease with a positive stress test in [**2127**] and a negative stress test in [**2135**].
History of atrial fibrillation prior to colonoscopy.
Prostate cancer - First dx in [**12-4**].
He  underwent transurethral biopsy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2138-1-10**] which  revealed a very aggressive prostate adenocarcinoma with a [**Doctor Last Name **] score of 8 involving 13 of 20 cores with at least 30%-80% of each of the cores.
Polymyalgia rheumatica on steroids in the past 5.
MGUS - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 343**] - IgG-kappa monoclonal gammopathy c/b with anemia and mild chronic renal failure 6.
Anemia - baseline 28-32 7.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.2-1.5  8.
Presumed plasmacytoma of L3 - noted on spine xray in setting  of chronic low back pain.
On [**2139-7-16**], CT Lspine showed expansion  and further destruction of L3 lytic lesion with soft tissue extension on the left side.
MRI on [**2139-8-21**] was notable for metastasis to L3 vertebral body with compression and left paraspinal mass with 75% narrowing of the spinal canal at L3 level due to retropulsion and epidural mass.
He completed [**9-8**]  sessions of XRT to the spinal mass in addition to steroid therapy.
H/O adenomatous polyps resected in [**2131**] 10.
Mass on left lower abdominal wall resected [**2134**], subsequently found to be a schwannoma  Social History: He is Russian speaking.
Lungs: bibasilar crackles Abdomen: NABS, ND/[**Name (NI) **], pt grimacing, no appreciable HSM though difficult exam given combative nature.
Pertinent Results: LABS- CK: 241 MB: 3 Trop-*T*: 0.01 Comments: Ctropnt > 0.10 Ng/Ml Suggests Acute Mi Crit 30.3 [**9-21**] 9.3 3.0 121 26.1 EKG atrial fibrillation RVR, rate 124, PVC's.
Inferior and anterior T wave changes.
Images- CT head [**9-14**]- No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect .
[**9-14**] MRI L-spine w/gadolinium- Large mass at L3 with features as discussed above.
There is severe canal stenosis.
CXR portable [**9-22**]- A small radiopaque band is seen just above the left costophrenic angle, likely representing focal atelectasis.
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-9-27**] 8:16 PM soft tissue mass at the L3 level with associated osseous destruction of the L3 vertebral body.
There is no evidence of spondylolisthesis.
Extensive degenerative changes are seen, as described above.
There is no fracture.
There is a 3 mm grade I anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 with focal kyphotic angulation.
There is no associated prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.
While this is possibly degenerative, the kyphosis appears more prominent in comparison to the prior C-spine radiographs from [**2135-12-19**], and an underlying ligamentous injury is not excluded.
I agree that there is more subluxation and kyphosis now than on the prior study.
No fracture or subluxation of the thoracic spine is identified.
Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Slightly increased density of the liver parenchyma is noted, and may reflect changes related to prior treatment or transfusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-9-27**] 7:29 PM No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
Again seen are areas of low attenuation within the periventricular and subcortical white matter, consistent with change from chronic microvascular angiopathy.
No hemorrhage is identified.
No evidence of acute intracranial process; specifically, there is no evidence of acute infarction.
Moderate generalized atrophy and chronic micro-ischemic change in subcortical and periventricular white matter.
Nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base is not evident on the chest radiograph of [**2139-10-1**].
The finding may simply represent nipple shadow.
It clinically indicated, repeat chest radiograph with nipple marker in place could be performed to exclude pulmonary nodule.
Degenerative narrowing at multiple disc levels noted.
Lytic lesion in right iliac bone, not fully evaluated.
Brief Hospital Course: 86yo man with h/o prostate CA, presumed plasmacytoma of L3 vert, admitted for back pain, altered mental status, urinary incontinence s/p decompression of L3 lesion with posterior stabilization from L1-5 with subsequent episode of atrial fibrillation and worsening altered mental status.
#Altered mental status- Present post dilaudid and Ativan for low back pain as outpatient.
In house felt likely due to narcotics.
Pt agitated at night requiring Haldol, with episodes of somnolence.
Pt had fall on [**9-27**] with no evidence of bleed on CT head.
[**9-28**] Neuro consulted given worsening mental status.
Neuro felt possible left hemisphere pathology causing receptive aphasia with right sided weakness.
Broad differential for this post-operative delirium included cerebral hypoxia, endocrine or electrolyte imbalance, postoperative pain, full bladder, hyper or hypoglycemia, drug intoxication or withdrawl, language/communication barriers, UTI, drug-intoxication (e.g.
Considered L-sided stroke [**1-1**] atrial fibrillation consistent with right-sided motor signs and possible aphasia.
MRI/MRA  stroke protocol to be performed negative for acute bleed or stroke pathology.
EEG with no seizure focus.
No evidence of UTI, metabolic derrangement or neurological pathology.
[**10-4**] bradycardic to 38, somnolent, neuro felt unresponsiveness related to bradycardia, though BP stable.
With elevated BP to 170's on captopril and 25 TID BB, increased metoprolol to 37.5 TID.
Episode of bradycardia two days later associated with episode of unresponsiveness.
In terms of atrial fibrillation, considered elderly male with CAD, htn, setting of stressor, surgical intervention in addition to possible increased fluid load all exacerbating factors, but appears discontinuation of beta blocker with rebound tachyarrhythmia likely culprit.
Enzymes sent and did not appear to be from MI, pulmonic process or PE, or CHF by XCR.
Urine OSM's suggestive of SIADH, but pt appeared hypovolemic on admission with very poor PO intake.
# Urinary incontinence - Known spinal cord compression on exam , but stable since last imaging, pt without new weakness or saddle, anesthesia, good rectal tone.
Felt likely related to prostate pathology.
Considered retention with overflow incontinence.
# Pain mgmt- Delirium likely result of pain medications, ativan and dilaudid.
Comfortable in no acute distress or pain, with tylenol for relief.
# CKD -Remained ay baseline creatinine during course of admission.

You developed atrial fibrillation, but are now not in atrial fibrillation.
You experienced a change in mental status likely related to narcotics, which is slowly improving.
-Please hold all narcotics if possible -Please return to the hospital if you are experiencing change in mental status above baseline in hospital, fever, shortness of breath, abdominal or severe back pain, or any other symptoms concerning to you or you caregivers.
