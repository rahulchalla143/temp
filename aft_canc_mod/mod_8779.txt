Admission Date:  [**2127-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-10-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6780**] Chief Complaint: Portal vein thrombosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 72y/o F presented to ED after seeing PCP for weight loss, fevers, and malaise over 3-4 weeks.
Has had anorexia with decreased po intake.
No night sweats.
Has noted darker urine during this time; stool not acholic.
No BRBPR, no diarrhea, no hematemesis.
+ SOB particularly with exertion.
Denies chest pressure or palpitations.
No recent infectious symptoms - minimal headache, no back pain; +slight nonproductive cough, no dysuria, no diarrhea, no abdominal pain.
Pt noted to have RUQ tenderness found to have anemia and leukocytosis with shift.
The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
However, there is occlusion of the right portal vein with visualized thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Portal vein thrombus with occlusion of the right portal and nonocclusive thrombus in the left portal vein.
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.
There is probable mild cardiomegaly.
No CHF or effusion is identified.
There is hazy opacity at the lung base posteriorly on the lateral view.
IMPRESSION: Focal ill-defined opacity at the base posteriorly, seen only on the lateral view.
Lungs are otherwise grossly clear, without other evidence for infiltrate.
Portal vein occlusion with partial recanalization of the left portal vein.
2.5 x 2 cm left adrenal lesion, which is not fully characterized on this exam and could represent an adenoma vs. malignancy.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Multiple small hazy nodular opacities, which are nonspecific in appearance.
Given the presence of calcified lymph nodes, the nodules could represent prior granulomatous disease however neoplasm cannot be completely excluded.
Persistent complete right portal vein and partial left portal vein thrombosis with small collateral formation.
Large area of edema within the left greater than right hepatic lobes with heterogeneous perfusion is likely related to portal vein thrombosis.
No definite hepatic masses on this limited evaluation.
No biliary source for infection.
Gallbladder wall edema likely relates to patient's anasarca.
2.5 cm left adrenal lesion does not meet definitive criteria for an adenoma.
This could still represent an adenoma, but metastasis or other primary adrenal lesion should be considered.
Asymmetric adnexa with right adnexa containing soft tissue that may represent asymmetric ovarian tissue, however an ovarian lesion cannot be excluded as this is only seen on one image set.
ERCP: ERCP: 9 ERCP images were obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and demonstrated normal biliary ducts without filling defect or dilatation.
There are multiple echogenic areas seen in the periphery of the myometrium consistent with calcified vessels.
There is trace fluid seen within the endometrial cavity.
There is trace fluid in the pelvis.
Neither kidney demonstrates evidence of hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  72y/o F with sepsis, constitutional symptoms and weight loss, and portal vein thrombosis.
1.  sepsis - unclear etiology of infection.
Abdominal exam benign and pt without abd pain; biliary source of infection likely.
The azithromycin was discontinued as there were no clear signs of pneumonia.
She was continued on the imipenem and vancomycin for empiric coverage.
2.  portal vein thrombosis - unclear etiology - appears to be somewhat chronic given recanalization, though has had a decompensation of some sort with new bilirubinuria, jaundice.
Thought possibly [**3-13**] malignancy but colonoscopy not suggestive, TV u/s not suggestive.
4.  anemia - guaiac negative - iron studies - in setting of blood transfusion, distorted view, however pt appears to have a likely anemia of inflammation - DIC labs- negative - Given colonoscopy report, may have anemia [**3-13**] hemorrhage from portal vein thrombosis.
MFAT: Pt has been noted to have a wandering PCM intermittent with MFAT over the past day.
6.  metabolic acidosis - Likely due to lactic acidosis.
7.  diabetes mellitus - held metformin in setting of NPO and lactic acidosis initially but then restarted metformin and pt.
Sepsis 3.
Anemia Secondary 1.
Hypertension 2.
Type II DM   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You should follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week.
If you notice any worsening CP, SOB, N/V, abd pain, headache, bleeding in your stools, or pain on eating or having a bowel movement, please return to the ER and/or contact your PCP.
