Given these 2 findings, there was a question whether or not these represented inflammatory lesions versus bronchoalveolar carcinoma in one or both.
We followed these lesions with serial CT scans including a PET/CT scan.
There was no FDG uptake within either lesion.
There was uptake within a porta hepatis lymph node which we followed on serial CT scans and proceeded with esophagoscopy with gastric ultrasound.
Our plan was to perform a generous wedge excision, and if it represented a well-differentiated bronchoalveolar carcinoma to consider that adequate treatment for the left lower lobe lesion.
Past Medical History: cavitary Left lower lobe lung lesion s/p left Video-assisted and Left lower lobectomy Coronary artery disease s/p CABG x 3 and LIMA-LAD stent, s/p IVC filter.
significant smoking hx etoh- 2 drinks/day  Family History: n/a  Physical Exam: General-frail elderly female HEENT- no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy Resp-clear, course upper airway sunds Cor- RRR, no murmur Abd- non distended, soft, non- tender Ext- no clubbing,cyanosis or edema.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please assess for pneumothorax or effusion.
There is a moderately large left pleural effusion tracking along the left chest wall, with underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
The left hemidiaphragm is also elevated, with near filled gastric fundus below.
There is curvilinear density superimposed over the left lung apex suggesting the presence of a small left pneumothorax.
The differential diagnosis includes vascular calcification superimposed over the left lung apex.
Equivocal small left apical pneumothorax, in the setting of a calcified left subclavian artery crossing the apex of the left lung.
PACU course complicated by need for IVF (4L) and neo gtt for BP/hemodynamic support.
Pt transferred to ICU on new for observation BP/ hemodynamic monitoring.
