Admission Date:  [**2134-9-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-12-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 85265**] is a 80 yo Armenian-speaking F with a history of multiple myeloma, [**Known lastname 2320**], and multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for constipation, nausea, and vomiting, recently started on anticoagulation for DVT, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] one day after discharge with a large dark stool and concern for GI bleed.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**8-6**] - [**8-12**] and again from [**8-16**] - [**8-18**] for constipation in the setting of chronic narcotic use (fentanyl patches, dilaudid pca, tramadol, and oxycodone in recent past) for her multiple myeloma pain.
During this admission she was also found to have a R common femoral vein DVT and was started on heparin gtt.
This was transitioned to lovenox, which was held [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] for dark maroon stool and a Hct drop (29.6 --> 24.8) with concern for lower GI bleed.
At the time she was transfused 1 unit of RBCs and her Hct stabilized and it was then thought that she had had a bleeding hemorroid.
She was also started on full dose aspirin per cardiology who evaluated her for NSTEMI in the setting of a fib with RVR during her hospitalization.
She was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] and the following day (day of presentation) she was noted to have a large dark stool.
Per grandson pt has no history of previous GI bleed other than the recent hospitalization.
She has continued to have nausea and emesis every few days.
She denies abdominal pain or diarrhea.
NG lavage caused epistaxis and revelaed initial bright red blood which cleared with 250 cc.
A third lavage yt eh GI fellow was clear.
She went into a fib with RVR with no ST changes but T wave flattening during the NG lavage.
A peripheral 18 guage was placed and she has the PICC from rehab.
Just prior to transfer to the ICU the patient became hypotensive to the 80s and a small amount of bright red blood ber rectum was noted on the rectal thermometer.
Of note, the patient's Multiple Myeloma - which was diagnosed a year and a half ago - was recently thought to be unamenable to chemotherapy by oncology given the pt multiple medical issues including poor PO intake and anasarca.
Kappa light chain multiple myeloma.
She has significant pain and is on chronic narcotics.
Hypertension 3.
Recent oral candidiasis  Social History: Lives with daughter and grandson.

This record is consistent with a mild encephalopathy, secondary to possible infectious, metabolic, or medication-related effects.
The superimposed beta frequency rhythm throughout much of the record is likely due to medication effect, most likely benzodiazepine or barbiturates.
There are no focal abnormalities or electrographic seizures recorded  [**9-30**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: .
No acute infarction, hemorrhage or specific evidence of anoxic brain injury.
The CSF within the cerebral extra-axial spaces and cortical sulci is FLAIR-hyperintense and slightly T1-hyperintense without subjacent brain parenchymal abnormality, while the intraventricular CSF signal appears normal.
Given the patient's progressive renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine rising from 1.2 to 2.3, this most likely represents retained gadolinium administered for the [**9-26**] MR study.
This phenomenon may produce a pattern of relatively abnormal sulcal CSF.
Abnormal protein or cells in the CSF is a less likely consideration, which would have to be excluded by lumbar puncture, if feasible.
No evidence of abnormal alignment at the craniocervical junction or atlantoaxial articulation.
Given the history, this most likely relates to underlying multiple myloma this is concerning for plasmacytoma  4.
Stable left maxillary sinus and bilateral mastoid air cell mucosal thickening and fluid.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 85265**] was an 80 yo Armenian speaking woman with history of multiple myeloma and recent hospitalizations for constipation/ileus complicated by DVT and NSTEMI, on lovenox and full dose aspirin who presented with BRBPR.
Her telemetry was showing an Afib rhythm with a HR in the low 100s.
She was awake and responsive to questions with nods and mouthing words but could not clearly vocalize.
She was also profoundly weak in both upper and lower extermities with poor hand grip and poor hand coordination.
## PEA arrest s/p cooling protocol c/b subclinical seizures: Her PEA arrest was attributed to macroaspiration on [**9-14**], with a question of family feeding patient despite NPO status.
Her warming complicated by subclincal seizures noted on EEG which improved on anti-epeleptic medication.
On [**9-24**], she again developed PEA arrest with degeneration into asystole [**3-16**] again secondary to aspiration.
Following this second PEA arrest, she was persistently unresponsive and unable to follow commands, though brainstem reflexes were intact.
Serial EEGs captured at least two short bursts (less than 10 seconds of) electrographic seizures over an extremely low voltage burst suppression pattern -- a record signifying an extremely poor neurological prognosis in the setting of cardiopulmonary arrest.
Her Keppra dose was increased, after which no seizures were captured on serial EEGs.
An MRI showed no acute infarction, hemorrhage or specific evidence of anoxic brain injury, but was not stroke protocol due to renail failure.
Given the patient's failure to regain neurological function, the patient's family was advised that she had an extremely poor prognosis for regaining any further neurological function.
Pt was put on Keppra for seizure proph.
# Bacteremia - The patient started spiking fevers through vancomycin and zosyn.
She was started on linezolid, then switched to dapotmycin because of its lower fluid requirement.
## Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive s/p second PEA arrest requiring norepinephrine and fluid boluses secondary to tension pneumothorax, aspiration, and Afib with RVR.
Later in her course, the patient again developed a pressor requirement and was placed on phenylephrine, likely due to sepsis.
Positive blood culture from [**10-12**] grew VRE and pt was transitioned to linezolid, then daptomycin as above.
Neo requirements continued to increase in the setting of fever and increased WOB.
## Acute Kindey Injury:  The patient suffered acute kidney injury following her second PEA.
## Pneumothorax: s/p PEA arrest the patient was hypotensive on norepi, breath sounds diminished on R.  CXR showed tension PTX on R, subcutaneous air on L and pneumomediatinum.
## VAP/LLL collapse: She developed a LLL consolidation on CXR, but has been afebrile and without change in WBC count.
She improved on treatment with reduced work of breathing and reduced oxygen requirement as she was satting 98% on room air.
Unclear how much she put out from MICU documentation, but has been off lasix x 1 day.
Repeat CXR demonstrated improved airspace disease with stable or slightly worsening pleural effusions.
Her anticoagulation was held given her recent GI bleed.
After the patient's second PEA arrrest she did have guaiac negative stools and a slowly falling hematocrit that did require intermittent blood transfusions.
A bedside swallow study recommened a video swallow study which revealed gross aspiration.
On [**9-24**] she had a presumed aspiration event that resulted in another PEA arrest becoming asystole requiring CPR and defibrillation.
No bacteremia noted.
She later was started on ceftriaxone for urinarlysis c/w UTI; however, this was discontinued after urine cultures were negative.
Finally, she was treated with fluconazole for persistent yeast in her urine despite frequent Foley replacement.
A bladder ultrasound was negative for fungal ball.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID:PRN as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 25 mg PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
