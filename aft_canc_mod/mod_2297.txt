Past Medical History: Oncologic history: # Head and neck cancer: - Mr. [**Known lastname 35716**] presented with a pain in his right neck.
A lump developed in the area and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and laryngoscopy demonstrated a post-cricoid hypopharyngeal lesion and was referred to have a CT scan of the neck.
The CT scan of the neck revealed an enhancing mass in the right pyriform sinus with extensive conglomerate adenopathy in the right level 2 and level 3 nodes.
Biopsy of the mass was positive  for squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2197-4-13**] he underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of right pyriform sinus lesion and rigid esophagoscopy.

CXR [**6-16**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-17**], there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
There are some bilateral areas of opacification most likely representing atelectasis.
In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of pneumonia would have to be considered.
Continued mild cardiomegaly.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 61 year old male with PMH of SCC of the pryiform sinus s/p C2 of TPF (taxotere, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**5-30**] presenting with cough and confusion and found to have a possible RLL PNA on imaging, worsening of his known chronic SIADH hyponatremia, and anemia with a Hct=19.8.
# Pyriform sinus squamous cell carcinoma: # Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the right piriform sinus: S/p Cycle 2 of TPF (taxotere, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**5-30**].
Due to patient's hyponatremia, confusion and generally complex medical condition, he stayed in-house for his third cycle of TPF once his cough, confusion and anemia had improved.
He completed the cycle with no significant complications, although he did have some emotional lability with the steroids.
He may have GI oozing secondary to mucositis or underlying diverticulosis which may be amplified by aggressive fluid repletion.
# Hyponatremia: The patient has a long history of hyponatremia which has been extensively evaluated by renal and found to be consistent with SIADH with unclear underlying cause, possibly due to his malignancy and worsened in the past (and this admission) with chemotherapy session.
Cisplatinum chemo is also known to worsen hyponatremia and therefore the patient has been repeatedly admitted for hyponatremia.
During his last admission, he was treated with lasix, salt tabs, and fluid restriction.
# CXR Findings: He has a small infiltrate on imaging suggestive of RLL PNA vs. atelectasis.
Given his recent chemotherapy, as well as current bandemia, chills, and cough with RLL crackles, he was given azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl in the ED.
He does not have a history of chronic cough, but he claims to have "aspiration" due to cough with lying flat consistent with GERD.
After monitoring the patient overnight, it was felt that pneumonia was very unlikely, and antibiotics were stopped.
# Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial from hyponatremia and possibly toxicity from his chemotherapy may be contributing.
He was near his recent baseline per his wife who has noted subtle memory changes since he started his chemo regimen.
# GERD: He described abdominal cramping followed by a feeling of regurgitation and cough while supine which is consistent with GERD.
It was felt that the patient has a tendency to develop vasovagal hypotension and bradycardia when his port site is accessed.
The patient has had vagal episodes in the past during accessing his port.

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the right piriform sinus, hyponatremia, slow lower GI bleed, altered mental status Secondary: Hypertension, GERD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with mental slowing and cough.
You were initially in the ICU because of concerns about your low sodium and a slow bleeding in your GI tract.
You were treated briefly with antibiotics for possible pneumonia and closely monitored for the GI bleeding, which stopped.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
As we suspect you have bleeding in your intestinal tract, it is very important that you see a Gastroenterologist about getting a colonoscopy.
