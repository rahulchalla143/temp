Admission Date:  [**2174-2-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2174-2-17**]    CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Urosepsis consistent with hypotension and demand ischemia.
The patient had UTI with acute renal failure, creatinine of 3.9, became hypotensive.
The patient had EKG change of [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression in 1 and AVL and V2 through V5.
The patient reports chest pain for last two weeks with  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2156**], diabetes, hypertension, increased cholesterol, bladder cancer in [**2169**], status post BCG treatment from [**2169**] to [**2172**], patient had duodenal ulcer consistent with gastritis by EGD in 6/00 and he had complicated gastrointestinal bleed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient is an obese male, in mild acute distress, temperature 96.4, heart rate 76, blood pressure 110/43, respiratory rate 18, 90% on four liters nasal cannula.
Abdomen distended, positive tense, mild tenderness throughout, positive bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding.
EKG showed sinus at 75, 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression in 1, 2, AVL and V2 through V6.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  79-year-old male with CAD, diabetes, bladder cancer, transferred for management of urosepsis causing demand ischemia.
CV:  Patient with CAD status post MI.
Patient unaware of recent echo or evaluation of heart function.
EKG could be consistent with fixed stenosis.
No chest pain currently, receiving Aspirin.
Cycle CKs, maintain Heparin per protocol to rule out MI, hold blood pressure medications in setting of recent hypotension, cardiac echo in a.m.  2.
Pulmonary:  Mild shortness of breath question secondary to increased abdominal distention, PE and chest x-ray negative for CHF.
Check ABG to evaluate for hypoxia and acid base status, MDI's prn.
Patient has a history describing several days of decreased po intake, decreased urine output, no dysuria or hematuria, presumably has UTI by urologist.
Likely developed urosepsis given decreased blood pressure and increased white blood cells.
Question role of bladder cancer in causing post obstructive situation.
Check renal ultrasound to rule out hydronephrosis and also bladder to rule out obstruction.
Check ABG to rule out acid based problems.
GI:  Patient has complaint of abdominal pain.
Patient is not passing gas since last night, no bowel movement in five days, positive distention consistent with ileus given UTI.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have mesenteric ischemia given hypotension.
The patient will have an NG tube in with IV fluid, check LFTs and pancreatic enzymes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had E. coli positive urine resistant to Fluoroquinolones but sensitive to Aztreonam.
Drain to stay in until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38494**], urologist, can evaluate for resolution of obstruction to remove the drain.
Patient's blood culture on [**2174-2-11**] showed E. coli in [**1-24**] bottles and on discharge, blood cultures were no growth to date.
Stool was negative for C. diff and fecal leukocytes.
CV:  Patient with EKG changes, had cardiac catheterization which showed cardiac output of 7.3, cardiac index of 3.3 with pressures as follows: Wedge pressure 15, PA pressure 30, RV pressure 43/14 and RA pressure of 11.
Medical management of his cardiac disease.
Patient is afebrile at 98.6.
Patient may need nitrates as outpatient if angina persists.
Patient has sublingual Nitroglycerin for chest pain, no further episodes in hospital.
Urosepsis with resolution, status post nephrostomy tube left side.
Coronary artery disease.
Demand ischemia due to urosepsis.
Bladder cancer and diabetes.
