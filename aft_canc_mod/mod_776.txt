Admission Date:  [**2163-6-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-6-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: invasive sqamous scalp ca  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement, neurosurgical intervention cancelled,  History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with afib, cad, dm who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] for lesion on scalp (can see brain matter).
She was evaluated as an outpatient intially by dermatology that did a biopsy of the scalp mass and she was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma.
The ulcerative lesion eroding skull extending intracranially and was to have neurosurgical intervention but the patient was supertheraputic INR of 7.7 so she was sent to the MICU.
She was also noted to have arf with cr of 2, anuric, dry on exam with a sodium 158-->161.
She received a NS bolus and then D5W and avoiding lasix and acei given renal failure, renal ultrasound with R hydro and pelvic mass (family does not want w/u).
Patient was placed on vanc and cetriaxone for meningitis proprolaxis since there is CSF communicating with skin secondary to scc.

FINDINGS:  Within the brain parenchyma, there is global parenchymal atrophy, indicated by enlargement of the ventricles and sulci.
There is also periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity, consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
A right cerebellar lacunar infarct is also noted.
There is no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is a large destructive lesion involving the vertex of the calvarium.
There is no underlying brain mass lesion or brain abscess, although there is an extra- axial, likely subdural, soft tissue/fluid component to this lesion, although this is difficult to evaluate due to volume averaging at the vertex and the lack of reconstructions.
There is subcutaneous gas, which also extends intracranially, with resultant pneumocephalus.
Extensive destructive lesion involving the calvarial vertex, with intracranial extension indicated by pneumocephalus and extra-axial, intracranial soft tissue/fluid component.
Differential includes infectious process or a subcutaneous or osseous malignancy.
Small vessel ischemic disease, lacunar infarcts, and global parenchymal atrophy.
There are no brain mass lesions or brain abscesses identified.
There is no left-sided hydronephrosis.
There is moderate right-sided hydronephrosis.
There is no renal mass or stone.
Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis.
Non-specific, large cystic pelvic mass.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with h.o CHF, DM, afib, who presented with invasive scalp squamous cell carcinoma with intracranial extension who died after code status was CMO.
# CMO - Had family meeting [**6-10**].
# Pain control - This was the family's primary goal of care.
There were multiple etiologies of the pain including her chonic right shoulder pain, sacral decubiti with possible abcess, painful scalp leison, or the >15cm pelvic mass.
Patient was comfortably sedated and only required additional pain medication when she was moved.
It probably developed before her care to nursing home facility given that there was a rapid decline in her functional status and intracraninal involvement of the tumor.
She was evaluated as an outpatient by dermatology and was determined to have a squamous cell ca as per biopsy on [**5-25**].
Initially, the family wanted to have a neurosurgical intervention, but the patient's INR was 7.7 so she was transferred to the MICU for reversal.
# Resolved hypovolemia/ acute renal failure/ hypernatremia - secondary to dehydration and intravascular hypovolemia in the setting of diruetic use.
# Pelvic mass - There is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass seen on renal ultrasound.
# afib not on anticoagulation - Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but was placed on anticoagulation for a recent phelbiltis.
# DM-HISS .
