Admission Date:  [**2107-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, black stools  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper endoscopy [**2107-1-31**], [**2107-2-17**] Hemodialysis Tunneled hemodialysis line IJ central venous catheter placement and removal  History of Present Illness: This is a 69 y/o F DM, CAD s/p NSTEMI, NASH cirrhosis who had melena x1 month with abdominal pain and fatigue.
She was found to have a decreased Hct to 22 from baseline of 26 to 27.
Of note patient had recent admission [**Date range (3) 84220**] for shortness of breath found to have NSTEMI.
Cath [**2106-12-30**] demonstrated single vessel disease - no intervention.
For anemia work-up patient had colonoscopy and EGD which demonstrated esophageal varices and gastritis.
CTA to rule out PE demonstrated nodular liver, splenomegaly and ascites.
Patient is now follewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] who felt liver disease is secondary to NASH.
Patient was planning to have banding of esophageal varices one week prior which was delayed.
Given her Hct drop and abnormal labs as well as hypotension to the 60s requiring pressors she was admitted to the MICU for further work up.
In the MICU, she received 3 units prbcs, octreotide gtt, ctx for sbp ppx, and her Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone were held.
She required restarting of her neo for persistent hypotension.
ECHO was performed that showed volume overload with mild depressed systolic function (likely 50%) however it was a poor study.
On [**2-3**], a temporary HD access was placed and patient was placed on CVVH given volume overload and pressor dependence.
She subsequently had a V/Q scan which was intermediate prob, but given concerns for massive GI bleed from varices on anticoagulation, this was not initiated.
Of note, she required BiPAP for several days for respiratory distress given volume overload.
She was initiated on HD on [**2-8**] without complication.
On review of prior records, she was found to have a new pelvic mass with elevated CA 125 to 400 concerning for ovarian malignancy (ovaries could not be visualized on prior US).
She reports occasional coughing with phlegm productive which is not bothersome to her.
She denies chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, fevers, chills or myalgias or other symptoms.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI  Past Medical History: After 5 years w/o medical care she presented in [**Month (only) 404**] with new AFib, NSTEMI, new cirrhosis, elevated CA 125 (400), nonvisualized ovaries on CT or US, 2.5 cm hypoechoic pelvic mass c/w fibroid vs ovarian pathology.
Was admitted [**Date range (3) 84220**], cath [**2106-12-30**] demonstrated single vessel disease - no intervention.
For anemia work-up patient had colonoscopy and EGD which demonstrated esophageal varices and gastritis.
CTA to rule out PE demonstrated nodular liver, splenomegaly and ascites.
Other studies showed significant cirrhotic stigmata (varices, splenomegaly, ascites), and her breathing improved with aggressive diuresis.
Patient is now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] who felt liver disease is secondary to NASH.
Patient was planning to have banding of esophageal varices one week prior to this admission but this was delayed due to the snow.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2-1**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a single wide complex beat.
Borderline low voltage.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
[**2-1**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is probable basal inferoseptal akinesis and probabel basal inferior akinesis but views are suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least mld to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-12-29**], unable to compare regional wall motion due to poor image quality.
[**2-2**] Renal U/S: 1.No evidence of obstruction.
2.Stable right upper pole renal cyst.
[**2-4**] V/Q Scan: At least three segmental perfusion defects, consistent with an intermediate probability for pulmonary embolism, in the setting of no ventilation images and clear lungs.
In the absence of additional studies, given the pattern of findings, clinical treatment for pulmonary embolism would be warranted.
[**2-5**] LENIs: No evidence of DVT of in either lower extremity  [**2-10**] TUNNELED DIALYSIS LINE placement: Satisfactory placement of tunneled dual-lumen 23-cm tip-to-cuff dialysis catheter in the left internal jugular vein with fluoro and ultrasound guidance.
[**2-12**] Chest Xray: new diagnosis of ARF and cirrhosis, needs specific CXR to rule out TB for outpatient HD initiation.
[**2-13**] MRI PELVIS W/O CONTRAST: Single fibroid within the left posterior uterine body correlates with the lesion seen on ultrasound.
The ovaries are atrophic and there is no evidence of adnexal mass.
Large pelvic ascites, presumably related to the history of cirrhosis.
EGD [**2107-2-17**]: Findings: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 1 cords of grade I varices were seen in the distal esophagus proximal to site of previous banding.
Excavated Lesions Two ulcers were found in the distal esophagus at the sites of previous banding.
No stigmata of recent bleeding noted.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance of the mucosa were noted in the whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Impression: Ulcers in the esophagus Esophageal varices Erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Ulceration at site of previous band ligation, grade I varix proximal compressed with air.
No active bleeding noted or etiology for anemia.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2-1**] the patient arrived in the emergency department complaining of fatigue and melena, in the setting of known esophageal varices scheduled for elective banding.
She was noted to have a rising creatinine, an elevated (but not rising) troponin, a hematocrit below her baseline, hyperkalemia for which she received kayexalate.
No active variceal bleeding was noted, although there was potentially some slow oozing.
For her asicites she had a diagnostic paracentesis that showed no evidence of SBP.
An Echo showed some mild tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and an EF of 50%.
A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction and a stable right upper pole renal cyst.
She seemed to have an obstructive sleep apnea picture overnights, and on [**2-3**] she was put on BiPap overnight.
The hepatology team considered her potentially a hepatorenal syndrome case so she was treated with Midrodine, octreotide, albumin.
She also had a V/Q scan performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolus that came back as intermediate risk for PE.
She had LENIs as well that were negative for DVTs.
However, given her freshly banded varices, after discussion with the GI service, it was decided she would be too high risk for anticoagulation given very high risk of rebleeding.
Her HRS treatment was discontinued as this was not felt to be the etiology of her renal failure (more likely ATN and pre-renal from hypotension in the setting of acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleed).
# Anemia: She continued to be anemic after her initial bleed and resuscitation.
Repeat EGD did not show any stigmata of bleeding, only appropriate ulcerations at the sites of prior banding.
This, in addition to her renal failure, are the likely etiology of her persistent anemia.
An abdominal US was performed that showed patent hepatic and portal vasculature and no etiology for her transaminitis.
Nadolol could be restarted if her blood pressures tolerate.
Initially she was not thought to be a candidate for liver transplantation because of her pulmonary hypertension, but she should have a repeat echo to reevaluate given her clinical improvement and reassess her candidacy for transplantation.
Midodrine was changed to dialysis days only which the patient tolerated without difficulty.
Reportedly had elevated CA-125 which was checked as she had new ascites.
Initial imaging with pelvic ultrasound was concerning for ovarian mass.
MRI abdomen was performed which showed the mass to be consistent with a fibroid.
# Diabetes type 2: Her metformin was discontinued given her renal failure and she was placed on a humalog insulin sliding scale.
# Atrial fibrillation: Was rate controlled here without intervention.
Nadolol may help with this in addition to secondary prevention of variceal bleed when it is appropriate to restart this medication.
# Coronary artery disease: Recent NSTEMI in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year with catheterization showing one vessel disease.
# Renal failure:  Likely multifactorial: acute blood loss anemia causing hypotension with pre-renal and ATN features.
Also, patient had been recently started on ACEi and diuretics (lasix, spironolactone) during prior admission which likely exacerbated her renal failure.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal variceal bleed Acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis Hypotension Anemia from acute blood loss and iron deficiency anemia Cirrhosis, likely NASH Iron deficiency Coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation Diabetes mellitus type 2 Uterine fibroids  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute renal failure and a bleed from varices in your esophagus.
You also stopped urinating and had kidney failure which required the initiation of dialysis.
You had a mass in your pelvis evaluated.
This can be followed by gynecology as an outpatient if you find that you are having symptoms from it.
You should monitor for any black or tarry looking stools as this could be a sign of another bleed from your varices.
