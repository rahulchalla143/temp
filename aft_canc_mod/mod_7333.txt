No worsening of his cough and he denied F/C.

He has also noticed the development of a rash on his L inner thigh in the last week.
ROS Pt denied recent fever or chills.
Denied headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, or congestion.
Denied chest pain/tightness or palpitations.
Denied vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
This AM, he was slightly groggy [**2-15**] to Ativan given overnight for sleep, hemodynamically stable without complaints.

Myelodysplastic syndrome s/p splenectomy - diagnosed 15 years ago, ringed sideroblastic anemia diagnosed via BM biopsy.
Multiple GI bleeds [**2-15**] angioectasias from XRT.
Anemia Squamous cell carcinoma in-situ T2DM BPH Gout Scarlet fever as a child Diverticulosis   Social History: The patient was married, had three children and quit tobacco in [**2122**].
Family History: His sister died of congestive heart failure.
Physical Exam: VS Tm = 100 axillary, P = 77, 140/61, 16, O2Sat 93% on 2L GENERAL: Pleasant male, nad, positive temporal wasting HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, ?
scleral icterus noted, dry MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, JVD 5 cm above sternal notch, or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Decreased BS at the bases with diffuse wheezes throughout.
S1S2, [**2-19**] holosystolic murmur with radiation to the axilla.
normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
1+ piting edema at ankles.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
[**2154-3-2**] CXR Findings most suggestive of CHF with interstitial and small areas of alveolar edema.
[**2154-3-2**] ECG: Rate = 76 bpm, LAFB, no acute changes from previous.
Echo (last admission): The left atrium is mildly dilated 4.2 cm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+)mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mildly decreased EF from previous echo.
Based off of the pt's history, clinical exam, BNP > 50,000, and admission CXR suggestive of fluid overload, it was thought that the etiology of the pt's SOB was secondary to a diastolic CHF exacerbation.
He had been previously admitted to the hospital just 4 days PTA with similar complaints of SOB that was also associated with a cough, and was diuresed and treated with antibiotics for a community acquired pneumonia.
The pt had just completed a 7 day course of abx for treatment of CAP prior to admission and given his lack of clinical symptoms suggestive of PNA, including fever and cough, he was not continued to antibiotics.
Thus, the cardiology service was consulted who agreed with the team's assessment that the pt's diastolic HF was likely [**2-15**] HTN and exacerbated by poorly controlled BPs at home along with his known [**1-15**]+ MR.
Omron Blood Pressure Cuff   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diastolic CHF HTN Pancreatic CA s/p subtotal pancreatectomy, XRT, chemo MDS DM II   Discharge Condition: Good, eating low Na diet, ambulating, breathing well on room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath and were found to have elevated blood pressures and increased fluid in your lungs, caused by diastolic heart failure.
