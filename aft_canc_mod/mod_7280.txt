Briefly, Ms [**Known lastname 107532**] began having a chronic cough and some hemoptysis this past [**Month (only) **].
Workup for this included a CT scan, which revealed a large (6cm) cavitary lesion.
She underwent extensive evaluation for possible metastatic disease including head MRI, PetCT and bronchoscopy, however although Pet revealed markedly FDG avid right lower lobe mass with a satellite nodule, transbronchial biopsy and washings were non diagnostic.
Patient was electively admitted today to have repeat rigid bronchoscopy with FNA of lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.
Patient was extubated without difficulty however she remained hypoxic and is still requiring supplemental oxygen.
Patient denies any pain, but reports being slightly disoriented still.
Has a heavy cough and reports some difficulty breathing, no nausea.
Past Medical History: CAD Diastolic Dysfunction Low anterior resection [**2146**] for complicated diverticular disease  HTN Hyperlipidemia Vasculitis?
Lower extremity neuropathy   Social History: Ex smoker, 20 pack year history.

No pneumothorax seen.
Patient initially did well on oxygen by facemask with diuresis, but on [**3-22**] patient had increased respiratory distress associated with ventricular tachycardia, and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was extubated the following day, but had respiratory distress again on [**3-25**] requiring reintubation.
Several family meetings were held during the course of her hospitalization, and with lack of progress and continued dependence on mechanical ventialtion, consistent with the patients previsously expressed wishes that long term mechanical ventilation was not acceptable quality of life, she was terminally extubated.
# Ventricular Tachycardia.
Completed amiodarone drip but continued to have NSVT, which resolved following repositioning of a central venous catheter on [**3-26**].
# RLL mass: Squamous cell on bronch biopsy.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**3-25**] for radiation therapy.
# NSTEMI/CAD: Ruled in by troponin (peaked at 0.25) on [**3-22**] with flat CK.
TTE showed anterior wall motion abnormalities and depressed EF with MR 2+.
Presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with florid pulmonary edema and effusions.
This was related to new, acute systolic dysfunction from anterior NSTEMI compounded by 2+MR .
With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor factors.
