Left bundle-branch block.
Probable left atrial abnormality.
There are bibasal effusions present.
There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
The appearances are suggestive of mild CHF.
GU U/S ([**9-23**]): Bladder with diffusely thickened and irregular wall.
This is associated with symmetric bilateral moderate hydronephrosis.
TTE ([**9-24**]): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional dysfunction c/w CAD vs. conduction system disease/BBB.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Upper ext Duplex U/S ([**9-24**]): Patent bilateral subclavian veins and bilateral brachial arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Acute Renal Failure: Patient was transferred from OSH with acute renal failure and found to have an enlarged prostate (homogeneous, smooth, no nodules) with FENa and FE urea c/w postrenal ARF.
On foley insertion, he had relief of obstruction with significant post-obstructive diruesis.
Nephrology was consulted and he was treated with kayexalate for hyperkalemia in the ICU given peaked T waves on ECG and widened QRS.
Renal U/S showed bilateral hydronephrosis and an enlarged thickened bladder.
He continued to have post-obstructive diuresis, up to net negative 5L / 24hrs, as well as gradual improvement in creatinine.
He was initially kept on maintenance 1/2 NS to prevent dehydration, and when tried off IV fluids, developed orthostatic hypotension with presyncope.
Admission SBP was 200 without symptoms.
As he remained hypertensive to SBP 160-180, metoprolol was started and titrated to 100mg daily.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, likely due to his renal disease.
4) Systolic HF: TTE done due to volume overload showed LVH with inferior wall hypokinesis and EF of 35-40%.
The hypokinesis may be due to his known LBBB versus ischemia.
Furthermore, his systolic dysfunction may have been secondary to his renal dysfunction and fluid retention.
He was started on ASA and a beta-blocker, as above, but not an ACE-I due to his acute renal failure.
Disp:*1 tube* Refills:*0*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute renal failure Hypertension Anemia  Secondary: Enlarged prostate   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath and leg swelling.
We found that your prostate was obstructing the flow of urine, leading to kidney damage and your symptoms.
Your kidney function is slowly improving, and your swelling has come down significantly.
