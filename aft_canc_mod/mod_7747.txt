The son reports she complained of left cheek pain so severe that she could not eat and loss about 30lbs in 6 weeks.
A MRI Brain from [**10/2118**] did not show any lesion or infection.
Past Medical History: Breast Cancer s/p mastectomy, w/mets (liver lesions seen on last staging imaging but patient did not want to biopsy).
Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, unable to participate fully in exam Orientation: Unable to assess secondary to aphasia Language: Expressive aphasia, nonsensical speech Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to 1.5 mm bilaterally.
Extensive occlusive thrombosis involving the right lower extremity deep veins extending from the calf veins to the level of the common femoral vein.
No DVT in the left lower extremity deep veins.
[**12-7**] NCHCT- IMPRESSION: High density demonstrated in the region of the known ring-enhancing lesion centered in the left temporal lobe compatible with a component of post-biopsy parenchymal hemorrhage.
There is a larger region of high attenuation throughout the left temporal lobe which either may represent delayed hyperenhancement and/or a component of hemorrhage.
[**12-8**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Persistent though collapsed area of rim enhancement demonstrated with central hypoattenuation and surrounding edema centered within the left temporal lobe after known aspiration.
No evidence of interval hemorrhage.
[**2118-12-7**] CXR Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcification in aortic arch is present.
A skinfold in the right upper lateral lung should not be confused for pneumothorax.
Focal dense calcification in the left lateral aspect of upper neck is probably within the carotid artery.
Small left pleural effusion  [**2118-12-9**] Video Swallow 1.

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
Lower extremity duplexes were also performed revealing an extensive clot in her right leg.
Post op Head CT revealed no hemorrhage.
Head CT with contrast on [**12-8**] revealed partial resolution of abscess with peristent edema.
A PICC line was requested in anticipation of long term antibiotics and lack of venous access.
The patient was anxious throughout the day and given 0.5 ativan with good relief of anxiety.
