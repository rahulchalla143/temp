Following this she developed severe N/V and was unable to keep any fluid down.
On [**3-21**] when she presented to the OSH, with these symptoms and shortness of breath.
She was found to have pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Bronchoscopy revealed a intraluminal lesion in her right main bronchus with almost complete obstruction.
As she continued to have shortness of breath and high oxygen requirement, she was transferred back to the ICU on [**2139-3-30**].
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient able to speak in [**3-19**] word sentences but overtly tachypnic with minimal exertion.
Continues to have pain along lower left breast after thoracotomy.
Also intermittently feels like 'having a panic attack' with increased shortness of breath and rapid breathing.
Sister with noncancerous cysts removed.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam VS: 97.2, 117, 104/73, 35 and 100/NRB GEN: Appears calm at rest but HEENT:  NCAT, NRB in place, mouth breathing CV:  Tachycardia, regular, without murmur PULM:  Course breath sound with more bronchial breath sounds on right; thoracotomy incision with dressing clean, dry, intact and no erythema or exudate ABD:  Mildly distended, nontender with minimal bowel sounds LIMBS:  WWP without edema SKIN:  With some eccymoses on abdomen, no erthyema around PIVs NEURO:  A&O x 3 .
CXR [**2139-3-30**]: Homogeneous opacity of the right hemithorax with mild rightward mediastinal and tracheal shift , with abrupt cutoff of the right main bronchus is concerning for right hilar mass lesion with collapse of the right lung.
Two highly atypical cells in a background of mesothelial  	cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.
CT chest with contrast [**2139-3-31**]: 1)large right hilar mass which infiltrates the collapsed right middle and lower lobes and obstructs the right main stem bronchus just beyond its takeoff.
contiguous with extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy 2) large right and moderate left pleural effusion and large pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Brief RA invaginaiton is seen (evidence of elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt tamponade present).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are pericardial calcifications.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left atrial abnormality.
Low limb lead voltage.
These findings may represent anterolateral ischemic process.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Bilateral LENI: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the lower extremities bilaterally .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic valve bioprosthesis with higher than expected transaortic gradient which may be due to hyperdynamic left ventricular function.
No prior studies for comparison.
Female patient w/ metastatic NSCLC s/p 6 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]-alimta-erbiltix, taxotere with disease progression transferred from OSH w/ pericardial/pleural effusion, RML/RLL collapse [**12-16**] tumour burden s/p rigid bronch with debridement, several pericardial windows/drain placement, pleuredesis.
NSCLC/pericardial effusion: Pt has undergone 6 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]-alimta-erbiltix, now on taxotere but with continued disease progression.
Found to have an intraluminal lesion in her right main bronchus with almost complete obstruction of the RML and RLL for which she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with some tumor debridement and recanualization.
Patient also received XRT with original plan to shrink tumor enough to allow possible stenting by IP.
However, patient had recurrent pericardial effusion due to malignancy.
Despite this intervention, the patient's respiratory status worsened, repeat TTE showed persistent posterior loculated effusion with persistent tamponade physiology.
SOB/hypoxia - likely multifactorial.
Patient has pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and obstructive lung malignancy.
Possibly due to stress reaction from pleurodesis or surgery.
Also has a Proteus and Klebsiella UTI for which she was treated with ciprofloxacin for a 7 day course.
Depression - pt was continued on celexa  #.
The patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**4-12**] with rates to 170s.
Returned to sinus rhythm with carotid sinus massage.
Digoxin was initially loaded, but his was discontinued due to patient's preference for comfort care and maintenance of sinus rhythm.
