Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with multiple GI surgeries including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with bile duct injury, total gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and splenectomy, was initially admitted with malaise and fevers, found to have PICC line sepsis; during this admission, patient had a fall from bed with subsequent rib fractures and hemothorax, which required chest tube drainage and VATS/decortication for reaccumulation/loculation.
This hospitalization was also complicated by anemia, UTI, delirium and thrombocytosis.
Active Issues: # PICC line sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria on admission with fevers to 102, WBC 19 and tachycardia, along with a confirmed site of infection in his PICC line.
TTE showed no valvular vegetations.
The Interventional Pulmonology team inserted a chest tube for drainage on [**9-24**], and it was subsequently removed by the Thoracic Surgery team on [**10-3**].
Chest tube placement and removal was complicated by a minimal pneumothorax.
After removal of the tube, the patient continued to have intermittent fevers and periods of hypotension that were responsive to IV fluid boluses.
On follow-up imaging of the chest, he was noted to have reaccumulation of his effusion with loculations, unable to be drained by IP.
There was minimal blood loss during the surgery.
The patient felt that his breathing and pain was much improved following the surgery .
# Nutrition/cachexia: Ongoing problem for this patient secondary to his prior gastrectomy.
During this admission, the patient tolerated PO diet well along with nutritional supplements.
However, out of concern for his malnutrition, per his outpatient providers, the patient was further supplemented with TPN for ten days, while he had an indwelling PICC for antibiotic therapy.
He is also not a candidate for J-tube placement.
# Anemia: Over the course of this admission, the patient experienced slowly downtrending hematocrit from continued bleed into his left pleural space.
# UTI: Patient was noted to have a UA positive for 111 WBC, without any growth on culture, along with increased frequency of urination.
This was attributed to acute medical issues and pain medications.
Lithium level was WNL; he was not hypoglycemic during episodes of delirium.
After treatment of bacteremia completed and the patient underwent VATS/decortication, his mental status improved and subsequently remained stable.
# Thrombocytosis: Thrombocytosis to peak of ~ 1.5 million was thought to be an acute reaction in response to his infection and hemothorax.
JAK2 sent off for possible myeloproliferative disorder,  as he has also had chronic leukocytosis and anemia.
Chronic issues: # Anxiety/BPD/ADHD: Documented history of these problems.
The patient was extremely anxious during this admission, likely secondary to multiple medical problems.

Secondary diagnoses: Hemothorax Left 9th and 10th rib fractures Loculated pleural effusion reactive thrombocytosis depression/ anxiety   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with a fever and overall malaise, and were found to have bacteria in your bloodstream from your indwelling peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.
You were found to have three bacteria growing in your blood: Escherischia coli, Entercoccus and Stenotrophomonoas.
The Interventional Pulmonology team drained this blood with a chest tube, but it reaccumulated and developed fibrotic pockets, which required surgical treatment.
You did very well during the surgery with minimal blood loss.
Afterwards, your breathing and pain improved.
START using a Lidocaine patch as needed for rib pain.
Clonazepam was reduced from 1 mg by mouth twice a day as needed for anxiety to 0.5 mg by mouth twice a day as needed for anxiety.
Diazepam was reduced from 5 mg by mouth three times a day as needed for anxiety to 2 mg three times a day as needed for anxiety.
Sennosides (Senna) was increased from 8.6 mg by mouth daily for constipation to 8.6 mg by mouth twice daily for constipation.
Your dose of Oxycodone has temporarily been increased from 5 mg by mouth every eight hours as needed for pain to 5 mg by mouth every six hours as needed for pain.
If you feel that your pain has improved, you may return to your original home regimen.
