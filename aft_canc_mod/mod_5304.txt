man with a history of COPD, HTN and recurrent NSCLC presenting with hemoptysis.
On the evening prior to admission, the patient had multiple episodes of hemoptysis with bloody sputum.
The patient went to sleep and awoke at 5AM with further bloody sputum production.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have stable vital signs with a stable hematocrit and radiographic evidence of progression of his known RUL mass.
The patient was initially diagnosed approximately 30 years ago with non-small cell lung cancer and underwent a Left upper lobectomy at that time.
He was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 359**] with hemoptysis requiring intubation, found to have a new RUL mass and underwent bronchoscopy with laser excision found on pathology to be undifferentiated large cell CA.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a PE without DVT's and was discharged on lovenox.
Staging screening revealed locally advanced disease with Right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
PET and CT did reveal other lesions including renal and splenic masses felt to not be consistent with metastatic disease.
The patient underwent pre-op evaluation including outpatient stress testing.
The patient presented to an OSH on [**2160-9-5**] with massive hemoptysis requiring intubation.
Bronchospopy revealed obstructive lesion of the Right mainstem due to a RUL tumor.
The patient underwent tumor excision with rigid bronchoscopy.
Pathology revealed undifferentiated large cell CA.
PET scan from [**2160-10-2**] demonstrates an FDG avid right hilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, there was an unusual focus of FDG uptake and soft tissues prominence along the left posterior psoas of unclear significance.
He had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**2160-9-14**], which demonstrated pulmonary embolus, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, ground glass and consolidative opacities concerning for hemorrhage, marked scarring and emphysema in the right upper lobe, nonspecific pulmonary nodules, several subcentimeter vague hypoattenuating foci in the liver, a large 3 to 4 cm nonspecific lesion in the spleen, and a 30 mm lesion along the lower pole of the left kidney.
A [**Year (4 digits) 500**] scan on [**2160-9-15**] showed no definitive evidence for metastatic disease.
An MRI of the head on [**2160-9-14**] showed no evidence of intracranial metastases.
PMH: CAD status post three angioplasties, with the last requiring stenting all of which occurred approximately 13 years ago.
Patient underwent recent stress test as part of pre-op eval for possible lung mass excision.
HTN COPD  Social History: Lives with family and worked 25 years as a plumber.
Integumentary: No rashes or lesions.
No acute ST or T wave changes.
Increase in size of right hilar enhancing mass with probable extension into the right main stem bronchus.
This results in partial occlusion of the right main stem bronchus, but there are no postobstructive changes.
Near complete resolution of right lower lobe airspace opacities seen on the prior examination.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
The possible filling defect in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery has resolved.
Unchanged appearance of emphysematous and fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe.
Portable CXR ([**2160-10-20**]): Near complete resolution of right lower lobe consolidation, with unchanged right upper lobe opacities.
Right hilar neoplastic mass slightly increased on the concurrent CT. .
FDG avid right hilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The location of this lesion is not typical of metastatic disease.
FDG uptake associated with a previously described indeterminate 13 mm left renal lesion, along the left lower pole.
The FDG uptake heightens concern for a solid nodule such as a renal cell carcinoma.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**2160-9-15**]): No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
MRI ([**2160-9-14**]):  No evidence of intracranial metastasis.
[**Month/Day/Year **] Scan ([**2160-9-15**]): No definite evidence for osseous metastases.
Appearance raising concern for the possibility of a pulmonary embolus in a right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary artery, although indeterminate.
Bibasilar mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities, which given their recent onset, are most suspicious for an infection, inflammation, or in the appropriate clinical setting, hemorrhage.
Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, for which short-term followup is recommended.
Several subcentimeter vague hypoattenuating foci in the liver which are nonspecific.
Metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
Large 3-4 cm nonspecific lesion in the spleen.
A 13 mm lesion along the lower pole of the left kidney with indeterminate characteristics and too small to characterize here.
man with a history of COPD, HTN and recurrent NSCLC presenting with hemoptysis.
# Hemoptysis secondary to the patient's known RUL mass with bronchus involvement.
On most recent admission, the patient suffered significant bleeding requiring intubation for airway protection.
Pt underwent rigid bronchoscopy and argon ablation for neovascularization in the right mainstem bronchi.
After the procedure, the patient had small amounts of blood tinged sputum which resolved one day after the procedure.
# Lung mass.
Bronchoscopy for visualization of bleed and mass, biopsies were to rule out a bronchogenic component of the cancer.
The patient is without signs of PE on today's CTA.
# HTN.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right upper lobe mass Left lung mass Hypertension Coronary artery disease COPD   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Return to the emergency department for persisent cough, worsening blood in sputum, weakness, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms.
Because of the bleeding with your cough, we have stopped your lovenox injections.
Our interventional radiologists recommend the following: You should begin chemo-radiation urgently, please consult with your oncologist about this therapy You should also be considered for possible photodynamic therapy.
