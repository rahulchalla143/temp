History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old male who had history of sigmoid colon cancer s/p sigmoid colectomy in [**2190-4-17**].
Patient was found to have postive lesions on a PET scan in [**Month (only) 116**] and a follow up CT scan in [**2190-7-18**] showed a 6.2x5.2 cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver at segment VII and a 2.9x2.4 cm lesion at the junction of the right and middle hepatic veins in the caudate lobe.
Family History: Father who died at the age of 76 of a bleeding ulcer, and a brother who died secondary to alcohol disease.
NECK: Supple, left IJ CV: irregularly irregular no murmurs no rub LUNGS: B rhonchi ABD: Distended, minimal BS, subcostal incision c/d/i.
Left hepatic artery has elevated resistive index of 0.8 with a brisk upstroke.
[**10-24**] CXR: NGT in place [**10-24**] US RUQ: patent L portal vein [**10-25**] CXR: Increase in right pleural effusion and atelectasis as well as left retrocardiac density representing atelectasis and/or pneumonia [**10-26**] CT Head unchanged from previous [**10-26**] MRI head: most likely hepatic encephalopathy [**10-26**] Liver US: patent vasculature [**10-27**] Renal US: symmetric arterial flow, no hydronephrosis [**10-30**] CT liver triphasic venogram: hypoenhancing segment II and partially segment III, narrowing of the main portal vein adjacent to the suture site for the right portal vein, patent hepatic artery, left portal vein, diffusely hypoenhancing colon consistent with colitis [**11-2**] Liver US: Flow in the left portal vein remains hepatofugal.
Given his change in mental status, the decision was made to transferred patient to SICU on [**10-24**] for observation and work-up of his mental status change.
On arrival, patient was mildly confused.
He was mildly to moderately lethargic but oriented to self and time with some promting.
On [**10-25**] the patient had worsening mental status and became obtunded and required intubation.
Large amount of purulent sputum suctioned out in intubation.
He was hypertensive in the 200's which was treated with lopressor and hydralazine but then became hypotensive after propofol bolus/gtt.
He [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] a duplex US which showed patent hepatic vasculature with no biliary dilatation and no hepatic collection.
They recommended EEG to evalute seizures vs. hepatic encephalopathy and holding propofol.
In evening pt witnessed to have 2 episodes of tonic-clonic seizure.
MRI non-revealing diffuse diffusion weighted imaging abnormality in bifrontal cortex.
Patient developed NSVT and was cardioverted Dilt gtt started.
Pt became agitated, hypertensive, overbreathing vent.
On [**10-28**] pt had persistently flat EEG tracings consistent with sedation vs "brain death" per neurology.
He went into rapid afib requiring cardioversion, and started on dilt gtt w/ good effect.
Given one unit prbc, 4 FFP for elevated INR w/ bolt in place.
Off sedation/paralytics still only exam was +corneals/PERRLA, no gag, no movement.
Switched to meropenem and recultured for elevated WBC.
More likely liver failure or DIC.
Episode of a-fib with RVR (HR 160) converted with metoprolol 5 mg IV x 4 and diltiazem 10 mg. Demand ischemia with trop 1.44.
At night, episode of arhythmias (SVT, bigeminy/trigeminy/quadrigeminy, ectopy) with hypotension requiring neo gtt @ 2, resistant to metoprolol 5 mg IV x 2, diltiazem 10 mg x 2, DC cardioversion x 4 (50, 50, 100, 100 J) with transient conversion to NSR x 20-30 seconds, amio bolus 150 mg, amio gtt, c/b arrest for 7s.
Consulted cardiology, recommended holding nodal agents, leaving anti-arhythmic, likely arhythmia secondary to metabolic disorder.
Final ECG showed no acute ST segment changes.
