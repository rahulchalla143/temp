HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2158**], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who had a recent colonoscopy in [**2165-5-30**] with three polypectomies who had been doing well post procedure and presented to the Emergency Department on [**7-16**] with black stools times 10 to 12 days and increasing fatigue.
The patient also admits to periods of episodic confusion but no bright red blood per rectum.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2158**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2158**].
High cholesterol.
History of polio, question of bulbar polio.
Colonic polyps status post polypectomy times three in mid [**2165-5-30**].
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of urinary incontinence.
General:  Well-appearing, slightly confused but oriented in no acute distress.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen slightly distended, non-tender, bowel sounds slightly decreased.
No costovertebral angle tenderness.
Rectal examination showed occult blood positive in the Emergency Department.
Skin:  No rashes.
Patient had slurred speech.
Patient was found to have positive asterixis.
Urinalysis was negative for infection.
RADIOLOGY:  Renal ultrasound performed showed a distended bladder, some simple kidney cysts.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no acute infiltrates and slight cardiomegaly.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 86 with flat T-waves.
No new EKG changes.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient had 10-12 days of melena with a history of recent colonoscopy and polypectomies.
The stomach had a submucosal nodule of 5 mm of benign appearance in the antrum.
No lesion was seen that could have been responsible for patient's melena.
He bled intermittently with melanotic to maroon liquid stools with clots requiring up to five units of blood within one 24 hour period.
A repeat colonoscopy was performed on [**8-5**] to assess for signs of bleeding.
The patient was found to have a small rectal polyp and a 5 cm ulcerated bleeding mass at the ileocecal valve.
Multiple myeloma:  The patient was thought to be in acute renal failure in the Emergency Department.
He also received five treatments of plasmapheresis in order to decrease the load of light chains in the serum.
The Hematology/Oncology Team considered adding another [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to the patient's chemotherapeutic regimen, however, due to the patient's hemodynamic instability and continuous gastrointestinal bleeding, no other [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was added.
The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy which showed 50% plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow.
Acute renal failure:  The patient was found to be in acute renal failure upon presentation to the Emergency Department.
This was found to be secondary to myeloma kidney and overwhelming light chain protein load on the patient's kidneys.
The patient's renal failure continued throughout his admission.
Coagulopathy:  Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he developed a coagulopathy.
He has had a rising PTT, PT and slightly elevated INR.
This was found to be secondary to the plasmapheresis and the patient was treated with subcu and oral vitamin K.  He was given fresh frozen plasma and the last two sessions of plasmapheresis were followed by fresh frozen plasma transfusions.
In addition, the patient was found to have a thrombocytopenia which was also felt to be related to his increased bleeding.
The decreased platelets were felt to be secondary to nutrition, uremic platelets and bone marrow infiltration.
Tachycardia:  On [**8-7**] the patient was found to be tachycardic while at hemodialysis.
An EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia consistent with new onset atrial fibrillation.
