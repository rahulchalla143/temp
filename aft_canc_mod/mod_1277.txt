Admission Date:  [**2154-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-8-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: During Code: Intubation Femoral Central Line Transvenous pacing Arterial Line  History of Present Illness: 74 yo diabetic male with metastatic renal cancer involving the lung and liver on avastin, prostate cancer, a history of PE, and no known heart disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] with 1 day of non-specific fatigue and malaise subsequently found to have an I-STEMI, and who now presents to the CCU s/p 2 BM stents to ostial and distal RCA stensoses and intra-catheterization vagally induced hypotension in the setting of acute kidney injury.
He has felt unwell with fatigue and malaise since he underwent CT-scan last Monday.
Notes that he felt particularly unwell Wednesday and that on Friday, the day prior to admission, he had a presyncopal event, which he describes as feeling weak in the legs while he was walking to the bathroom in his home; he lost his balance and hit his forehead against the wall but did not lose consciousness.
He retired to bed, where he remained for the rest of the day and awoke the day of admission with fatigue and malaise.
During the interval between when he was presyncopal to when he presented to the ED, he had no chest tightness or heaviness, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, vomiting.
He also denies orthopnea, PND, or dependent edema.
At baseline he can climb 2 flights of stairs to his apartment without significant exertional dyspnea.
Mild reciprocal ST depression in aVL and V3 Acute since prior EKG.
A bare metal stent was successfully deployed in each of the lesions; DES were deferred in the setting of the patient's metastatic cancer and potential bleeding risk on longterm anticoagulation.
The procedure was complicated by an episode of fluid responsive hypotension due to vagal stimulation.
He continued on a renally dosed integrilin gtt for 6 hours post cath and was started on medical management for acute coronary syndrome with ASA 325, plavix 75, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], and atorvastatin 80.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Quiet heart sounds.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi anteriorly.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates two vessel disease.
The right coronary artery has a  proximal 70 % stenosis, as well as a 99% lesion in the distal RCA just after the PDA bifurcation.
The circumflex artery has a 60% lesion distally.
Limited hemodynamics demonstrated mild hypotension that responded to one liter fluid bolus.
Successful PTCA and stenting of distal RCA subtotal occlusion with 2.0x18mm Mini Vision bare metal stent.
Systemic hypotension during the case, that responded to intravenous fluid bolus.
Acute inferior/posterior STE myocardial infarction.
Successful PCI of distal RCA subtotal occlusion with BMS.
Successful PCI of proximal RCA stenosis with BMS.
[**9-29**] Renal U/S: No acute renal pathology.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = <20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis/akinesis.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post-TPA infusion, there is no change.
Brief Hospital Course: Inferior STEMI: 74 yo diabetic male with metastatic renal cancer involving the lung and liver on avastin, prostate cancer, a history  of PE, and no known heart disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] with 1 day of non-specific fatigue and malaise subsequently found to have an I-STEMI.
He presented to the CCU s/p 2 BM stents to ostial and distal RCA stensoses and intra-catheterization vagally induced hypotension in the setting of acute kidney injury.
Presented with essentially no specific symptomatology, noting instead to have 1 week of vague malaise and fatigue punctuated by an episode of presyncope the day prior to admission.
CK/MB and Troponins were positive in the setting of STE changes in the inferior leads with reciprocal changes across the precordium; CKMB peaked the day of admission and was low in comparison to the Troponins in absolute value, suggesting that the STEMI was missed and may have occurred a week ago.
The etiology of the STEMI is thought to be a thromboembolic event due to Avastin, which is known to put patients at risk for these phenomena.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Pt found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which is likely multifactorial - due to pre-renal (FeNA<1%), post-renal, and intra-renal pathophysiology; responded well to an empiric fluid challenge and bladder scan was revealing of bladder outflow obstruction, prompting placement of a foley; UA showed casts concerning for contrast nephropathy after a heavy dye load recently (a CT for re-staging of his cancer) and catheterization.
Bedside emergent echo revealed thrombus in right atrium suggestive of possible large PE.
