Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 23050**] is a 58 yo male with past medical history significant for Hodgkin's disease s/p splenectomy, CAD, and hypothyroidism who presents with babesiosis & Lyme disease.
#.Babesiosis: Mr. [**Known lastname 23050**] was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 2292**] with diagnosis of babesiosis complaining of fevers, rigors, myalgias and headache.
He presented with thrombocytopenia to 64, abnormal LFTs, and elevated bilirubin.
Within 12 hours of admission, patient's parasitemia level increased from 4.7% to 8.8%.
ID recommended RBC exchange transfusion given asplenia and rising parasitemia.
After receiving 15.5 units of blood, patient suddenly developed chills, rigors, and a temperature of 99F.
Pathology investigation was most consistent with a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction.
His fever, headache and myalgias resolved.
However, post-trasfusion, the patient had a persistent leukocytosis and rising transaminitis.
Although leukocytosis persisted until discharge, the level remained stable and was most likely attributed to a reaction to steriods or an inflammatory response to RBC exchange.
ID consult suggested elevated LFT could be a natural progression of infection (see below for details) or a side effect of antibiotics, since atovaquone has a known risk of hepatotoxicity and azithromycin is hepatically metabolized.
Skin lesion: Patient reported a dark, atypical lesion on left clavicle.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
