Admission Date:  [**2130-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-1-22**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Haloperidol / Percocet  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**] Chief Complaint: Hematuria .
Continuous bladder irrigation.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 20899**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with PMH significant for DM, BPH s/p TURP, and remote low grade TCC s/p resection, who presents with a chief complaint of gross hematuria.
He had previously been in his USOH until he began to have blood in his urine last night.
He denies dysuria, changes in frequency of urination, difficulty voiding, pain with voiding, or abdominal pain.
He had a urinary tract infection several months ago which presented with hematuria.
He denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain.
In the ED, the patient had a urinalysis, which showed trace leukocytes, large blood, and few bacteria.
A BP was not able to be obtained initially, but he had 2+ bilateral pedal pulses.
The decision was made with the MICU team to get an EKG, which did not show new ST changes compared with an old EKG.
CAD - s/p MI in [**2109**] tx with lytic therapy and rescue angioplasty 2.
Hypertension 7.
Hypercholesterolemia 8.
L hip replacement [**2119**] c/b femur fx with "slipped prosthetic"  [**2127**] 9.
Dementia - baseline AAO x 1 .
Physical Exam: Vitals: 98.2 F 55 148/70 16 95% RA General: elderly, well-appearing male in NAD, appears stated age  Lungs: clear anteriorally at bases Cardiovascular: normal rate, regular rhythm Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended GU: white patches on scrotum, foley in place, draining reddish urine Extremity: no edema .
[**1-12**] CXR (AP): No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**1-15**] CXR (AP): No appreciable change.
Mild blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles.
Filling defect within the bladder may represent clot or recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma.
Mild aspiration pneumonia.
Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine.
There is poor epiglottic deflection and no laryngeal elevation.
Penetration was seen both before and during administration of nectar thick liquids.
There was premature spillover during the oral phase due to loss of bolus control and swallowing delay.
IMPRESSION: Multiple episodes of penetration with several episodes of microaspiration with all consistencies of barium.
Low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, no lamina propria invasion seen.
Muscularis propria present.
## Hemorrhagic cystitis: The patient was admitted with hematuria and continued to have significant hematuria during most of the admission.
CT urogram was concerning for possible recurrence of TCC (showed filling defect in the bladder).
# Troponinemia/CAD: He had a troponin leak in the ICU with peak of 0.21.
This likely represented demand ischemia in the setting of vasovagal syncope (during BM), UTI, and anemia secondary to acute blood loss from hematuria.
He had no new EKG changes.
He did have one episode of chest pain prior to the initial troponin leak, however this was felt unlikely to be ACS given transient nature and no EKG changes.
## Hypotension: He had several episodes of transient hypotension during this admission.
The first resulted in a code blue (as above) when he became hypotensive to the 60s and unresponsive while on the commode; likely a vasovagal episode.
Later, he again became hypotensive to the 60s 1-2 hours after manual bladder irrigation.
Given the hypotension and his leukocytosis there was concern for developing urosepsis and he was transferred to the MICU.
He had one further episode of hypotension, again with SBP transiently to the 60s 2 hours after manual bladder irrigation.
These episodes were most likely related to blood loss from his bladder vs vasovagal response to the fluid shifts with bladder irrigation.
## Cough/Wheeze/Hypoxia: The patient became wheezy at times with productive cough and intermittent transient hypoxia.
This was most likely related to mucous plugging vs mild CHF.
He would occasionally desaturate intermittently to low 90s but improve with suctioning of mucous plug.
There was also concern for a possible aspiration event.
He did have a leukocytosis with WBC up to 15-16, however he remained afebrile.
He was treated with ceftriaxone for empiric UTI coverage (as above) and this was felt sufficient to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia.
## Altered Mental Status: Per his sons, the patient has a history of delirium and agitation when hospitalized.
He did have several episodes of delirium and agitation, requiring restraints at time.
## Acute renal failure: On admission, his creatinine was elevated to 1.5.
This was likely pre-renal renal failure.
## Acute on chronic systolic CHF (EF 20-25%).
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Recurrent bladder transitional cell carcinoma Secondary: 1) CHF 2) CAD 3) Acute renal failure 4) Diabetes mellitus, Type 2 .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with blood in your urine and low blood pressure.
While in the hospital you had a mild "silent" heart attack, which was felt to be due to strain on your heart from the significant amount of blood loss in your urine.
You had a cystoscopy that revealed extensive bladder cancer as the cause for your hematuria.
You were also treated with antibiotics for possible urinary tract infection.
