Admission Date: [**2178-1-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2178-2-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-15**]        Sex:  M  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 70-year-old male with extensive locally recurrent melanoma involving his face, status post excision, neck dissection and radiation therapy.
Initial staging was consistent with stage III C disease but now with mets to the lung, bone and soft tissue.
He was due to be started on high-dose IL-2 but in clinic on [**2178-1-12**], he was noticed to have erythema in an area of recent lymph node dissection felt consistent with cellulitis, and was started on oral Keflex, and now is presenting with worsening erythema.
The patient reports that in the week since he started antibiotics, the erythema has enlarged and become more red.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, metastatic melanoma with original diagnosis in [**2177-6-5**].
On [**2177-8-28**] he had re-excision of the left temple and cheek area and a left radical neck dissection, with melanoma in 7 of 69 total lymph nodes.
He then developed soft tissue nodule superior to the graft, that might have represented residual melanoma and appeared to have reduced in size with radiation.
In late [**2177-10-6**] a PET CT showed increased glucose uptake at sites of surgery on his thigh and around the superior edge of the graft on his face.
Follow up head MRI and torso CT on [**2178-1-7**] revealed no metastatic brain lesions, but metastatic disease in his chest, left axilla, mediastinum and lung, as well as a T12 sclerotic focus felt consistent with melanoma.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No signs of wound dehiscence.
Broad area of erythema and corresponding area warm to touch.
No palpable masses or fluid collections.
No cervical, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  No dullness to percussion and clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with cellulitis and was placed on IV vancomycin.
He also became short of breath and was treated with Lasix.
Transthoracic echo revealed diastolic heart failure and he was continued on enalapril and Lasix.
Blood cultures remained negative and he was afebrile throughout this time.
Derm consult on [**1-28**] was obtained due to persistent rash, and a biopsy was performed consistent with melanoma.
During this week he received 7 of 14 doses with 7 doses held related to tachycardia and pulmonary edema.
On treatment day #4, he was tachypneic with hypoxia to the mid 80s.
Chest x- ray was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions.
Throughout the day he became increasingly more tachypneic and fatigued, and was transferred to the ICU.
An echocardiogram on [**2178-2-3**] showed a small pericardial effusion with question tamponade physiology.
He underwent a cardiac MRI on [**2178-2-4**] revealing no cardiac metastases and no tamponade physiology.
Physical therapy consult was initiated and he was ambulating short distances with a steady gait.
Other side effects related to IL-2 included rigors improved with Demerol; fatigue; and hypotension on treatment day 3, requiring fluid boluses.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.0 with associated oliguria.
He developed metabolic acidosis with a minimum bicarb of 18, improved with bicarbonate boluses.
IV fluids were continued given acute renal failure.
During this week he had mild ST elevation to 54, which improved prior to discharge.
He had no hyperbilirubinemia, myocarditis or coagulopathy noted.
He was thrombocytopenic to a platelet count low of 68,000 without evidence of bleeding.
He was anemic and was transfused with packed red blood cells with discharge hemoglobin of 9.1.
Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1, week 1, high-     dose IL-2 therapy complicated by pulmonary edema, and     bilateral pleural effusions from IL-2 induced capillary     leak, with respiratory distress.
Acute renal failure related to IL-2 therapy.
