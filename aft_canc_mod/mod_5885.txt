No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
The LAD had diffuse proximal calcific disease with serial 60-80% stenoses.
The LCX system was notable for slow flow in a subtotally occluded bifurcating OM2; the AV-groove LCX was a small vessel without significant stenoses.
