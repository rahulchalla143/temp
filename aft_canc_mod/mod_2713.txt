Admission Date:  [**2181-6-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-2-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5062**] Chief Complaint: Admitted [**6-12**] to ENT for embolization of R occipital artery prior to biopsy of rapidly growing R paraspinal neck mass   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Chemoembolization of R occipital artery, biopsy R neck mass - Bronchoscopy x 2 - Trach [**6-27**], PEG  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28181**] experienced R neck pain for several months prior to admission, as well as a rapidly growing mass for 1 month.
He lost 10 pounds in the previous few months, and his appetite decreased, but no fever or night sweats.
Prior to admission, CT scan of the neck revealed a hypervascular paraspinal mass (originally 4.8x4.5, 2 wks ago now 7.4x6.3cm).
Pathology of the neck mass (prelim) with poorly differentiated carcinoma presumed to be [**2-28**] head/neck malginancy.
Also noted to have mild post-procedure hypoxia but was stable on 3L NC until night of [**6-16**] when hypoxia abruptly worsened accompanied by [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respiration and tachypnea requiring 6L then NRB, admitted to MICU for intubation.
He was hypotensive on propofol and required 100% FiO2 for 7.39/32/64.
Paradoxical motion of chest was noted and due to a CXR with elevated R hemdiaphragm, concerning for RL collapse, bronchoscopy was performed and significant secretions removed.
Repeat CXR did not reveal much improvement.
diaphragmatic weakness 2/2 phrenic nerve involvement and altered mental status.
On [**6-27**], pt was trached [**2-28**] concern for airway compromise given neck mass.
On vanc/zosyn, pt's WBC fell rapidly and pt became neutropenic.
He continued to have fevers while he was neutropenic so he was changed to caspo, cefepime, flagyl and vanco.
He was then changed to linezolid for gram pos coverage and he became pancytopenic.
Caspo was stopped on [**7-7**] because he was no longer neutropenic and there was a concern for drug fever.
On [**7-12**], pt's wbc again dropped (consistent with chemo) and he had a fever to 102.2 so cefepime and flagyl were restarted.
Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive during intubation, likely due to propofol.
LP was done and cytology negative for malignant cells.
Sedating meds were stopped and his mental status cleared.
MRI of brain and CT torso without evidence of mets.
On [**7-2**], pt underwent bronchoscopy with subcarinal bx showing atypical epithelial cells with prominent nucleoli which was not helpful for diagnosis.
On [**6-30**], pt started on neupogen and continued on this until [**7-9**] when stopped for increasing counts.
Transaminitis: Pt with elevated AST/ALT, total bili and alk phos on admission.
Hepatitis serolgies were negative, dopplers showed nl hepatic flow and no masses on RUQ U/S.
Tachycardia: Pt had a CTA in the setting of acute hypoxia and tachycarida, neg for PE.
Multiple EKGs done consistent with sinus tach.
Past Medical History: Hypertension  Social History: Lives with wife, rare ETOH, no illicit hx,+ tobacco use, works as a consultant for [**Company **]  Family History: Ovarian cancer in mother, father and grandfather with MI at 49, 50  Physical Exam: Tm 100.7  Tc 98.4 100-132/70-87   P107-135  RR 24-28  98-100% 50%TC I/O: 3530/1300 over 24 hours .
General: Responds to questions, commands HEENT: serosanguinous fluid draining from R sided neck mass Pulm: cta anteriorly, no rales, ronchi CV: s1 s2 reg Abd: NABS, soft, NT Ext: no LE edema Neuro: 4-/5 BUE, [**3-31**] BLE, DTR +1, equivocal babinski Skin: shallow ulcer on LLE with erythema  Pertinent Results: Studies: [**7-14**] CXR: stable RLL opacity .
Path of biopsy: large cell tumor, (squamous, melanoma, germ cell tumor vs. lymphoma) .
ECG [**2181-6-17**]: sinus bradycardia, no st/tw changes .
[**7-15**] Labs:  Micro [**7-12**] BCx x 2 pending [**7-12**] Fungal cx pending [**7-12**] UCx no growth [**2092-7-5**] sputum cx not adequate specimens [**7-2**] sputum w/ 4+ GPC in clusters, rods   Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o previously healthy M presenting with neck mass c/w undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown primary s/p embolization.
Post-op course c/b change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61224**] respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Had an episode of desaturation to 81% on [**7-14**] w/ unchanged CXR and improved with suctioning to 93%.
He consistently had saturations in the 90%'s since his transfer to the floor.
He was initially started on levoflox/flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia/tracheobronchitis.
These were changed to Cefepime when first neutropenic after chemo, however changed to Caspo, Cefepine, Daptomycin, and Flagyl given neutropenia and persistent fevers.
Patient remianed afebrile for the balance of his stay.
Change in mental status: Etiology unclear, but could be related to his initial respiartory failure, his complications from embolization, or tumor related.
There was concern for CNS disease given that mass was extending into cervical foramina and dura, however initial CSF evaluation was negative.
Repeat Head CT revealed increasing mass however no evidence of CNS disease, with a question of impingment on neural foramina and vertebral arteries.
Pain Control - Pain difficult to access because of communication difficulties.
When asked if he has pain he often shakes his head no.
PRN Morphine given for occasional complains of right neck pain.
Repeat CT neck done to evaluate mass on [**7-3**] notable for much increased size since [**6-14**] without evidence of abscess.
Fever and Neutropenia: Had episode of Neutropenia which resolved on GCSF.
Started on Daptomycin for Gram Possitive coverage.
Patient also became neutropenic on Vanco/linezolid.
Etiology likely secondary to agitation, anxiety about XRT/chemo, pain.
ON [**7-27**] pt had tachycardia to 170s, which was sinus tach.
Transaminitis: Initially looked to be due to obstructing process, but Liver U/S did not reveal obstruction or masses, dopplers with nl hepatic flow.
FEN:  Patient had PEG on [**6-28**] because of aspiration risk and neck mass obstruction, and received tube feeds.
PPX: Received sc heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
He was started on a ppi because of aspiration risk, and given a bowel regimen to prevent constipation.
