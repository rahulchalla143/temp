History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 35970**] is a 56-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for whole brain radiation on [**2122-1-4**].
Recently, she was seen on Friday for shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, found to have pan-sensitive Klebsiella in urine, also with small segemental pulmonary embolism in RLL, for which she was given Lovenox.
She was also recently diagnosed with pneumomia on [**2122-1-1**] and was started on levofloxacin as an outpatient.
She had had several episodes of "fainting" previously, usually preceded by feeling of lightheadedness.
According to the husband, has rigidity for approximately 10-30 seconds after she passes out, and then is completely at baseline (no confusion, no loss of bowel/bladder).
She also had an elevated lactate to 5 and so there was concern of sepsis and antibiotics were broadened to cefepime + Vancomycin.
She was slow to respond but no focal neuro findings.
She had another episode of unresponsiveness and  was stood up and had urinary incontinence and kept falling to the right.
Team was then for a third episode of unresponsiveness, and attending was already in room.
Brain biopsy in [**11-2**] confirmed diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma.
MRI showed leptomenigeal enhancement.
There is no ETOH or IVDA history.
Her mother has hypertension while her father died of congestive heart failure.
Extremities: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally, no edema in extremities  Neurological Examination: She is not awake or alert.
There is no verbal output.
She does not have doll's eyes.
There is paratonia in both upper and lower extremities.
Small segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe.
No evidence of infarction.
New hiatal hernia.
Stable liver hemangiomas, left adrenal adenoma, pulmonary nodules, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Gas in bilateral renal collecting systems, please correlate with recent instrumentation.
Circumferential enhancement around the spinal cord which may relate to patient's leptomeningeal enhancement concerning for metastatases seen on recent MR [**1-3**].
MRI [**2122-12-30**] Spine: 1) New diffuse thick leptomeningeal enhancement involving the entirety of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine with a dorsal extramedullary intradural lesion at the T2/3 level which is indenting the dorsal cord.
2) 2-cm enhancing lesion involving the cord at the T3/4 level and a smaller 0.9- cm enhancing lesion at the T5 level.
3) Edema and expansion of the cord extending from the C7 to the T6 level.
4) Above findings are concerning for metastasis.
MRI Head [**2122-12-15**]: Worsening diffuse enhancing leptomeningeal disease which involves the brainstem, the cerebellar vermis, the corpus callosum and nearly all the midline structures in addition to the leptomeninges surrounding the brainstem and the upper cervical cord.
The central lesion superior to the mid brain has slightly enlarged in size since the previous exam.
Worsening diffuse leptomeningeal neoplastic process.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 35970**] is a 56-year-old woman, well-known to the OMED team with anaplastic astrocytoma, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthostasis discovered during a whole brain radiation treatment.
Three days prior to admission, she was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and segmental pulmonary embolism on Lovenox.
The night of admission, she was found to have an elevated lactate, and she continued to be orthostatic, so she was started on cefepime/vancomycin for concern for sepsis.
A stat head CT showed no change.
EEG was performed and showed no seizure activity.
Anticoagulation was held given concern for bleed, non-symptomatic.
Benzos were held given risk of respiratory depression (DNR/DNI).
Discharge Instructions: Admitted for orthostasis and radiation therapy.
