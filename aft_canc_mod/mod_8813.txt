Admission Date:  [**2108-7-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2108-8-5**]   Service:  This is an 80 year-old female with multiple complex medical problems who presented with metastatic gastric cancer, status post Ziloda and Aronest due the Friday following admission on [**2108-7-17**].
She presents for admission on the 12th with complaints of increased heart rate, feeling hot and cold, though unsure if she is febrile over the past three days, as well as the feeling of head fullness and weakness.
She has a one year history of atrial fibrillation, but cannot cardiovert secondary to no anticoagulation.
She had a left stent placed one months prior to this admission due to external compression for lymphadenopathy and radiation in the past.
She also has a history of hard to treat urinary tract infections.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Metastatic cancer from gastroesophageal junction diagnosed [**7-/2107**], locally advanced, status post three months of Ziloda, biweekly Aronest injections, weekly Taxol cycle 3.
3) Remote history of aneurysm/intracranial bleed.
Has been on phenobarb for atrial fibrillation times one year refractory to cardioversion and cannot anticoagulate.
She has a remote history of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, status post old inferior posterior myocardial infarction with inducible ischemia, history of orthostatic hypotension.
No jugular venous distention.
crackles in left base.
No suprapubic tenderness, no rebound or guarding.
2+ pulses bilaterally dorsalis pedis.
Poor skin turgor with tenting.
Chest x-ray is stable, cardiomegaly, no congestive heart failure, no infiltrate.
CTA without pulmonary embolus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was determined to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, unable to be anticoagulated due to history of aneurysm.
Once transferred to the Oncology Service, patient went for a third attempt at a right percutaneous nephrostomy placement.
Based on the hypotension and the concern for retroperitoneal bleed, patient was transferred to the Funard Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
There was no evidence of bleed, except for a clot in the renal pelvis on the right.
She was transfused to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30 due to her history of coronary artery disease and an inferior myocardial infarction.
To further evaluate the stent, the patient underwent a nephrostogram, which showed patency of the stent, though continued clot which they felt was dissolving and the cause of the dark blood in the nephrostomy tube.
Since patient continued to have blood in the tube, on [**8-2**] interventional radiology performed an angiogram to evaluate for active bleeding.
There was no evidence of active bleeding, but a thin walled arteriovenous malformation was noted, though to prevent further rupture, it was determined that Interventional radiology would embolize it.
This was performed without complication.
Of note, while the patient was here, initial urinalysis was positive for E. Coli which she was treated for a full course of ciprofloxacin for ten days.
This finished, and she had a fever again.
Follow up urinalysis showed no bacteria but did have 10,000 to 100,000 yeast, though she was treated with Diflucan.
Patient's acute renal failure remained relatively stable in the low 2s throughout the course of her stay, this was followed closely in the setting of both her urinary tract infections with multiple manipulations but interventional radiology.
Patient remained anemic during this stay but goal hematocrit remained greater than 30 in the setting of her coronary artery disease.
The persistent drop was thought to be due to the hematoma around the nephrostomy as well as the clot in the renal pelvis.
There was no evidence of active bleeding that was persisting.
No further fluid was given to her due to her extensive edema.
Coronary artery disease:  She was continued on her Lipitor, but her aspirin was held due to the bleeding and the multiple interventions.
for procedures.
Hydronephrosis of right, status post multiple percutaneous nephrostomy attempts.
Renal pelvic hematoma.
Renal arteriovenous malformations, status post embolization.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Orthostatic hypotension.
