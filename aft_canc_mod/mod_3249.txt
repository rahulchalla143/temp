HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male smoker with a history of Stage 3A nonsmall cell lung cancer, diagnosed by bronchoscopy in [**2149-8-11**] who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2149-11-13**] after having 500 cc of hemoptysis and associated shortness of breath that morning.
He denied chest pain or prior episodes of hemoptysis.
Of note, the patient was treated with radiation and Taxol/Carboplatin from [**2149-10-1**] through [**2149-11-6**] with a seemingly good response; his energy level and shortness of breath were reportedly improved following these treatments.
One day prior to admission at the [**Hospital1 2177**], he was seen in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for a complaint of increasing lethargy and shortness of breath; a chest x-ray done at that time demonstrated a new left lung air/fluid level.
At the end of this procedure, the left main stem bronchus was obstructed with bronchial balloon.
Given the complex vascular supply of the tumor, however, the procedure was aborted.
On the night prior to transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient had an additional 300 cc of hemoptysis with an associated drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was therefore started on a Dopamine drip.
