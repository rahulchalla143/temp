Past Medical History: - Pineal germ cell tumor s/p radiation and chemotherapy at age 14 - s/p VP shunt for noncommunicating hydrocephalus [**2148**] with frequent falls and several revisions - s/p fall with depressed skull fracture in [**2174-9-10**], underwent cranioplasty - Complex partial seizure disorder - Bilateral hearing loss - Pan-hypopituitarism, with reported history of a prolactinoma and adrenal insufficiency - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - Osteopenia - Reported history of SDH in [**2156**] s/p evacuation, and complicated by stroke with left sided weakness and slurred speech that completely resolved - Dysphagia/Aspiration - PEG placement [**3-18**] - MRSA UTI - Colonized by VRE in urine   Social History: Currently resides at [**Hospital3 105**].
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: Scattered rhonchi, no wheezing.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
NEURO: Non-verbal, withdraws to pain in b/l LE, less so in upper extremities.
CSF: 8 WBC, 310 RBCs 5 percent polys; 71 percent lymphs Gram stain 1+PMNs, no organisms.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2176-8-5**]): New sulcal effacement of the left occipital and parietal lobes with relative sparing of the temporal and frontal lobes.
Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, and airspace opacification in the right upper lobe, could be due to pneumonia.
Low lung volumes.
Indeterminate nodule in the left adrenal gland.
Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver, too small to characterize.
Multiple compression deformities of vertebral bodies, with old healed fractures in the ribs, old fracture of the sternum, old fracture at the coccyx.
CHEST PORTABLE AP ([**2176-8-5**]):  New area of opacity in the right mid lung may represent an area of infection or increased atlectesis in setting of decreased lung volumes.
Otherwise, bibasilar atelectasis is stable.
MRI/MRV HEAD: Scattered foci of high signal intensity indicating restricted diffusion on the left parietal and left occipital lobe and also on the right occipital lobe, likely consistent with acute/subacute ischemic changes.
There is no evidence of ventriculitis or cerebritis.
Limited examination secondary to motion artifact and metal artifact, ventricular shunt noted on the left frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] via right frontal burr hole.
Unchanged areas of encephalomalacia, chronic pachymeningeal enhancement with small subdural collections bilaterally, unchanged since the prior examinations.
Bilateral opacities in the mastoid air cells.
EEG: Five pushbutton activations were captured in this telemetry without electrographic or clinical correlate.
Routine sampling shows a polymorphic delta activity background rhythm with decreased voltage over the left hemisphere.
There are epileptiform discharges in the left mid-temporal region and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges in the right hemisphere.
Seizure detection files showed two electrographic seizures without clinical correlate on video.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 40754**] is a 41F with a PMH s/f a pineal germ cell tumer s/p chemotherapy and radiation many years ago complicated by hydrocephalus requiring a VP shunt, and complex partial seizures.
Currently she is Tracheostomy, PEG tube, and foley dependent, bed-bound, and with severe cognitive impairment.
She was admitted on [**2176-8-5**] with fevers, altered mental status, and worsening seizure control.
Fevers: Prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she had had multiple cultures taken at her long term care facility.
Her sputum was growing serratia and stenotrophomonas, and urine was growing pan-resistant pseudomonas.
She also had an ongoing c. difficle infection.
On arrival to the hospital, she was febrile, and tachycardic with stable blood pressures.
Samples of her CSF, sputum, urine, blood, and stool were taken to look for a fever source, and with the help of an infectious disease consultation, she was empirically treated with vancomycin, cefepime, colistin, PO vancomycin, and acyclovir- given concern for VPS associated encephalitis, ventilator associated pneumonia, pan-resistant foley associated UTI, and c. diff colitis.
An MRI was performed to further evaluate the findings on CT scan, which showed multiple embolic strokes.
Cultures returned negative in the CSF for bacterial or HSV infection, and highly resistant pseudomonas species grew in both sputum and urine.
Her MRI did not confirm any evidence of encephalitis, and in fact showed multiple acute/subacute embolic strokes.
Her EEG showed evidence of seizure activity.
Taken together, her decline in mental status was taken to be multifactorial: related to shower emboli, increased seizure activity, and delirium from multiple infections.
Unfortunately, this did not improve with treatment of her seizures or infections.
Increased seizure activity: Her father had noticed that her arms were shaking with increased frequency.
A 24hour video EEG was performed, which confirmed the presence of seizure activity, which correlated to the images captured on video.
Ativan was used as need for seizure control, then later replaced with daily scheduled Valium.
This was reversed with deep suctioning, and felt to be secondary to mucous plugging.
She was also noted to have elev Ca in [**10-20**] range, unable to assess if she is symptomatic from it.
Panhypopituitarism: During the first two days of her admission, she was given a stress dose of hydrocortisone, and once her tachycardia and fevers resolved, she was switched back to her usual prednisone dose.
Multidisciplinary family meeting: Given her poor prognosis, the decision was made to hold a family meeting with her neurosurgeon, parents, and the primary team.
The family was informed about her current status, and poor prognosis.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for consipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection, as well as a pneumonia in your lungs.
You were also having increased movements in your arms, raising the concern about seizures.
Additionally, we started daily Valium to further help with seizure control.
Stop Prednisone 5 mg daily  Seek medical attention immediately if patient has uncontrollable bleeding, continuous seizure activity, fevers or any other concerning symptoms.
If corrected Dilantin level is higher than 20, then reduce the evening dose to 100 mg.
If corrected Dilantin level is lower than 15, then increase the noon dose to 150 mg.  Dilantin levels need to be checked again in 5 days.
