Admission Date:  [**2141-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-10-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-12-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis  History of Present Illness: 66 yo M with IDDM, HTN.
hyperlipidemia presents with 2 week so fintermittant cramping abdominal pain with one episode of vomiting last week and no BM in 2 weeks.
Pain feels like pressure, worse on left side, urinating improves it.
Patient also reports an increase in urinary frequency, has PMH of BPH.
He reports a weight loss of 5 lbs over last month unintentional and decreased po intake [**1-7**] to early satiety.
No CP, minimal SOB as abd distension has increased.
No fever, some ?
ED Course: Patient was treated with MOM and had a large BM which improved his symptoms.
CT showed innumerable omental masses and caking throughout abd.
Surgery was consulted and recommened no acute intervention, tissue dx needed.
Also SOB which has worsened with increasing abdominal distension.
Past Medical History: CVA [**2127**] on Coumadin HTN Hyperlipidemia Hyperplastic colon polyp removed in [**2137**]   Social History: Former smoker, no EtOH, retired, one son, widowed x2, lives in [**Location 669**].
Pancreatic CA in Father  Physical Exam: DISCHARGE PHYSICAL; VS: Tcuttent 99.9 BP 110/60 HR 82 RR 26 O2% oN RA GEN: NAS, comfortable HEENT: no OP lesions CV: regular rate s1/s2, no mrg PULM: end expiratory wheezes, good air movement, decreased bs at bases ABD: +bs, hypoactive bs, distended, dullness at flanks, non-tended EXT: 2+ pitting edema LE bilat NEURO: no focal deficits, a/o x3 PSYCH: appropriate   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: [**2141-9-19**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases reveal mild bilateral dependent atelectasis.
The remainder of the lungs are clear without nodules.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is a large volume of low density (approximately 20 [**Doctor Last Name **]) ascites in the abdomen, which fills the pelvis and paracolic gutters.
Layering along the greater omentum is too numerous to count nodules adn stranding consistent with omental studding or "omental caking".
In the splenic hilum, there is an ill- defined approximately 8 mm area of hypodensity which could represent a filling defect secondary to the phase of arterial opacification or a metastatic focus.
Extrinsic to the splenic hilum, there is an ill- defined 3.1 x 2.1 cm area of isodense material in the splenic hilum.
There is a hypodensity within the dome of the liver (2:14) which is too small to characterize by CT.
There is a 15 mm x 18 mm hypodensity within the interpolar region of the left kidney measuring 19 Hounsfield units and likely represents a simple cyst.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically and there is no hydronephrosis.
The stomach is decompressed and there are no abnormalities appreciated.
The remainder of the abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There are scattered mesenteric nodes.
There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air.
In the area of the cecum and terminal ileum, there is a 1.8 x 1.4 cm mass extending into the lumen of the cecum (2:72).
In the setting of extensive abdominal ascites and omental caking, this finding could represent a ruptured mucinous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions identified.
There are no fractures identified.
Cecal mass which could represent a colonic malignancy.
Appendix which is visualized but does not fill with contrast and in the setting of abdominal ascites and omental caking could represent a ruptured mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix.
Ill-defined lesion in and around splenic hilum.
CXR [**2141-9-19**]: FINDINGS: There is rightward deviation of the trachea which could be secondary to patient's low lung volumes.
There is mild distortion of the right and left costophrenic sulci to suggest possible small bilateral pulmonary effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes limit full evaluation on this portable chest radiograph.
However, small bilateral pleural effusions appear present.
LABS ON DISCHARGE: CBC: 12.7* 4.05* 10.8* 32.4* 80* 26.5* 33.2 14.1 522* Chem 7: 88 30* 1.3* 134 4.4 98 26 14 CEA: 1083    Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo M admitted with abd distension x2 weeks and 5lb weight loss found to have omental caking on CT.
Cytology positive for maligant cells, indeterminate for GI malignancy based on staining.
Oncology was consulted and felt to have a poor prognosis of less than 6 months.
Patient will eventually get an abdominal port for home management of his ascites and will be tranistioned to home hospice.
# Malignant Ascites: Patient presented to ED with abd pain and distension and was found to have omental caking on CT as well as a cecal mass.
CEA was elevated at 1083.
Cytology studies showed maliganct cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
#  Fever: Patient was afebrile on admission.
He spiked a fever on HD 4 and became tachycardic.
He met criteria for SIRS and was started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage and pan cultured.
Blood cultures thus far have been negative and CXR at the time of spike showed no actue pulmonary process.
The ceftriaxone was discontinued after the 4th paracentesis that showed resolution of his SBP.
Patient remained afebrile until the day prior to discharge when he spiked to 101.9.
Vitals were stable through this last episode of fever and it was attributed to his tumor burden.
Patient became hypotensive to 84/62 on HD 5 after spiking the night prior.
Given his fever, elevated white count, hypotension and hypoxia, he met SIRS criteria and was transferred to the MICU where he was monitored overnight and transferred back to the floor.
# Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia: Thought to be multifactorial including increased abdominal pressure [**1-7**] ascites, infection and atelectasis.
After his first bed side paracentesis during which he received 2 units FFP, he became acutely short of breath and required nebulizer treatments and O2 by masal cannula.
# Sepsis: Patient spike to 101.9, was hypoxic, hypotensive and had an elevated white count.
Massive diarrhea [**1-7**] aggressive bowel regimen (or infection) possibly contributing.
# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: Patient developed SBP found on his second paracentesis with 600 PMN's.
# Question of TRALI: Patient was admitted with an elevated INR and received 2 units of FFP during his first paracentesis.
One hour after, he had an increasing oxygen requirement.
his chest Xray showed no acute process.
His symptoms were initally attributed to transfusion-realted acute lung injury.
He was treated supportively and symptoms resolved with oxygen and nebulizer treatments.
This incident was investigated byt he blood bank and determined to be secondary to an allergic reaction not to TRALI.
This bump was attributed to a pre-renal cause of renal failure as he was intravascularly volume depleted secondary to his malignany ascites.
# Anemia: Patient was admitted with a hct of 40 and developed a microcytic anemia which was attributed to iron deficency and anemia of chronic disease.
He had flecks of blood in his vomitus early on in his hospital stay which was likley [**1-7**] to his elevated INR.
# H/o remote CVA: Had been on coumadin as outpatient, being held in conjunction with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 9766**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]/c'ed in preparation for an abdominal port.
, # BPH: The pt's Flomax was held given concern for early sepsis during his hospitalization and restarted on discharge as his bps were stable.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, headache.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and distension and a CT scan of your abdomen showed fluid and a mass in your colon.
The fluid was drained multiple times and a sample of the fluid showed that cancer cells were present.
One of the fluid samples was also positive for infection and you were treated with antibiotics.
You were discharged to a skilled nursing facility and will return to the hospital for paracentesis twice weekly as long as you need this for comfort.
You have a paracentesis scheduled on Friday, [**10-6**] at  Please return to the hospital if you experience worsening fever, chest pain, difficulty breathing or any other concerning symptoms.
