[**2115-8-27**] CXR: INDICATIONS: Hypoxia, increasing shortness of breath.
There is minimal pulmonary, vascular engorgement, but overall, the appearance is improved since the study from six hours earlier.
There are no focal consolidations.
[**2115-8-31**] CXR: Triangular opacity in the right suprahilar lung is probably atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions layer posteriorly.
Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no retrosternal hematoma or displaced rib fracture.
Q in III (old), non-specific ST changes in anterior leads (old versus [**2115-7-24**]) EKG on discharge: Sinus rhythm Lateral ST changes are nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2115-8-30**], no significant change  ********************  Relevant studies in hospital: [**2115-8-29**] ECHO: LVEF low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo female with MMP including ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, severe MR, and [**Month/Day/Year 2182**], admitted with SOB in setting of missed HD [**2-20**] clotted AV graft, as well as supratherapeutic INR.
Transfusion of FFP was initiated in the ED to reverse her coagulopathy and plan for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.
Unfortunately, she developed worsening hypoxemia with volume administration, and was placed on BiPAP and admitted to the ICU for volume overload and respiratory distress.
In the ICU, she developed worsening respiratory distress, and was intubated emergently on [**2115-8-27**] at 20:10, with succinylcholine administration for induction.
1) PEA arrest: Etiology of PEA arrest attributed to hyperkalemia, with exacerbation following succinylcholine administration.
She was resuscitated according to the ACLS algorithms for PEA/asystole/pulseless VT, shocked twice (200 joules and 360 joules)and concomitantly repeatedly treated for hyperkalemia.
An echo was obtained on [**8-29**], which revealed a stable EF at 50%, 2+ MR (improved versus [**6-/2115**]) and moderate PA HTN (old).
She was transferred from the ICU to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable with no neurologic deficits.
Significant pain in chest from chest compressions, but chest x-ray after code showed no evidence of PNX, hemothorax, rib fracture.
Of note, previous bleeding with Ibuprofen (history of acquired factor VII deficiency, s/p Rx).
2) Respiratory failure: Attributed to fluid overload in the setting of missed hemodialysis [**2-20**] clotted AV graft and fluid administration +/- [**Month/Day (2) 2182**].
She has been stable from a respiratory standpoint since then.
aspiration pneumonia or tracheobronchitis given new sputum production.
CXR, however, negative for infiltrate.
She completed a 7 day course of antibiotics but remained afebrile, WBC count at baseline, with no evidence of PNA on any CXR's.
3) ESRD on HD: As above.
Initial placement of dialysis access deferred given supratherapeutic INR, but eventually placed emergently following arrest (cordis line placed during code changed over wire and dialysis cath placed).
4) CAD: She was ruled out for MI on admission with serial cardiac enzymes.
EKG pre and post arrest unchanged.
She was given 1 [**1-20**] units of FFP, stopped in the setting of respiratory failure.
Patient initially had some difficulty eating as she felt nauseated and vomited up food.
Thought to be due to pain meds.
9) Transaminitis: LFT's transiently rose in setting of shock liver, but returned to baseline by discharge with no intervention needed.
Left femoral cordis placed during arrest, changed over wire for temporary dialysis catheter, removed on [**8-30**]).
Small hematoma noted, no bruit.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Thrombosis of AV graft used for dialysis 2) S/P PEA arrest d/t hyperkalemia 3) ESRD   Discharge Condition: Stable.
2) Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet 3) Please take all of your medications as prescribed 4) Please call your PCP or return to the ED if you have worsening SOB, chest pain LE edema, nausea, vomiting, fevers, weight gain.
