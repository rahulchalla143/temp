She describes the weakness as generalized and feeling like she has low energy.
She has severe weakness of her right hand for many months which is unchanged.
She also endorsed weakness of the legs bilaterally.
She also states that for the past week she has felt increasingly nauseous with dry heaves.
During this time, she has had poor PO intake.
She endorses cough productive of clear sputum for the past [**3-4**] weeks.

She has no sick contacts and denies fever or chills at home.
She was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2104**] and was found to have brain metastases in [**2113**].
She was recently started on Zelboraf in [**3-/2114**] for her metastatic melanoma.
This was managed with whole brain radiation, CyberKnife and dexamethasone for the edema which she is still being tapered off of.
Her MRI on [**2114-5-7**] showed numerous bilateral metastases in the brain with interval improvement after the above treatment.
She had a CXR with concern for RLL infiltrate and she was started on Levofloxacin.

Bibasilar atelectasis.
-LENI ([**2114-5-19**]): IMPRESSION:  No DVT in right lower extremity.
No definite osseous lesions.
Right gluteus calcific tendinopathy.
Mild degenerative changes in both hips.
New asymmetry of the right obturator muscle, which may represent metastatic involvement of the muscle or adjacent lymphadenopathy.
Right and left breast nodules smaller in size.
-CXR ([**2114-5-23**]) No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with metastatic melanoma s/p Cyberknife and WBI as well as treatment with vemurafenib, HTN and anxiety who presents with hyponatremia and weakness.
Initially, etiology was thought to be hypovoluemic hyponatremia given her poor PO intake prior to admission, flat neck veins, and poor skin turgor.
Renal was consulted and she was started on 3%NS at a rate of 20cc/hr given her failure to significantly improve with conservative measures.
The etiology of her SIADH is likely multifactorial and related to her brain metastases, pneumonia as well as her pain and nausea.
# Afib: She reportedly has a h/o "irregular heart beat" and had a few episodes of atrial fibrllation with RVR in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] abnd on the floor.
# Community acquired pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR at admission, better appreciated on lateral view, although unclear whether this is atelectasis or infection.
Following this, she continued to have some itnermittent cough with yellowish sputum.
Repeat chest X-rays showed no pneumonia.
We started her on azithromycin at the time of discharge, and she will complete this course of antibiotic for empiric treatmetn of possible bronchitis as an outpatient.
# Lower back and groin pain: The pain is similar to what she experiences at home, partially related to the prior surgery she had on her hip for melanoma.
Pain was improved with PO morphine and Lidoderm patches.
# Weakness: Most likely cause for her generalized weakness over the week prior to admission is her hyponatremia and poor PO intake, as described above.
Aside from her ongoing right hand weakness, there was no other focality to her weakness.
Low concern for cord compression or spinal lesions given her neuro exam findings.
Her chemotherapy drug, Zelboraf is also known to cause generalized weakness: we decided to trial holding this medication for one week starting [**2114-5-23**] to see if her symptoms improve off the medication.
This may be explaining some of her weakness and fatigue.
There is no obvious evidence of bleeding from history or exam.
# Metastatic melanoma: She has recently received WBI and Cyberknife therapy for her brain mets and was currently on Zelboraf after being enrolled in clinical trials with no improvement in her disease.
She is being tapered off dexamethasone which she was started to help reduce cerebral edema during her rad/onc treatments.
She was continued on Zelboraf for most of this admission, but it was held temporarily for one week starting [**2114-5-23**] to assess whether the drug might be contributing to her pain.
# Hypertension: BP well controlled this admission.
Metastatic melanoma: We stopped dexamethasone on [**7-23**].
Bronchitis: We started azithromycin to treat possible bronchitis on [**2114-5-24**].

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted with weakness, and were found to have low sodium.
We performed a CT scan of your torso and X-rays of your hips, which did not show any lesions in your bones or joints.
Following discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], we think that your pain is a combination of your sciatica and a side-effect of your vemurafenib.
The CT also showed that the melanoma is still responding to the vemurafenib.
While you were in the hospital, you sometims developed a fast heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation).
-fluoxetine -fluconazole  STARTED -senna, colace and bisacodyl to help you move your bowels -maalox for gas -metoprolol to help control your heart rate -tylenol, tramadol, morphine and lidocaine patch for pain -prochlorperazine for nausea  INCREASED clonazepam to three times daily  Please continue taking your other medications as usual.
