He was initially diagnosed with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome acute lymphocytic leukemia in [**2139-6-7**].
He initially presented in [**2139-5-7**] with nausea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and sweats.
At that time he also noted decreased vision in his left eye and was diagnosed with possible central vein occlusion.
A lumbar puncture was positive for lymphoblasts.
His hospital course following diagnosis was prolonged and he developed adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring two week intubation in the Intensive Care Unit.
He was admitted [**2140-2-5**] for dehydration, at which time he was diagnosed with a sinus infection.
He was noted to have recurrence on blasts in his peripheral smear on [**2140-2-5**].
He developed blurry vision on [**2140-2-8**], a head magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time was without abnormalities.
An lumbar puncture on [**2140-2-9**] showed recurrence of leukemia in his cerebrospinal fluid and he has received three doses of Methotrexate, Solu-Medrol, Ara-C intrathecal chemotherapy ([**2-10**], [**2-12**], and [**2-15**]).
He current denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers or nightsweats.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive as described in history of present illness.
General:  Clinically ill-appearing middle-aged male, alert and oriented times three in no acute distress in no respiratory distress.
Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
Skin:  No rashes noted.
Gram stain, no polys, no microorganisms, fluid culture negative, fungal culture pending, acid fast bacillus culture pending.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive - The patient received intrathecal Hydrocortisone, Vincristine, and Ara-C, given history of positive cytology from cerebrospinal fluid on [**2140-2-17**] and [**2140-2-23**].
The cytology of the fluid from [**2-17**] was positive for acute lymphocytic leukemia.
The cytology from [**2-23**], cerebrospinal fluid showed atypical lymphoid cells.
Although the patient has evidence of persistent leukemia in his central nervous system, it is hoped that the allo bone marrow transplant will induce a graft for his leukemia response that will eliminate residual disease.
Initiation of bone marrow transplant protocol was initially held due to elevated liver enzymes.
His electrocardiograms remained with no change from baseline throughout protocol.
The patient received his infusion on [**2140-3-2**] which he tolerated without complications.
This is the last dose he will receive given severe mucositis.
Febrile neutropenia - The patient had fever to 101 on [**2140-2-27**] at which time he was started on Cefepime and Vancomycin for febrile neutropenia.
Given that the patient remained afebrile with a stable blood pressure his antibiotics were discontinued on [**2140-2-29**].
The patient's efferent hypotension was thought to be secondary to VP 16 infusion rather than sepsis.
Vancomycin was added on [**3-3**] for persistent fever and Ambazone was added on [**2140-3-4**] for a persistent fever in the setting of Grade 4 mucositis.
Mucositis - Ulcers were noted over his lips at admission with progressive swelling.
However, following his chemotherapy he developed severe mucositis with minimal response to gel clear, and bicarbonate rinses.
The patient has required a Dilaudid PCA for pain controls.
Hydrocortisone was added given concern that a history of head radiation in [**2139-10-7**] may be contributing to mouth inflammation.
Gastrointestinal - The patient was noted to have a transaminitis on admission.
Possible causes include medication-related (although the patient was on new medication), leukemia, viral hepatitis, liver or gallbladder pathology.
The patient received three days of Leucovorin given the concern for intrathecal Methotrexate toxicity.
Additional workup included an ultrasound of his liver which showed no evidence of abnormalities in the gallbladder or biliary ductal system but showed fatty infiltration of his liver.
Eye swelling - Shortly after admission, the patient was noted to have right medial eye swelling and erythema.
This medial eye swelling and erythema gradually improved over the course of the hospital stay.
Hematology - The patient's blood counts were supported with transfusion for hematocrit less than 30 or platelet less than 30 given severe mucositis.
