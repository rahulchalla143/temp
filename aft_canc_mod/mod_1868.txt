His work-up ultimately included MRI of the head that revealed a right parietal mass, as well as a small contrast enhancing region in the left cerebellum consistent with metastasis.
Work-up revealed a left upper lung mass as well.

Poor coordination of his left hand (baseline)  Pertinent Results: MRI [**10-31**]:There is a new right frontal/parietal craniotomy.
There is hyperemia and mild linear enhancement along the medial and superior margins of the surgical cavity.
There is a small right subdural collection, a small right epidural collection, and a small right subgaleal collection.
Vasogenic edema in the right cerebral hemisphere has decreased in extent compared to [**2106-10-11**].
A 4 mm enhancing mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere is unchanged.
A left parietal development venous anomaly is again seen.
No new enhancing lesions are seen.
MRI [**10-29**]: Head Accounting for differences in head angulation and positioning, there is slight increase in the right parietal lobe mass but with decrease in the surrounding edema.
The right frontal lobe lesion currently measures 2.2 cm CC x 2.7 cm AP x 2.5 cm TV dimensions compared to prior measurements of 2.2 x 1.7 x 2.0 cm.
There is less mass effect on the ventricles.
There is also a subtle enhancing lesion in the left cerebellum adjacent to the tentorium.
There is no acute ischemia.
He did have LUE ataxia and alt.

amount of new blood on CT however pt was neurologically stable.
