History of Present Illness: 38 y/o female with history of ALL, diagnosed [**9-23**], status post complete remission induced by five cycles of chemotherapy but with recent relapse by bone marrow biopsy [**2135-6-13**] status post admission for reinduction chemotherapy [**Date range (1) 18555**] who presented to the ED from home with epigastric pain and fevers.
She noted epigastric pain for approximately three days associated with diarrhea and nausea.
She was directed to call the [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] fellow on call, and when she mentioned fever to 100.2 associated with chills and rigors, she was directed to the ED for evaluation.
CXR was without evidence for pneumonia.
On review of systems, she denies cough, shortness of breath, or diaphoresis.
Her diarrhea has resolved, but her abdominal pain continues.
As above, she had a recent relapse of her disease by bone marrow biopsy on [**2135-6-13**] and had re-induction chemotherapy on [**6-17**] with plans to undergo matched un-related allogeneic stem cell transplantation if a donor becomes available.
Her treatment course has been complicated by -F+N, low back pain, C diff, -surgical debridement and extraction of a tooth on [**2135-2-11**] due to dentoalveolar abscess to bone -vaginal Herpes outbreak while in hospital [**Date range (1) 18555**].

MICROBIOLOGY: [**6-30**]: [**11-19**] blood cultures positive for coag neg staphylococcus.
CT CHEST ([**2135-7-13**]): New bilateral pleural effusions are very tiny.
Dependent ground-glass opacity in both bases clears in inspiration and prone imaging and are due to air trapping.
One 9 x 7 mm bulla in right lower lobe is unchanged (4A:106).
There is no lymph node enlargement using CT criteria.
There is no pericardial effusion.
New very tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
No findings of infection.
RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2135-7-7**]): The liver is diffusely echogenic.
No focal liver lesions are identified.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
IMPRESSION: Echogenic liver most likely fatty infiltration.
More severe forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis and fibrosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
Heterogeneous 9 mm enodmetrium with possible focal endometrial lesion.
9 mm right adnexal cyst which today has the appearance of a paraovarian cyst.
LUE ULTRASOUND [**7-6**]: No evidence of DVT involving the left upper extremity.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature cells consistent with blasts occurring in sheets occupying 90% of marrow cellularity.
Abnormal forms are not seen.
Focal loose clustering is noted.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bone marrow biopsy [**8-1**]: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and reveals a markedly hypercellular bone marrow (90% cellularity).
There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature cells consistent with blasts occupying 90% of marrow cellularity.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 38 year-old woman with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative ALL, previously on chemo-therapy status post induced remission with relapse of disease on bone marrow biopsy [**2135-6-13**] status post reinduction chemotherapy as inpatient [**Date range (1) 18555**] presenting with abdominal pain, fever and neutropenia.
# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia:  Because the infectious work-up was negative, we decided to perform bone marrow biopsy to assess for ALL disease recurrence.
There were no complications during the chemotherapy.
She was kept on allopurinol and sodium bicarbonate IV hydration to prevent methotrexate-related renal toxicity.
Unfortunately she started to have recurrent fevers as described above and her bone marrow biopsy on [**8-1**] showed relapse so it was decided to treat her with clofarabine to attempt to induce remission so she could undergo a transplant in the near future.
# Neutropenic fever:  Granulocyte count was 18 on night of admission.
When she arrived on the floor there was no clear source of infection; CXR and urine culture were negative and physical exam was remarkable only for mild epigastric tenderness.
Blood cultures were drawn; one of four samples grew gram positive cocci so she was started on IV vancomycin.
Speciation returned as coagulase negative staph; vanco was stopped but her coverage was later broadened to cefepime and caspofungin due to her persistent fevers and low white counts.
Blood cultures remained negative on broad spectrum antibiotics but she continued to spike fevers overnight.
She was restarted on IV vancomycin for continued fevers and also developed diarrhea and was found to be C. diff positive and so was started on po flagyl.
She stopped having fevers for a while, however they began again on [**7-26**].
A CT of her chest showed no active disease, a CT of her sinuses showed no sinusitis, cultures were all negative and it was thought that the fevers were due to her ALL so a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**8-1**] which showed a packed marrow.
She continued to have fevers while being treated with clofarabine, however her fevers resolved a few days after her course of clofarabine was completed.
CT chest was consistent with volume overload, and she was tentatively diuresed given pericardial effusion (below).
# Acute Pancreatitis:  A few days after completing clofarabine she developed persistent abdominal pain.
She had had a MRI to evaluate a possible new nodule seen on abdominal US, however the MRI showed no liver pathology except for iron deposition.
An abdominal CT showed pancreatitis so she was made NPO and given aggressive IV hydration and dilaudid for pain control.
After 6 days when she was still experiencing significant pain, abdominal CT was done to evaluate for complications, and it was negative for abscess or necrosis.
# C.diff infection: The patient developed diarrhea and was found to be C.diff positive on [**7-18**].
She was continued on flagyl as she remained neutropenic on broad spectrum antibiotics.
# Vaginal Bleeding:  On HD 2, she started her menses.
When her bleeding and fevers continued, GYN was consulted for recs regarding additional progesterone therapy and work-up for gynecologic cause of fevers and abdominal / suprapubic pain.
Pelvic U/S showed possible endometrial polyp versus intrauterine clot, two uterine fibroids, and stable right hydrosalpinx versus ovarian cyst.
There was no pathology to account for her fevers.
Progesterone/estrogen injections as well as GnRH analogues were deferred due to the thromboembolic risks and the low liklihood of any benefit to be had from either therapy in the setting of recent progesterone therapy.
Her platelets and red cells were repleted as needed; platelets were transfused to keep levels greater than 30 to minimize menstrual blood loss.
After wearing the patch for 2 weeks with an increase in the dose, her menstrual bleeding stopped and she was taken off the estradiol patch.
# Initial epigastric pain:  Differential diagnosis for abdominal pain at presentation included peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or gastritis (viral or chemical).
She had been on protonix, but still may have developed gastric ulcerations or mucosal lesions secondary to steroids (per chemo), viral ulcers, or infection.
We continued her pantoprazole and treated her pain with PO dilaudid.
We could not perform upper endoscopy due to her thrombocytopenia.
Further work-up could be pursued as outpatient when her cell counts recover; however, her epigastric pain resolved during the hospital course.
# Hypertension:  The patient was initally on her outpatient metoprolol dose, however she had elevated pressures while hospitalized and so had her metoprolol increased to 50 mg daily and 5 mg of amlodipine added.
She was hypertensive in this setting and was treated with hydralazine and metoprolol IV.
# Diabetes:  We held her glimepiride and started her on a humalog insulin sliding scale for tighter glucose control.
Her home glargine was decreased from 20U to 18U qPM as she had a few episode of midnighttime hypoglycemia.
Her lantus was decreased during her episode of pancreatitis as she was on TPN.
# Pericardial effusion:  TTE showed pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right ventricle consistent with tamponade physiology.
Cardiology saw the patient and advised volume resuscitation.
This recommendation was balanced with her respiratory distress and anasarca in response to aggressive fluids.
____________________________________________________________ [**Hospital Unit Name **] course [**2135-8-18**]- [**2135-9-18**]  The pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU [**2135-8-18**] for persistent febrile neutropenia and sepsis.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had a long course with recurrent fevers and infections.
Nephrology was also involved as the pt was put on CVVH for renal failure.
She needed extensive blood and platelet transfusions for persistent anemia and thrombocytopenis.
She was intubated for several weeks due to respiratory failure.
She did recieve tube feedings and TPN for nutritional support.
She was eventually made DNR/DNI on [**9-15**] and, despite use of multiple pressors, succumbed to septic infection on [**2135-9-18**].
