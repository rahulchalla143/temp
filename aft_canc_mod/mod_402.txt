No pneumonia or pneumothorax.
Fracture deformities of the right posterior 7th and 8th ribs, clinical correlation is recommended to determine if there is an acute component.
Bilateral pleural plaques reflecting asbestos exposure.
CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C  [**2195-2-10**] CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a complex fracture line extending through the intertrochanteric region of the right femur.
The fracture extends to both the anterior and posterior cortical surfaces.
There is slight external rotation of the distal fragment with respect to the proximal fragment.
No other pelvic fractures are identified.
There is moderately severe concentric joint space narrowing in the left hip joint space with extensive osteophyte formation with subchondral cystic change.
No fracture plane is visualized.
There is mild joint space narrowing in the right hip with osteophyte formation, much less than on the left.
There are colonic diverticula without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
The prostate gland is mildly enlarged with several punctate areas of calcification.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
Nondisplaced complex fracture through right femoral intertrochanteric region.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a complex fracture line extending through the intertrochanteric region of the right femur.
The fracture extends to both the anterior and posterior cortical surfaces.
There is slight external rotation of the distal fragment with respect to the proximal fragment.
No other pelvic fractures are identified.
There is moderately severe concentric joint space narrowing in the left hip joint space with extensive osteophyte formation with subchondral cystic change.
No fracture plane is visualized.
There is mild joint space narrowing in the right hip with osteophyte formation, much less than on the left.
There are colonic diverticula without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
The prostate gland is mildly enlarged with several punctate areas of calcification.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
Left atrial abnormality.
Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were acquired with intravenous and oral contrast material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are calcified pleural plaques at the lung bases consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
There also are bilateral pleural effusions and basal atelectasis.
These lesions are consistent with metastases in the context of known prostate cancer.
The kidneys are notable for cortical atrophy and the right kidney contains a hypoattenuating lesion seen on series 2, image 41, which may represent a cyst but a metastatic focus cannot be excluded.
In the region of the cecum and ascending colon, note is made of an irregular-appearing bowel wall, and there is the suspicion of pneumatosis in this region.
This may be due to infectious colitis, typhlitis or ischemia.
In the clinical context of bacteremia and guarding, however the concern for pathologic process in the region of the cecum and ascending colon persists.
There also is a small amount of fluid tracking down the right paracolic gutter and there is a small amount of fluid surrounding the kidneys and tracking down into the pelvis.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen, however there are multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes that do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Sigmoid colon and rectum are unremarkable except for sigmoid diverticuli.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen.
There is generalized anasarca.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a dynamic hip screw transfixing the right proximal femur.
There is DISH in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
Possible pneumatosis in the cecum/ascending colon.
This may be due to infectious colitis, typhlitis or due to ischemia.
Innumerable liver metastases.
Calcified pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
Bilateral basal atelectasis and pleural effusions.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Enlarged prostate consistent with history of prostate cancer.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
Calcified pleural plaques at both lung bases unchanged.
No pericardial effusion.
This study is limited by lack of IV contrast; hypodensities can be seen in the liver, which probably correspond to the innumerable low-density lesions seen on previous CT scan.
Nonspecific stranding seen around the kidneys and along both pericolic gutters is unchanged.
No free air.
No free fluid.
No evidence of obstruction.
No significant lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Sigmoid diverticula without diverticulitis.
Diverticulosis in left colon.
No free fluid or free air or lymphadenopathy.
Degenerative changes of the spine.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
No definite pneumatosis, or evidence of obstruction.
[**3-5**] CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
The tracheostomy tip overlies the trachea at the level of the upper clavicles, in nomimal position.
No pneumothorax is detected.
Again seen is hyperinflation and multiple calcified pleural plaques.
There has been some interval worsening in degree of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
No gross effusion.
Micro: negative BCx, UCx, negative for C. Diff .

Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Thought to be likely due to chronic lung disease plus abdominal distention pressing up on his diaphragms +/- aspiration PNA.
The patient was was started on vanc/levo/Flagyl for aspiration/nosocomial PNA and aggressive bowel regimen for ileus secondary to narcotics.
He completed a one week course of antibiotics, successive CXRs following treatment failed to show any residual or new infiltrate to suggest persistent pneumonia.
However, he then continued to have daily fever spikes, and he was empirically treated with a one week course of Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible VAP pneumonia.
# Anemia/Transient Melena: The patient was anemic, iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease, possibly secondary to known malignancy.
In addition, he had guaiac positive stool output.
He had one episode of melena (about 250 cc) on the morning after his trach/PEG placement, and a drop in his BP to 80's systolic.
They recommended continuing on the PPI [**Hospital1 **], and monitoring his hct [**Hospital1 **]; with the thought that his melena was most likely secondary to blood loss from the PEG procedure.
The patient's hct continued to trend down, and he underwent an EGD and colonoscopy on [**3-11**] which showed an ulcerated, erythematous lesion in the proximal ascending colon.
This was thought to be the explanation for his melena, and a biopsy was taken, with a differential diagnosis including ischemic colitis vs. Crohn's disease vs. neoplasm.
The EGD revealed a smooth nodule in the fundus of the stomach, which will need to be further evaluated in the future; was otherwise normal.
It was thought that the patient's hematocrit should be monitored every 48 hours, or more frequently if melena develops.
GI cleared the patient to restart his Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, but this may need to be stopped and other prophylaxis measures explored (i.e, filter placement) if he begins to rebleed.
# Ileus/abdominal distension: Likely due to narcotic -induced ileus.
Possible pneumatosis in the cecum/ascending colon.
This may be due to infectious colitis, typhlitis or due to ischemia.
Innumerable liver metastases.
Calcified pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
Bilateral basal atelectasis and pleural effusions.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Enlarged prostate consistent with history of prostate cancer.
The patient was started on empiric Flagyl for C-Diff, as he had persistently large volume, greenish, guaiac positive stool output.
The abdominal CT was repeated a few days later, and showed slight improvement of previous findings, and still no signs of obstruction.
# Acute renal failure: occurred in the setting of hypotension and volume depletion.
# Hip fracture: s/p mechanical fall and ORIF on [**2-12**].
Initially received too [**Last Name (un) **] narcotics causing ileus and respiratory failure.
# Hyponatremia: Initially thought to be SIADH and fluid restriction was enforced.
Later, however with fluid restriction, likely became hypovolemic causing renal failure.
Hyponatremia resolved with IVF.
Patient then became hypernatremic, which again resolved with free water repletion.
However, he then became hypertensive on the day prior to discharge, and was started on an ACE for management, this may need to be titrated for optimal BP control.
# Prostate CA: per PCP has had metastatic prostate cancer for last ten years.
Contact was maintained with his urologist, particularly after his abdominal CT showed liver metastasis.
He was maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, and provided with a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for GI protection.
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: 2.5 mg Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for aggitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right hip intertrochanteric fracture Respiratory failure Aspiration pneumonia ileus lower GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You have been discharged to an extended care facility for rehabilitation, your right hip fracture has been repaired.
