Admission Date:  [**2119-2-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-3-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Metoprolol Tartrate / Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none.
History of Present Illness: 89 year old female with history CHF(EF 40%), MI([**12-18**]- medically managed), chronic hyponatremia who presents from nursing home with hypotension, hypoxia, and progressive cough x 2 weeks.
No clear history of aspiration, but pt eats pureed food.
Patient CXR was consitent with pulmonary edema.
She was given dose of levofloxacin, cefepime, and clinda for possible aspiration PNA.
She uderwent CTA chest in the ED which showed multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the bilateral lower lobes and patient was started on IV heparin and admitted to the ICU.
ROS: Denies any HA, chest pain, currently no SOB, denies any abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: Hypertension S/P hysterectomy Iron deficiency anemia Basal cell carcinomas (largest on scalp; patient refuses to have treated per PCP) Recent MI [**12-18**] medically managed CHF most recent echo with LVEF 40% Critical AS: Peak velocity 4.0 and valve area of 0.5 Rectal mass (no workup)   Social History: Pt previously lived alone but most recently from rehab.
She has no children.
Multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Diffuse small pulmonary nodules, most conspicuous in the lower lobes.
Followup with chest CT in [**2-20**] months time after acute symptoms resolve would be standard.
Index of suspicion for underlying malignancy should guide the decision on the time interval to rescan.
More organized areas of consolidation, particularly in the right lower lobe could represent focal areas of infection, but peripheral consolidations in the left lower lobe could also represent infarction associated with pulmonary emboli.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Extensive vascular calcifications in the coronary arteries and mitral and aortic valves.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
ECG: Sinus rhythm Atrial premature complex Left anterior fascicular block Probable left ventricular hypertrophy Delayed R wave progression - may be left ventricular hypertrophy or possible prior anterior myocardial infarction ST-T wave abnormalities - could be left ventricular hypertrophy Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2119-1-15**], no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypoxia: The patient has multiple subsegmental PEs seen on CTA last night.
Aspiration PNA was also likely contributing to her hypoxia as there was some evidence of consolidation on chest CT.  She was initially on abx, then stopped, but restarted with levaquin upon review of this CT.
Though CHF may have been a small part of her hypoxia, given that her hypoxia resolved without diuresis, this is less likely.
In addition, chest CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules which had a broad ddx.
Hypotension likely from volume depletion as she responded well to IVF overnight.
Other etiology of hypotension could be from PE but this is unlikely given patient does not appear to have large central PE on CT scan.
3) Hyponatremia: Patient with chronic hyponatremia.
On previous admission her Na was 122 and improved to 128 after diuresis, felt hyponatremia secondary to volume overload.
On this admission, sodium improved with IVF so likely hypovolemic component.
4) Cardiac; Patient with recent STEMI in [**12-18**] that was medically managed.
Also patient with CHF and LVEF of 40%.
Once hypotension resolved, restarted beta blocker at low dose atenolol 12.5 mg daily.
She did not have any significant clinical volume overload though BNP was elevated.
ACE-I held as was hyperkalemic but will need to be restarted in next several days if BP remains stable and hyperkalemia resovles.
5) FEN: Patient evaluated in past by speech and swallow, Pureed diet, pills whole with thin liquids.
Zinc Sulfate  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: On [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: 1) Chronic PEs 2) Pneumonia 3) CHF  SECONDARY: 1) Aortic stenosis 2) CAD 3) Chronic hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Good.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**] if you have fevers, chills, worsening breathing, or any other symptoms that concern you.
