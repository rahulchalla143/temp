She developed acute onset of severe left hip pain [**8-30**] the night prior to admission.
She  suffers chronic bone pain from bone metastases but this was significantly worse.
She had no history of trauma or falls.
Intra-op course was complicated by 750 cc blood loss and hypotension requiring 1L NS, 2 units of PRBCs.
Patient also had her lovenox restarted.
Onc history: Left breast cancer diagnosed in [**2124-6-20**] with three positive nodes and underwent lumpectomy followed by Cytoxan and Adriamycin.
In [**2126-3-22**] she was diagnosed with a vetebral metastatic lesion and at the same time was also diagnosed with colorectal cancer for which she underwent excision.
Right pathologic proximal femur fracture s/p ORIF [**2128-4-8**], s/p XRT 2.
Goiter with hypothyroidism 3.
Hypertension 4.
Anxiety disorder 5.
Rectal cancer 7.
Admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**5-27**] for hyertensive emergency after presented with dyspnea, course complicated by NSTEMI 8.
S/P L hip ORIF on [**6-16**] complicated by hypotension and hemorrhage on lovenox requiring 4 units of PRBCs in 24 hours.
Family History: FH: Fa died at 73 of CAD Mo died at 97  Physical Exam: sentences HEENT - anicteric, MMM Neck - JVD @ 8 cm, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - no crackles at bases appreciated CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, [**1-27**] HSM at apex Abd - + BS, SNT/ND, no hsm appreciated Extr - Neuro - Alert and oriented x 3 no focal deficits appreciated Skin - No rashes .
Limited examination for detection of subtle fracturs due to diffuse extensive metastatic disease.
Given this limitation, there is no evidence for acute femoral neck fracture.
Subacute fracture through the left greater trochanter and left iliac crest, better evaluated on the CT of [**2128-6-12**].
Surrounding right hip joint fluid is most likely postoperative in nature.
Fibroid uterus.
No acute abnormality is detected including no hemorrhage or hydrocephalus or herniation.
There has been interval decrease in the size of midline shift.
Multiple metastatic foci within the both occipital lobes and both frontal lobes appear unchanged.
Multiple bony lytic lesions within the left frontal bone, right temporal bone and right side of C1 appear unchanged.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity and underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded in this location.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly prominent.
There is no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
There is increased density to the bony structures, (particularly the ribs and the proximal right humerus) consistent with known blastic metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 71 Year old female with metastatic breast cancer to the brain, spine, pelvis and femur admitted with left hip pain.
Sheound to have an impending pathologic fracture and went to the OR on [**6-16**].
Surgery was complicated by hypotension requiring pressors and dropping hematocrit.
She was felt to be bleeding into hip so she was taken back to the OR on [**6-17**] to cauterize small arterial bleed in mid-thigh.
She developed delerium during the hospital stay thought to be due to polypharmacy (opioids, klonipin, steroids) and possible pneumonia.
Impending hip fracture, s/p ORIF.
Left hip MRI showed an avulsion fracture of the greater trochanter and an iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture, both of which were subacute.
Following surgery, she was hypotensive requiring pressors, had decreased urine output, falling hematocrit and increased tension in her left hip.
She was thought to be bleeding at surgical site in her left hip so was taken back to the OR on [**6-17**] for caterization of small arterial bleed.
Patient became delerious on [**6-16**].
Delerium was thought to be due to benzos, opioids, and anxiety of surgery.
Delerium may be due to use Klonapin, high doses of opioids, and steroids (for WBRT)in a patient with brain metastases.
Furthermore, the patient developed a rising [**Known lastname **] count and CXR could not rule out a retrocardiac opacity, suggesting that PNA could be contributing to delerium.
Patient also has hyponatremia due to SIADH.
A head CT did not show an acute cause of mental status changes.
's pain was controlled with Oxycontin and oxycodone PRNs.
Patient reports left foot numbness and has [**2-23**] strengh on dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of left foot that is unchanged from previous Rad Onc note.
MRI of the lumbar spine confirmed there was no change from previous MRI of the spine and showed NO cord compression.
Hypertension was well controlled with the exception of hypotension following surgery.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] has metastatic breast cancer with metastases to the brain and bones.
Her cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated following surgery and her post-op EKG showed ST depressions in the setting of hypotension.
Small troponin leak is likely due to demand ischemia.
Patient became edematous following surgery because she was given a significant amount of fluids to keep her blood pressure and urine output stable.
Patient developed Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on [**2128-6-23**].
She will not be fully anticoagulated at present because of recent hip surgery, but is getting prophylactic lovenox and baby aspirin.
