Brielfy, patient reported difficulty swallowing and increasing shortness of breath in the past few months.
Was evaluted for dysphagia via EGD which only showed gastritis.
Also reports progressive dyspnea with functional capacity limited to a single flight of stairs.
On the day of admission, she felt worsening dyspnea and palpitations without chest pain, fevers, syncope, chills, nausea, vomitting.
CTA chest was negative for PE, but revealed large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules.
She was initially on diltiazem drip which was transitioned to oral diltiazem on the floor, during which time she was in NSR  Today patietn underwent bronchoscopy which revealed near total collapse of the left mainstem bronchus and 50% collapse of the bronchus intermedius.

Cells are negative for cytokeratin AE1/3  IMAGES/STUDIES:  ECG [**2104-5-9**]: Atrial flutter with variable ventricular response or atrial fibrillation.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
TRACING #1  ECG [**2104-5-9**]: Atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation with a controlled response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
TRACING #3   CXR [**2104-5-9**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The mediastinal contour is markedly abnormal, with right tracheal deviation and right paratracheal abnormal soft tissue density.
There is left main stem bronchus narrowing and subcarinal soft tissue fullness.
A 2 cm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule and smaller right middle lobe nodular opacity are consistent with the history of melanoma.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia.
Within the limits of chest radiography, no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified.
Pulmonary metastases, severe mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to melanoma.
CXR [**2104-5-10**]: IMPRESSION: Improved right lung consolidation could have been due to aspiration.
Extremely large retrotracheal mediastinal adenopathy, obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, resulting in left lower lobe collapse.
Large pulmonary metastases in the right upper and middle lobes.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of metastatic disease is noted within the abdomen and pelvis.
The large conglomerate of lymph nodes in the subcarinal location is compatible with metastatic disease.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**5-15**] No significant abnormalities are seen on MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium  CT Chest [**5-28**] 1)Interval development of patchy consolidation in the right upper and right middle lobe is most likely due to radiotherapy and a small right pleural effusion is now moderately large, the left pleural effusion has slightly increased and remains small.
2)Slight improvement in the right main and left mainstem bronchial narrowing which remains severe.
Unchanged extent of the left-sided pleural effusion with unchanged left atelectasis.
Unchanged right hilar mass and right upper enlargement of the mediastinum.
No evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY 51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**], presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, weight loss found to have large mediastinal mass that completely collapsed her left main-stem bronchus.
She was admitted to the ICU after she required intubation for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.
She remained intubated for the duration of her hospitalization, save for multiple self-extubations with subsequent respiratory failure on non-invaive ventillation.
BY PROBLEM # Mediastinal Mass: She was admitted to ICU following brochoscopy where she remained intubated given the findings of significant compression to the left mainstem bronchus with bleeding periprocedurally.
Pathology from the endobronchial ultrasound was consistent with malignant melanoma.
She was admitted to the ICU after she required intubation for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.
She remained intubated for the duration of her hospitalization, except for several self-extubations with subsequent respiratory failure on non-invaive ventillation.
# Pneumonia: She developed fever of over 102, increased respiratory rate, and copious thick secretions on hospital day 2.
There was evidence of left lower lobe infiltrate possibly due to post-obstructive pneumonia.
Vancomycin was discontinued and she finished a 10 day course of unasyn without recurrence.
# Atrial Flutter: On the floor, She had an episode of rapid ventricular rate post-procedurally and was started on PO diltiazem.
