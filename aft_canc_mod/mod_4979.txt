Admission Date:  [**2117-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-12-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-7-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: right lung mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsies Laryngoscopy with vocal cord biopsy   History of Present Illness: 76F with little PMH, lifelong smoker, admitted to OSH with chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea; now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of R lung and vocal cord masses.
Also reported chest pain.
Her husband reports that though she has not specifically been complaining of shortness of breath prior, but for at least a month prior he had been noting that she might be dyspneic.
Family has noted raspy voice for several years without much recent change.
ROS also notable for 30# weight loss over last 6 months despite good PO intake; also with intermittent L leg swelling x months.
Her husband described that she complained of a gagging and choking sensation that caused her to feel like she need to throw up.
She had a chest CT without PE but this did show RLL mass.
She therefore had bronchoscopy today; during the procedure was found to have large vocal cord mass.
Her vocal cord and endobronchial masses were both biopsied.
In the MICU, the patient's antibiotics were changed to clinda and CTX to cover necrotizing pneumonia since CT showed gas in collapsed RLL.
Both recommended steroids for airway edema and taking to OR for biopsies.
Airway edema persisted so she was maintained on steroids.
She was extubated on [**12-11**] without difficulty.
On [**12-12**] she did have some agonal breathing while sleeping but this resolved upon awakening.
ENT plans to perform laryngoscopy to biopsy mass and assess airway edema.
On presentation to the floor patient had no complaints.

Family History: Brother had some type of primary pulmonary issue (details unclear).
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with some decreased air entry at R base and occ inspiratory rhonchi posteriorly, no accessory muscle usage CV: Regular rhythm, normal rate, normal S1 + S2, soft SM at LUSB without radiation.
Abdomen: soft, obese, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds, without masses, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII grossly intact, no focal deficits appreciated   Pertinent Results: [**2117-12-7**] 08:15PM   WBC-13.1* RBC-3.13* HGB-7.9* HCT-26.8* MCV-86 MCH-25.4* MCHC-29.6* RDW-14.9 [**2117-12-7**] 08:15PM   NEUTS-84.1* LYMPHS-7.7* MONOS-8.0 EOS-0 BASOS-0.2 [**2117-12-7**] 08:15PM   GLUCOSE-113* UREA N-15 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-4.0 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-32 ANION GAP-6 [**2117-12-7**] 08:15PM   CALCIUM-7.9* PHOSPHATE-1.9* MAGNESIUM-1.6 IRON-13* [**2117-12-7**] 08:15PM   ALT(SGPT)-5 AST(SGOT)-14 LD(LDH)-69* CK(CPK)-12* ALK PHOS-66 TOT BILI-0.2 [**2117-12-7**] 08:15PM   calTIBC-140* VIT B12-328 FOLATE-4.9 FERRITIN-346* TRF-108*  [**2117-12-7**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
[**2117-12-7**] CXR: No previous images.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
There is increased opacification at the right base, most likely consistent with effusion and atelectasis.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2117-12-8**] LENIs: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
The subglottic lesion is not seen on this study, which may relate to presence of the endotracheal tube.Recommend repeat study after extubation.
Right pleural effusion.
Known heterogeneous 5.3 cm x 5.1 cm cystic and solid mass predominantly centered within the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe.
Associated mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes as detailed above with the largest being a subcarinal lymph node measuring up to 12 mm in short axis.
Suspicious rim-enhancing foci in the spleen, the largest of which measures 13 mm and a second focus which measures 8 mm as detailed above.
No focal liver lesions are identified.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, also with fluid tracking along the right major fissure.
No evidence for intracranial metastatic disease.
Chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease without acute findings.
Diffusely hypointense bone marrow signal is present without focal abnormality.
The findings may relate to anemia versus a variety of other etiologies and should be correlated with patient's history.
Brief Hospital Course: 76yo F with h/o tobacco use admitted from OSH with vocal cord lesion - likely benign - and RLL lung mass - concerning for squamous cell carcinoma.
Lung Mass: The patient presented from an outside hospital with a lesion in her right lower lobe.
A CXR was taken which was significant for a mass in the RLL.
A CT was done which showed a cystic mass.
The patient had biopsies of the mass taken via bronchoscopy at the OSH.
The pathology of these lesions were "very concerning for malignancy".
She presented with a significant oxygen requirement requiring ICU admission.
These were negative for malignant cells.
The MRI of the head had no evidence for mets.
Thoracic surgery was consulted to get tissue for a definitive diagnosis.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need to have a tissue diagnosis and PET scan prior to hematology oncology evaluation.
She had no signs of fevers and her oxygen requirement had improved at time of discharged.
Vocal Cord mass: The patient also had a mass on her vocal cords.
Bradycaredia: The patient had asymptomatic bradycardia at night.
Likely secondary to malignancy.
Elevated PTT/INR: Possibly secondary to malnutrition.
Pneumonia 3.
Vocal cord polyp 5.
Hypoxemia  Secondary Diagnosis: 1.
Tobacco abuse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from another hospital for evaluation of a lung mass.
You were treated with antibiotics and were extubated without difficulty.
You also had a polyp on your vocal cord which was biopsied and appears benign.
You had an MRI which was negative for signs of metastatic lesions in your brain.
You had a CT torso which showed a suspicious lesion in your spleen.
Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs by mouth as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze 2.
