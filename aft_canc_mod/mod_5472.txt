Per her daughter she has been doing very poorly in the past 2 weeks with increasing abdominal pain, N/V, poor PO intake.
She underwent an ERCP on [**6-12**] with an ulcerated mass and pus noted at the major papilla with unsuccessful cannulation of CBD.
She had received 5 UFFP for an elevated INR >2.
She remained hypotensive with SBP 80-90s post procedure and throughout the evening and morning of [**6-13**].
Upon transfer to floor, within 1-2 hours her SBP dropped to 64/40, she was placed in T-[**Doctor Last Name **], hypoxia noted 85% RA.
She was put on a NRB, received 1.5L NS with minimal response SBP 70s and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and closer monitoring despite DNR/DNI code status.

Ulcerated mass in the major papilla 2.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was unsuccessful using a free-hand technique due to the ampullary tumor .
ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT  [**2199-6-12**] 3:26 PM Opacification of the biliary tree or the pancreatic duct was seen.
PTBD  [**2199-6-13**] 2:01 PM IMPRESSION: Left percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrated distal CBD obstruction with dilatation of CBD and both intrahepatic ducts.
Left external PTBD with 8-French pig tail catheter with tip in CBD.
When LFT's and cholangitis have improved after a few days on external drainage, we could attempt to internal-external drainage tube placement or internal biliary stent placement as inpatient or SDA procedure if patient is discharged.
US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2199-6-13**] 8:36 AM A limited portable study was performed to assess for biliary dilatation.
Intrahepatic ducts are also noted to be diffusely dilated with the proximal CBD measuring approximately 1.2 cm and intrahepatic ducts measuring up to 10 mm.
A distinct gall bladder was not identified.
Limited examination of the liver parenchyma was otherwise unremarkable with no focal masses identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo F with a h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and inoperable ampullary cancer s/p ERCP w/CBD stent placement in [**2197**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-12**] for palliative ERCP to treat recurrent obstructive jaundice, transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension.
Pt has been hypotensive since admission with several SBP measures in the 60's with highest SBPs in the 90's with fluid resuscitation.
This is most likely biliary septic shock given pus noted on ERCP, fevers, elevated WBC w/left shift, hypotension, and borderline tachycardia.
She has also been receiving tylenol PR for low grade fevers as well as ativan as needed for agitation.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day: [**Month (only) 116**] use elixir form for sublingual dosing.
6. med Haldol 0.5-2mg Sublingual q 4 hours PRN agitation (liquid form) 7.
