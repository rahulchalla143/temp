Admission Date:  [**2172-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-4-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor / Amoxicillin / Erythromycin Base / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Procainamide / Zocor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: C. diff colitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old gentleman with a history of prostate cancer currently undergoing hormonal therapy, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation not on aspirin/plavix only, PAD, who presents with a one-day history of feeling poorly and fever.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with dysuria/hematuria where he was in the ICU initially and called out to [**Hospital Ward Name **] hospitalist.
He was found to have UTI with quinolone-resistant E. coli and proteus organisms and treated with 10-day course of cefepime which ended on [**2172-3-22**].
He began feeling "lousy" last night, at which time he had some transient SOB and chills (of note, he has recently been using O2 by NC at [**Hospital1 1501**] at nights).
He also noticed dry cough this morning, although this has been "on and off" for several weeks.
He had an episode of loose stool last week while on antibiotics, but last BM was yesterday and normal, no blood.
He has occasional dysuria which has been attributed to pain from urethral strictures that occurs on occasion (brief episode yesterday, now resolved).
He also had some "aching" left upper arm pain that came on suddenly yesterday and has been off and on.

Studies: [**2172-3-24**] Portable AP CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2172-3-26**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT): IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings, no evidence of new acute infiltrates.
[**2172-4-4**] Radiology RENAL U.S.: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old M with multiple medical problems including prostate cancer, dCHF, CAD s/p stents, PAD, COPD who presented with fever and hypotension concerning for early sepsis.
On HOD5 the pt was found to be C. diff positive and started PO vancomycin.
#) C. Diff colitis The patient's initial presentation of hypotension in the setting of fever was concerning for possible sepsis.
He was begun on vancomycin and cefepime for emperic coverage of suspected infection (HOD1).
Due to continued hemodynamic stability, the patient was transferred to the floor on HOD3.
On HOD5 the pt had his first BM in the hospital, which was found to be C. diff positive.
C. diff infection unified the pt's LLQ tenderness, recent h/o antibiotics, recent h/o diarrhea, and episodic fevers.
He improved quickly with PO vancomycin, and remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile for the remainder of this admission.
- recommend continuing PO vancomycin to finish 14 day course (last day of treatment [**2172-4-12**]) - recommend C. Diff precautions - recommend serial abdominal exams and standing aggressive bowel regimen .
#) Hypoxia: Review of records in OMR reveal PFTs with obstructive pattern consistent with emphysema in [**2164**].
Patient was not aware of this diagnosis nor is he on medications at home for COPD, so it seems that prior symptoms have been mild.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not complain of subjective SOB and was able to maintain O2 sats in the mid-to-upper 90s on room air after admission to the ICU (was 92% on arrival to the ED).
On HOD3 the patient began to have an increasing O2 requirement.
His dyspnea slowly improved with diuresis, and serial CXRs remained reassuring against pneumonia or florid pulmonary edema.
- Recommend continuing albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN for wheezing or shortness of breath .
#) Acute on chronic renal failure Creatinine on admission was at the upper end (1.7) of recent baseline range of 1.3 to 1.7.
This was likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of hypotension and chronic diastolic heart failure.
Due to worsening peripheral edema, crackles on exam, and increasing O2 requirement, lasix was restarted on HOD3.
It was felt that the pt was hypovolumic given bland sedement and low FeUrea.
He was transfused 2 units of pRBC (HOD12-13) given his need for intravascular volume and pre-existing baseline anemia.
#) Anemia Hct was 27 on admission which is stable from his recent discharge.
#) Leukopenia Likely secondary to demargination in a setting of poor physiologic reserve.
Given his h/o anemia, possible underlying component of MDS.
#) History of recurrent UTIs Will likely remain a problem with future care given indwelling foley.
With diuresis the patient's hypoxia resolved, and his signs of heart failure improved.
He was given 2 units of pRBC HOD13-14 for ARF on CKD and tolerated the additional volume well.
He is not anticoagulated given his history of recurrent falls.
#) CAD Status post [**2152**] BMS to mid RCA, [**2164**] DES to mid RCA.
No evidence of acute ischemic change on EKG.
#) Right Heal Ulcer Appears to be healing well.
Waffle boots were used to minimize pressure sores on this admission.

You were admitted to the hospital because of fever and low blood pressure.
You were found to have an infection in your colon by a bacteria called C. difficile.
Also during this admission you had worsening kidney function which is likely a result of multiple causes including the infection in your colon, and the diureses you require for treatment of chronic heart disease.
Given your heart condition, please maintain a low salt diet (less than 2 grams of sodium per day).
