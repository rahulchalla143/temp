Admission Date:  [**2150-11-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2150-11-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2101-5-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a history of familial dysautonomia and metastatic lung cancer.
The patient presented to the Emergency Room following a brief syncopal episode that was preceded by acute shortness of breath.
The patient states that he had not had any pulmonary symptoms prior to [**2150-9-6**] when he developed acute shortness of breath, for which he was seen at [**Hospital3 **].
He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion at that time.
A pleurocentesis yielded a malignant fluid that was later diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma.
A follow-up CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed metastases to the liver.
He went to dinner with his parents and shortly after, he started to complain of increasing shortness of breath that was not relieved by his home oxygen.
There was no head trauma, seizure activity, bowel or bladder incontinence.
The patient denies any chest pain, chest tightness.
He also denies any recent weight gain or increased swelling in the lower extremities.
Their only description was that the patient just had increased breathing efforts.
It is a progressive sensorimotor neuropathy where the patient tends to lose reflexes, hypotonia, decreased perception of pain and temperature, orthostatic hypotension, and swallowing dysfunction.
3) Adenocarcinoma of unknown origin, presumed to be lung cancer with metastases to the liver.
His urinalysis revealed trace proteins and greater than 250 glucose.
His EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 110 beats per minute; normal axis; left ventricular hypertrophy; a left atrial abnormality; T wave inversion in leads III and V6; Q waves in V4 and V5; normal intervals.
His chest x-ray revealed:  Severe kyphoscoliosis, an ill-defined opacity at the right lung base.
CT of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli.
A large consolidation of the right lung base with air bronchograms, suggestive of pneumonia.
There was also a smaller possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
Marked rotary scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
Multiple sclerotic foci in the lower thoracic vertebral bodies that could represent metastases.
There was mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation was seen.
The mitral valve appeared structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There was trivial pericardial effusion.
He was in minor respiratory distress on a nonrebreather mask.
He had decreased reflexes in the upper and lower extremities.
His chest showed severe kyphoscoliosis.
There were rales and rhonchi throughout the entire right lung.
The patient also had egophony on the right side.
He had rales and rhonchi in the lower half of the left chest.
He was without rebound tenderness, or tenderness to deep palpation.
The patient had +2 edema in the left leg, +1 pedal edema in the right leg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 49-year-old male with a history of familial dysautonomia and lung cancer who presented with an acute onset of dyspnea.
The dyspnea appeared to be due to a number of factors, to include decreased compliance due to his kyphoscoliosis; a large pleural effusion; possible aspiration pneumonia; anemia; and questionable myocardial dysfunction.
Due to his autonomic dysfunction, the patient was repleted with several IV boluses for a total of 2.5 liters.
In discussion with the patient's oncologist, this precipitous drop was consistent with the nadir expected with his chemotherapy regimen.
4) Pulmonary edema believed to be of cardiac origin.
