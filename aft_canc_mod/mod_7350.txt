Only alleviating factor is prednisone, which he has taken occasionally for gout, and he notes that his abdominal pain resolves completely.
His son is also concerned about that he has been "slow" and confused lately.

There is subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.
Mild elevation of left hemidiaphragm appears unchanged.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
No areas of focal consolidation are demonstrated.
There are no acutely displaced rib fractures visualized.
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study.
No acute intrathoracic process demonstrated.
-CT head ([**2162-4-23**]): No evidence of acute intracranial process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Focal inflammatory changes of the sigmoid colon likely represent acute exacerbation of Crohn's colitis.
Colonoscopy is recommended after remission of acute process to exclude underlying mass lesion.
Diffuse regular thickening of the gastric and small bowel folds is consistent with bowel wall edema likely from hypoproteinemia or portal hypertension.
Fatty infiltration of the liver associated with signs of portal hypertension including a splenorenal shunt and small volume ascites.
More severe chronic liver disease such as hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis may be present and clinical correlation is advised.
-TTE ([**2162-4-26**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Other Diffuse erythema, congestion, friability and superficial ulceration of the mucosa more severe from the rectum to mid-descending colon.
The remainder of the descending colon, transverse and ascending colon had patchy disease.
This is consistent with crohn's colitis.
Impression: Polyp in the ascending colon (polypectomy) Diffuse erythema, congestion, friability and superficial ulceration of the mucosa more severe from the rectum to mid-descending colon.
The remainder of the descending colon, transverse and ascending colon had patchy disease.
This is consistent with crohn's colitis.

?s flare with hypotension secondary to likely hypovolemia.
At admission, he was likely hypovolemic from GI losses and poor PO intake prior to admission.
There was also concern for sepsis and he was started on Cipro/Flagyl to cover for GI sources.
A TTE was obtained which did not show any significant cardiac dysfunction.
# Crohn's flare: As above, he was started on Cipro/Flagyl and continued on mesalamine.
The patient was found to have new disease in terminal ileum, and will likely initiate an immunomodulator as an outpatient.
#  Macrocytic, normochromic anemia: Treated empirically with IM vitamin B12 given macrocytis anemia and Crohn's disease.
Anemia of chronic disease likely also contributing.
# Fatty liver: INR elevated to 1.7 at admission and albumin was also 1.7.
Also found to have evidence of fatty liver disease on his CT this admission.
# ?HIT: During this admission, the patient's platelets were trending down and he developed a clot at the site of his PICC line.
There was concern for HIT, and the patient's SC heparin was stopped.
Because of psoriasis and LE edema, the patient could not tolerate Pneumaboots.
Given his increased risk of venous thromboembolism given his underlying IBD, the patient was started on fondaparinux.
His PF4 Ab test became positive at 1.44 and he was resumed on fondaparinux for treatment of HITT with outpatient followup with no major rectal bleeding.
Given his IBD, it is acceptable for him to have a small amount of bloody stools but should large amount of bleeding occur, one must consider relationship to anticoagulation.
# Elevated INR: No evidence of hemolysis, making DIC less concerning.
Possibly [**1-7**] poor nutrition (albumin 1.7 on admission) and lack of absorption [**1-7**] crohn??????s.

It is likely that you will need to start another medication, as imaging from this admission showed that your Crohn's disease is spreading.
