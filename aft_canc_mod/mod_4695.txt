Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2117-12-9**]):    NO GROWTH.
ECG:  low voltages, sinus rhythm 58 bpm, normal axis,  QTc 457, <1mm ST elevation in III, aVF in the setting of low voltages.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
At least mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after interleukin treatment due to renal cell cancer with hypotension.
Current study demonstrates interval development of bilateral perihilar interstitial process consistent with pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable given the low lung volumes and portable technique, but note is made of the distension of the azygos vein that might be in part due to volume overload.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid septum and anterior wall.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right ventricle appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study (RV not well seen on prior).
The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.
There is unchanged opacity with air bronchograms at both lung bases, right more than left, associated with minimal pleural effusions.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented for high dose IL-2 biotherapy on [**2116-11-22**] and transferred to the ICU for hypotension.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to IL-2 induced myocarditis as well as IL-2 therapy itself.
Regarding IL-2, treatment was stopped on [**2116-11-26**] due to lethargy and fatigue.
An echo was ordered, which was without sign of pericardial effusion.
Hypotension improved shortly after arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She continued to have hypotension on day 1 on the floors to systolic 80s, asymptomatic.
She was afebrile, and had no other symptoms consistent with SIRS.
Myocarditis treated with supportive care as unable to give to NSAIDS in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
Cards consulted as patient seen to have increasing ectopy as well as runs of ventricular tachycardia on [**11-29**].
She was doing well on the [**Hospital1 **] until [**12-3**] when Code Blue was called whereupon the patient developed unstable VT (monomorphic with 1 short period of polymorphic), chest compressions were initiated, shock and 1 mg epinephrine then rhythm converted to VF, patient was re-shocked and regained pulse.
On arrival patient noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic - sterile femoral line was placed and patient was intubated and started on phenylephrine.
During peri-intubation period, the patient went in and out of unstable monomorphic VT and required 1 further shock.
She was monitored on telemetry without events.
She was completely chest pain free, and without shortness of breath or palpitations on the day of discharge.
# Acute systolic heart failure: As above, she developed a IL-2 induced myocarditis, and subsequent acute systolic heart failure.
TTE on [**12-3**] demonstrated depressed systolic function.
She will need to follow-up with Cardiology, and have repeat TTE in ~1month to assess for improvement of systolic heart failure.
# Metastatic RCC: She initially presented for initiation of IL-2 therapy.
Per the ICU team, did not appear to be an obstructive picture.
Likely IL-2 induced but likely compounded by hypotension s/p infusion.
She had no signs or symptoms of bleeding.
Iron studies showed elevated ferritin and low TIBC, suggestive of ACD.
# Elevated TSH: TSH was checked in the ICU, and found to be 13.
Given checked in the setting of acute illness, the importance is of unclear significance.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted for initiation of IL-2 therapy for renal cell cancer.
You also had an abnormal heart rhythm, requiring cardiac resuscitation.
However, given low blood pressure this was stopped.
Metoprolol is a similar medication, and beneficial in heart failure.
You had no signs of bleeding.
We think this is largely due to your renal cancer and inflammation.
