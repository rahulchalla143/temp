Able to name low and high frequency objects.
+ left/right mismatch.
No dyscalculia.
R visual field cut though not complete hemianopsia.

There is the suggestion of subependymal extension.
There is a second smaller peripherally enhancing nodule superomedially to the first in the high left parietal lobe measuring 10 x 12 x 13 mm.
Foci of susceptibility artifact within this lesion as well as foci of high T1 signal suggest the presence of blood products.
There is a rind of high signal on the diffusion-weighted images and low signal on the ADC map within the larger lesion.
A smaller lesion appears faintly bright on the diffusion-weighted images and low on ADC map.
There is approximately 6 mm of rightward shift of the septum pellucidum.
There is no evidence of acute infarct.
Apart from the areas of susceptibility described above, there is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There is cerebellar atrophy.
There is mild mucosal thickening within the frontal air and ethmoid air cells as well as the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneously enhancing mass with smaller satellite enhancing mass centered in the left parietal lobe with associated extensive vasogenic edema and mild shift of normally midline structures.
The appearance of the abnormalities is most consistent with a primary brain neoplasm such as a high-grade glioma.
A 5-mm pulmonary nodule within the right upper lobe and mildly prominent left axillary lymph node measuring up to 10 mm in short axis.
Otherwise, no evidence of primary tumor within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
fMRI [**3-13**]: IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of the previously described heterogeneous mass lesion centered at the left temporoparietal occipital lobes and unchanged smaller left parietal lesion with no significant changes in the interval.
The functional examination demonstrates dominance for the language at the left opercular region and the areas of activation are demonstrated at more than 1cm from the mass lesions.
The ASL sequence demonstrates avid pattern of perfusion in the circumference of the largest lesion and also punctate hyperperfusion on the left parietal lesion and the convexity.
Status post resection of the left parietotemporo-occipital lobar irregularly enhancing lesion with associated post-surgical change.
There is no appreciable enhancement above and beyond the intrinsic T1-hyperintensity to suggest residual tumor.
Persistent mass effect on the atrium of the left lateral ventricle and rightward shift of the normally-midline structures.
Recommend short-term interval follow-up for this lesion and to evaluate for recurrent disease at the post-operative site.
Sinus disease, as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 54M admitted to NEUROSURGERY after being found to have a left parietal mass.
CT and MRI of the head demonstrated a sizeable left pariteal mass, and it was decided to go forward with surgery to address.
CT torso was obtained, which did not reveal primary pathology; however a small pulmonary nodule was identified that is to be followed as an outpatient.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
DO NOT DRIVE until you have your visual field testing AND have been cleared by your surgeon.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**7-25**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
