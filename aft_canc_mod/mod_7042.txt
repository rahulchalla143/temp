There is no displaced fracture.
[**2164-11-15**] rib xray - There are nondisplaced and mildly displaced fractures of four contiguous left-sided ribs (the sixth through ninth ribs).
There is increased pleural density in this region which could reflect associated hematoma.

He was placed on bipap to help with his breathing which was particularly difficult given the need to balance treatment of his fracture pain with adequate mentation and respiratory effort.
The patient remained significantly acidemic with pH 7.1 and elevated CO2.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM PRIOR TO CMO STATUS: # Respiratory Distress: likely secondary to pain with splinting from rib pain resulting in ventilation and oxygenation deficits.
no fever or evidence for infection however with vomiting and altered mental status could have aspirated.
no pneumothorax on imaging.
other potentials could be PE however seems early in course for this and has no hemodynamic or ECG evidence for PE.
# Altered mental status/myoclonus: non-focal neuro exam and altered mental status has waxed and waned with the respiratory distress (i.e.
Will target improving Co2 status to improve mental status and myoclonus.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: likely pre-renal with component or post-renal given large bladder scan.
- UA, urine lytes showing likely pre-renal etiology with high osmol and low urine Na.
no evidence of head trauma per history or exam.
- monitor as above - low dose dilaudid for pain given renal impairment if needed - Acute pain service: no epidural due to plavix.
# CAD: no ischemic changes on EKG and negative enzymes x 2. however with new respiratory changes reasonable to re-cycle enzymes - cycle enzymes.
# CHF: appears dehydrated as shown in Hct, Cr, and mucous membranes.
