Yesterday ([**6-17**]), he developed new numbness and paresthesias from his waist down and significant increase in pain.
Review of systems is also positive for increased fatigue and worsening anorexia.
He denies loss of bowel or bladder control.
An MRI of the spine was obtained that revealed destructive lesions in the upper thoracic vertebral column and mechanical compression of the cord.

Family History: No history of lung cancer in family.
No evidence of clonus  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals stable, afebrile Cachectic appearing man, TLSO brace in place, able to transfer to wheelchair Awake and alert cooperative with exam Diminished sensation below umbilicus diminished muscular effort bilat, but no focal muscular deficits no focal cranial nerve deficits   Pertinent Results: MRI C/T/L SPINE ([**2130-6-18**]): Interval worsening of metastatic disease in the thoracic spine with near-complete compression of the T4 vertebral body and progression of compression at T5.
There is severe cord compression at T3-T4.
There is anterior epidural disease at T5 and T6.
There is a new kyphotic angulation with the apex at T4.
As seen on recent MR of the thoracic spine, severe compression fractures of T4 and T5 vertebral bodies with 2.1 cm lytic lesion in the T6 vertebral body.
All findings are consistent with metastatic disease from known lung carcinoma.
Diffuse involvement of the left hemithorax by lung carcinoma as described on recent CT chest.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes in the lateral leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-5-25**] no diagnostic change.
CXR [**2130-6-20**] Known total left lung collapse with deviation of the trachea and  mediastinum to the left is noted.
There are two nodular opacities within the right upper lobe and one projecting over the diaphragm in the right lower lobe that are consistent with CT findings.
No pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
SPINAL ANGIOGRAM [**2130-6-20**]  CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with lung cancer metastatic to T4, presenting with cord compression.
Preoperative tumor embolization is requested.
Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent with possible treatment with stent or coils if needed.
access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
Right common carotid artery.
Left common carotid artery.
FINDINGS:  Right common carotid artery:  No tumor blush or evidence of blood supply to tumor is identified from the right common carotid artery.
The carotid bifurcation is patent without evidence of stenosis.
Right subclavian artery:  No evidence of tumor supply or blush was seen from the right subclavian artery.
The artery is patent without evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
There is no pseudocyst or occlusion of the left subclavian artery.
Left vertebral artery:  There is no stenosis or occlusion of the left vertebral artery, which originates from the left subclavian artery.
No evidence of tumor supply was seen from the left vertebral artery.
Left common carotid artery:  No evidence of tumor blood supply was seen from the left common carotid artery.
The carotid bifurcation is patent without evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
Right T7 intercostal artery:  No evidence of tumor supply was seen from this vessel.
No evidence of tumor supply was seen from injection at this level.
Right common femoral artery angiogram was performed through the sheath after procedure was performed, which demonstrated widely patent right common femoral artery.
The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
IMPRESSION:  Embolization of right T5 intercostal artery utilizing 2 x 3 mm Vertx pushable coils for embolization of metastatic disease to the vertebral body.
Complete opacification of the left hemithorax and Port-A-Cath are again seen.
There is no evidence of large hematoma at the surgical site.
The remaining screws are fully contained within the bone with no lucency surrounding them.
[**2130-6-27**] Video Swallow Gross aspiration with nectar-thickened and thin liquids.
Numerous right pulmonary nodules are increased in size since the [**2130-5-25**] chest CT examination, concerning for neoplastic progression.
Neighboring ground-glass opacities could be seen with an inflammatory reaction; although infection is difficult to exclude, organizing pneumonia after chemotherapy is fairly common.
New right adrenal metastasis.
New left iliac lytic mass, likely metastasis.
Detailed paraspinal assessment is limited due to streak artifacts.
Loss of the bordering fat plane between the distal esophagus and the thoracic soft tissue mass.
Unchanged appearance of complete left lung collapse and neighboring moderate pleural effusion.
[**2130-6-28**] No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity.
[**7-1**] Abd Xray- IMPRESSION:  Air is seen throughout the colon, but no colonic distention is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 yo M with h/o stage IV squamous cell lung carcinoma with known mets to T4 who presents with two days of leg weakness and paresthesias below the waist, found to have near-complete T4 vertebral body compression and severe cord compression at T3-T4.
Post embolization, the groin site appeared normal and there was minimal s-s drainage.
Chronic pain service was consulted..SDU orders were written.
[**Date range (1) 9459**]: The patient was unable to tolerate a diet and a NG was unable to be placed secondary to compression on esophagus.
The patient continued to have postoperative pain and chronic pain management was consulted.
The patient was fitted for a post-surgical brace and made progress with physical therapy.
On [**6-26**] the patient stated that the CTLSO brace was very uncomfortable and as such we called NEOPS to come and evalaute the brace for a better fit.
Pain service recommeded adding a basal rate for morphine overnight to improve overnight pain control.
On [**6-27**] he had a CT torso that showed a new adrenal and ilaic lesion and post-op changes.
He failed speach and Swalloe eval and was taken to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had a endoscopic PEG palcement under general anesthesia.
He intermittently complained of back pain and at times some chest discomfort.
EKG showed some ST depression in the inferior leads.
He was noted to be tachycardic in the PACU and EKG showed some ST depressions in the lateral leads, increased from baseline.
He had high residuals multiple times and they had to be held though.
On [**7-1**] His pain was well controlled on the new PO regimen.
He was initially thought to be tolerating his tube feeds at the new goal, but in the afternoon he had high residuals (thick consistency & fowl smelling).
His pain was well controlled.
