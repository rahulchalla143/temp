CXR [**2180-8-17**]: IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of a right-sided pleural effusion which is large.
Haziness of the right sided pulmonary vasculature suggests asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Probable small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Unchanged large right-sided pleural effusion.
Findings suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema involving the right lung.
No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic pathology.
Unchanged enhancing left renal mass which is most likely a renal cell carcinoma.
Echocardiogram [**2180-8-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97527**] is an 85 year old male with renal cell carcinoma, end stage renal disease on HD, atrial fibrillation not on coumadin [**12-27**] fall risk, mild dementia who presented from home with abdominal pain and fatigue.
Pain was diffuse and not associated with other symptoms with the exception of worsening abdominal distention and ascites.
Abdominal and pelvis CT scan was negative for acute pathology.
Pain resolved spontaneously.
He had no signs or symptoms of infection.
He had no signs of cardiac ischemia.
He had a mildly elevated lactate which resolved with hydration.
He had an echocardiogram which showed a mildly depressed EF compared to priors but was otherwise not significantly changed.
He did have one transient episode of blood pressures in the 70s systolic during hemodialysis during which time he was asymptomatic and his hypotension resolved with a small fluid bolus.
Acute on Chronic Right Sided Heart Failure:  Patient was noted to have gross ascites, right sided pleural effusion, and worsening hypoxia in the setting of getting IVF.
His oxygen requirement improved with dialysis.
Ascites:  Patient had a diagnostic paracentesis in the emergency room with a SAAG of > 1.1 and no evidence of SBP.
Echocardiogram during this hospitalization showed mildly decreased LVEF compared to priors with severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
History of Clostridium Difficile:  No recent diarrhea but has had multiple recurrences and is on chronic PO vancomycin which was continued.
He had two stool samples which were negative for clostridium difficle.
End Stage Renal Disease on dialysis:  He received dialysis according to his usual scheduled.
As above, he has significant ascites and right sided pleural effusions which are chronic which will be managed with dialysis as an outpatient.
Not anticoagulated secondary to fall risk.
Renal Cell Carcinoma:  Patient is s/p resection of renal cell carcinoma in [**2172**], now with new lesion on CT scan followed by urology.
Left Chest Lesion:  During this hospitalization he noted that he had a hard protrusion from his left lower rib cage.
Initially he noted that this finding was new, but later reported that it has been present for many years.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] park  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Ascites Hypotension End stage renal disease NSVT   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for your abdominal pain and fatigue.
You had a diagnostic paracentesis which was negative for SBP and a CT scan which showed fluid in your abdomen but otherwise no acute abnormalities.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizzines, chest pain, difficulty breathing, worsening abdominal pain or distension, unexplained weight gain or any other concerning symptoms.
