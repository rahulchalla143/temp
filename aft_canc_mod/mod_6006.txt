Admission Date:  [**2168-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-8-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 96131**] is an 81 yo WF with adenocarcinoma of the lung, metastatic to the brain and liver on Tarceva, now presenting from her nursing home with sepsis.
At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, was noted to have decreased appetite for the last 2 days, then was found to be acutely SOB with SpO2 of 78% on RA.
In early [**2162**], she developed a single frontal lobe metastatic lesion that was resected and treated with radiation therapy.
Following her radiation therapy over the next number of months, she never truly recovered and was felt to have a significant post-radiation encephalopathy.
She had been in the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since that time, but over the latter part of [**2166**] and the early part of [**2167**], she deteriorated clinically, becoming less alert, with poor appetite, weight loss, and somewhat less interactive.
She was found to have lesions in the liver and was started on tarceva for palliation.
Asthma 3.
Hiatal hernia 5.
Pulmonary emboli s/p IVC filter placement [**2162**] 9.
Depression   Social History: Permanent resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Multiple loops of edematous small bowel as well as the splenic flexure and descending colon consistent with enterocolitis.
No superior mesenteric or portal venous gas identified.
Findings are more likely consistent with infectious etiology.
Posterior right hepatic irregular hypodense lesion corresponds to large hepatic metastasis seen on ultrasound [**Month (only) **] [**2167**].
The possibility of superinfection cannot be excluded.
Multiple small hypodense lesions of the spleen may represent metastatic involvement or infectious foci.
Moderate hiatal hernia appears similar to [**2162-7-8**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 96131**] is an 81 YO WF with a history of metastatic NSCLC p/w sepsis.
An abdominal CT was obtained, remarkable for diffuse bowel wall thickening consistent with colitis.
Blood cultures 1/4 bottles returned positive for GPC in clusters, and urine grew GBS.
Given the presence of edematous small bowel on CT scan, her stool was screened for c. diff toxin, and she was continued on Flagyl empiricially.
Given her poor prognosis, and after discussion with the family, it was understood that she would be DNR/DNI, no pressors, no CVL, but family wished to continue antibiotics and steroids.
1) SEPSIS - Included in the differential for the source of her sepsis are infectious colitis vs. urosepsis vs. other unknown source.
Given her clinical history of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and edematous bowel on abdominal CT, colitis was considered to be the most likely source.
Ms. [**Known lastname 96131**] was treated with Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for 7 days prior to discharge for presumed sepsis secondary to enterocolitis.
Her surveillance urine culture returned without growth; however, her blood cultures revealed 1 out of 4 coagulase-negative staphylococcus, likely secondary to contamination.
Of note, she had no positive result for c. diff toxin in her stool.
2) Adrenal Insufficiency - A baseline cortisol was elevated at 41.5, without a rise following cosyntropin (although timing of blood test questionable).
3) NSTEMI - During her ICU course her cardiac biomarkers without notable EKG changes.
4) Metastatic lung cancer -  The plan for Mrs.[**Known lastname 96132**] care was considered extensively in the setting of her terminal illness with very poor prognosis.
At time of discharge, she was responsive to stimuli and minimally interactive.
Her pain was palliated throughout hospitalization with IV morphine and carefully titrated to match her needs.
At discharge, palliative care was decided to be the primary goal, although her family still desired ongoing treatment of her infection with IV antibiotics.
7) FEN: Patient is unable to tolerate PO medications or nutrition.
8) Code Status:  DNI/DNR, no pressors or central line.
