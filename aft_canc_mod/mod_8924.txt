Pt tolerated the procedure well but was kept intubated and admitted to the ICU overnight for anesthesia concerns and the pt being slow to wake after general anesthesia.
On POD1 she was extubated with no complications.
She had several episodes of emesis but a f/u KUB showed the G-J tube to be in place.
The G-tube balloon was reduced by 10cc for the possibility that that could be causing some mild obstruction.
She had had no episodes of vomiting for greater than 24hrs on the day of discharge.
The geriatric service felt that this might be due to her haldol, trazodone and/or remeron but they had no definite explanation.
Of note, her stool was sent for c.diff which came back positive.
Although she was afebrile and she did not have a white count, she was started on flagyl given the positive cultures for a course of 14 days.
