Admission Date: [**2101-10-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2101-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-8-22**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented on [**10-17**] to the emergency room as a transfer from [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] where the patient had complained of bilateral flank pain, increased severity, with diarrhea and vomiting, and pain radiating to the back.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for CAD, status post non-Q- wave MI in [**2090**], status post PTCA stent, paroxysmal AFib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-insulin dependent diabetes type 2, colonic polyps, chronic diarrhea, history of lower GI bleed attributed to hemorrhoids, hypertension x 20 years.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was consulted as well as hepatology for abdominal pain that initially presented on the left side, then localized to the right upper quadrant.
He was in no acute distress.
He did have scleral icterus.
A positive 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the neck.
No groin hernias.
Tox screen was negative for alcohol, salicylate and Tylenol.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  An abdominal CT was done that demonstrated enumerable hepatic masses, with the largest loculated in segment 8.
Nodular contour of the liver as well as extensive gastric, splenic, and umbilical varices suggestive of underlying cirrhosis.
There was apparent patent left portal vein.
No obvious segmental perfusion differences.
He had a replaced hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery.
It was also noted by hepatology that there was no history of chronic liver disease or hepatitis; although, he did have synthetic dysfunction with an INR of 1.6, an albumin of 2.2 and total bilirubin of 6.2.
Concern was for hepatocellular carcinoma versus pancreaticobiliary CA, although less likely.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] saw the patient, who had been transferred to the surgical intensive care unit, where an EGD was performed to rule out varices and rule out gastric neoplasm.
An EGD demonstrated no varices seen in the esophagus, clotted blood seen in the whole stomach, varices were seen in the fundus with a blood clot, the duodenum appeared normal.
Impression was of varices seen at the fundus with blood in the whole stomach.
No varices noted in the esophagus.
It was noted on the CT scan that had been done at the [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] that findings were most consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
There was also cholelithiasis noted.
A cardiology consult was obtained for evaluation of cardiac enzymes given severe anemia and concern for MI with a CK of 440, which increased to 896, a CK/MB of 4.20 that increased to 12, and a CK/MB index that was 1.0 that increased to 1.3, and troponin 0.019 that increased to 0.07.
Recommendations included holding aspirin, keep hematocrit greater than 30, hold on antiplatelet agents given thrombocytopenia and active bleeding, no further need for cycling enzymes.
It was felt that the patient had demand ischemia.
Given severity of GI bleed, it was unlikely for the him to be anticoagulated for an MI; and he was to be medically managed.
He was continued on the beta blocker for heart rate and BP control.
He also received FFP for the elevated INR as well as vitamin K subcutaneously x3 days.
His abdomen was mildly distended, but soft/nontender with positive bowel sounds.
It was felt the patient had cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple lesions with portal vein thrombosis with lymph nodes as well as gastric varices and that the lesions were unresectable.
It was felt that he likely had hepatocellular carcinoma.
It was felt that he was not a candidate for transplantation or resection, and TIPS was not an option in this patient.
Abdomen was soft/nontender, positive distention with positive __________ .
Of note, he had some penile edema; and a Foley was in place.
He did have difficulty once the Foley was removed.
On [**10-19**], Foley required replacement for bladder distention.
