Admission Date:  [**2142-1-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-2-6**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old female with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, type 2 diabetes and peripheral vascular disease who presented with pain and bleeding from her rectum and INR 17.
The patient reports that she has had intermittent bleeding oozing from her nose over the past several days as well as gum bleeding when she is brushing her teeth for the same period of time notes increased frequency of stools of loose consistency described as chocolate syrup mixed with blood clots.
Had routine PT/INR done today by the VNA, which showed an elevated INR and directed to the Emergency Department by her primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] denies syncope, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or reflux symptoms.
No history of peptic ulcer disease.
Also had increased PTT as well as BUN and creatinine 213/3.2.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
Chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease.
Echocardiogram [**10/2129**] showed an EF of 45 to 50% with inferior posterior hypokinesis, hyperlipidemia, degenerative joint disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post left lower extremity bypass, chronic edema with stasis dermatitis.
Nasal polyps status post polypectomy, clonic polyps, depression, status post left knee replacement, status post TAH/BSO for menorrhagia at an age 33.
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, which causes a rash and Keflex, which causes severe diarrhea.
No tobacco or alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient is an elderly black female in no acute distress.
Positive bleeding gums.
Heart S1 and S2, irregular irregular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen obese, soft, nontender, no organomegaly.
Rectal positive external hemorrhoids nonbleeding.
Extremities massive lower extremity edema with chronic stasis dermatitis.
Coagulopathy:  It was thought that the patient was having an increase in Coumadin dose over the past several weeks due to expired tubes done by her VNA and when her new tube was fine her INR was elevated at 17.4, she received several units of fresh frozen platelets and vitamin K and her coagulopathy was corrected.
Colonoscopy was significant for numerous polyps throughout her colon and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was significant for gastric erosions.
It was felt that the polyps were responsible for her recent bleed and that she would need outpatient repeat colonoscopy several weeks after.
Of note, the patient had an abdominal CT scan looking for possible cancer and metastatic disease from her polyps, which was significant for two lytic lesions on her ileum.
She then received a bone scan, which was unrevealing for any further metastatic disease.
Of note, one of the polyps removed from her colonoscopy had high grade dysplasia contained within the adenoma.
She had a serum protein electrophoresis, which showed no specific abnormalities.
Urine protein electrophoresis showed multiple protein bands with albumin predominated.
Renal failure:  Patient with an elevated creatinine.
Unclear what her recent baseline was.
It was thought to be a combination of prerenal azotemia given her volume loss.
Cardiovascular:  Patient with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation not requiring rate controlling agents.
Patient resuscitation in the MICU was complicated by congestive heart failure.
She had an echocardiogram that showed an EF of 30%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension.
She diuresed well with Lasix and her oxygen requirement was totally gone by the day of discharge.
Blood loss anemia.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic lower extremity edema.
