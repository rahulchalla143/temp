CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-2-26**] 5:17 PM  73 year old woman with metastatic NSSLC REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for metastasis CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Assessment for metastasis in a 73-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast head CT.  CT OF HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: No intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normal midline structure, major or minor vascular territorial infarct is apparent.
Impression: No acute intracranial pathology including no signs of metastasis.
Predominantly sclerotic lesion involving the entire T4 vertebral body with destructive components compatible with osseous metastatic disease.
There is also an enhancing soft tissue component within the epidural space compressing the cord in this region.
Sclerotic focus within the left iliac bone adjacent to the sacroiliac joint.
Please correlate with prior studies or bone scan.
Multiple hypodense lesions within bilateral kidneys and segment IV-B of the liver, too small to characterize.
Small axial hiatal hernia.
