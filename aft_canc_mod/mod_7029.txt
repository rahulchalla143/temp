He also had some desaturations and the chest x-ray showed some question of infiltrates in the left lung.
CT scan showed significant collapse of a portion of the left lower lobe.
The patient was brought to the operating room for reduction of this obstruction which seems to be at the level of the jejunostomy tube as well as improvement in his pulmonary situation.

Findings on bronchoscopy included some fairly significant mucus plugs in the left lower lobe.
A BAL grew out EColi and Enterobacter.
Post-op, the pt had fevers and was started on vanc and cipro.
A CXR showed atelectasis and bilateral pulm effusions.
Pt then had some incisional erythema.
