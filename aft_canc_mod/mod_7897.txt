RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2189-11-10**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Consolidative process within the left lung with some residual aerated lung at the left base and in the region of the lingula.
Although this may represent atelectasis, other processes such as aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage or pneumonia should be considered.
The right lung is low in volume but grossly clear.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Evidence of prior right-sided hemorrhagic infarct with postsurgical changes from right frontoparietal craniotomy.
Following drainage, the loculated left upper lung collection has completely resolved with residual opacity which is likely a combination of atelectasis and chronic pleural thickening.
Since [**2189-11-2**], lower lung atelectasis has progressed to complete collapse of the right lower lobe and partial collapse of right upper lobe.
Mild-to-moderate opacities in the middle lobe is likely atelectasis or secondary to aspiration.
Left lower lung atelectasis is fairly unchanged.
Mild bilateral pleural effusions.
The ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter ends in the peritoneal cavity of upper abdomen and there is no associated fluid collection.
No definite intracardiac shunt is identified on intravenous saline injection.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No intracardiac shunt identified (images are suboptimal and cannot exclude a small PFO).
[**2189-11-15**] CTA: FINDINGS: There is no main, branch, lobar, or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Branch arteries are also prominent, with peripheral pruning, compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Thoracic aorta is normal in caliber throughout, without aneurysm or dissection.
The heart is normal in size, without pericardial effusion or right heart strain.
Moderate left pleural thickening and simple effusion persist, with prominent loculations along the left mediastinum and left cardiophrenic angle (3:57, 40B:38).
Prior foci of air have resolved, and faint linear rim enhancement remains following instrumentation.
Pulmonary aeration appears minimally improved at the lung bases, with persistent bilateral areas of discoid atelectasis.
Mild central irregular bronchial wall thickening is present, which may be compatible with small airways disease.
Again noted are multiple prominent paraaortic nodes measuring up to 8-9 mm, likely reactive.
There is a small sliding hiatal hernia.
Left ventriculoperitoneal shunt is noted in the left anterior chest wall.
Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
No pulmonary embolus.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Extubation, with continued areas of diffuse subsegmental atelectasis.
Moderate left effusion and pleural thickening, with small medial loculations.
[**2189-11-16**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: No relevant changes in the lungs since [**2189-11-13**].
Low lung volumes with mild bibasal atelectasis are unchanged.
Mild widening of the mediastinum to the left side extending to the apex which is a persisting postoperative feature has been stable since [**2189-11-7**].
No new lung opacities of concern.
Mild to moderately enlarged heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 year-old female with neurological deficits who presented with cholangitis.
Intubated for ERCP due to hypoxia on presentation.
Found to have VP shunt and fluid collection in pleural space.
Cholangitis - The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 25354**] with fever, RUQ pain and elevated Tbili.
A RUQ US there showed numerous gallstones but no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Respiratory failure - The patient was hypoxic to the 77% saturation on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the ICU, the patient had been requiring high levels of oxygenation, likely multifactorial, related to sedation, probable restrictive disease from habitus, atelectasis, OSA or obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and pulmonary edema.
CTA was performed that did not show pulmonary embolus.
CXR showed atelectasis and low lung volumes.
She should get formal PFT testing as well as a sleep study as we suspect she may have a diagnosis of OSA or obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
A CT revealed a large fluid collection in the pleural space believed to be CSF.
Pleural effusion was drained; pleural fluid cultures did not grow organisms.
L leg pain: Pt reported chronic left foot pain.
She showed occasional agitation and noncompliance with medical care.
HTN - Held all anti-hypertesnives in the setting of acute illness.
This may be restarted at rehab if BP is elevated and electrolytes/kidney function are stable.
Hypothyroidism - Continued levothyroxine  #.
Asthma - Continued albuterol once extubated.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow-up Chest CT recommended after clinical improvement   - Chest CT [**2189-11-2**] showed ill-defined nodular appearing area in LLL which could be part of consolidation/atelectasis process, but requires attention in followup to exclude malignancy - Follow-up dermoid cyst seen on OSH imaging, persistent menstrual bleeding - Pt will see outpatient pulmonary clinic for PFTs and possible sleep study - Pt will see outpatient surgery for discussion of future cholecystectomy  Medications on Admission: - Omeprazole 20mg PO daily - Levothyroxine 50mcg PO daily - ASA 81mg PO daily - Lisinopril 5mg PO daily - MVI - Simvastatin 20mg PO daily - Depakote DR 1000mg PO BID - Os-Cal 500mg PO daily - Diazepam 5mg PO TID - Tylenol 650mg PO TID PRN Pain - Depakote 250mg PO QHS - Risperidone 0.25mg PO QHS - Vit D 50,000 units qWeekly (sunday) - Senna PRN constipation - Bisacodyl PRN constipation - Lactulose 20gm PO Q8 PRN constipation - Percocet 5/325 q6 hours PRN pain - Albuterol inhaler  Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 50 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 189**] Health Care Center - [**Hospital1 189**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cholangitis Pleural effusion [**1-28**] VP shunt   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Answers to questions appropriately but often non-compliant with care, has cognitive dysfunction Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
