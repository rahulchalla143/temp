He denies any associated double or blurry vision, headache, or focal weakness (has had increased overall fatigue recently).
Because of the persistant dizziness, he presented to an OSH ER where a head ct was performed which showed a midline cerebellar bleed.

Extraocular movements intact with some horizontal nystagmus on right gaze and rotary nystagmus on upgaze.
Tongue midline, no fasciculations.
Pertinent Results: MRI/MRA head and neck [**2113-6-7**]: FINDINGS: There are no areas of diffusion abnormality.
On T1-weighted images, there is a 2.0 x 2.6 cm mass, which appears bright on T1-weighted images and isointense to low signal on T2-weighted images with areas of increased T2 signal with a possible fluid-fluid level.
Additional 1cm homogeneously enhancing lesion is visualized within the left parietal lobe near the sensory gyrus with moderate peritumoral edema.
Minimal amount of edema is also seen surrounding the mid-cerebellar lesion.
On gradient echo images, there are areas of susceptibility within these two lesions, which are consistent with hemorrhage.
No other areas of abnormal enhancement are noted.
There is mass effect as a result of the cerebellar lesion with slight anterior displacement of the posterior wall of the fourth ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Likely two hemorrhagic metastatic foci, one to the mid cerebellum and one to the left parietal lobe in the region of the sensory gyrus.
There is mild to moderate edema surrounding both lesions with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Head CT with and without IV contrast [**2113-6-8**]: FINDINGS: Consistent with the MRI performed yesterday, there is no change in the high-attenuation masses within the cerebellar vermis and left parietal lobe, which show a small degree of contrast enhancement.
There is low attenuation surrounding these lesions, more pronounced within the left parietal lobe, consistent with edema.
Both of these masses are consistent with hemorrhagic metastases.
There is no evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is mucosal thickening within both maxillary sinuses, right greater than left.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain with two presumed hemorrhagic metastases within the cerebellum and left parietal lobe.
No new hydrocephalus.
CT chest, abd, pelvis [**2113-6-8**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is an evidence of prior right-sided lobectomy.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
Surgical sutures and soft tissue density are present within the right hilum, presumably reflecting post-surgical change.
Centrilobular emphysematous change is seen within the left lung which is clear.
No definite pulmonary nodules are identified.
Both adrenal glands demonstrate nodularity that is new when compared to a prior CT. A lesion within the left adrenal gland measures 1.8 x 1.1 cm.
There is a hypo-enhancing lesion within the tail of the pancreas (series 3, image 60) measuring 2.5 x 2.8 cm.
An additional low attenuation lesion measuring 1.6 cm is seen within the mid body of the pancreas.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are seen.
Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
New nodules within both adrenal glands as well as at least two hypo- enhancing lesions within the pancreas that are consistent with metastatic disease.
Postoperative change within the right lung consistent with prior right upper lobectomy with soft tissue density and sutures at the right hilum.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted to Neuro ICU where he was started on IV decadron which improved his symptoms throughout his hospital course.
He underwnet MRI and CT head which revealed tumour in the cerebellar vermis impingoing onthe 4th ventricle and a second lesion in the L parietal region.
There was no hydrocephalus.
CT of the chest/abd/pelvis revealed metastatic disease involving the bilat adrenal glands, pancreas, lung.
