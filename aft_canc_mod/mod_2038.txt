ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Multiple relatives with cancer and paternal grandmother with coronary artery disease.
Neck, limited range of motion with no pain.
Extraocular eye movements are intact with sticcottic eye movements and no nystagmus.
Facial movement has marked right facial droop as well as some slight right upper face weakness.
There is no tremor.
Muscle strength on the left was suboptimal effort but no focal weakness besides that limited by pain, especially on the left lower extremity.
Sensory examination, it is difficult to assess but she denies any changes to light touch, pinprick, temperature or vibration.
She withdraws to pain in the left lower extremity and upper extremity.
On coordination examination, she is intact to finger-to-nose test on the left with slow rapid alternating movements.
Noncontrast head computerized tomography scan shows a left frontal 3.5 by 3.4 cm hemorrhagic metastatic lesion and a left posterior parietal hemorrhagic lesion.
The patient was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain was done showing a left frontal, left posterior parietal and left superior parietal hemorrhagic metastatic lesion.
While on the floor, she continued to have a dense right hemiplegia but her verbal output did return.
The Neurosurgery Service was consulted and they recommended that the left frontal metastatic lesion be excised and the patient was accepting of this offer.
Radiation Oncology and Neuro-Oncology was consulted and both felt that the patient should have stereotactic radiation after the surgical resection of her left frontal metastatic lesion.
In addition, her Dilantin was switched over to Keppra given that the Dilantin will give her a higher threshold of seizures during the radiation.
The patient was seen by physical therapy and found to be able to move around with minimal assistance.
Given the edema around the hemorrhagic metastatic lesion, the patient was started on Decadron.
