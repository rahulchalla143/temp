Admission Date:  [**2167-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-5-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: airway monitoring  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 56 y/o M admitted to [**Hospital6 **] for respiratory distress.
Prior to presentation, the patient was brushing the snow from his car when he became SOB and presented to [**Hospital3 46817**] with stridor.
He also noted mildly increased cough with phlegm production, as well as 3-4 days of subjective chills.
There a CT scan noted a large enhancing L paraglottic mass w/ an airway lumen of 3x6 mm with multiple metastatic nodes and question of esophageal extention.
A trach was then placed percutaneously, and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as no beds were available at [**Hospital1 789**] VA.  Past Medical History: -Lanyngeal ca dx on larygeal bx, w/o h/o radiation or node dissection -s/p G-tub -h/o R thumb amputation [**9-/2161**] -HTN -h/o Lyme dx and babesiosis treated this past summer  Social History: worked as a carpenter, stopped smoking 2 weeks ago  Family History: sister w/ DM  Physical Exam: VS:T=98.2, BP=114/62-141/71,HR=66-95, RR=13-22, O2=98-100% on 40%trach GEN: Pt thin appearing but in NAD HEENT: nonicteric, mucosa slightly dry, trach in good position; oropharynx difficult to visualize but no erythema CHEST: transmitted upper airway sounds but no wheezes, whales CV: distant HS, RRR ABD: scaphoid, soft, NT, ND, G-tube EXT: no LE edema; +clubbing SKIN: facial telangectasias  Pertinent Results: CXR: The patient is status post tracheostomy.
There is no evidence of CHF.
Lung fields are grossly clear without evidence for pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
He could form a bolus with liquids, but no ground or solid consistencies were tested.
Mild tongue weakness was noted with difficulty transporting material from the front to the back of his mouth.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There was a mild to moderate delay in initiation of the pharyngeal swallow.
Laryngeal elevation was moderately to severely reduced.
Upper esophageal sphincter relaxation was also reduced.
More residue remained on the right side, as there was no space in the valleculae or pyriform sinuses on the left due to the presence of the mass.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Aspiration occurred with all consistencies; thin liquid, nectar thick liquid, honey thick liquid and pudding.
Aspiration occurred before the swallow due to premature spillover and swallow initiation delay; during the swallow due to reduced vocal cord closure, and after the swallow due to spillage of residue mixed with secretions into the airway.
No cough was produced upon aspiration.
A cued cough was effective in reducing but not in eliminating the aspiration.
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] aspirates all consistencies due to his laryngeal mass and the excess secretions in his oropharynx.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE - pt appears to have extensive involvement of his tumor and had stridor upon presentation to OSH.
Sputum culture shows Strep Pnuemo colonization vs. tracheitis/PNA.
-will treat for suspected respirtory infection for 7 days with ceftriaxone.
4) TACHYCARDIA: Likely [**3-12**] slight volume depletion and low grade fevers.
5) HTN - continue Lisinopril, monitor BP.
Please follow fever curve and monitor tachycardia.
