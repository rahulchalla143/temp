The patient reported that she was treated for pneumonia with abx and then thoracentesis two weeks prior to admission.
She stateed that she was prescribed several pills by her kidney doctor, but this morning the "white pill" did not help.
She was also noted to have leukocytosis with WBC of 11.9 and 82% PMNs.

****************** TUMOR MARKERS ****************** [**2117-10-3**] 04:06AM BLOOD CEA-4.1* CA125-2477*  ****************** IMAGING & STUDIES ******************  [**2117-10-2**] Chest Xray: Complete opacification of the left hemithorax may represent pleural effusion- atelectasis.
Underlying pneumonia - aspiration is not excluded.
Right small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Large left pleural effusion, with near complete collapse and consolidation of the left lung.
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.
Ascites, with diffuse nodularity of the peritoneum, suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Ill-defined lesion within the left lower pelvis, in the expected location of the uterus and adnexa, with calcifications seen.
The origin and etiology of this lesion is unclear without intravenous contrast, and could reflect a uterine fibroid, or adnexal lesion.
Prominence of the cecal and sigmoid colonic walls.
Rare clusters of atypical but degenerated epithelioid cells.
[**2117-10-4**] Pleural Fluid Cell Block: Rare epithelioid cells, too few to further categorize, and inflammatory cells.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2117-10-6**] Pleural Fluid Analysis: ATYPICAL; Rare atypical but degnerated epithelioid cells in a background of mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.
[**2117-10-7**] Pleural Fluid Cell Block: Highly atypical epithelioid cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
[**2117-10-12**] Chest Xray: Interval removal of the left pigtail drain.
Left hemithorax unchanged.
Occlusive thrombus in right basilic vein.
[**2117-10-14**] Chest Xray: No significant change in bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with CAD s/p CABG in [**2096**] and [**Hospital 41538**] transfered from [**Hospital1 **] for hypotension, renal failure and cancer work-up found to have metastatic cancer likely primary ovarian.
* Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on admission, requiring pressors and large volumes of IVF.
This was believed to be secondary to distrubutive shock, likely sepsis of unknown source.
Infectious sources may have been from a GI source given carcinomatosis as well as pulmonary given recently diagnosed PNA.
Pericardial effusion was unlikely given low voltage EKG and no JVD, no effusion on CT chest.
Furthermore, TTE was performed which showed no pericardial effusion.
Given poor renal function, Vanc was initially dosed by level.
At the time of transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was normotensive without requirement of pressors or fluid resuscitation and was on day 6 of a 7 day course of vanc and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* Hypoxia: Several hours after admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient had significantly increased work of breathing, was getting progressively more tachypneic with increasing oxygen requirements.
She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
CT of the chest was performed and revealed large left pleural effusion, with near complete collapse and consolidation of the left lung.
The chest tube continued to produce a significant amount of pleural fluid while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Repeat xray showed no interval worsening of the pleural effusions and patient remained stable saturing at >95% on 2-3L of oxygen by NC.
Patient denied shortness of breath.
* Oliguric renal failure: On admission, the patient was noted to have Creatinine of 2.9, with bland sediment and minimal urine output.
Renal failure was suspected to be secondary to hypotension.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis or vascular impairment on CT. Urine lytes were consistent with a pre-renal cause of ARF.
She was not restarted on any of her home blood pressure medications except for furosemide.
* Metastatic Ovarn Cancer: The patient was noted to have evidence of carcinomatosis on scan from OSH.
CT scan performed here confirmed carcinomatosis and also revealed an ill-defined lesion within the left lower pelvis, in the expected location of the uterus and adnexa, with calcifications.
Cytology from her pleural effusion showed atypical epithelial cells consistent with metastatic disease, however a primary source was not identified.
Gyn/Onc felt that patient's presentation and elevated CEA/CA125 were most consistent with a stage IV ovarian cancer.
* Anasarca On transfer from the ICU, the patient was hypervolemic with total body overload including lower extremity and sacral edema with crackles bilaterally on chest auscultation.
* Raynaud's Syndrome On patient's 7th day in the hospital she developed cyanosis of the fingertips in her right hand.
An US of patient's right upper extremity showed a clot in the superficial basilic vein (unlikely to account for these symptoms).
Her symptoms improved moderately with these interventions.
A literature search was done and it was found that approximately 2.7% of individuals with ovarian cancer develop cutaneous manifestations, which can include Raynauds.
* Rash/Decubitus Ulcer During her stay in the hospital the patient developed perineal erythema.
She also developed a stage II decubitus ulcer which should be cleaned daily and dressed.
* Diarrhea Patient complated of diarrhea on the floor.
She was started on low dose loperamide which improved her symptoms dramatically.
* History of CAD s/p CABG [**37**] years ago: Patient was continued on outpatient Aspirin.
Beta Blocker was held given hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and not restarted on the floor given that she was normotensive.
* Anxiety/Depression Patient was started on mirtazepine 15mg po with good effect for depression and to promote appetite.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Presumed Ovarian Cancer - Stage IV  Secondary Diagnosis Pneumonia Raynaud's   Discharge Condition: Stable on 2-3L of oxygen.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the [**Hospital3 **] Hospital from [**Hospital3 **] where you were found to have a low blood pressure, poor kidney function and imaging that showed fluid in your lungs and nodules in your abdomen.
Here at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] you were found to have a pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics.
You were also found to have elevated tumor markers and atypical cells in the fluid in your lungs, suggestive of cancer, and most consistent with ovarian cancer.
You and your family decided that you did not want to pursue chemotherapy against the cancer and would instead focus on your comfort.
You also developed cyanosis of your left fingertips consistent with Raynaud's.
We did an ultrasound of your arm that showed a small clot in a superficial vein, this is very unlikely to be the cause of your symptoms.
Should you develop shortness of breath we recommend that you contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**] to discuss following up with the lung doctors about [**Name5 (PTitle) 20483**] a chest radiograph and perhaps a more permanent catheter.
Your hospice should be able to help you address any symptoms you develop and alleviate any discomfort you may have.
