CT abdomen showed hydroureter on the left side and she had a positive urinalysis.
Her renal failure was thought to be both prerenal and caused by obstruction.
She received a percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the left side by interventional radiology without complication.
She also had a positive urinalysis at [**Location (un) 620**] and was started on treated with Cefepime for a complicated obstructive UTI.
