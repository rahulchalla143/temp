Admission Date:  [**2106-11-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-11-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-8-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**] Chief Complaint: [**Hospital 82594**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
History of Present Illness:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year-old woman with history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] on hydroxyurea, Raynaud's phenomena, hypertension, transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-11-11**] for workup of new hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension.
Prior to one month ago, she was able to climb a flight of stairs without difficulty and walk several blocks, denying any exercise limitation.
She was working for her son in a gift shop until 3 weeks ago, at which time she began to note dyspnea with climibing one flight of stairs at her home and that she needed to take frequent breaks from what were typically small domestic tasks.
Other symptoms included mild ankle edema, and "swollen abdomen" noted by her PCP.
Her PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray and started her on ciprofloxacin for pneumonia (per patient).
She was also referred for an TTE due to pleural effusions, which revealed a markedly dilated right ventricle, moderate aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
There was a right sided effusion which was tapped with results consistent with transudate.
Also noted to have mediastinal adenopathy.
During her hospitalization, patient was found to have acute kidney injury and per nephrology consutation felt to be secondary to poor renal perfusion from impaired left ventricular filling.
She was also initiated on CAP treatment with levofloxacin, which was completed at transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and work-up of her hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension.
She remained hemodynamically stable with an oxygen requirement of 4 LPM.
These findings confirmed OSH results with TR gradient 56-64, severe TR, mild MR, mild LVH, RVH, marked RV dilation with abnormal septal motion.
Also has noted dark urine since arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], along with abdominal pain in her LUQ to LLQ, which felt like a "toothache" to her.
Review of systems   Denies snoring or nightime dyspnea or awakenings though notes her "son thinks I have sleep apnea" for unclear reasons.
Denies fever, chest pain, syncope or lightheadedness, bleeding episodes, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting prior to coming to hospital.
Denies headache,  weight loss, night sweats or fever.
Denies history of liver disease, heart disease, venous thromboembolic disease.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], diagnosed about [**2088**], on hydroxyurea about 10 years.
Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65126**], who has controlled disease well for many years.
Hypertension 5.
Avascular necrosis of the femur or humerus (unclear) 7.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine about 1.0.
Is the primary carer for her daughter who suffers from some social difficulties - possibly autism spectrum.
No TB exposures.
No HIV risk factors.
Family History: No family history of pulmonary disease.
Husband died of mesothelioma after working in a shipyard; pt states they met years after he worked there and was never exposed to any shipyard clothes and never visited the worksite.
Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: General appearance: Elderly female, mildly tachypneic with speech.
No adenopathy.
Chest: Diminished breath sounds at bilateral apices, bilateral basilar crackles.
Soft, non tender currently, slightly distended though tympanic throughout without clear evidence of ascites.
Back: No CVA tenderness.
Extremities: Trace to 1+ LE pitting edema, digits slightly darker in color without evidence of ulceration.
No adenopathy.
Chest: Diminished breath sounds at bilateral bases, some fine dry crackles to the middle of the lower lobe posteriorly.
Abdomen: Soft, non tender currently, no evidence of ascites.
Back: No CVA tenderness.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..  Other Investigations Cardiac Echo [**2106-11-15**] IMPRESSION: Severe right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional/global systolic function.
Cardiac Echo [**2106-11-16**] IMPRESSION: Cor pulmonale; no intracardiac shunt.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-11-14**], no obvious change.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 22 mm Hg.
There was severe pulmonary artery hypertension with PASP of 84 mm Hg.
There was no significant change in these pressures after 10 minutes of inhaled 100% FIO2 or 10 minutes of inhaled 100% FIO2 plus NO.
Procedure performed from the right internal jugular vein without complications.
Severe pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated right sided pressures.
Hepatosplenomegaly in the setting of normal hepatic echogenicity and architecture in combination with enlarged hepatic veins; the constellation of findings can be seen in the right-sided heart failure.
Non-obstructing renal calculi.
Right pleural effusion.
CT chest, without contrast [**2106-11-15**] IMPRESSION: 1)Marked enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2)Diffuse mild dilatation of the ascending aorta at 43 mm.
3)Moderately large right and small left dependent pleural effusions.
4)Diffuse air trapping is consistent with small airways obstruction.
5) Rounded atelectasis in the right upper lobe with atelectasis in the middle and right lower lobe.
6)Diffuse coronary artery and valvular calcification.
7)Periportal edema, splenomegaly and probable varices are incompletely assessed and in the presence of ascites suggests portal hypertension.
A right internal jugular sheath is seen with tip in the superior right atrium.
Tent-like configuration of the heart is compatible with persistent pericardial effusion, progressed.
The prominence in the hilar regions are consistent with reported history of pulmonary artery hypertension.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right persists.
Retrocardiac opacification could represent atelectasis or, less lkely, infection.
No overt pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year-old woman with hypertension and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure.
Although the etiology is unclear, it is possible that several disease processes are at work: Polycythemia is sometimes associated with pulmonary hypertension, however this degree of pulmonary hypertension would be atypical if not impossible.
Given positive D-dimer and coagulopathy at admission along with negative CTA, an alternative explanation would include microembolic or thrombotic disease with the pulmonary vasculature that is sufficiently diffuse to avoid detection on CT.
This is also consistent with decreased response to oxygen and nitric oxide on right heart pressure as measured by Swan-Ganz catheter.
Some prelinary work-up for vasculitus and systemic disease was negative.
Chronologically, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was stable on the medical floor, went to the ICU for diuresis, close monitoring and determination of pulmonary arterial pressure, including in the context of increased oxygen, nitric oxide and sildenafil.
Issues of importance during the stay include the following:  Pulmonary hypertension and RV failure.
Newly diagnosed, with symptoms x 1 month, however RV dilation and hypertropy suggest longer chronicity.
No evidence of intracardiac shunt or LV failure given negative ECHO bubble, no intrapulmonary shunt or PE evidenced on CTA chest.
Negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti centromere as well as SPEP and UPEP,TSH slightly high but free T4 normal, awaiting anti-scl 70.
Swan catheter placed in cath lab prior to arrival, with persistantly elevated PAP and no response to NO.
Mild decrease in PAP to 60s/20s, dobutamine stopped and swan removed.
Likely explained by VQ mismatch in setting of severe pulmonary hypertension; also has bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
ECHO negative for ASD or evidence of R->L shunting.
Acute on chronic renal failure   Baseline reportedly ~1.0, has been in the 1.2-1.5 range here and at OSH.
Mild proteinuria and abnormal microscopy with RBCs and WBCs.
Acute change differential includes hypoperfusion from heart failure, ATN from a number of sources (which was thought to be the case at OSH).
INR elevated to 1.5 at admission without explanation.
Hypertension   At baseline takes nifedipine 30 mg CR and toprol XL 50 mg, held in setting of low BP.
Reviewed meds, and consulted Dermatology: Lasix and sildenafil unlikely offenders, but most likely is from contrast given pt's known history.
Dispostion   Unsuitable for palliation at home given care for daughter (see social history).
Secondary Diagnoses: Systemic hypertension (controlled) Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] (controlled)   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing in the context of severe pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure within the vessels supplying your lungs).
This resulted in the determination of a new medication regimen that now includes sildenafil (Viagra) that acts to dilate and reduce pressure within lung blood vessels.
As you suggested, we also think that this rash is likely due to either contrast media or is a contact dermatitis.
If you experience increasing shortness of breath, require more oxygen, chest pain, or any other concerning symptom, please return to the hospital.
