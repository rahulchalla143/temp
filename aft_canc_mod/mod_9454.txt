Name:  [**Known lastname 15333**],[**Known firstname **]                  Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 15334**]  Admission Date:  [**2130-7-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-8-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-11-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Flomax / Shellfish Derived / Fish Product Derivatives / Zolpidem / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7221**] Addendum: On [**2130-7-25**] the patient had an increased oxygen requirement and a CTA to rule out PE was performed.
A small subsegmental acute PE was found in the left lower lobe and the patient was put on a heparin drip for about 4 days to maintain a PTT between 60-80.
Given his history of GI bleed, pancytopenia, and intent on continuing chemotherapy for his multiple myeloma, it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation outweighed the benefits and all anticoagulation was discontinued once the patient was satting well on room air.
