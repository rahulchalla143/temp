Cholangiogram demonstrated tumor ingrowth and occlusion of the middle-upper third of the stent.
[**1-29**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.
Persistent but smaller right pleural effusion as well as a left pleural effusion and associated patchy bibasilar airspace opacity which could reflect compressive atelectasis although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Heart size is difficult to assess given low lung volumes and the presence of the effusions.
No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aneurysm identified.
No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia.
Bilateral moderate to large pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Increased perihepatic and perisplenic simple-appearing fluid.

# Severe sepsis: Patient admitted with fevers, hypotension and found to have klebsiella and enterococcus growing in blood cultures at [**Hospital3 **].
They suggested that her outpatient providers could consider repeat abdominal CT scan to r/o septic phlebitis or abscess in liver after abx course over; however, if she decides to pursue palliative care with her oncologist this will not be necessary (read below)  #Cholangitis:  Presented initially with fevers, abdominal pain, and hyperbilirubinemia.
Has history of obstructive jaundice and previous stenting due to her cholangiocarcinoma.
ERCP showed blockage of left hepatic duct and migration of previously placed stent.
Hepatic duct felt to be closed secondary to compression by tumor.
However, her alkaline phosphatase trended upward and was above 437 on discharge.
# Anemia: Reportedly had hct drop to 16 on admission at OSH.
Pt had recent chemo (which could certainly drop her counts- had pancytopenia on admission to [**Hospital1 **], all of which normalized at [**Hospital1 18**]) .
Pt had brown, guaiac positive stool, so given her recent fragmin use, may have a slow bleed.
Hemolysis and DIC labs normal.
CT from [**Hospital1 **] on day of admission reportedly shows extension of tumor burden, and this is also suggested by ERCP.
I have discussed with the patient only that the tumor has expanded, and that she needs to speak with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss next steps and prognosis.
# Left portal vein thrombosis: likely [**2-9**] tumor invasion as discussed above.
This seems to have been held given recent Hct drop.
Her fragmin will be held, per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], as she is at risk for large GI bleed given guiaiac positive stool, and as her care will likely proceed in a palliative direction given tumor extension on chemotherapy.
# Diabetes Mellitus:  Well controlled in hospital.
# edema.
Patient with pitting bilateral LE edema that developed after vigorous hydration in the ICU.
# Pleural effusions:  Seen on CT scan.
She was seen by the Interventional Pulmonary Service and they did an ultrasound which demonstrated pleural effusions too small to tap.
Patient was not hypoxic and in no respiratory distress.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Bacteremia 3.
Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation and treatment for an infection in your bile duct and bacteria in your blood.
You had two different types of bacteria in your blood, and you were seen by the infectious disease doctors, who recommended a total of 10 days of IV antibiotics for this infection.
When you were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] initially, your blood counts were very low, and there was concern for blood loss in your gut.
At that point you should discuss with him your prognosis given that your cancer has grown despite chemotherapy.
