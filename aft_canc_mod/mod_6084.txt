CT in ED again revealed a Type B dissection in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.
Hysterectomy, s/p removal of benign [**Last Name (un) **] lesions  Social History: Quit smoking 2 months ago.
Type B aortic dissection arising just distal to the take off of the left subclavian artery, extending to the right common femoral artery.
Multiple low- attenuation lesions scattered throughout the liver, possibly representing cysts or hemangiomas, incompletely characterized on this single- phase study.
There is borderline mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
A linear density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection; there is also evidence of dissection in the distal aortic arch (however the aortic arch is not fully visualized).
No dissection is seen in the ascending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

She also had an echocardiogram which again revealed a type b dissection in the descending aorta but showed no other abnormalities.
