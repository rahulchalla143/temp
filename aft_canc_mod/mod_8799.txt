Admission Date:  [**2197-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-10-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Elective admission for valvuloplasty  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stent to Left main coronary artery Cardioversion   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with history of aortic stenosis, HTN, DM, HLD, PBD CAD s/p NSTEMI with LAD stent who was admitted for elective cath/valvuloplasty in the setting of known AS and increasing SOB over the past few weeks, and concern for worsening AS by outside echo.
Pt states that he has been asymptomatic and denies SOB, chest pain/pressure, N/V or diaphoresis.
However, according to his home nurse, his exercise tolerance has diminshed and although his mobility is even more limited than usual due to shortness of breath.
At present, he is only able to walk [**12-23**] blocks before becoming short of breath.
He denies orthopnea however he sleeps on three pillows at night.
Currently he is pain free and asymptomatic.
He has been followed as an out-pt for his aortic stenosis.
In the cath lab today, he was found to have left main distal stenosis of 60-70% (borderline) and a valve gradient 15-20 mm with calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.2-1.3, therefore valvuloplasty was deferred.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
Diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia carotid artery disease- [**2193-3-12**] u/s: 50% [**Country **], 50-60% [**Doctor First Name 3098**], External carotid artery stenosis > 50% on the left.
right upper thigh with soft old hematoma extending from groin (cath site) area, increasingly swollen with possibly newer brusing closer to knee.
1+ edema to the ankle.
Slightly tender to palpation, no cords.
[**10-1**] LE US -No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis on the left.
The right side cannot be evaluated and renal artery stenosis on this side cannot be excluded.
Bilateral renal cysts.
[**9-28**] CARDIAC ECHO Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondeary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-8-8**], the right ventricle now appears somewhat hypokinetic.
The LMCA had an 80% distal stenosis.
The LAD and LCX had diffuse luminal irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling pressures with a LVEDP of 40 mmHg and a RVEDP of 24 mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 75/34 mmHg.
There was systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 154/64 mmHg.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Mr [**Known lastname **] has a history of CAD with stent placement to the LAD [**3-27**] and known RCA occlusion.
He does not have any recent history of CP or pressure and ST depressions on EKG appear to be chronic.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive Heart Failure: Volume overloaded on exam with scrotal and peripheral edema.
PCWP elevated at 40.
Note that this is an increased dose for pt and he should be monitored for signs of dehydration.
ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] not started because of low blood pressures after diuresis.
# Aortic Stenosis: While ECHO [**2197-9-21**] showed severe stenosis, cath here demonstrated only moderate area 0.96 and valve gradient 15.01 therefore valvuloplasty was deferred.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Was transiently in AF and cardioverted into NSR.
He will need PFT's, TFT's and LFT's as an outpt to with new amiodarone initiation.
New anemia since cath in mid 20's although this is close to pts baseline.
He has a large resolving hematoma on his right upper thigh and had some scant rectal bleeding from anal fissure, now resolved.
# Renal artery stenosis: on recent US, no stenosis was seen on the left side.
No further action required at this time given that no evidence of bilateral disease.
# Diabetes Type 2: Blood sugars were high here, his NPH/Regular insulin was continued as at home.
#Lower extremity pain/edema: DVT ruled out with LE doppler.
Likely thrombophlebitis in right medial ankle area, On Ceflexin TID and improving.
His legs should be elevated as much as possible and Terbenafine should be applied to toes to treat fungal infection twice daily.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Petrolatum     Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for dry, pruritic legs.

Please follow the bruise on your right thigh for signs of a growing bruise.
START Terbenifine twice daily for 2 weeks to treat the fungal infection between your toes 6.
Take [**Last Name (LF) 22509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] antibiotic, to treat the infection near your right ankle.
