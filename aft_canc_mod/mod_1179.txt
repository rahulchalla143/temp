Admission Date:  [**2193-2-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-1-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  BLUMEGART INTERNAL MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and invasive adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder who is status post recent admission for hemobilia and stent placement who presented to the Emergency Department after one episode of hematemesis.
The patient noted on the evening prior to admission he ate dinner and then later developed nausea with emesis times one consisting of partially digested food.
One hour later the patient was talking on the phone and had another episode of nausea followed by vomiting of brownish material with blood clots.
Intravenous access was difficult, and therefore, a right femoral central venous catheter was placed, and the patient was line resuscitated.
The GI Service was [**Name (NI) 653**], and the patient was subsequently admitted to Blumegart for upper GI bleed in the setting of invasive adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Atrial and ventricular ectopy on Amiodarone.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
General:  The patient was an elderly man in no acute distress.
The patient had a left-sided ptosis.
No jugular venous distention.
There was a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.
There was no splenomegaly.
Extremities:  The patient had peripheral pulses that were 2+ with mild pedal edema.
Chest x-ray indicated no pneumonia or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Blumegart Internal Medicine Firm for work-up of upper GI bleed.
He received an upper endoscopy which indicated a normal esophagus, clotted blood in the stomach, and erythema and congestion of the duodenal mucosa with contact bleeding.
There was no active bleeding noted on exam.
The patient was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells with a pretransfusion hematocrit of 29.6 and a posttransfusion hematocrit of 30.0; although this was thought to be an inappropriate response to a transfusion, his hematocrit remained stable, and no further transfusions were attempted at that time.
On hospital day #3, the patient started to complain of moderately severe epigastric tenderness with associated nausea.
He was then witnessed to have one episode of hematemesis with approximately 50 cc of dark blood.
He was then noted to have melena with a substantial amount of maroon colored stool.
The patient was also noted to develop atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rate in the 150s.
He was restarted on Lopressor with improved rate control but remained in atrial fibrillation during the remainder of his hospital stay.
The patient was then taken to the Interventional Radiology Suite for emergent angiography of the celiac access which revealed a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm.
This organism was later identified as Klebsiella pneumonia which was pansensitive.
At the time of this dictation, it was planned that the patient will be discharged to an acute rehabilitation setting for several days prior to anticipated discharge to home.
The patient remained afebrile with a normal white count and resolving liver function tests during his hospital stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of approximately 100.
Although he was maintained on Lopressor, it was felt that the patient's rate control should not be increased given his risk of continued bleeding.
Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with local invasion of the liver.
Hemobilia with right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, status post embolization.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
