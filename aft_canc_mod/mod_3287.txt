Admission Date:  [**2168-1-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-1-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2137-10-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  O-MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 30 year old male with a past medical history of pulmonic stenosis (now thought to be secondary to an anterior mediastinal mass), who presented with five weeks of progressive nonproductive cough, fever, and night sweats to an outside hospital on [**2168-1-1**], where a chest x-ray revealed an anterior mediastinal mass and a CAT scan showed the mass measuring at 11.3 by 14.4 by 12.0 centimeters, as well as small effusions.
The patient was sent home with follow-up but over the weekend, he developed pleuritic left sided chest pain with mild shortness of breath.
He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where an echocardiogram revealed a 3.5 centimeter effusion with inferior vena cava inspiratory collapse and mitral inflow variability without increased jugular venous pressure or a pulsus.
Hernia repair at eight years old.
Lyme disease at ten years old.
Pulmonic stenosis diagnosed in [**9-11**], after a murmur and diagnosed by echocardiogram.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient is a well developed male who is thin and diaphoretic, anxious, in mild respiratory distress.
The heart was tachycardia, regular S1 and S2 with II to III/VI murmur at the left sternal border.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Echocardiogram revealed normal systolic function, 3.5 effusion at the largest diameter, inferior vena cava collapse with inspiration, question of pericardial studding, mild respiratory variation in mitral inflow consistent with some early signs of tamponade.
CAT scan from [**2168-1-1**], heterogeneous mass in the left midline compressing the left pulmonary artery, right upper lobe pleural nodules, left pleural effusion, pericardial effusion.
Pericardial effusion at admission - The patient had signs for early tamponade physiology but was hemodynamically stable and was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.
The patient therefore underwent pericardial drain and 600cc of grossly hemorrhagic fluid were removed.
Following the procedure overnight, there was no further drainage from the pericardial drain.
This revealed no effusion and it was felt the patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint.
The biopsy revealed nonseminomatous germ cell yoke sac tumor.
Staging workup included a head magnetic resonance scan which revealed no lesions, as well as an ultrasound of the scrotum which was within normal limits.
Fluid drained from the pericardial and pleural effusions were negative for malignant cells.
Infection - During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he continued to have shortness of breath as well as a cough with mild hemoptysis.
This was thought most likely secondary to the tumor burden, however, the patient was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Clindamycin as broad spectrum therapy with a question of postobstructive pneumonia.
Subsequently, the patient did well with no further fevers.
Pleural effusion - The patient had a left sided chest tube placed for drainage of pleural fluid.
Following the removal of the chest tube, the patient had continued drainage from the site of the tube.
Pericardial effusion, status post drainage.
Left pleural effusion, status post drainage.
