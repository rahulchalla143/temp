Possible fall but no signs of acute trauma.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute cervical fracture or subluxation.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
There are multilevel chronic degenerative changes, most prominent at C5-6 with posterior osteophyte, causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
In the visualized lung apices, there are mild paraseptal emphysematous changes and bilateral dependent atelectasis.
There are an endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube.
There is secretion pooling in the dependent position of the posterior pharynx.
No acute cervical fracture or subluxation.
Prominent posterior osteophytosis at level C5/C6, which increases risk of spinal cord injury even in minor trauma.
THERE WERE NO PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS.
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] L. [**Doctor Last Name **]   FINDINGS: ROUTINE SAMPLINGS: Showed a general suppression of the background with bursts of either generalized or left or right activity seen with a frequency of between 8 and 12 seconds.

Showed no epielptiform features.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations in this file.
