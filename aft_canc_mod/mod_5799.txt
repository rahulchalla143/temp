Obstructing stone at distal left ureter, measuring 7 mm and increase of the left hydronephrosis, with significant amount of perinephric stranding, and multiple calculi, which suggests calyceal rupture though additional pyelonephritis not excluded.
Stable hydronephrosis on the right with a small amount of perinephric stranding.
Many renal stones seen in the left lower calyx and the atrophic right kidney.
Scattered diverticula in the descending colon with paracolic fat stranding; however, stranding could be from the adjacent left kidney.
[**2120-8-17**] Liver/Gallbladder U/S: IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis.
[**2120-8-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Evidence of retrocardiac density - pneumonia versus progressive atelectasis.
No change in size of low-density perinephric fluid collection following left percutaneous nephrostomy.
Again this likely reflects a combination of hematoma mixed with urine.
Unchanged collection of contrast material posterior to the left kidney following procedure.
No intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hematoma to explain hematocrit drop.
6-mm left ureteral calculus unchanged in location, with decrease in hydroureter.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
[**2120-8-26**] UE DOPPLER IMPRESSION: No left upper extremity DVT .
Increase in size of low-density, perinephric fluid collection, with interval increase in number of air foci within the fluid collection following left percutaneous nephrostomy, while this may represent a urinoma, seroma or hematoma, superinfection cannot be excluded.
Stable hydronephrosis of the left kidney with mild decrease in size of superior subcapsular fluid collection, concerning for calyceal rupture, as described before.
Bilateral renal stones.
Left 7 mm distal ureteral obstructing stone.
Stable bilateral small pleural effusion with bilateral dependent atelectasis; cannot rule out superinfection.
Fibroid uterus.
Interval improvement in multiloculated bilateral perinephric collection, with near complete collapse of the left posterolateral cavity containing a previously placed pigtail catheter in situ.
Bilateral coarse renal calculi and ureteral calculi, unchanged.
No other significant changes with persistent bilateral small pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis right hepatic lobe hypoattenuating lesion, cholelithiasis and fibroid uterus.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 28893**] is 58F with history of nephrolithiasis and postobstructive renal failure, history of urosepsis, who presented to the ER with N/V and weakness and found to have UTI/pyelonephritis, ARF, and severe sepsis.
## Sepsis/pyelonephritis/peri-nephric abscess: When patient was admitted she had fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia with evidence of end organ dysfunction.
Her sepsis was likely due to a urinary source given her history, UA with bacteria, and appearance of left kidney.
On HD2 she had a percutaneous nephrostomy placed to decompress left ureter d/t obstruction with stone.
Despite the nephrostomy placement and antibiotics, her leukocytosis and intermittent fever resumed on HD11.
She had a repeat CT scan on HD14 which revealed perinephric abscess.
Patient defervesced and leukocytosis resolved.
Urology was made aware of her condition, but did not want to intervene further until her abscess improved.
It revealed the abscess with the pigtail catheter was resolving, but that 2 other abscesses were present.
At the time of discharge she had a normal WBC, was afebrile for >10days.
She was set up with home nursing care to help with the pigtail catheter drain to her perinephric abscess and the nephrostomy tube at home.
They will dose and make further changes to her antibiotics.
Pt experienced a significant hct drop in setting of her illness and IVF: 35->16.2 over course of 10 days  (HD1 to HD 11).
There was no evidence of active bleeding with exception of small amount from nephrostomy drainage.
CT scan showed no retroperitoneal bleed on HD15.
She had an INR of 1.8 on HD4 that was reversed with vitamin K.  Her anemia was microcytic, but iron studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
## Acute Renal Failure in the setting of CKD.
Ms. [**Known lastname 28893**] has CKD from previous episodes of postrenal failure.
Her ARF was likely due to both her stone obstructing her ureter and her sepsis limiting flow to the kidney.
## Elevated LFTs.
This was thought to be due to ischemic insult from hypotensive episode.
These lab abnormalities resolved with treatment of urosepsis and IV hydration.
Urology put in her left percutaneous nephrostomy tube, ordered a urine gram stain and culture which grew out Strep Viridians.
Patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] as outpatient to discuss surgical management of her stones after her infection resolves.
##Depression: Patient started to feel depressed about the severity and course ofher treatment.
Social work was consulted to help her deal with some of her home issues  ## Diarrhea during hospital stay patient had diarrhea for 4 days.
Patient was found to have hypernatremia (Na: 149) on HD [**1-3**].
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
These labs can be entered into the [**Hospital1 **] system to be followed by all of her physcians   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe sepsis Pyelonephritis Nephrolithiasis perinephric abscess   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of a severe infection that began in your kidney.
This infection likely started because of a stone obstructing the urine flow from your kidney to the bladder.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have fever greater than 101, abdominal or back pain, bleeding or pain with urination, difficulties with your nephrostomy tube, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
At that point you can decide how to approach the management of your stones and your nephrostomy (tube draining urine from your kidney).
