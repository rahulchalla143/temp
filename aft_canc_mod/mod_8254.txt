Given given his recent right upper lobectomy, there was concern for a bronchial stump leak or bronchopleural fistula formation responsible for his pneumothorax.
The bronchoscopy showed a middle lobe positional occlusion, likely due to kinking of the middle bronchial stem as the middle lobe expanded in the absence of the upper lobe.
There was no evidence to suggest a bronchopleural fistula or a bronchial stump air leak.
Finally, we placed him on pneumostat again, which this time showed no air leak.
