Admission Date:  [**2181-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-11-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-9-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, hemiplegia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 39-year-old woman with a history of endometrial cancer with recently discovered poorly differentiated lesion to the right femur, s/p open reduction internal fixation on [**2181-11-1**] on prophylactic lovenox therapy presented with altered mental status and hemiplegia.
[**Last Name (un) **] was found at her facility tonight unreponsive and hemiparetic on the left with severe weakness, was at her baseline two hours prior.
Of note patient was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (2) 100063**] with episode of chest pain.
No clear source was identified, however patient was noted to new metastatic lesions of the lung, femur, and adrenals on imaging.
She was noted to have hypercalcemia which was managed with pamidronate.
She completed her outpt workup for RLE mass which underwent open reduction and internal fixation.
She subsquently underwent 5 rounds of radiation tx to her right femur for pain control.
Palliative care was also consulted for assistance with pain management.
Exam with L sided weakness, with some resistance to gravity.
Due to initial concern for septic emboli from her surgical site she was treated with 1gm Vancomycin.
CT head demonstrated multiple hyperdense lesions with surrounding edema thought to be hemorrhagic conversion of mets.
Ortho also consulted for evaluation of RLE edema, thought to be related to recent surgery.
RLE Xray with no acute pathology.
- Imaging from [**2181-10-6**]: bilateral hilar adenopathy up to 2cm, right adrenal nodule, multiple bilateral lesions in the kidneys, a 1.4 cm subcutaneous soft tissue nodule in the right inguinal region, andmultiple 1-cm right inguinal lymph nodes.
5X5X22 cm right distal femoral mass with soft tissue extension.
- Femoral mass pathology poorly differentiated carcinoma "compatible with" endometrial carcinoma.
She has no  family history of clotting disorders or heart disease.
oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU:  foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses.
RLE warm, nonerythemetous, twice the size of LLE, but edema nonpitting.
Neuro: pupils reactive, unable to assess other cranial nerves as pt not responsive, left facial droop.
DISCHARGE EXAM General: More responsive this AM, able to follow commands HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils small but reactive bilaterally, oropharynx clear Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU:  foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses.
RLE warm, nonerythemetous, twice the size of LLE, but edema nonpitting.
EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study because of diffusely suppressed and slow background indicative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were present in the record.
A note was made of sinus tachycardia and occasional premature wide complex beats.
CT head: IMPRESSION: Multiple hyperdense masses involving both the superficial and deep white matter and deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, with an area of vasogenic edema in the left occipital lobe.
Differential diagnosis is broad, though findings are most likely secondary to hemorrhagic metastases given the clinical history.
Other possibilities, though less likely include hemorrhagic infarcts secondary to dural venous or cortical venous thrombosis, spontaneous hemorrhage from complication of anticoagulation (given the recent history of orthopedic surgery), lymphoma or infection.
Further characterization with MRI of the brain is recommended   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 39 y/o f with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma who was admitted for AMS and new left hemiplegia found to be likely d/t newly diagnosed malignant metastases to brain (multiple lesions) with hemorrhage into right thalamic lesion.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS) ??????
patient was transientently intubatied for airway protection to allow for disgnostic testing.
No clinical or EEG evidence for active seizures.
Treated with oral steroids and prophylactic anti-convulsant.
BRAIN LESIONS ??????
Likely metastatic disease from her known poorly differentiated CA of uncertain primary.
Evidence for hemorrhage into lesions per CT.
Per our oncology team no further theraputic or palliative chemo/radiation can be offered that would be of benefit to the patient.
likely [**2-7**] to acute bleed into brain mets(consistent with right thalamic lesion and hemmorage seen on CT).
metastatic poorly differentiated, unclear etiology.
Per oncology team no plans for further chemotherapy.
RIGHT LEG SWELLING ??????
No further interventions with Orthopedic service.
No evidence for DVT by LE NIVS.
