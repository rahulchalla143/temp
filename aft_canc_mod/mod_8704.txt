HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old female with multiple medical problems (see below), including dementia, diabetes type 2, breast cancer, pulmonary fibrosis and a history of intermittent GI bleeding, is admitted due to patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] and had a hematocrit of 26 with heme positive stool.
The patient was unable to tolerate a barium enema study.
Due to her pulmonary disease she was not felt to be a good candidate for a colonoscopy.
Left breast mass has been stable as of her last CAT scan in [**2120-10-18**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Anemia iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis with subsequent pulmonary fibrosis on Prednisone and oxygen.
Urinary tract recurrent infections recently with MRSA.
History of right humeral fracture.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive family history of colon cancer in two cousins.
Neck supple, no carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Her hospital course was complicated by discovery of a large colonic mass found to be adenocarcinoma of the colon.
Also complicated by removal of bleeding polyps in the cecum.
This was followed by interventional radiology embolization of ileocolic artery.
Course also complicated by MRSA bacteremia and multidrug resistant Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
Course also complicated by congestive heart failure secondary to massive blood product requirement.
Also complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
[**11-1**] colonoscopy biopsy demonstrated fragments of adenoma with focal high grade dysplasia.
[**11-5**], repeat colonoscopy demonstrated bleeding at the cecum that was controlled with epinephrine and clipping.
A mass was also noted at the ascending colon with a biopsy consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Biopsy also demonstrated bleeding from the previous polypectomy sites.
Contrast radiography demonstrated active extravasation originating from a third order branch arising off the SMA, a branch of the ileocolic artery.
Follow up angiography showed no active extravasation.
The procedure was complicated by a drop coil down the right leg arterial system with no further sequela.
The patient was given a fourteen day course of Flagyl for potential ischemic colitis secondary to massive epinephrine use.
The patient had two mild episodes of hematochezia subsequent to her embolization.
The patient's post procedural course was complicated by abdominal pain that was presumed secondary to the multiple abdominal manipulations during this admission.
A KUB was unrevealing on [**11-14**] as were liver function tests and amylase studies.
Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy:  Likely secondary to multiple infections (see below) and underlying malignancies.
No evidence of active bleeding by the day of discharge.
MRSA bacteremia:  The patient had a low grade temperature on [**11-7**].
Klebsiella urinary tract infection:  The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and yeast colonization.
A urinalysis was unrevealing on [**11-5**] and culture demonstrated moderate yeast.
Pain secondary to multiple abdominal procedures:  The patient was maintained on morphine sulfate at .5 to 2 mg intravenous q 2 hours prn pain.
Anemia secondary to lower gastrointestinal bleed:  Also has iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.
Congestive heart failure:  In [**2118-9-18**] the patient had abnormal echocardiogram with a preserved ejection fraction.
Her hospital course this admission was complicated by congestive heart failure in the setting of massive blood product requirement with subsequent increase supplemental oxygen requirement.
No electrocardiogram changes.
Atypical pain felt to be secondary to multiple abdominal procedures.
Supplemental O2 requirement 4 liters nasal cannula.
Much of her agitation and dementia on this admission was felt to be secondary to the setting of hospitalization including multiple procedures and an Intensive Care Unit stay.
Code status:  The patient is DNR/DNI, no pressors.
Lower gastrointestinal bleed, status post two colonoscopies, status post cecal polypectomy, status post ileocolic artery embolization.
Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy secondary to infection/malignancy.
Klebsiella urinary tract infection (status post seven day course of Imipenem).
Congestive heart failure (preserved EF secondary to volume overload.
Diabetes mellitus.
Check temperature daily and monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.
CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI no pressors.
