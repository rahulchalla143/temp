Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Small right lung base consolidation.
Large bilateral renal cysts.
<br> CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion, simple in attenuation.
There is adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation within a portion of the posterior right lung base.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are coarse coronary artery calcifications, particularly involving the LAD.
Small amounts of oral contrast are seen within the gastric lumen.
Minimal high-density material is seen dependently within the gallbladder, possibly representing layering stones.
The adrenal glands are minimally bulky, without a focal mass lesion, unchanged.
There is no hydronephrosis of the kidneys.
Oral contrast opacifies the remaining portion of the colon, or several diverticula are seen.
Visualized small bowel loops also contains some oral contrast, but are otherwise unremarkable.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
There is no free fluid.
Small retroperitoneal nodes are seen adjacent to the IVC measuring up to about 7 cm size (2:36).
Oral contrast is seen within the lower half of the esophagus, and a rounded structure within the lumen of the mid esophagus at the level of the carina likely represents retained food.
Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and there is a small pericardial effusion.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease as described.
Findings reviewed with the GI fellow on [**2124-10-30**].
Duodenum:  Protruding Lesions There was a question of a small sub-mucosal mass of benign appearance at the duodenal bulb.
These were considered low risk for bleeding.
Other procedures: As ulcers and duodenitis were considered low risk, decision was made to proceed with PEG placement.
<br> Impression: Atrophy in the antrum Low risk ulcers and duodenitis in the duodenal bulb Successful PEG placement (PEG) Question of small submucosal mass in duodenal bulb.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: High dose protonix 40 mg twice a day Please check H. Pylori serology and treat if positive No further intervention for now for question of submucosal mass unless symptomatic or further bleeding.
Duodenitis and ulcer may have accounted for slow hct decline.
<br>  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 85 year old man with a history of Alzheimer's, diverticulosis, recently diagnosed colon CA, status post hemicolectomy on [**2124-10-9**] presented with dark stools and acute blood loss anemia and malnutrition from The [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
He was hemodynamically stable and underwent EGD, revealing:  "Atrophy in the antrum, Low risk ulcers and duodenitis in the duodenal bulb, Successful PEG placement (PEG), Question of small submucosal mass in duodenal bulb, Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum."
It was felt these ulcers were likely accounting for the blood loss and occult blood positive stools.
Once on the General Medical Floor, he had trouble tolerating his TFs initially with emesis and nausea.
The GI Fellow pulled the tube back and abdominal x-ray showed it no longer in the esophagus.
TFs were resumed and the patient had no difficuties thereafter.
<br> Alzheimer's Dementia and Depression:  Pt oriented to self, but not place or time.
<br> Submucosal Mass seen on EGD:  Unclear if this requires follow-up.
<br> Remaining open surgical wound:  minimal opening, excellent granulation tissue, no evidence for infection, appears to be healing well.
<br> Mucinous Adenocarcinoma with 1/3 positive lymph nodes, adenopathy seen on CT scan:  Consider outpatient follow up with GI oncology if patient/family desire.
<br> Please note, the patient may have some dark stools given his recent GI bleed, but this should resolve over time.
You may consider checking a Hct if you are concerned that he is bleeding again, though the suspicion that his duodenal ulcers will bleed any more is small as he is on treatment for H. pylori and a high dose PPI.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed: hold for loose stools.
