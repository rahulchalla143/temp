He was status post chemoembolization of hepatic mass at [**Hospital1 2177**] in the setting of elevated AFP.
CT scans have shown hepatic mass with question of thrombus in adjacent hepatic vein.
He was subsequently listed for liver transplant for advanced liver cirrhosis and unresectable HCC.
History of CVA in [**2129-8-17**] with residual right leg weakness.
ALLERGIES:  Lisinopril with which the patient gets mouth and lip swelling.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone, no children.

He denies a change in bowel function.
No change in urinary symptoms.
He denies headaches, visual changes.
He reports right leg weakness which is baseline.
He denies chest pain shortness of breath.
Recent echocardiogram in [**2131-7-19**] demonstrated ejection fraction of greater than 60%, no ventricular septal defects, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EXAMINATION:  General: The patient is comfortable in no acute distress.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no CVA tenderness.
CV is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended, no organomegaly.
Extremities - no C/C/E, no calf tenderness.
Right lower extremity is [**1-20**] proximally.
No deficits in the left lower extremity.
The patient had a chest x-ray status post liver transplant for NG tube placement which demonstrated moderate layering right pulmonary effusion and a small left pleural effusion.
There was a left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
On the following day, the patient had another ultrasound with confirmed vascular flow which demonstrated a 13.7 x 7 x 11 cm subhepatic hematoma, moderate ascites, patent hepatic vasculature, no evidence of hydronephrosis.
It was noted on the chest x-ray on [**2132-1-26**] that the patient had a new right lower lobe infiltrate, most likely representing pneumonia.
In the appropriate clinical setting, could also represent aspiration or pulmonary hemorrhage.
On [**2132-1-26**], a bronchoscopy was performed in the ICU for a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia.
morphine, treated for right pneumonia.
The bronchial washings on [**2132-1-26**] demonstrated that the Gram stain showed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no microorganisms seen.
There was no acid-fast bacilli seen on direct smear nor concentrated smear.
Viral culture for cytomegalovirus is pending.
On [**2132-1-30**], the patient had an ERCP demonstrating that there was a normal distal pancreatic duct.
The cholangiogram revealed a non- dilated native and donor bile duct.
A bile leak was seen at the level of the anastomosis.
A 10-French 8 cm Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully across the anastomosis into the donor bile duct and bile was seen draining into the duodenum.
They felt that his weakness could be mechanical due to irritation from pneumo boots.
However, he does have significant weakness in his distal right leg and they felt that because of the liver transplant, it is possible to have worsening of old deficits like his residual stroke.
There was no extravasation of the contrast.
The patient was afebrile and vital signs were stable, good I's and O's, JP drains medial put out 15 and lateral put out 50.
The patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable.
Abdomen - well-healed incision, distended.
Extremities - the patient had +3 edema bilaterally in lower extremities.
