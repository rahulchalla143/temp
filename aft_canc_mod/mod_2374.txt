HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer of the left lower lobe diagnosed in [**2131-1-26**] status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy for locally advanced disease, and status post radiation treatment for brain metastases, who is admitted for pneumonia and failure to thrive with decreased oral intake and weakness which has worsened over the prior two to three weeks.
Also, she had a rash and urinary frequency.
She was admitted and treated for a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and volume depletion.
On admission, she was found to have worsening hypertension with shortness of breath that was not improved with a saline bolus and with Lasix.
An echocardiogram report showed a pericardial effusion with tamponade and pulsus paradoxus of 16.
The patient had a pericardiocentesis with a drain placement that removed 500 cc of fluid and an additional 200 cc to 300 cc of fluid at the bedside.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 94.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 95 to 100, blood pressure was 91 to 110/35 to 58, respiratory was 18, oxygen saturation was 95% on 4 liters, and a pulse of 6 mmHg.
She had jugular venous pressure at 1 cm above the clavicle at 30 degrees.
Cardiovascular examination was significant for a regular rate and rhythm and without murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Extremities were significant for an erythematous macular rash on the upper and lower extremities bilaterally as well as the chest.
Pretibial edema of 1+.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe pneumonia with atelectasis and consolidation.
Electrocardiogram showed low voltage with sinus rhythm at 106, diffuse minimal ST elevations, and question of electrical alternans.
Echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, with moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, and right ventricular diastolic collapse; consistent with impaired filling and tamponade.
The echocardiogram after pericardial drainage showed the effusion was resolved.
No residual fluid or residual tamponade, and a thickened pericardial rim.
It was decided to place another larger pericardial catheter instead of a pericardial window for drainage of the pericardial space.
In addition, a drain was placed in the pleural space to drain bilateral pleural effusions.
Cytology of the pericardial fluid showed malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Atrial fibrillation occurred intermittently.
The patient had pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions for which a pleural drain was placed.
The patient had episodes of oxygen desaturations to the middle 80s on room air and was maintained on 15 liters face mask at 96% and eventually was able to be weaned down to was 2 liters nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the low 90s.
The acute renal failure on admission was complicated by hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia, and an increased anion gap.
The patient's pneumonia on admission was treated with levofloxacin 250 mg q.d.
once the acute renal failure was resolved.
The hospital course was also complicated by increased liver function tests with an AST of 5700 that eventually resolved on its own.
The patient was found to have low platelets and a positive screen for heparin antibody.
Neurologically, the patient worsened after the placement of the second pericardial drain and remained intermittently lucid and disoriented.
Nutritionally, the patient was admitted with a decreased oral intake; and this, give and take, worsened throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
Finally, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was complicated by hypercalcemia which was treated with moderate success with intravenous normal saline and intravenous Lasix.
as needed for anxiety and restlessness; given sublingually and dispensed with 2 cc of 5 mg/cc elixir.
as needed for pain or dyspnea; dispense 2 cc of 50 mg/cc elixir.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   End-stage metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
