Admission Date:  [**2169-5-13**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old [**Year (4 digits) 595**] female who is non-English speaking who has a history of multiple medical problems including [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], CAD, breast cancer, who presents to the ED with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
The patient has had this abdominal pain chronically for many months.
She denied bloody stools or tarry black stools.
The patient also describes chest pain, exertional, without any associated shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diuresis.
Review of systems was positive for cough, weight loss of 25-35 pounds, night sweats, negative for fevers and chills and diarrhea.
History of breast cancer, status post lumpectomy, radiation, and Arimidex treatment with no negative dissection.
Status post inguinal hernia repair.
Status post left arm fracture.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There were dry mucous membranes.
There was a II/VI systolic murmur in the left lower sternal border.
Lungs: Decreased at the left bases, crackles bilaterally.
No rebound tenderness.
Extremities:  No edema.
Dorsalis pedis palpable.
The patient's U/A did not show evidence of a urinary tract infection.
The patient's chest x-ray showed left midzone consolidation/collapse and a large left-sided pleural effusion which is new from previous x-rays but has been seen on x-rays here as recently as last year.
ABNORMAL CHEST X-RAY:  Given the patient's nonspecific complaints and lack of further information for the patient in the OMR secondary to a new MR number being assigned in the ER, the patient underwent a CT of the torso while in the ER.
The CT demonstrated left upper lobe with a dense consolidation as well as a small opacity, 1.7 by 1.2 cm in the right upper lobe as well as a large left-sided pleural effusion and some small pretracheal nodes.
Given the concern for possible tuberculosis infection, the patient was placed on respiratory precautions the following day.
However, the patient's story was much much more suspicious for a malignancy and indeed two days following admission the cytology for the pleural fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma, either metastatic from breast or new lung adenoma CA.
At this time, they are awaiting further stains to determine whether it is metastatic or lung cancer as this will determine possibility of further (palliative) treatment.
On chest x-ray following the thoracentesis, a small 10% apical pneumothorax was demonstrated.
They felt that the malignant effusion and pneumothorax warranted a pleurex catheter with pleuroscopy and possible pleurodesis.
They did a bronchoscopy with normal bronchi seen and no abnormalities on [**2169-5-18**].
The patient did have an oxygen requirement during her hospital stay.
On room air, the patient was approximately 88% oxygen saturation without shortness of breath except on exertion.
An ABG demonstrated respiratory acidosis and on examination, the patient sounded wet and she was then diuresed 2 liters with some improvement in her sats and symptoms.
The patient was continued to be diuresed as her daily chest x-rays revealed worsening pulmonary edema, although no change in the apical pneumothorax.
The patient did undergo a bedside echocardiogram in the hospital which demonstrated diastolic dysfunction with a normal EF and moderate aortic stenosis.
ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Outside records were obtained from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital which demonstrated that the patient had a recent EGD with duodenal ulcer.
The patient was treated with Protonix and sucralfate and this appeared to improve her symptoms dramatically.
QUESTIONABLE PNEUMONIA:  The patient did initially have a white count on admission but no fever.
She was started on levo and Flagyl for a possible postobstructive pneumonia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient initially was in acute renal failure which was prerenal by electrolytes.
POLYCYTHEMIA [**Doctor First Name **]:  The patient was continued on her Hydrea in-house.
CODE STATUS/END OF LIFE AND COMMUNICATION ISSUES:  During initial family meeting with the patient and her husband, using a [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter, the patient said that she did not want to be intubated or resuscitated.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in the Interventional Pulmonary Clinic as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who follows her polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who has followed her for her breast cancer.
