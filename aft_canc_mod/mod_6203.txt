CT from OSH: incomplete cuts of upper abdomen, very large R-sided liver lesion c/w hemangioma with peripheral pooling of contrast She was admitted to the SICU with close monitoring of Hct.
CT repeated here showed: - Large 12 x 14 cavernous hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver causing mass effect.
- Cholelithiasis.
- Hypodense lesions within the bilateral kidneys, too small to characterize.
- Fundal uterine fibroid.
- Left adnexal cyst.
She received two units of RBCs while in the ICU, HCT remained stable and she was taken to the OR on [**2139-9-11**] with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Exploratory laparotomy and enucleation of hepatic hemangioma.
Post op diagnosis was cavernous hemangioma.
A moderate amount of hemorrhage was encountered that was just a raw surface bleeding from the surface of the hemangioma.
Her ICU course was uneventful and she was transferred to the floor  Her pain was initially treated with an epidural and a PCA.
We had to adjust her oral pain medications due to some discomfort, but achieved a regimen that worked well for the patient.
Initially on the floor, the patient had a poor appetite which resolved by POD7.
