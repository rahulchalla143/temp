History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 66-year-old female diagnosed w/ muscle invasive bladder cancer.
Recently she was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis as a result of bladder wall thickening -- partially due to her TURBT from  [**Hospital3 6265**] and partially from her bladder cancer that is located near the right ureteral orifice.
She has had [**11-14**] lbs weight loss in the last 2 months.
She has some urinary urgency/frequency with the two ureteral stents and currently she's wearing a urinary protective diaper b/c of her severe urinary symptoms   Past Medical History: RA, osteoporosis, bladder CA Hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, TURBT at [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2151-10-29**]; Bilateral ureteral stent placements  Social History: She smokes one pack of cigarettes per day.
There is no flank tenderness or discomfort or palpable abdominal mass or inguinal ymphadenopathy.
On POD7 the patient started complaining of increased abdominal pain.
On POD8 the patient had a persisent left lower lobe consolidation despite treatemtn with Levaquin.
There is extravasation of contrast at the left ureteral anastomosis with contrast layering in a large pelvic fluid collection.
There is an additional fluid collection posterior to this which does not have contrast within it.
Given the patient's clinical history of leukocytosis and fever, infection of the fluid cannot be excluded.
Drainage could be performed via CT guidance and a posterior approach, though it would be technically difficult.. 2.
Persistent bilateral hydronephrosis.
Moderate left-sided pleural effusion and smaller right-sided pleural effusion.
A left percutaneous nephroureteral stent  was placed by IR and she had CT guided drainage of her pelvic urinoma with a pigtail catheter placement.
A loopogram was obtained which suggested a right ureteroleal anastamotic leak.
Marked reduction in size of pelvic fluid collection (urinoma) with pigtail catheter in place.
Bowel loops are unremarkable and there is no evidence of abscess.
Decrease in the amount of ascites with small residual collection in left lower quadrant.
Diffuse anasarca remains.
Decreased size of moderate left-sided pleural effusion with resolution of right-sided pleural effusion A pigtail creatinine was obtained which was still high so the drain was left in place.
