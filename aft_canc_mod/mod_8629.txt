Admission Date:  [**2165-2-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-2-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2115-11-1**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Blue Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old African-American female who underwent a sigmoid colectomy in [**2163-10-5**] for adenocarcinoma of the colon with one positive lymph node.
She was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of hepatic resection for this metastatic disease to the liver.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Colon adenocarcinoma with positive lymph node and status post surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.
Past surgical history is significant for status post sigmoid colectomy in [**2152**] and status post brain tumor resection in [**2145**], status post uvulectomy and sinus surgery.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to sulfa and penicillin which cause rash.
Family history is significant for a mother who died of cerebrovascular accident.
Her father died of a myocardial infarction and question of IHSS at age 45.
Sister died at age 47 of a myocardial infarction and question of IHSS.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is moderately obese female in no acute distress.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.
No lymphadenopathy and no thyromegaly.
Cardiac examination is normal, S1 loud, split S2, there is a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, normal bowel sounds, and no masses.
Extremities have no peripheral edema.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], which is only significant for an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18-20, but her coronary arteries were open, which is a moderate surgical risk.
CTA showed one liver lesion in segment six of the right lobe measuring 2.7 x 5.2 cm.
Second lesion in segment 4A measuring 3.8 x 4.6 cm.
She tolerated this procedure well and received 3,000 Crystalloid and estimated blood loss of 400 and urine output of 640.
Neurologically her pain was controlled with epidural for the first postoperative day.
Her pain has appropriately decreased and her use of pain medications has appropriately decreased.
Due to the history of diabetes, it is unknown if this was an atypical chest pain versus perhaps some laryngeal edema secondary to intubation.
She had an electrocardiogram which showed paced rhythm which was unchanged from a previous electrocardiogram.
She had one other episode, but has denied having any other episodes of her throat closing.
Much of her symptoms have been focused only around her airway.
During this period also she did not have any periods of desaturation and remained hemodynamically stable.
Her wound has remained clean, dry, and intact.
She received diabetic teaching while in the hospital.
The section 6 and 4 resection were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon.
Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma to the liver.
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
The patient has had diabetic teaching for insulin shots.
