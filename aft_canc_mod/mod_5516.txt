Admission Date:  [**2179-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-2-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: fall, unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 66921**] is a 75 year old man with history of grade 4 left parieto-occipital GBM, found minimally responsive after a fall at home in the bathroom at 8 p.m. tonight.
He has not been taking steroids as far as she knows and there have been no recent changes to his medications.
However, he has become less interactive, perseverating about his brain all the time, and is having increasing difficulty getting about with his walker.
He has been in two car accidents in the past two months (both his fault, rear-ending people), after one of which he was reportedly found to have increased cerebral edema and was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] (per an ED discharge summary from [**Hospital3 10310**] that was included with his paperwork).
She called 911 and he was brought by EMS to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital, where his blood pressure was 212/111 with hr 102, and where his exam was documented as revealing equal pupils, "unresponsive," and right sided weakness (unclear how much the weakness represented a change from his baseline neurologic exam).
He had a head CT there which revealed significant vasogenic edema of the left hemisphere and small areas of hemorrhage at the left frontal pole and the right occipital region (?within ventricle or mass).
He had a repeat head CT which revealed the areas of hemorrhage to be unchanged, but increased rightward shift compared to the scan from earlier this evening.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and felt there was no acute surgical intervention to be done at this time.

Diffuse hypodensity within the left brain consistent with edema and history of GBM with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Medial shift of left temporal lobe concerning for impending uncal herniation.
CT C-SPINE anterior wedging of C7 cervical body, of uncertain acuity  CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS dependent changes and atelectasis at lung bases, s/p right nephrectomy, left parapelvic kidney cysts  [**6-6**] Head CT FINDINGS:  Compared to the exam obtained one day earlier, there are stable foci of hemorrhage within the left frontal and parietal lobes.
There is unchanged hypodensity within the left cerebral white matter and shift of normally midline structures to the right.
Medial shift of the left temporal lobe is again seen and stable.
There is increased fluid within the paranasal sinuses; however, the patient is intubated.
There is no definite evidence of uncal herniation.
[**6-6**] Chest X-ray FINDINGS:  There are multiple new ill-defined opacities in both lungs (left greater than right) likely represent multifocal pneumonia.
A small left pleural effusion is also present.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 76 year old male with history of grade 4 GBM, undergoing treatment with Temazolamide under the care of Dr.[**Name (NI) 24469**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], who presented after he fell and became minimally responsive, with preserved brainstem reflexes, in the setting of significant cerebral edema (vasogenic, related to tumor), which probably reflects underlying progression of his disease.
He has two moderately small hemorrhages, one at the left frontal pole (likely traumatic contusion) and one in the occipito-parietal region which looks like it could be within an area of tumor.
The hemorrhages are not significant enough to account for his mental status, which is almost certainly due to the cerebral edema.
He is also at risk for seizures, although no overt seizure activity has been witnessed thus far, and the presence of the hemorrhages further increases cortical irritability.
Plan: - Admit to Neurology ICU NEURO: - Continue Decadron 4 mg q6h - Mannitol 25 mg q4h, hold for osm >320, Na >150 - Increase Keppra to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] - Avoid sedating medications as able - Repeat CT STAT if neurologic status declines FEN: - NS at 60 cc/hr, try to keep fluid balance negative - [**Hospital1 **] lytes - NPO RESP: - Wean vent as able CV: - treat hypertension with hydralazine prn ENDO: - RISS GI: - Pantoprazole HEME: - Hold off on Heparin or ASA for now due to hemorrhage - Daily CBC PROPHY: - Pneumoboots  * * *  Mr. [**Known lastname 66922**] physical exam and mental status did not improve, despite treatment with mannitol and decadron.
He developed a multifocal pneumonia on [**6-6**] as well.
They expressed understanding of his poor prognosis and the unlikely chance of recovery, and decided that that they would like to withdraw care and institute comfort measures only.
