The patient was transferred to the floor on the [**2121-11-3**], at which point she was in no acute distress.
She had a clear mental status and her main complaints were abdominal pain status post exploratory laparotomy.
Tumor lysis and prophylaxis was ongoing with allopurinol and aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma.
However, the treatment protocol was compromised by the patient's physical status and several other factors.
Methotrexate was never administered because of the patient's large pleural effusions.
Also, a phosphoamide treatment was discontinued after original administration resulted in a significant change in mental status.
PANCREATITIS:  The patient exhibited abdominal pain on admission which was attributed to infiltration of her colon by lymphoma.
Moreover, treatment with chemotherapy was expected to result in a high risk of bowel perforation because of melting of the large tumor mass that had infiltrated her colon.
Upon her admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain.
Laboratory results showed an elevated amylase and lipase level which continued to rise and was associated with increased abdominal pain.
Gradually, the amylase and lipase blood levels dropped and the patient's abdominal pain subsided.
A repeat abdominal CT scan showed improvement in her status with a regulation of lymphoma and radiographic features of pancreatitis.
RESPIRATORY STATUS:  Throughout her second week of hospitalization, the patient complained of increased shortness of breath.
A thoracentesis was performed on the [**2121-11-11**], and two liters of bloody fluid were aspirated.
A cytology revealed the presence of the lymphoma cells.
The patient tolerated the actual procedure well, however, shortly afterwards, she exhibited hypotension and had to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure support.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  In addition to the above described episode of hypotension, the patient remained tachycardic throughout her hospitalization.
The decline in her left ventricular function continued and on the [**2121-11-14**], her left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 20% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis identified by echocardiogram.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] status post exploratory laparotomy, and at that time she was treated with Levofloxacin, Metronidazole and Cefepime because of her post surgical status and her high risk for bowel perforation because of her treatment for lymphoma that had infiltrated her colon.
Following the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient's white blood cell count dropped, she became neutropenic, and soon afterwards, she exhibited fever, as her antibiotic coverage was modified to include meropenem and Vancomycin.
Her mental status and her general performance status improved, and the patient became afebrile for a period of three days.
It should also be noted that the patient has currently a double lumen PICC placed which, given her prior repeated candidemia, predisposes her to future development of fungal infection.
However, the risk for future fungal infection must be weighed against the need for intravenous access for this patient who needs several intravenous medications and total parenteral nutrition.
MENTAL STATUS:  The patient's mental status throughout her hospitalization fluctuated with altered mental status during the period when she was afebrile and she had positive blood cultures for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
However, when her mental status and general performance status somewhat recovered from the fungal infection, she was treated with additional chemotherapy including Ifosfamide.
A radiographic imaging of her brain was negative for acute events.
Following the patient's reaction to this medication, it was decided to stop any further chemotherapeutic treatment.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Upon arrival, the patient had Burkitt's lymphoma with abdominal presentation, including infiltration of her appendix, cecum, and terminal ileum.
She also developed pancreatitis following her exploratory laparotomy in the outside hospital.
During her first week of hospitalization at the [**Hospital1 69**] the patient was complaining of significant abdominal diffuse pain and was at severe risk for bowel perforation as her Burkitt's lymphoma was expected to respond to her chemotherapeutic regimen.
Fortunately, her pain subsided with a very temporary support with morphine and her abdominal examination normalized.
Follow-up abdominal CT scan without intravenous contrast performed on the [**2121-11-14**], revealed no bowel dilatation and no bowel wall thickening which was interpreted as a favorable response of her lymphoma to chemotherapy.
The patient remained without abdominal complaints for an additional two weeks of her hospitalization.
However, on the [**2121-11-27**], the patient complained of mild tenderness to abdominal palpation for the first time during the last three weeks of her hospitalization.
This was worrisome of recurrence of lymphoma in the abdominal cavity or bowel obstruction caused either by the lymphoma or by adhesions from her exploratory laparotomy or also there was the possibility of an intra-abdominal infection.
A KUB performed at the bedside did not show evidence of obstruction.
contrast and it was decided to avoid using a nasogastric tube because the patient was at the time neutropenic with a very low platelet count.
It has been decided to avoid an aggressive management of her complaint of abdominal tenderness to palpation.
The patient exhibits no rebound or guarding.
Her abdomen is soft and nondistended, and she has been able to hold her bowel movements indicating probable complete bowel obstruction is not probable.
In brief, this is a very frail patient who has been in this hospital for one month and has exhibited a very aggressive manifestation of Burkitt's lymphoma with several complications, including large pleural effusions, hypotension following thoracentesis, Candidemia, with fever and cardiovascular instability, cardiac toxicity with a low left ventricular ejection fraction, changes in her mental status following her fungal infection and administration of Ifosfamide as well as pancreatitis and currently abdominal tenderness to palpation.
Because of the poor performance status of this patient, it has been decided that further chemotherapy should be held off.
The original chemotherapy regimen for this patient was designed to be the Codex-M regimen, however, the patient was never given methotrexate because of her persistent pleural effusions and the patient has had a poor reaction to Ifosfamide with altered mental status, and at this point, further Ifosfamide is being held off.
The patient has received so far several transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets and has had bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as one intrathecal administration of ARA-C and a second lumbar puncture to evaluate her altered mental status which was negative for infection.
