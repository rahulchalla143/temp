Endoscopy on [**4-5**] showing multiple columns of grade [**11-19**] varices with scarring at prior banding sites.
One varices reported to have red whale sign.
It was uncertain if red whale sign due to bleed or NGT trauma so no banding done.
Repeat EGD on [**4-9**] with no bleeding, [**11-19**]+ esophageal varices -> 3 bands were placed at this time.
Also noted to have portal hypertensive gastrophathy and small hiatal hernia.
Was also febrile to 100.7 on that presentation and urine Cx grew enterococcus sensative to Cipro -> treated with Cipro and discahrged on this with plan to continue long term for SBP ppx.
GI at [**Hospital3 **] felt that if patient bleeding again in setting of recent banding that he may need TIPS and for that reason was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU from [**Hospital3 **] ED.
VS stable and no complications in transit.
Unclear if any diagnostic testing for cirrhosis done.

Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and moderate volume ascites.
No focal hepatic lesions identified.
Right pleural effusion, partially imaged.
Gallbladder wall thickening is likely due to underlying chronic liver disease.
EGD [**4-17**]: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 2 cords of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Excavated Lesions Two large non-bleeding ulcers were found where prior banding was performed in the lower third of the esophagus.
Other No evidence of active bleeding Stomach:  Mucosa: Localized discontinuous mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the fundus and stomach body.
These findings are compatible with mild portal gastropathy.
Localized discontinuous erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the antrum.
Other No evidence of polyps, active bleeding or varices Duodenum:  Mucosa: Localized White irregular mucosa of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the second part of the duodenum.
Brief Hospital Course: ID: 80 yr/o M with alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by varices, thrombocytopenia, recent upper GI bleed who presented to [**Hospital 7912**] this AM with reports of black bowel movements and Hct concerning for repeat upper GI bleed.
# Upper GI Bleed: Recent history of UGI bleeds attributed to varices due to alcoholic cirrhosis.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for question of TIPS for refractory variceal bleeding.
Continued to have melena for the first 24hrs so 2 additional units of blood given the morning after admission, as well as 1 dose of Vit K. Hepatology saw in consult and recommended against urgent scope due to recent banding and fear of distrupting prior intervention and causing further bleeding.
Family and patient refused TIPS due to concern for encephalopathy.
He had no further episodes of melena and he did not require any further transfusions.
Repeat EGD on [**4-17**] showed ulcerations at the site of previous banding so this was felt to be the source of his melena.
He should have a repeat endoscopy in six weeks to assess for healing and should have weekly CBCs to monitor blood loss.
# Cirrhosis: Presumed due to alcohol.
Abd U/S showed ascites, radiologic evidence of cirrhosis, and no portal/hepatic clots.
Initially home furosemide and spironolactone were held in setting of acute bleed.
Given Cipro for UTI and SBP prophylaxis as mentioned above and restarted on PO lactulose and rifaximin once taking POs.
# Recent UTI: Enterococcal UTI at OSH that was sensitive to Cipro.
CHRONIC ISSUES # [**Month/Year (2) 112017**]: Continued home levothyroxine  # Recent Seizures: Per family had seizures during recent admission in [**Month (only) 958**].
Had never had seizures prior.
# Possible Dementia: On problem list from [**Hospital3 **].
Unclear if this is related to dementia or encephalopathy.
Disp:*2700 mL* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Upper GI bleed Alcoholic Cirrhosis Urinary tract infection .
SECONDARY Hypothyroidism Seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You underwent a repeat endoscopy which showed ulcerations in the area of your recent bands that is likely the source of your bleeding.
The following medications were changed during this admission: INCREASE lactulose to 30mg three times a day to help decrease confusion START rifaximin 550mg twice daily to help decrease confusion START sucralafate 1g four times a day for the next seven days to help decrease the amount of bleeding in your esophagus .
