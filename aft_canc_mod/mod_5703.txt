ESRD on HEMODIALYSIS/ CLOTTED FISTULA Unable to be unclotted, was converted to a graft.
The patient complained of nausea after dialysis on [**12-27**] and vomited twice however his symptoms improved after anti-emetics.
HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA IgG of 307 (normal= [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25219**]), likely secondary to rituximab treatment and CLL, put Mr [**Known lastname **] at risk of infection.
Past notes suggested reluctance to use IVIG because of concerns about heart failure; however, it might be possible to use IVIG in conjunction with dialysis in order to remove fluid and replace it rather than adding to total volume.

(--> baseline)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you missed a dialysis session because of clotted fistula.
You were emergently dialysed for high potassium in your body.
The clot in the fistula could not be removed so the surgeons converted it to a graft.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection.
If you experience worsening pain, redness and heat at the surgical sites (arm and neck), or if you have fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pain on urination, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency room.
