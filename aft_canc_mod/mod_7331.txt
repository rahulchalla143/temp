He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with fever to 101.7, confusion, weakness, and hypotension (SBP=70-90).
Last hospitalization was notable for ORIF of R hip fracture, and RLL PNA thought to be post-obstructive.
He was treated initially with vanco/levo and discharged on a levofloxacin course set to terminate on [**5-20**] for a total 2 week course.
Bronchoscopy revealed RML bronchus narrowing and edema said to be concerning for recurrence of malignancy--PET scan had been recommended at d/c prior to scheduled follow-up with IP.
TTE/TEE done to r/o vegetations--ultimately recurrent fevers attributed to possible recurrence of CA.
Pt noted to have large "green" guiaiac negative BM in ED, given vancomycin, levaquin, flagyl.
Also received 100mg of hydrocortisone for hx of adrenal insufficiency (on prednisone 5mg daily).
States that he has had intermittent diahrrea for weeks, but more so over last few days.
Denies being confused at rehab, but states that he has noticed increased diffuse weakness.
Has had productive [**Hospital Unit Name **] without SOB since recent discharge.

Hypotension resolved quickly with IVF, diahrrea concerning for c diff given recent hospitalization and Abx exposure; fevers/leukocytosis concerning for pneumonia with failure of levaquin despite improvement in appearance of CXR.
# Fevers/ Leukocytosis: Current WBC much higher than it had been on previous admission for HAP and fracture when it peaked at 11.
Although pt was persistently febrile during last hosp despite Abx with negative cultures, he has not had this degree of leukocytosis before.
CDIFF assay not sent by [**Name (NI) **], pt has not had stool since arrival to the floor.
She is receiving empiric vanc/cefepime for possible HAP refractory to levofloxacin.
# Hypotension: Transient in ED and quickly responsive to 1L NS with concurrent improvement in creatinine imply that pt was volume depleted.
[**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to GI losses from diahrrea Not concerned for septic physiology at this time given quick and sustained response to fluids.
Given stress dose of hydrocort in ED but blood pressure normalized quickly and home dose of prednisone 5 mg daily restarted.
# Resolving RLL opacity: Radiographically c/w improvement in atelectasis/consolidation, but in light of fevers/leukocytosis and persistent productive [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] treat as failure of levaquin as above.
Bronch from last hosp implicated possbile recurrence of lung CA and outpt PET had been planned.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: As above most c/w a pre-renal state and diahrrea would be a logical etiology for volume depletion.
He needs to have an oncologist.
Pt does have melanoma and should have head CT to eval for mets.
Pt with tenderness (as expected) over surgical site.
# Trop elevation:  seems to be chronically elevated in this pt although degree of CRI fairly unimpressive.
Given risk factors, pt may have CAD (although dx not confirmed).
No need for furhter trend as already trending down.
