NOTE:  THIS PATIENT CANNOT BE INTUBATED FROM ABOVE DUE TO HEAVY TUMOR BURDEN.
History of Present Illness: This is a 51-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for laryngeal cancer s/p radiation and chemotherapy, COPD, hypertension, narcotic dependence, now ventilator dependent with a tracheostomy tube, transferred from [**Hospital **] rehab for difficult suctioning and worsening respiratory distress.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was first diagnosed with laryngeal cancer about 2.5 months ago, and has had a complicated medical course since that time; he was initially treated with Taxotere, cisplatin, and infusional 5-FU but missed multiple treatments due to hospitalizations and infections.
During the afternoon on day of admission, patient was having increasing respiratory distress at [**Hospital **] rehab.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was anxious with increased work-of-breathing.
Patient had immediate improvement in symptoms and was transferred back to MICU without incident.
Patient is unable to provide detailed history due anxiety and subsequent sedation after procedure.
According to his sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], he has had a very rough couple of months, in-and-out of the hospital with multiple infections and complications.
Past Medical History: --Sqaumous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx well-moderately differentiated, s/p chemo and radiation --COPD --Hypertension --Chronic low back pain --Enterobacter + sputum cultures from [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital in [**11-29**] --Pseudomonal growth in tracheal aspirate (sensitive to impipenem by report)  Social History: Long history of smoking.

of laryngeal cancer s/p chemo and radiation, now vent dependent, presents from [**Hospital1 **] for respiratory distress and difficulty suctioning trach.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  Most immediate etiology of respiratory distress is mal-placement of trach tube.
There was also extensive tumor invasion of the upper airway, superior to the trach tube.
Patient was transitioned to PSV the following morning without complication.
****Key is that he cannot have this trach changed because his airway is so tenuous that any trach change would cause imminent airway collapse.
Any trach change would lead to imminent airway collapse****  # ELEVATED WBC:  Patient presented with leukocytosis and left shift.
Although there has been concern for pseudomonas and enterobacter pneumonia in the past, it appears (from previous notes) that these organisms were thought to be contaminants.
Patient was treated briefly with imipenem, but was not transferred here on any antibiotics for these organisms.
Patient's leukocytosis may just be in the setting of multiple tracheal manipulations as well as high tumor burden.
He is afebrile currently and has no other labs to suggest sepsis (lactate is 0.6).
Patient was given one dose of zosyn on arrival to the MICU, but we did not give him any further antibiotics.
He remained stable, afebrile and without any  # C DIFF:  Continued PO vancomycin.
# ANXIETY/DEPRESSION:  According to [**Hospital1 **] notes and patient's sister, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been anxious as of late.
Patient's chronic pain remained at baseline and was well controlled.
# HYPERCALCEMIA:  Likely in setting of malignancy.

You were admitted to the hospital after you developed difficulty breathing.
Your breathing tube was noted to be compressed against your trachea (wind pipe), and this was the reason you had difficulty breathing.
It is very important that any future movements or changes in your trach tube should be done in the operating room.
