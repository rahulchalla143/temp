The gallbladder is distended and contains a large volume of sludge.
There are no obstructing calculi identified.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube remains in place within a decompressed gallbladder without evidence of adjacent fluid collection.
Right pleural effusion.
Ascending and transverse colon wall thickening with adjacent stranding is compatible with colitis which may be infectious, inflammatory, or less likely ischemic given distribution.
Colonoscopy is recommended to exclude underlying malignancy after resolution of acute process.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
11-mm nodular focus at the left lung base may represent atelectasis but consider followup.

CHEST IMAGING: ============== CT CHEST W/OUT CONTRAST [**2128-6-9**]: 2 cm Medial right upper lobe subpleural opacity could represent a consolidation from an infection, but exclusion of malignancy is necessary.
Several pulmonary nodules measuring up to 12 mm, some with spiculations, have characteristics concerning for metastases.
Right upper lobe pneumonia, progressed from [**2128-6-9**].
Multiple pulmonary nodules as described on CT of [**2128-6-9**].
Coronary artery disease.
Right apical consolidation and two left upper lobe nodules have not changed since the most recent scan, but right lower lobe nodules have improved.
Overall appearance is most consistent with an acute infectious process, either fungal (e.g.
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia may also have a similar imaigng appearance.
Coronary artery calcifications  CT CHEST [**7-1**]: 1.
Focal right upper lobe consolidation is slightly smaller in size and several pulmonary nodules have resolved, consistent with an improving infectious process.
New pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions of unclear etiology, as well as interval enlargement in several mediastinal lymph nodes may be related to the patient's history of malignancy or the subsequent treatment.
Small pericardial effusion is unchanged and small bilateral pleural effusions are decreased.
Increasing large right pleural effusion, persistent right upper lobe consolidation.
Enlarging and new left lower lobe nodular consolidations.
No specific pathogen is suggested but a right-sided thoracentesis may be considered for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
No abnormal enhancement seen.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
Small vessel white matter ischemic changes.
No evidence of abscess.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
TTE ([**2128-8-24**]) - The atria are mildly dilated.
An adjacent mobile structure might represent Eustachian valve but a vegetation or small thrombus cannot be excluded.
Abnormal lymphoid cells comprise 10% of total analyzed events.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells in the CD45 moderate/dim , moderate side scatter "blast" gate express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD13, CD15, CD117, CD11c, TdT (dim, subset), lymphoid associated antigens CD2 (dim, subset), CD7 (dim) lack other B and T cell associated antigens are CD10 negative, and are negative for CD14, CD41, CD56, CD64.
INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia.
DIAGNOSIS: ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
Red blood cells are markedly reduced in number, variably hypochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including occasional dacrocytes and elliptocytes seen.
The white blood cell count appears increased and consists almost entirely of variably-sized blasts with scant light blue cytoplasm and nuclei with moderately coarse chromatin, scalloped borders and distinctive nucleoli.
A minor subset of large cells with more abundant cytoplasm is present.
The remaining cellularity shows mild dyspoiesis in erythroid precursors along with scattered myeloid precursors.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: It consists of a 0.7 cm core biopsy of periosteum, cortical bone and trabecular marrow with a cellularity of 70-80%.
The blasts are moderate in size with scant amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm and oval to irregularly-shaped nuclei with vesicular chromatin and small, yet distinctive nucleoli.
This result is consistent with myeloid disease, specifically the pathologic diagnosis of AML.
Trisomy 14 is not associated with a particular cytogenetic prognosis.
Small clonal populations and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
Bone marrow biopsy [**2128-4-8**]: PERSISTENT INVOLVEMENT WITH ACUTE MYELOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA.
Red blood cells are hypochromic and normocytic with anisopoikilocytosis including elliptocytes, rare dacrocytes and target cells.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD13, CD15, CD117, lymphoid associated antigens CD2 (subset) (partial dim).
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by persistent acute myeloid leukemia.
[**2128-5-7**] BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY: HYPOCELLULAR MARROW WITH RESIDUAL BLASTS AND SCANT ERYTHROPOIESIS (SEE NOTE) Note: The marrow aspirate and core biopsy reveals residual blasts (~40-50%).
In a patient with chemo-ablation, these residual blasts may indicate residual leukemic blasts, some undergoing chemotherapy induced cell death.
Residual hematopoiesis is scant and is mostly within erythroid cells.
While highly consistent with residual / recurrent / refractory disease, the clinical course is best assessed by following peripheral blood counts and cytogenetics in conjunction with clinical correlation.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation and shows pancytopenia.
Red blood cells are decreased in number, with minimal anisocytosis and mild poikilocytosis.
Rare cells with blast morphology seen, but cannot be definitely categorized.
The majority of cells in this smear are located at the edges and are abnormal blasts, some with degenerative changes.
They are large cells with irregular nuclei, some of which is smudged, and some with a prominent nucleoli.
Scattered histiocytes with intracytoplasmic cellular debris seen.
The myeloid elements are mostly blasts, and are seen in large aggregates, some with degenerative changes.
Plasma cells, stromal cells and histiocytes are also seen within the interstitium.
This finding is consistent with the persistent disease.
Small clonal populations and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
THE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A CHEMOABLATED MARROW.
Red blood cells are decreased in number and normocytic with minimal anisopoikilocytosis including rare spherocytes, dacrocytes and elliptocytes.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased and is composed exclusively of lymphocytes.
Differential shows 100% lymphocytes  BM Biopsy [**2128-6-9**]: MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH DYSPLASTIC HEMATOPOIESIS AND INCREASED BLASTS, SEE NOTE.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material shows numerous markedly hypocellular spicules consisting of stromal cells, histiocytes, and plasma cells.
Myeloid precursors are decreased with abnormal nuclear lobation.
Note: The findings are consistent with a hypoplastic marrow after multiple rounds of induction chemotherapy.
BM Biopsy [**2128-6-29**] DIAGNOSIS:  Hypocellular marrow with decreased trilineage hematopoiesis.
Note:  No evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia is seen.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: Red blood cells are normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including macrocytes, elliptocytes and spherocytes seen.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is inadequate for evaluation due to aspicular aspirate and hemodilution.
Neutrophils with disjointed nuclear robes, abnormal nuclear lobation and hypogranular forms are seen.
A 100 cell differential shows: 3% Blasts,  2% Promyelocytes, 3% Myelocytes, 5% Metamyelocytes, 35% Bands/Neutrophils, 0% Plasma cells,  37% Lymphocytes, 0% Erythroid, 5% monocytes and 10% atypical lymphocytes.
It consists of a 1.6 cm core of periosteum, cortical bone, trabecular marrow with a cellularity of [**5-13**]%.
Rare clusters of erythropoietic colonies are seen comprising of less than 5% of the marrow.
Hemosiderin-laden macrophages and pockets of scattered plasma cell and stromal cells are seen.
[**2128-6-24**] PATHOLOGY REPORT: Investigation of transfusion reaction: Mr. [**Known lastname 74075**] experienced rigors, chills and hives during his pRBC transfusion on [**2128-6-24**].
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of hemolysis, as his plasma remained yellow and clear and testing demonstrated a negative DAT.
The chills/rigors are consistent with an afebrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction.
Additionally the patient experienced an urticarial reaction likely secondary to soluble substances in the plasma of the product.
BM Cytogenetics ([**2128-6-29**]): DIAGNOSIS:  Hypocellular marrow with decreased trilineage hematopoiesis.
Note:  No evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia is seen.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is  for evaluation adequate for evaluation.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is inadequate for evaluation due to aspicular aspirate and hemodilution.

Rare clusters of erythropoietic colonies are seen comprising of less than 5% of the marrow.
Hemosiderin-laden macrophages and pockets of scattered plasma cell and stromal cells are seen.
A limited panel is performed to determine look for residual disease.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotyping findings consistent with involvement by: No evidence of increased blasts.
Microbiology ================ [**2128-9-15**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2128-9-10**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Injection of contrast through this tube demonstrates free contrast bathing the intraperitoneal cavity and draining along the right paracolic gutter to become contiguous with a pelvic fluid collection.The amount of fluid present has not changed significantly pover the CT dated [**2128-10-10**].
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
Widespread airspace consolidations are compatible with pneumonia, potentially fungal or bacterial in etiology, or aspiration.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Diffuse anasarca.
Colonic intramural fat is similar to prior and may represent chronic colitis but this finding can also be observed as a normal finding-epsecially in patients with intrabdominal fat   Brief Hospital Course: = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================                       PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ [**3-25**]: Admitted with 1-2 months of progressive fatigue, found to have acute leukemia - WBC 68k (96% blasts), hct 10%, plt 85k.

[**7-30**]: Double cord hematopoetic stem cell transplant.
[**8-6**]: Develops febrile neutropenia.
Transferred to MICU for agitation, altered mental status, increased nursing requirement.
[**8-14**]: PICC placed [**8-15**]: EEG for altered mental status, dysarthria - generalized periodic epileptic wave forms.
Started keppra 250mg IV q12h [**8-17**]: Transferred back to BMT for clinical improvement.

Given persistence of disease based on bone marrow biopsy on [**2128-4-8**], he completed 5+2 regimen.
Repeat biopsy still showed residual biopsy.
Pt remained persistently neutropenic.
The bone marrow remained acellular on repeat BMBx on [**2128-6-29**] with no leukemic cells.
#) COLITIS:  IV flagyl was initiated on [**4-4**] and CT abdomen showed colitis on [**2128-4-6**].
Lower Abd tender but soft and better than prior (diffuse tenderness) and improving.
While he did complain of "occasional" abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, he also felt a lack of motivation and "decreased taste" for food.
Consulted psychiatry on [**6-11**], who recommended starting mirtazapine qhs for appetite and sleep, which was started but then discontinued on [**6-13**] given concern for increased somnolence.
Flagyl and megace eventually discontinued, but meropenem continued in setting of persistent neutropenia.
#) FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA: Patient had low grade temperature on admission, and continued to have temperatures in 99-100s.
He was initially started on Cefepime ([**2128-3-25**]) for febrile neutropenia (WBC was high, but had 0% neutrophils) without improvement in his fever curve.
FEVER CLUSTER #1 - Vancomycin was added on [**2128-3-26**] for continued low grade temperature.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent with no growth.
FEVER CLUSTER #2 - Vancomycin was added on [**6-8**] and fungal coverage was broadened to Ambisome on [**6-9**] given subpleural based opacity and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Daptomycin converted to vancomycin for increased lung penetration.
Vancomycin was DC'd on [**6-25**] as pt was persistently afebrile and acyclovir was DC'd on [**6-29**] for the same reason.
Ambisome was DC'd on [**7-2**] when repeat chest CT showed improvement of nodules.
FEVER CLUSTER #3 - Spiked fever again on [**8-9**] and ultimately grew VRE from blood and biliary source.
Comparison of Chest CTs from [**8-20**] and [**8-26**] showed interval worsening of multifocal pneumonia and right side pleural effusion.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**8-31**] showed no valvular abnormalities suggestive of endocarditis, EF >55%.
Repeat Chest CT [**2128-9-5**] showed little interval change.
Etiology was likely multifactorial including dehydration from discontinuation of TPN/poor po intake and multiple nephrotoxic medications (vancomycin, ambisome and acyclovir).
[**Last Name (un) **] #2: Creatinine increasing around [**8-18**] after VRE grew from blood likely sepsis related with peak at 2.0.
Thought to be due to bone marrow suppression from leukemia, as patient did not have elevated bilirubin or other laboratory findings to suggest hemolysis.
There was concern for autoantibodies to platelets but PRA testing was negative.
#) ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS: Diagnosed with acute cholecystits on HIDA after gallbladder U/S read as intermediate.
No obstructing stone was found.
As pt improved clinically with minimal RUQ and able to tolerate PO intake, decision made to forego surgical interventio in setting of pancytopenia.
#) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient transferred to MICU on [**8-20**] due to altered mental status in setting of initiating granulocyte infusion, supratherapeutic tacrolimus level to 12, and difficulty caring for patient on the floor.
Mental status was thought to be secondary to toxic / metabolic in setting of previously untreated VRE sepsis as well as contributing hepatic encelopathy [**2-5**] shock liver, potential obstruction.
Neurology was consulted because of dysarthria and weakness on exam.
Weakness was thought to be proximal, likely due to myopathy.
Consideration was also paid to potential role of tacrolimus, levels of which were significantly elevated during [**Last Name (un) **].
A repeat MRI head was done on [**9-1**] which showed small vessel disease, but no acute process.
An incidental finding of asymmetric mastoid air cell enhancement raised the question of supperative mastoiditis.
No bony erosion was evident and therefore no ENT intervention needed.
Improvement in mental status was noted with the the onset of less frequent fevers and decreased morphine basal dose on PCA.
In [**Month (only) 216**], had severe biliary sepsis (not choly candidate, so perc tube placed).
Since [**Month (only) **], had course c/b fungal pna, CMV viremia, mental status changes (thought to be due to PRES [**2-5**] cyclosporine).
Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] ([**9-10**] - [**9-17**]) for respiratory failure and hypotension.
Readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**10-11**] - [**10-17**] for biliary sepsis/peritonitis and hypoxic respiratory distress post ERCP stent placement procedure on [**10-11**].
Interdisciplinary meeting held with BMT, ICU, ID, ERCP, IR, Surgery, and SW on [**10-15**] to discuss management of biliary sepsis as patient was deteriorating.
His mental status was worsening, Tbilis trending up, increasing abdominal pain and distention, worsening sepsis despite broad coverage antibiotics and antifungals.
Paracentesis showed that fluid in the abdomen was bile   and the tube interrogation demonstrated that bile was leaking into the peritoneum  and that the perc tube was displaced and terminating anterior to the liver.
On [**10-17**] 0000, patient had fever and became hypotensive in the 77-80s requiring three different pressors (vasopressin, phenylephrine, and NE) at maxed doses.
Labs showed increasing lactic acid with severe metabolic acidosis.
He was given 150 of bicarb in hopes that pressors effectiveness would improve.
# Hypotension/Sepsis: Initially transferred to ICU for likely septic shock.
Pt spiked a fever to 102F on [**2128-9-10**] and no fevers since.
Pt had suspicion of multifocal pneumonia with unclear pathogen but Pt has been on broad abx coverage.
Pt previously had acute cholecystitis with VSE and also VRE bacteremia of unclear source in early [**Name (NI) 216**].
Echo did not show evidence of endocarditis on [**8-31**].
He had an MRI brain on [**9-1**] that did not show any evidence of acute infection.
He has not had an LP due to severe thrombocytopenia.
He does not have any diarrhea or leukocytosis, and his C diff stool PCR was negative on [**2128-9-7**], but he seems to have significant abdominal pain.
CT [**9-11**] showed no intrabdominal abscess but mild edema of the colon c/w volume overload vs colitis/typhilitis and stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Despite his large pleural effusions, thrombocytopenia has made prior teams hesitant to pursue thoracentesis.
PE remains a possibility but LENIs negative.
Another explanation for his hypotension may be adrenal insufficiency given random cortisol of 8.6 which is inappropriately low given current severe illness.
His mental status improved with continued treatment and given his prior RUQ pain, suspect biliary souce w/ possible biliary sepsis.
Patient also had worsening abdominal pain and distention.
# Acute respiratory failure: Pt extubated successfully on [**9-15**].
Pt suffered acute respiratory distress.
Unclear etiology, but likely due to sepsis and was very broadly covered with abx as above.
CT scan shows stable to slightly increased bilateral pleural effusions and interval increase of parenchymal atelectasis vs consolidation at bases, no evidence of empyema.
Thoracentesis contraindicated given bleeding risk with thrombocytopenia.
When patient returned to the ICU on [**10-11**] post ERCP, he was kept intubated due to tachypnea and tachycardic pre-procedure.
Hypoxic respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to sepsis.
He was continued to be broadly covered for possible pneumonia with micafungin, bactrim ppx, dapto, and [**Last Name (un) 2830**].
There is also contribution from pain and distended abdomen pressing on lungs and causing respiratory distress.
His pain was treated with dilaudid.
Thought to be multifactorial including ATN/prerenal secondary to sepsis and AIN secondary to CMV and/or meds (foscarnet).
Renal was consulted and thought it was likely due to ischemic renal insult without frank ATN.
Initially, patient had intermittent RUQ pain but CT abd/pelvis and RUQ u/s showed no biliary dilation or other acute intraabdominal pathology likely responsible for pain.
A HIDA scan on [**10-11**] showed CBD obstruction and patient sent for ERCP and placement of stent.
#AML: Pt is s/p double cord allo transplant with evidence of engraftment.
Cyclosporine has been adjusted multiple times for elevated levels (goal 200).
Result showed that patient had 70% xx and 30% xy suggestive of possible recurrence of AML.
# CMV Viremia: CMV viral load 31,000 <-- 11,500 ([**9-29**]) <-- 10,900 ([**9-27**]) <-- 8,100 ([**9-23**]) <-- 2,640 ([**9-20**]).
EEG on [**9-4**] with no seizure activity.
Per BMT team, thought secondary to tacrolimus and switched to cyclosporine.
BMT team also states that patient's mental status has significantly improved and is now alert and oriented x3, able to carry conversation.
# Metabolic acidosis: initially he had a non-anion gap acidosis with hyperchloremia, likely due to free water depletion and concomitant hypovolemia.
Rechecked cortisol was 12.5  ISSUES ONLY PERTAINING TO [**9-10**] - [**9-17**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission  #Skin ulceration: Pt noted to have ulceration on L forearm with surrounding erythema.
No bleeding or exudate.
MRI brain on [**9-1**] showed no acute process.
Pt was seen by neurology, who recent signed off and felt delirium was the most likely explanation.
Mental status has greatly improved therefore we will not pursue LP at this time given bleeding risk with thrombocytopenia, although ID recommends further workup rather than keeping on high dose acyclovir due to fear of inducing renal failure given Pt is also on ambisome and cyclosporine.
Suspect component of delirium given rapid waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
Doubt HSV encephalitis given rapid changes in condition.
# Volume status: Net positive 13 L since admission.
Right pleural effusion appears slightly larger.
Want to move more toward net even given recent respiratory failure.
- Trend H/H [**Hospital1 **], goal >21 -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate -f/u w/ GI regarding duration of PPI and carafate  # elevated alkaline phosphatase:  unclear etiology, but peaked at 900 on [**2128-9-5**].
