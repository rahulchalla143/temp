Admission Date:  [**2189-7-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2151-5-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  GYN/ONC  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 38-year-old gravida 2, para 2 presenting with a new diagnosis of cervical cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient underwent a routine PAP smear which revealed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and subsequently underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure on [**2189-6-1**].
High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion revealed gland involvement present at the ectocervical and endocervical margins.
There was also invasive adenocarcinoma with depth of invasion of 7 mm.
There was also adenocarcinoma in situ.
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy for stage IA2 adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
Please see Operative Report for more details of that particular surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history significant for mother with breast cancer at the age of 55, and a father and sister with melanoma.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Postoperatively, the patient was doing well without complaints.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
The incision was clean, dry, and intact without rebound or guarding.
Genitourinary revealed no vaginal bleeding.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, nontender.
GYNECOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have adenocarcinoma grade II at 1.7 mm at greatest depth of invasion.
No lymphvascular invasion was seen.
No in situ carcinoma or dysplasia.
No malignancy was identified in lymph nodes.
The patient had minimal ambulation on the first day secondary to discomfort.
There was high concern for a possible deep venous thrombosis at this time.
This was done as the patient was requiring oxygen as previously mentioned, and the x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis with patchy air space consolidation.
There was no evidence of congestive heart failure, and there was free air under the diaphragm; presumably post surgical.
On postoperative day four, secondary to the patient's oxygen requirements and inability to wean off of supplemental oxygen, and an arterial blood gas that was 7.48/38/42/32/6, there was great concern that rather than this being venous that the patient might in fact be in respiratory compromise.
A CT angiogram was done, and the patient was noted to have pulmonary emboli in the right lobe and segmental branches to the right lower lobe, and a suggestion of thrombus in the left lower lobe vessels.
There was evidence of segmental atelectasis in both lung bases.
On [**2189-7-20**], the patient was noted to have a distended abdomen, and her complaints of abdominal pain had escalated overnight.
The patient was assessed to have an abdominal bleed, and an immediate transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells was started.
However, on serial abdominal examinations it was noted that the patient's wound had cellulitis and that her incision was beginning to open up.
Prior to this, the patient had an inferior vena cava filter placed (please see Interventional Radiology note for said procedure).
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was rather uncomfortable for the patient as she continued to have nausea and emesis.
Suppositories did in fact help with the patient's nausea and vomiting toward the end of her course.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On [**2189-7-22**], the patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection positive for gram-negative rods after the patient had a temperature spike.
Electrolytes were checked on a regular basis for nutritional evaluation.
Status post radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymphadenectomy; complicated by pulmonary embolus and hemoperitoneum.
