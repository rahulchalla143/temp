Admission Date:  [**2109-6-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-6-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypoxemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of tachy-brady syndrome, mitral regurgitation, and CML, presents with 4-5 days of worsening SOB, wt gain, and LE edema.
He went to his PCP's office today for evaluation and was found to be in rapid afib with HR in the 120s-130s.
His PCP did an EKG which confirmed rapid afib, frequent ectopy, and new ST depressions.
He was felt to have crackles on exam and was given 20mg PO lasix.
He received a total of 30mg IV diltiazem which eventually brought his HR down to the 90s, but it caused transient hypotension as well, with SBP in the 80s.
CXR was performed which revealed slightly worsening pulmonary edema and loss of the R heart border, concerning for fluid vs. consolidation.
Repeat CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema, but no frank infiltrate.
His mental status did improve somewhat and he was able to converse with me to confirm his symptoms, but he remained tachypneic with a RR in the 30s.
He was mentating well and had no complaints.
Given his BL BP is around 100/60 we opted to give another dose of lopressor 5 mg IV.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted in late [**Month (only) 958**] to early [**Month (only) 547**] for chest pressure.
He continued to have arrythmyia c/w his tachy-brady syndrome.
His TSH was slighlty elevated but there was concern over med complicane so his prior dose was resumed.
Prior to this, in mid [**Month (only) 958**], the patient was admitted for syncope and hypoxia and required a MICU stay, but no intubation.
He had a holter in [**Month (only) 958**] that showed asymptomatic ectopic atrial beats and 25 isolated VPBs with 6 couplets and two 3-beat runs of VT, rate 110 BPM.
Past Medical History: # Mitral regurgitation (1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**4-10**]) # Tachy-brady syndrome # h/o C. Diff # RLE ulcer # Chronic diarrhea # Hypothyroidism # CML (t9;22) - intolerant of Gleevec (secondary to itch) - being treated with hydrea   Social History: Lives at home with his partner.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Elevated JVP CV: irregular, +systolic murmur, no rubs/gallops.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: 2+ edema to mid lower leg, with venous stasis changes.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a pmh of tachy-brady syndrome, mild mitral regurgitation, and CML, who presented with 5 days of SOB and was found to be in afib with RVR and CHF and borderline BPs.
the patient was intubated and cardioverted for his atrial fibrillation.
After extubation, Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] became porgressively short of breath.
2) Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] had a h/o tachy-brady and possible atrial tachycardia versus flutter in old notes.
During this stay he did not tolerate the A.fib with RVR and became hypoxic due to a CHF exacerbation.
In the CCU the patient was intubated for respiratory distress and was loaded amiodarone and with cardioverted to a NSR with frequent ectopy.
3) Congestive heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] had diastolic dysfunction and CHF which was probably the result of overall poor cardiac function and his history of tachy-brady and his atrial fibrillation.
He became progressively short of breath.
Medications on Admission: hydrea 2000mg PO QD ASA 81mg PO QD levothyroxine 88mcg PO QD   Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: congestive heart failure atrial fibrillation tachy-brady syndrome hypothyroidism Chronic myelogenous leukemia   Discharge Condition: expired   Discharge Instructions: pt.
was admitted to the CCU for respiratory distress and CHF secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
