Patient initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2120-5-3**] with fever and cough of one day duration.
He was also complaining of shortness of breath and home O2 sats were measured in the high 80s.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], he was treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with IV avelox and vancomycin.
During that hospitalization he also complained that his urine was warm.
Patient was diagnosed with carcinoid tumor of right lung in [**Month (only) **]/[**2119-12-5**] and has been followed with observation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31573**] at [**Hospital1 1474**].
He has had tumor involvement of his right middle lobe bronchus (initially presenting with hemoptysis) and has undergone debulking of the tumor.
He has had an Octreotid scan indicating involvment in the right hilum and masses and consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobe consistent with metastatic disease.
Current chest CT indicates disease progression with a larger hilar mass, new mediastinal node disease, and tumor almost filling the right mainstem bronchus, however, CT and CXR document aeration of right lung indicating that tumor is not completely obstructing.
He complains of shortness of breath and cough.
He has also had a few episodes of post-tussive emesis.

Chest radiograph again shows a somewhat ovoid tubular opacity within the right middle lobe extending to the right hilum which on CT scan appears to correspond to a fluid and/or debris filled distal mainstem and right middle lobe bronchi likely representing superimposed infectious process and/or mucoid impactin in associated bronchiectatic right middle lobe bronchi.
There is no acute congestive failure.
An underlying endobronchial leion with distal obstruction could not be completely excluded.
New pretracheal adenopathy.
New 5 mm left lower lobe nodular density.
Persistent tubular opacities in right middle lobe which may represent fluid filled bronchi.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Secondary to pts bleeding mainstem bronchus tumor following bronch procedure on top of baseline COPD with sats on RA at home ranging only 88-92.
Throughout pts course in the ICU he had persistent white out of the right lung.
The patient was unable to wean the vent while ventilating only the left lung, most likely [**2-6**] underlying severe COPD.
The patient also developed left lung infiltrates, thought to be secondary to spillage from the right lung.
Two repeat bronchoscopies were attempted, both times clot and secretions overflowed from the right when the ET tube was pulled back and it was thought to be unsafe to attempt washout or aspiration for fear of causing significant cross contamination of the good lung.
# Sepsis: Thought secondary to patient post-obstructive pneumonia that developed behind the right-sided endobronchial carcinoid tumor.
The pt was persistently febrile for the first several days of admission and covered with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Pts blood pressures remained low and pt intermittently required pressors, complicated by intermittent AF with RVR.
# Atypical Carcinoid Tumor: With new lad concerning for spread.
Palliative chemo and radiation were offered as options only if patient was able to wean off the vent.
On [**5-18**], the patient developed worsening refractory hypoxia despite maximal ventilator settings as well as hypotension on maximal single pressors.
