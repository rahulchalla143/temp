She initially presented to St. [**Hospital 11042**] hospital for evaluation and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a head CT showed a mass in the right side of her brain.
She says she has occasionally been somewhat emotional in the past but has never been treated for depression before.
Her symptoms continued despite medication and she also began to experience extreme fatigue along with headaches around her right eye and some nasal congestion.
She initially attributed this to sinus problems which she has had in the past.
In addition she reports some difficulty walking over the last few days, saying that it feels like her feet are sticking to the floor, particularly on the left side.
Has had a few falls recently but no head trauma.
Co-workers remarked that her facial droop and dysarthria seemed worse and encouraged her to go to the hospital for evaluation.

Physical Exam: At discharge: Right Pupil Sluggishly reactive 4.5 to 4mm, left pupil brisk Left Gaze preference, eyes open minimally to noxious stimuli Localizes briskly to noxious stimuli in the right upper extremity Antigravity withdrawal of left lower extremity to noxious Minimal movement of left upper and lower extremities to noxious Upgoing left toe  Pertinent Results: [**2193-7-24**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] appearance of right frontoparietal mass with skin markers  now in place for planning purposes  [**2193-7-24**] CT head -Post surgical changes from right fronto-parietal craniotomy for biopsy and debulking of right parietal mass.
-Stable minimal subfalcine herniation - 6 mm leftward shift of usually midline structures.
No transtentorial herniation.
-No new hemorrhage or acute large territorial infarction.
Significant mass effect due to large hypodensity in the right frontal region, representing extensive acute infarction in the RIGHT MCA territory, particularly its superior division, more than simply post-surgical edema.
Marked subfalcine herniation with leftward shift of normally midline structures by 15 mm compared to 6 mm 3.
Early right uncal with no downward transtentorial herniation.
Significant hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct.
She was AOx3 with left UE plegia, left lower extremity had minimal withdrawal to noxious stimuli.
A Stat Head CT was performed which was consistent with marked edema and midline shift of approximately 1.6 cm which was new since the last post operative imaging performed on [**2193-7-24**].
Due to the patient poor prognosis in the setting of a large right-sided MCA infarct and secondary to the right-sided lesion concerning for an intrinsic neoplasm and the patients imaging and poor neurological exam the decision was made to make the patient Care and Comfort Measures only.
