# BRBPR- The patient has a history of diverticular bleeding in [**2121**].
A tagged red cell scan was performed, which showed active bleeding.
IR took the patient for possible embolization but did not see any active bleeding so no intervention was performed.
GI was consulted and performed a colonoscopy which did not show any active areas of hemorrhage, but did show multiple polyps, diverticulosis, and possible ischemic colitis.
# A. fib - The patient's home medication verapamil was stopped out of concern for GI bleeding and hypotension; metoprolol 50 mg TID was continued.
On [**8-31**], the patient had an episode of Atrial fibrillation with RVR and required 10 mg IV Diltiazem pushed.
# HTN- Anti-hypertensives were intially held but were restarted during the patient's admission.
# Recurrent UTIs - The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs associated with his chronic in-dwelling foley catheter, which he has had for 5-7 years.
The patient was intially started on antibiotics at the OSH for his UTI but these were stopped because the patient was asymptomatic and there is concern for propagating resistant infections.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] at [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Lower GI bleed Diverticulosis, Colon Polyps, possible ischemic colitis Atrial Fibrillation w/ rapid ventricular response  Secondary: HTN HL Afib Type II DM seronegative inflammatory arthritis h/o diastolic heart failure obesity BPH h/o recurrent UTIs   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were diagnosed with a lower Gastrointestinal bleed, for which you were intially treated at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**] before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
You had a tagged red cell scan at [**Hospital3 417**], which indicated active bleeding and since it was felt that surgery was not in your best interest, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Here, our radiologists did a study and did not see evidence of active bleeding.
Because you did continue to have lower GI bleeding w/ clots, our gastroenterology team was consulted; they performed a colonoscopy, which showed evidence of diverticulosis, multiple small colon polyps, and possible evidence of ischemic colitis.
On [**8-31**], you had a very fast heart rate due to your atrial fibrillation.
You were placed back on your home medication verapamil and also received IV medication to help slow your heart rate.
We made the following changes to your medications: We STOPPED coumadin due to your GI bleeding; further guidance regarding this medication is discussed below We STOPPED Plaquenil as it was not clear whether you had an indication for this treatment and did not think you were taking this at home We CHANGED your Lasix from 80 mg once per day to 40 mg once per day; you should weigh yourself daily and if your weight increases more than 3 lbs over 2 days, you may need to increase this dose back to 80 mg once per day We CHANGED your Lantus dose from 16 U in the morning and 19U in the evening to 10 U in the evening- in addition to sliding scale insulin; depending on your blood sugar checks, your Lantus dose may need to be increased We continued your Aspirin 81 mg each day, Ativan 0.5 mg each night as needed for sleep, Verapamil 180 mg SR each morning, Simvastatin 80 mg each day and Metoprolol 50 mg three times per day We STOPPED your Novolog .
