She was in remission until this month when she had a restaging CT scan because of an elevated creatinine.
She was found to have a large right pelvic sidewall mass obstructing her ureter and multiple enlarged lymph nodes.
Biopsy showed recurrence of her grade 3b follicular cell lymphoma.
She has since been found to have a rising LDH and hypercalcemia, and decided with her local oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 20676**] [**Name (STitle) 31966**], to enter into a study protocol #DF 09-111, "Safety and Efficacy study of Ofatumumab in combination with ICE or DHAP Chemotherapy in Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Lymphoma Prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation."
She has recently felt well except for somewhat decreased energy and a 5lb weight loss.
She has pain when using her right shoulder from a rotator cuff tear that she chose not to repair.
She denies fever, chills or night sweats.
Despite her rhinorrhea, she denies headache, sinus tenderness or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.

Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  [**Known firstname **] was diagnosed in [**2178-11-17**] with a grade 3b follicular lymphoma after being noted to have hypercalcemia (18) and bulky lymphadenopathy.
Biopsy of a left inguinal node showed grade 3b follicular lymphoma with a MIB of 50-60%, and she was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP completing therapy in [**2179-3-18**].
PET scan was negative at the completion of chemotherapy and her most recent prior CT scan was done in [**10/2179**] and also was negative for disease relapse.
However, in early [**2180-5-17**], she underwent restaging CT done without contrast because of an elevated creatinine and she was found to have a large right pelvic sidewall mass (6.5 x 3.1 cm) causing obstruction of her ureter causing right hydronephrosis.
There was some soft tissue thickening along the posterior right lateral aspect of her bladder, a left pelvic side wall mass that was 2.8 cm, a right paraaortic lymph node that was 2.1 cm, a left paraaortic lymph node at 1.2 cm, and some left external iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy as well as some other enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.
Her LDH and calcium had been within normal limits at previous oncologist visit, and she was sent here for further evaluation and consideration of autologous stem cell transplant.
At presentation on [**2180-6-1**] she developed hypercalcemic with a calcium of 11.4 an elevated LDH.
She followed up locally with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for labs and Zometa while decided whether or not to pursue treatment at [**Hospital1 18**].
Past Medical History:  Significant for hypertension, osteopenia, and endometriosis.
She had a brother who is deceased from heart disease and a paternal cousin who is deceased from lung cancer.
Her son has no medical problems and she knows of no other cancer or blood disorder in the family.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**6-12**] for induction with Ofatumumab/ICE chemotherapy as part of a phase II study.
# Ifosphamide toxicity Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] features of ifosphamide nephrotoxicity and neurological side-effects of confusion, delerium and aphasia.
Ifosphamide toxicity was treated with methylene blue and with repletion of potassium and phosphorous (in the [**Known lastname **] of renal tubular acidosis).
# Hypertension Lisinopril and atenolol were held during the admission.
Lisinopril was held in the context of acute renal failure, which resolved over the admission.
# Acute renal insufficiency.
Resulted in holding of lisinopril, which can be re-started with due consideration of recovering renal insufficiency and need for supplementary potassium.
Renal tubular acidosis resulted from ifosphamide as above.
# Neutropenia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for scheduled chemotherapy.
During the admission you had a neurologic reaction to one of the chemotherapies (ifosphamide).
You required a medication called methylene blue and your neurologic status improved to your baseline.
