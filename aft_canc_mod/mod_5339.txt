Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-8-9**] no change.
Redemonstrated are bilateral ill-defined airspace opacities, most pronounced in the upper lobes, but stable from prior, compatible within the patient's known history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
No new areas of focal consolidation are present.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the chest with bilateral air-space opacities compatible with known diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-9-7**] 3:17 PM CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The imaged portions of the lung bases are notable for small, tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] type opacities at the left lower lobe which are improved from the previous study as well as suture material in the right middle lobe which is stable.
There is no free gas or fluid in the abdomen.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Regional vascular structures reveal scattered atherosclerotic calcifications along the aorta.
The left adrenal gland is notable for a small 15 x 13 mm nodule containing bulk fat, consistent with an adrenal myelolipoma.
There is no free gas or fluid in the pelvis.
There is specifically no evidence of retroperitoneal or other hematoma.
There is no pelvic fat or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.
No retroperitoneal or other hematoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-9-7**] 7:37 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent infarction.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler examination of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed and demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentability and respiratory variation in flow.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis involving the right or left lower extremity.
Colonoscopy [**2136-9-12**] Findings: Protruding Lesions A single 2 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the rectum.
EGD [**2136-9-12**] Findings: Esophagus:  Other Esophagus with white plaques suggestive of candidiasis Stomach:  Other Erythema of the antrum suggestive of gastritis Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Esophagus with white plaques suggestive of candidiasis Erythema of the antrum suggestive of gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Treat likely [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Esophagitis with Fluconazole   Brief Hospital Course: 51 YO M w COP, HTN, HLD, dCHF, PE on coumadin, recent elevated INR now presenting to the ED for orthostasis and malaise found to have acute anemia, elevated INR and guiac positive stool concerning for GI bleed; question of possible melena per pt.
# ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA: The patient was admitted to the medical ICU given concern for active GI bleeding in the setting of low hematocrit with inappropriate response to transfusion in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
He was hemodynamically stable without evidence of active bleeding.
He underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy under MAC in the OR which showed a polyp in the rectum (biopsy) but otherwise otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum (evaluation limited by prep).
EGD showed esophagus with white plaques suggestive of candidiasis; erythema of the antrum suggestive of gastritis but otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
Pt was prescribed fluconazole for tx of [**Female First Name (un) **] and omeprazole for GI prophylaxis given evidence of gastritis and that pt taking chronic steroids for lung disease.
# Orthostasis, hyponatremia: This was likely related to blood loss although also likely a component of dehydration given that patient had decreased PO intake for several days as well.
#PULMONARY EMBOLISM: The coumadin was held and he was given FFP and vitamin K in the setting of presumed GI bleed.
Lower extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT.
Bacitracin-Polymyxin B 500-10,000 unit/g Ointment Sig: One (1) application Topical every six (6) hours as needed for irritation.
Oxycodone 15 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 3 days.
