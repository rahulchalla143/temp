Admission Date:  [**2145-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-4-24**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NIPPV cardiac catheterization s/p stents to L subclavian and iliac  History of Present Illness: 82 yo woman with extensive vascular history (below), breast cancer in the past s/p L mastectomy in [**2128**], htn, high chol, and possible diagnosis of colon cancer treated 2 yrs ago with chemo which she self-d/c'ed, who had presented for elective angiography for lower extremity ischemia, and had developed nausea felt to be angina equivalent.
After heparin gtt, she went for cardiac cath on [**4-14**] PM and was found to have patent grafts and 3vd, though low flow to LIMA and RLE vessels, thus s/p stenting of right CIA and L subclavian.
She developed left sided weakness since then, unknown last well time.
Heparin was used prior to the cath, which was stopped at noon on [**4-15**]; she did well during the procedure, although post-procedure there was a groin hematoma and hematocrit drop requiring 2 units prbc's.
This morning, there was no neuro exam performed, but she was apparently talking, with no facial droop and normal language (?8 or 9AM).
Initial NIHSS was unscorable because the patient was able to open eyes, but did not speak at all, did not blink to threat on the left, withdrew minimally to noxious stimuli (decreased on the left upper extremity).
She was seen ten minutes later and language function was back to normal with normal naming and speech, but a dense homonomous hemianopsia, extinction to double simultaneous stimulation over the left hemibody, weakness of the left arm, NIHSS of 5.
On further questioning later with family present, "peripheral vision on the left" has been worse over the past month, though she also has cararacts.

CT BRAIN [**4-15**]:  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There are multiple large rounded lesions within the brain which are hyperdense, consistent with hemorrhagic metastases.
At least six metastatic lesions are visualized.
There is a large hemorrhagic lesion involving the right occipital lobe measuring 4.3 cm in diameter.
A larger more ill-defined lesion is noted within the right parietal lobe superiorly.
There is a moderate amount of edema surrounding the hemorrhagic metastasis, demonstrated as hypodensity of the surrounding white matter.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures at this time.
The large right occipital hemorrhagic metastasis results in mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Multiple hemorrhagic metastases within the brain.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cancer with cardiac catheterization and intracranial hemorrhage for further evaluation to rule out metastatic disease.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
FINDINGS: There are multiple areas of signal abnormalities seen within the both cerebral hemispheres.
There is irregular rim enhancement seen following the administration of gadolinium which extends to subependymal enhancement of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Additionally, several rounded areas of enhancement and signal changes are seen in both cerebral hemispheres measuring 1-2 cm in size involving the frontal and parietal lobes consistent with mild surrounding edema.
These findings are consistent with metastatic disease.
There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle without significant midline shift.
There is mild brain atrophy identified.
IMPRESSION: Findings indicative of hemorrhagic metastatic disease with the largest lesion in the right occipital lobe and several other lesions measuring from 1-2 cm in both frontal and parietal lobes.
Mass effect is seen on the right lateral ventricle without midline shift.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Interval worsening of pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo woman with cad, pvd, htn, high chol, breast ca in the past, and questionable history of colon cancer 2 yrs ago, who developed left sided weakness morning after cath, as well as L extinction on DSS, L homonomous hemianopsia, and at least two periods of unresponsiveness lasting at least several minutes in duration suggestive of seizures, with CT scan showing multiple areas of hemorrhage in both cerebral hemispheres, and large left occipito-parietal hemorrhage suggestive of bleeding into mets (vs amyloid, less likely).
No hypertension to suggest that this was HTN related.
MRI of the brain with gado confirmed that these lesions were likely mets.
CT of the torso for further metastatic workup was desired, but the patient developed acute renal failure thought related to contrast nephropathy.
She was given IV fluid, which exacerbated her already poor cardiac function, and she developed CHF.
She had also had an elevated WBC count and some chest xray evidence of pneumonia at this time.
At this point she was following commands, answering simple questions (limited by her shortness of breath), lifting the left arm against gravity with some resistance as well, right arm remained full strength, and she still had the left homonomous hemianopsia, although extraocular muscles were intact in their movements.
Within hours of transfer to the floor, she developed respiratory distress and as BiPAP could not be arranged on the floor at that time, she was transferred back to the ICU (SICU now).
On [**4-21**] she dropped her sats again and developed further respiratory distress while in the ICU.
She was given morphine for air hunger and for comfort, and other medications aimed at treating underlying processes were discontinued.
