Neurology was initially consulted for altered mental status which they attributed to toxic/metabolic issues, etoh intoxication, UTI but recommended that if he continued to have altered sensorium and not clear appropriately to consider LP for CNS infection and MRI to r/o toxo, PML, etc.
Toxicology recommended giving IVF and if the lactate  and osmolar gap improved with fluid, then it was unlikely to be due to ethylene glycol or methanol intoxication.
During his ED course, patient was noted to become tremulous and taccycardic and was thought to be undergoing withdrawl.
He reported feeling dehydrated, dizzy, mild headache, whole body feels stiff including neck, pain in legs from sunburn.

Imaging:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

There is diffuse soft tissue swelling at the site of visualized abrasions.
IMPRESSION: No hematoma or abscess in the left upper thigh.
CT head [**2178-4-25**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Mild opacification of left mastoid air cells noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  Pt is a 39 yo man with pmhx HIV with unknown cd4 count admitted here with etoh intoxication, now withdrawl, rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis, elevated anion and osmolar gap.
He was initially admitted to the MICU given his altered mental status, and was transferred to the floor after his mentation improved.
# Altered mental status- On admission, the differential included toxic/metabolic causes including acidosis, urinary tract infection, etoh withdrawl.
LP was hled as he was agitated and he was treated empirically for meningitis with ceftriaxone, acyclovir and vanco.
# Tacchycardia- This was likely multifactorial with multiple possible causes such as etoh withdrawl, pain, volume depletion and anxiety although he has received 5 liters in ED.
-ekg -> sinus tachy -treated ?
He reported that he was anxious about confronting his partner.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis with osmolar gap- On admission, his anion gap was felt likely due to etoh ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis (?
[**1-10**] [**Doctor Last Name **]) but he has osmolar gap concerning for other toxic ingestions.
# HIV- the patient citing confidentiality refused to allow me to contact his ID specialist or PCP regarding his [**Name9 (PRE) 2775**] regimen or other medications.
# [**Name (NI) 3148**] pt found down by police which is the likely cause of his rhabdo.
No evidence of seizure activity that was witnessed.
# Acute renal failure- thought to be prerenal - improved with IVFs .
# Thrombocytopenia- likey due to combination of etoh abuse and HAART therapy and HIV infection.
underlying liver disease and/or medication induced.
# L thigh contusion: He was found to have a raised L thigh contusion/bruise.
Given its raised nature, and low hematocrit, an ultrasound was done to rule out underlying hematoma/abscess.
He did not have fevers, warmth or erythema beyond the area of desquamation c/w cellulitis.
Given his immunocompromised state, he was given 7 days of clindamycin to prevent infection and asked to change dressings on this area daily.
Secondary Diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis AIDS thrombocytopenia Elevated LFTs Anemia   Discharge Condition: AAO x 3 Afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and altered mental status.
You were also found to have a L thigh contusion.
If you develop any headaches, cp, sob, fevers, or other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.
