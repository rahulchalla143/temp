Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY - [**10-29**]: Diagnosed with AML (p/w fevers and myalgias, found to have Influenza A. WBC of 3 with 74% blasts.
Had residual disease after completion requiring HIDAC.
Transplant was c/b prolonged neutropenia, fevers, high transfusion requirement secondary to ABO mismatched graft.
- [**2135-11-1**]: p/w progressive fatigue.
Found to have 54% blasts in his peripheral blood without evidence of tumor lysis or DIC.
- Chronic GVH of the liver, manifesting as liver function test abnormalities.
He had a Liver Bx in [**7-31**]: findings consistent with GVH, but also increased ferritin consistent with iron overload.
Recent MRI did not show any change in adenoma size -Splenic rupture [**2-27**] MVA in [**2125**], no splenectomy required -h/o VRE bacteremia in [**4-30**].
Family History: Patient had a cousin who passed away from leukemia at the age of 9.
His grandfather has DM2, and his father has multiple kidney stones.
He also notes that multiple relatives on his father's side have had MIs and CAD.

Consult ID for details..          Daptomycin = Sensitive , MIC OF 1.5 MCG/ML Sensitivity testing          performed by Etest.
GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2136-8-9**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 28 year old male with AML s/p 3rd allo SCT (2 sibling donors, 1 MUD) ~6 months ago who was admitted after a bone marrow biopsy was indicative for recurrent AML in order to receive chemotherapy.
Otherwise, he had mild nausea and headaches that responded to lorazepam and oxycodone.
He had fevers which were believed to be due to the cytarabine since the fevers only occurred following the chemo and cultures were negative.
This caused him to have fevers and rigors, but this resolved by the next day.
His cell counts began to rise after 6 days, and he no longer required transfusions of red cells or platelets.
# Febrile neutropenia/ID: He was put on cefepime prophylaxis while neutropenic and vancomycin was added when he spiked through cefepime.
The patient became febrile up to 103 on [**8-3**] and have continued.
The patient had VRE bacteremia and the patient was started on linezolid and vancomycin was d/c'ed.
As LFT's normalized the pt continued to have fevers, tachycardia and developed sharp [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] abdominal pain and mica was changed to vori again, and an extensive work up including [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US, CT A/P, MRI of liver, HIDA scan, surface ECHO, CTA of chest, CT non-con of chest was pursued to evaluate the cause of the pt's persistent hyperdynamic state and severe pleuritic pain.
On the evening of [**8-15**], pt developped acute respiratory distress with hypoxia and tachycardia.
The patient was discharged from voriconazole and started on ambisome and posaconazole for increased aspergillus as well as atypical fungal coverage.
His pain also decreased significantly.
On [**8-26**], the patient was switched to daptomycin in preparation for his stem cell boost on [**8-28**], however, this caused a rise in the patients LFTs and bilirubin.
#Rib pain - After returning to the floor from the ICU, the patient continued to complain of severe lateral thoracic pain, R>L that required treatment with q4h IV dilaudid.
Per the patient, this was different from the pleuritic chest pain that he had experienced previously.
A CT scan of the chest done on [**9-15**] showed no acute process or etiology of his pain.
#Elevated bilirubin - The patient had an elevation of his bilirubins from [**Date range (1) 62547**].
Initially, the etiology was unclear, and [**Name (NI) 5283**] u/s and liver MRI showed no evidence of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease, cholecystis or biliary duct destruction consistent with GVHD.
#Nutrition - The patient had poor PO intake due to nausea and lack of appetite.
He was placed on TPN, which was stopped on [**9-15**] when his appetite and nausea improved.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety or nausea.
