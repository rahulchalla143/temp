Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8284**] HiDAC very well without complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or decreased appetite.
Ms [**Known lastname 8285**] CBC was monitored closely following HiDAC chemotherapy secondary to her significant bleeding risks from thrombocytopenia as evidenced in the past.

Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] remained on AmBisome for the multiple rounded lesions within the spleen which were not significantly changed on repeat MRI examination on [**2154-12-4**].
The lesions were likely hemangiomas versus leukemic infiltrates, although a fungal infection was of a concern.
Ms [**Known lastname **] developed a fever during her neutropenia and was initiated on Cefepime.
The patient had continuous contact with her infant son prior to her febrile episode and the possibility of an airborne virus precipitating the fever was explored.

The patient also had a cough at this time.
Blood cultures, urine culture, chest x-ray were performed on [**2154-12-26**] during the febrile episode, and all studies did not reveal a source for her infection.
