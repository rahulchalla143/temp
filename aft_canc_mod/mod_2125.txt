Febrile Neutropenia - In the ED patient was hypotensive and started on dopamine.
Blood cx taken on the bmt service were negative, multiple CXR showed no PNA.
Initially, patient's hypotension was thought to be from ativan overdose at home vs. sepsis.
Subsequently patient was then started on caspo for persistent fevers.
A source of infection was never found so the initial hypotension and change in mental status were both thought to be from ativan overdose rather than sepsis.
Pancytopenia - Most likely [**1-22**] recent chemotherapy.
patient is transfused in house 2x and was determined to be transfusion dependent due to her disease.
She remained transfusion dependent.
- acute MS changes at admission were most likely due to ativan overdose at home.

[**Name (NI) 430**] MRI was negative except for sinus disease thought to be chronic.
The patient then developed left facial droop and slurring of speech.
