Pain described as sharp, anterior, nonradiating severe chest pain, pleuritic, only present when coughing or taking deep breath, not at rest.
HD was discontinued early after 1.5 hrs due to tachycardia, noted to be in rapid AF 150-180, BP initially 102/72, given 10mg IV diltiazem, became hypotensive to 80s.
He had two attempts at DCCV, wtihout success then started on diltiazem drip with HR improving to 90-100s, started on neo and levophed for BP support.
Pt seen on arrival to CCU, denies any dyspnea, admits to persistent pleuritic anterior chest pain.
No recent fever, chills, cough, nausea.
No abdominal pain, BRBPR, melena, he has ocassional loose stools.

Physical Exam: VS: T 97.4, BP 124/53, HR 86, RR 16, O2 sat 96% on 4L NC Gen: elderly AA male in no acute respiratory distress, moderate discomfort with movement of R leg.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CV: Irregularly irregular, no m/r/g.
Chest: CTA b/l anteriorly without crackles or wheezes.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
R knee in immobilizer brace, no significant tenderness over R knee, significant tenderness over R femur.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated AF with ventricular rate of 68, nl axis, no LVH, no ischemic changes, ST depression noted on previous EKG resolved.
[**4-3**] Head CT: No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and regions of discoid and subsegmental atelectasis.
Cardiomegaly and marked left atrial enlargement.
Mild vasculopathy.
Right thyroid goiter resulting in mild tracheal compression and leftward tracheal deviation.
[**2177-4-5**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No esophageal stricture or mucosal abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo M hx ESRD on HD, HTN, DM II who presented with new onset atrial fibrillation, rapid ventricular rate and hemodynamic compromise associated with chest pain.
# Atrial fibrillation-Exacerbating factor was unclear and pt did not tolerate the RVR well and developed hypotension.
There was no clear evidence of fluid overload.
Pt had continued hypotension after IV diltiazem, DCCV attempts were unsuccessful in ED x 2.
Pt was started on IV diltiazem at 10mg/hr with pressor support for hypotension and admitted to CCU.
Pt responded well to diltiazem drip, HR improved to 80s and hypotension resolved gradually, able to be weaned off pressors overnight.
An echocardiogram was obtained to look for structural abnormalities, showing mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], mild symmetric LVH with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
He was noted to have some intermittent runs of A.fib or atrial arrythmia, but HR was well controlled on Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] & Metoprolol 25mg TID.
# Chest pain - Pt was admitted with c/o chest pain & was evaluated with cardiac enzymes which were not elevated from baseline.
CTA of chest in the ED showed no evidence of PE or dissection.
# Vomiting: Pt noted a sense to food being stuck in chest & then had intermittent episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis.
UGI swallow showed normal peristalsis, reflux and upper esophageal deflection [**2-15**] enlarged thyroid mass (known h/o thyroid cancer, decision made with patient & PCP to avoid intervention).
Pt denied abd pain but was noted to have one guaiac positive stool.
It was thought likely that he had developed a gastritis due to high dose NSAIDs.
# Right leg pain-Pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 29120**] for mechanical fall related right knee pain and gout flare.
Pt had continued to have right knee/upper thigh pain at rehab.
X-rays obtained were neg for fracture & pelvic/lower extr CT showed DJD but no e/o fracture.
Pain improved on Ibuprofen & Oxycontin 10mg [**Hospital1 **], and he continued to have good pain control after stopping NSAIDs.
# ESRD - Pt was followed by renal throughout hospitalization & was continued on his outpatient medications including cinacalcet.
# HTN - BP meds initially held given hypotension, then Metoprolol was restarted after resolution of hypotension.
# DM: Glipizide was stopped while in house & pt was covered with Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale with decent BS control.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation with RVR ESRD on HD Gastritis HTN DMII Thyroid Cancer Severe DJD   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with chest pain & found to be in Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.
You have been treated with medications to help slow the heart rate.
You have been started on a new medication called Amiodarone to help suppress this arrythmia & slow your heart rate.
If you develop any new chest pain, shortness of breath or any other general worsening of condition, please call your PCP or come directly to the ED.
