She was scheduled to see CT surgery tomorrow in consult for possible CABG, but yesterday developed shortness of breath and left anterior chest pain radiating to left arm after going up 2 flights of stairs.
Reports this pain was different from her typical anginal pain, which is more substernal in nature and often radiates to the back.
The chest pain was not associated with any dizziness, diaphoresis, or nausea.
Per report, EKG showed mildly flattened T waves laterally.
On arrival to floor, patient comfortable and chest pain free.
On review of systems, she reports recent headaches secondary to her isosorbide mononitrate.
Has occasional palpitations.
Also reports occasional orthopnea and PND, though attributes some of this to her body habitus and sleep apnea.
Reports mild abdominal discomfort and loose stool yesterday, now resolved.
Denies fevers, chills, diaphoresis, nasal congestion, sore throat, current N/V, abdominal pain, constipation, bloody or dark tarry stools, dysuria, or hematuria.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no change in valvular function.
Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Some increasing opacification at the right base most likely represents atelectasis with crowding of vessels in the region of the cardiophrenic angle.
Mild blunting of the costophrenic angle is seen.
No evidence of vascular congestion.
Both lopressor and lasix was decreased due to mild hypotension.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
