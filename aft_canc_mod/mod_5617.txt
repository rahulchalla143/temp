Admission Date:  [**2199-8-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-8-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-10-7**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 76-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Room on [**2199-8-2**] with weakness and nausea upon arrival.
Patient also reported black stools.
The weakness progressed and on the day prior to admission, the patient reported that he could not urinate while standing secondary to weakness.
The patient denied back pain now, but questions whether he had it on the day prior to admission.
The patient denied abdominal pain.
Denied diarrhea or constipation.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction with RCA PTCA in [**2192**], status post lateral wall ST elevation myocardial infarction with stent in [**2198-7-30**].
Diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction in [**2198-7-30**] 30-40%.
Guaiac positive stools on aspirin.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 1.7 to 1.8.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Urinary retention.
This is a elderly gentleman pale in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Conjunctivae were pale, no icterus.
Cardiac examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, 2/4 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border, one with crackles at the bases and decreased air movement on the right.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended, good bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
The patient was admitted to the MICU for severe anemia and hypotension and presumed GI bleed.
CT of abdomen was negative for aortoenteric fistula, aortic dissection, or abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Anemia:  Anemia was deemed likely secondary to an acute gastrointestinal bleed also on top of chronic picture.
Patient's anemia was deemed to be acute on chronic with acute being the GI bleed, chronic issue of anemia in addition to thrombocytopenia.
They recommended holding the proton-pump inhibitor secondary to thrombocytopenia as a possible inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
I also recommended bone marrow biopsy to further assess for possible bone marrow etiologies.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed during this admission which revealed myelodysplastic syndrome as the likely etiology of his now chronic anemia.
Also revealed pale red blood cells indicating a possible component of iron despite normal iron studies.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, however, with serial hematocrit checks would be found to have a hematocrit of 25.9 or lower.
Patient had remained transfusion free for nearly 48 hours prior to discharge.
Thrombocytopenia:  Possible etiologies included medication-induced, ITP, TTP, hemolysis.
A bone marrow biopsy once again gave unifying diagnosis with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.
Hematology:  Per above, the patient was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome.
GI:  The patient was also found to have an acute GI bleed.
The endoscopy revealed multiple areas of gastritis and small patchy angiectasias.
Electrocautery was used to achieve hemostasis in this region.
In addition to this, they also found an extrinsic compression of the mid esophagus by a pulsating structure, however, a prior CT scan of the abdomen had been unrevealing for aortic aneurysm.
This was possibly just due to a large cardiac chamber.
The patient had an additional EGD while in-house given his decrease in hematocrit after the first procedure, however, this did not yield any further areas of bleeding to be cauterized.
Also during his admission, the patient noted large black bowel movements consistent with old blood likely from his upper GI source.
There was no additional nausea or vomiting.
The patient was noted to have low back pain.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which revealed 3 mm ST segment depressions.
This was treated with sublingual nitrogen with resolution of the pain and also subsequent resolution the electrocardiogram findings back to baseline of 1 mm depressions.
This was deemed to be due to a demand ischemia episode.
