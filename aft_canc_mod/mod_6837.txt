Her situation had also been complicated by known CNS involvement of her leukemia.
An HLA-matched unrelated donor had been found who was a single B allele mismatch.
The most likely preparative regimen would have been an ablative busulfan Cytoxan/total body radiation Cytoxan, or a second choice a TLI clofarabine ATG trial.
On [**2153-10-31**], she presented complaining of night sweats, abdominal pain, and vomiting, no diarrhea.
She stated that she was also extremely fatigued and wished to sleep all the time.
Denied headache or visual changes but endorsed "heaviness" of her head.
She also endorsed increased SOB, but no upper respiratory symptoms.
No fevers or chills at home.
No  no cough, no sore throat, no headache, no numbness or tingling, no focal weakness, +abdominal pain, +nausea, +vomiting, +constipation, no diarrhea, no lower extremity swelling.
The patient presented on [**2153-8-8**] to [**Hospital6 2561**] with fevers and severe shortness of breath.
She was found to have an elevated white count of 114,000 with 10% blasts and early myeloid precursors.
A bone marrow biopsy done on [**2153-8-8**] showed involvement with acute myeloid leukemia, most likely M5b with monocytic differentiation.
On [**2153-9-12**] bone marrow biopsy showed 90% cellularity, which was entirely comprised of monocytic cells consistent with leukemia precursors.
Intrathecal liposomal cytarabine on [**2153-10-19**].
Rheumatic fever 2.
Toxoplasmosis - causing spontaneous abortion at 8 months gestation in [**2133**]  Social History: She moved to US from [**Country 9362**] 7 years ago.
Family History: Mother with history of breast cancer, father with history of throat cancer.

Interval development of a new lingular consolidation, with surrounding ground-glass opacity, may reflect an infectious process.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema, asymmetrically worse on the right.
Mild decrease in size of extra-axial posterior fossa collections.
T1 hyperintense irregular focus in the left cerebellum with mild enhancement is grossly unchanged since prior exam.
Interval development of diffuse widespread ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening.
There are also small bilateral pleural effusions.
These constellations of findings are suggestive of CHF or volume overload.
Less likely these findings could be related to leukemic infiltration or atypical infection.
Progression of persistent lingular consolidation which notably causes encasement and obliteration of a pulmonary artery branch.
Therefore this is favored to represent either an aggressive infection, (an atypical [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as fungus could be considered) or malignancy such as a focal leukemic infiltrate.
Left greater than right bibasilar consolidation could also be infectious in nature.
Progression of the splenic and bilateral renal infarcts.
Ill-defined liver hypodensities in the left and right hepatic lobes as described.
These are of unclear etiology but could be related to the additional sites of infarction or leukemic infiltration.
Slightly increased free fluid in the pelvis.
She had increasing peripheral blasts after second cycle of decitabine and new symptoms.
She was admitted for new symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, low grade fever and night sweats concerning for infection or leukemia relapse.
#) Fever and AML:     Fevers were likely of leukemic etiology.
CT Torso showed new lingular lung infiltrate and splenic infarctions, likely leukemic infiltrate though infection could not be ruled out.
Given patient's history of pulmonary lesions improving on chemotherapy, blasts on peripheral blood, leukocytosis, and 88% blasts seen on BM biopsy, initiation of chemotherapy with Dacogen, Mylotarg, and Hydroxyurea was started on [**2153-11-1**].
ICU Course [**11-3**]- [**11-5**]:  # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:   Patient was oxygenating poorly on 5L oxygen by nasal canula with an ABG of 7.52/31/49, so she was placed on a non-rebreather on the evening of [**11-4**], then non-emergently intubated at 21:30 by the overnight intensivist for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
During intubation, blood was noted in the lower airway, suggesting possible alveolar hemorrhage.
An arterial line was placed to monitor her blood pressures more accurately and draw frequent arterial blood gases.
# AML:     She was placed on neutropenic precautions for functional neutropenia.
Even after her respiratory failure and intubation, she was given her next dose of chemotherapy on the night of [**11-4**], per BMT recommendations.
Soon after intubation, the patient spiked a temperature to 103 F, likely secondary to her leukemia.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 83422**] urine output declined as the night progressed, and she became tachycardic to 130s.
She was started on vasopressor medications the morning of [**11-5**] for new hemodynamic instability.
Through the morning, the patient had an increased vasopressor requirement to maintain systolic blood pressure, and she demonstrated worsening acidemia desipte maximal medical support.
The patient's family was called because of her worsening clinical status, and she quietly expired in the presence of her family.
# Abdominal Pain:    The patient complained of increasing abdominal pain on the evening of [**11-4**] and "bloating," stating that she had been having the pain for four to five days, and it is relieved somewhat after bowel movements.
Her physical exam at that time was significant for an increased tenderness and firmness in the epigastric area and guarding only in the epigastric region of her abdomen.
She did not have any rebound tenderness.
Per discussion with Radiology, the Xray could have represented ascites or severe acute obstruction; however, the patient had no nausea or vomiting, so obstruction was thought to be unlikely.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed significant worsening of splenic infarctions and new renal infarctions, likely secondary to her leukemia.
# DIC:    Early morning [**11-4**], the patient was noted to be in DIC with decreasing platelet count, increasing INR, and a dropping fibrinogen level.
Her oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] spoke with the family afterwards and explained that she had a Blast Crisis which had not been responsive to treatment.
