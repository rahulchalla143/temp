Pt denied any LOC, headache, visual changes, new difficulties with speech or any other motor or sensory loss.
Pt has a laceration on the bridge of his nose.

Family History: Remarkable for mother with diabetes and a brother with diabetes and prostate cancer.
Mild confusion.
VIII: Hearing intact to voice, not finger rub IX, X: Palatal elevation symmetrical.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Probable old septal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-12-25**] no significant change.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 77	152	86	[**Telephone/Fax (2) 70523**]	  Imaging: Head CT [**1-23**]: IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of patient's known left cerebellar hemorrhagic mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Mass effect and partial effacement of the fourth ventricle and left posterior aspect of the perimesencephalic cistern with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Bilateral nasal ala and nasal septum fractures with adjacent soft tissue edema.
Multilevel degenerative disc disease with no evidence of acute fracture.
Soft tissue density adherent to the right tracheal wall which may represent mucus versus polyp.
Left cerebellar mass with hemorrhagic foci and surrounding edema causing effacement of the fourth ventricle and quadrigeminal cistern.
Differential diagnosis includes lymphoma and metastatic disease.
Chronic right frontal lobe changes consistent with prior history of trauma and contusion.
Status post gastric pull-through for esophageal carcinoma, with no definite metastatic disease.
Stable 15-mm right hepatic lesion with suggestion of peripheral enhancement, and which may represent a hemangioma.
New rib fractures involving the left sixth and right tensor ribs, without definite underlying lytic lesion or associated soft tissue mass.
Sclerosis and cystic changes in the bilateral femoral heads, which can be seen with avascular necrosis, particularly in patients on steroid therapy.
Prostatic enlargement.
Resection of the previously demonstrated infiltrative mass lesion on the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Residual pattern of enhancement in the surgical bed with a nodular area of enhancement as described above, measuring approximately 19 x 9 mm in size possibly related with volume averaging, persistent edema in the posterior fossa involving the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Unchanged microvascular ischemic disease in the periventricular white matter.
Followup MRI is recommended to demonstrate any further change or stability in the pattern of enhancement in the surgical area.
Status post occipital craniotomy with surgical changes in the craniotomy bed and edema in the left cerebellar hemisphere, similar in extent to MR done on [**2116-2-1**].
Similar degree of mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Trace intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Bilateral Knee images [**2-4**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture detected on either side.
Stable medial tibial plateau fracture on left, with marked medial compartment narrowing on the left.
No evidence of biliary dilatation.
On [**1-24**], pt underwent a third ventriculostomy without complications.
Staging for esophageal carcinoma was performed.
No sites of metastasis were identified.
On [**1-27**], [**Last Name (un) **] was [**Last Name (un) 4221**] for increased blood glucose.
CTA/V of the head was performed which demonstrated no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.
On [**1-31**], he went to the OR for suboccipital craniotomy for mass resection.
MRI revealed a gross total resection of the lesion.
On [**2-2**], his coagulation studies were found to be slightly elevated.
Medicine and the ID services were [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] to help determine the causation of the elevated WBC and transaminitis.
On the evening of [**2-4**] and into the early morning of [**2-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname 70518**] became much more tachycardic(EKG showing sinus tach), and had low blood pressures(SBP 80-90).
His peripheral IV infiltrated and he had no access.
His heart rate temporarily decreased from 140 to 120s but that only lasted a short time.
The patient became progressively lethargic required intubation.
He subsequently suffered multi-organ failure including hepatic failure, renal failure, and profound coaguloathy.
He remained hypotensive requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.
While his blood pressure had subsequently stabilized, he subsequently suffered ARDS with progressive worsening of his ventilation status.
Given the progressive worsening of the patient's status despite aggressive measures and the poor prognosis associated with esophageal metastasis, the family decided to make the patient CMO.
