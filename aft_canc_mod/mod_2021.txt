Admission Date: [**2145-6-21**]        Discharge Date: [**2145-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-5-5**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 50-year-old man with a history of metastatic melanoma who entered with a small bowel obstruction.
The patient initially was diagnosed in [**2143-8-8**] with a left cheek melanoma measuring 1.25 mm deep.
However, in [**2144-4-7**] he recurred with a left submandibular mass requiring a modified radical neck dissection.
He had a short course of Interferon which was not well tolerated.
In [**2144-9-7**] I met the patient for the first time because he had developed a left chest wall metastasis.
I resected this and he then underwent additional rounds of experimental systemic therapy.
On the day of admission, the patient had reported nausea and progressive abdominal distention.
He was initially admitted to the Medical Service but ultimately was transferred to the surgical service after undergoing a laparotomy with resection of his small bowel metastasis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression and gastroesophageal reflux.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**6-24**] where he was found to have an area of intussusception in the mid small bowel due to an implant of metastatic melanoma.
He was also noted at that time to have multiple subcentimeter serosal implants along the bowel and throughout his mesentery diffusely.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic melanoma with small bowel obstruction.
