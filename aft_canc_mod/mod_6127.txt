Per ED he was also noted to have a fair amount of coffee ground emesis, and obvious trauma to the occiput of the head.

There is apparent asymmetry in the distance between the odontoid and the lateral masses of C1 which may be due to rotatory subluxation versus positional and can be imaged further as per clinical need.
Fracture through the right lateral transverse process of T1 which has the appearance of subacute/chronic injury.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine with most significant disc narrowing at C6-7.
Head CT [**11-10**]: 18-mm left subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline shift towards the right of approximately 11 mm.
Acute hemorrhage is also seen in the left sylvian fissure as well as the right thalamus and fourth ventricle.
There is subfalcine and subtentorial herniation with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation suggesting raised intracranial pressure.
Comminuted fracture of the distal right clavicle and would recommend dedicated films to further evaluate.
Multiple nondisplaced chronic-appearing rib fractures.
Filling defect within the right portal vein, which could represent non- occlusive thrombus and would recommend ultrasound evaluation to further evaluate.
There are right-sided dependent lung consolidations which could represent aspiration or lung contusion.
There is a small right apical pneumothorax and right apical blebs.
There is diffuse fatty liver.
Reduction in size of large left convexity subdural hematoma with decreased mass effect and decreased rightward subfalcine herniation as described.
Persistent rightward uncal herniation noted.
Right thalamic and potential right midbrain small intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
Persistent enlargement of the right lateral ventricle with transependymal resorption of CSF noted.
LENIS [**11-17**]:IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombosis of the right common femoral vein.
Interval decrease in size of left subdural hematoma, associated midline shift and mass effect and resolution of left uncal herniation.
Thalamic and brainstem hemorrhages appear stable.
No new intracranial hemorrhage or significant changes since prior scan.
Mild improvement in rightward midline shift from 3 mm to 2 mm.
EEG [**2128-12-2**]  IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the right fronto-central slowing and due to the relatively monotonous mildly slow background throughout.
The first abnormality suggests a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left anterior quadrant.
Nevertheless, there were no clearly epileptiform features there or elsewhere.
The widespread 7 Hz rhythm suggests a widespread encephalopathy, with a regularity raising the possibility of medication effect.
Hyperdense area adjacent to the left frontal lobe in subdural location that is likely secondary to post- operative changes, however, cannot exclude small amount of subdural hemorrhage.
Possible mild cerebrale dema without shift of midline structures, likely due to post-surgical changes.
Expected post- operative changes with pneumocephalus, extra-axial air, and soft tissue swelling.
Head CT [**12-17**] IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in size of fluid collection, with decrease in mass effect upon left frontal hemisphere.
Associated decrease in left to right shift of midline structures.
Persistent edema and mass effect.
Stable appearance of a small left frontal epidural fluid collection with mild mass effect upon the left frontal hemisphere.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Low attenuation subgaleal fluid collection at the cranioplasty site which could relate to postoperative change, although its persistence raises the possibility of a CSF leak.
Mild paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and mastoid air cell opacification.

The legal department was contact[**Name (NI) **] for guardianship.
Pt had IVCF (infrarenal)previously placed, 2. small right apical pneumothorax, 3. filling defect in right portal vein may represent non occlusive thrombus, 4. comminuted proximal right clavicular fracture, 5. right lung dependent consolidations could be aspiration or contusion injury, 6.right testicle high in canal could be result of trauma, 7.distended bladder.
A small amount of coffee ground drainage was noted that evolved to be bilious in nature without further concern.
His hematocrit did drop during the hospitalization and the surgical ICU determined that this was enamia of chronic disease.
Significant LUE weakenss is noted.
Laboratory values on [**Doctor Last Name **] #13 revealed thrombocytosis (1,000) - Aspirin was started for this.
Pt did have an episode of bradycardia after this procedure which was successfully treated with atropine.
His neuro exam showed that he followed commands at times on the right upper and bilat lower extremities.
On [**12-17**] pt developed a subgaleal collection on L side of head which was subsequently drained 4 times and head wrap most recently on [**12-27**] with improvement.
Pt has moderate amounts of secretions, however has a strong cough and negative sputum samples.
He is afebrile and remains hemodynamically stable.
