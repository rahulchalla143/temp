Rapid atrial fibrillation.
Hemoperitoneum secondary to bleeding of the vaginal cuff status post hysterectomy.
Urinary tract infection.
PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:  Exploration and evacuation of a hemoperitoneum and oversewing of the left aspect of the vaginal cuff on [**4-16**].
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of rheumatic heart disease with valvular dysfunction, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction secondary to atrial thrombus, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and anemia, who presented with palpitations on [**2178-4-9**], and was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.
Once the patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint, she underwent exam under anesthesia and a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for fibroids and pelvic pain and menorrhagia on [**2178-4-13**].
On postoperative day #2, she was noted to be slightly tachycardiac with good urine output with a slightly distended abdomen and a hematocrit drop from 31 to 25 for which she was given 3 U of packed red blood cells.
The patient however became progressively tachycardiac and oliguric, and on postoperative day #3, a CT of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal hematoma with portal venous air.
The patient continued to hemorrhage with a hematocrit drop to 19 and became progressively coagulopathic despite FFP.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction secondary to atrial thrombus embolizing to a coronary artery.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Menorrhagia and fibroids.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
Heart rate was in the 110s, and she was in atrial fibrillation.
Chest:  Clear with no crackles or wheezes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2178-4-9**], and her atrial fibrillation was managed by the Medicine Team.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal hematoma with portal venous air.
General Surgery was consulted, and she was taken to the Operating Room on [**2178-4-16**], for exploration and evacuation of the hematoma and oversewing of the posterior aspect of the vaginal cuff.
Her postoperative course in the Intensive Care Unit was notable for several episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
She was cardioverted for the first time on [**4-18**], and then went back into atrial fibrillation on [**4-20**] with unsuccessful.
She underwent an echocardiogram on [**4-23**] which showed some pulmonary hypertension.
Her urine and sputum were positive for growth, and she was started on Levofloxacin and Ceftazidime.
