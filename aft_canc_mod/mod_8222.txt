These findings are most concerning for infection.
Hemorrhage, edema or worsening of underlying interstitial lung disease is unlikely given the asymmetry.
Small right pleural effusion is noted.
No pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of diffuse alveolar consolidation in the right hemithorax concerning for infection.
Hemorrhage, edema or worsening of underlying interstitial lung disease is less likely given asymmetry.
Worsening interstital and air space opacities.
Could reflect exacerbation of known fibrotic NSIP or in the right clinical setting would include an infectious process.
The previously described suspicious right middle lobe subpleural nodule is only partially imaged.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-5-25**] IMPRESSION: Overall improvement in diffuse widespread ground-glass opacities suggestive of resolving bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive.
Of the remainder, 5 show segmental necrosis and/or cellular/fibrocellular crescents.
There is mild-moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.
Mild chronic inflammation accompanies the scarring.
Intact tubulointerstitium shows mild chronic inflammation.
Arterioles show moderate mural thickening and hyaline change.
No active vasculitis is noted.
Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex, containing approximately 5 glomeruli, of which 1 is globally sclerotic.
Clinical: ?
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman with history of IPF and MGUS who presented with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue.
She became in a stable condition after aggressive treatment in ICU for acute lung disease and ARF secondary to P-ANCA associated small vessel vasculitis (Wegener's' granulomatosis versus microscopic polyangiitis).
She was initially treated for presumed pneumococcal pneumonia with IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Images were consistent with worsening bilateral airspace disease.
The initial clinical suspicion at that point was multiple myeloma, evolving from her known monoclonal gammopathy given evidence of renal failure and profound anemia, complicated by pneumococcal pneumonia in the setting of deficient humoral immunity.
She was placed on a NRB and was transferred to the ICU for possible need for mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Chest CT on [**2112-5-22**] showed patchy consolidations, septal thickening, and multiple areas of traction bronchiectasis.
Mini-BAL and multiple cultures were unrevealing for an infection.
A skeletal survey was negative for lytic lesions.
Repeat SPEP showed low level M-spike less suggestive of myeloma.
A follow up renal biopsy was done with concern for renal pulmonary syndrome showed progressive cresenteric glomerular nephritis.
Her ARF is likely secondary to vasculitis.
She had nephrotic range proteinuria and was started on 10mg lisinopril which was titrated to 20 mg. She was initially on three antihypertensive medications, including amlodipine, metoprolol, and hydralazine.
Her anemia is chronic and likely related to myelosuppression secondary to inflammation and Cytoxan.
No evidence of hemolysis or acute bleed during course.
Perianal dermatitis is secondary to incontinence was is improving on clotrimazole cream.
