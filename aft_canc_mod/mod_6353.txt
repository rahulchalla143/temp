Pt began having scant hemoptysis on [**2141-11-2**], but then on evening of [**2141-11-4**] had 10 episodes where she coughed up "quarter-sized" bloodclots.
She then presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where she underwent CTA, showing L hilar mass anterior to L main pulmonary artery 4cm in size occluding the LUL main bronchus.
In the ICU, patient c/o some subjective SOB, which she states has been present since the bronchoscopy.
Denies further episodes of hemoptysis.
No CP, no abd pain/N/V.
Also of note, patient is being treated for UTI w/ macrodantin, started on [**2141-11-1**] for complaints of dysuria.
No UA/culture was sent.
Past Medical History: - Coronary artery disease with history of myocardial infarction in [**2126**], s/p 3 stents w/ last one in [**2138**] - Osteoarthritis.
- Polymyalgia rheumatica - Hypertension.
- Steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
- Obesity.
- Depression.

Family History: - Father died of unknown malignancy - Mother died from complications secondary to hip surgery  Physical Exam: Gen: NAD, AOx3 HEENT: NCAT, mmm, no oropharyngeal lesions Neck: no cervical lymphadenopathy Cardiac: RRR, no m/r/g, nl s1s2 lungs: CTAB abd: soft, nt, nd + bs ext: no c/c/e  Pertinent Results: [**2141-11-5**] Pathology from bronchial washings Left upper lobe, bronchial washings, cell block:      - ATYPICAL.
- Rare atypical poorly-preserved epithelial cells, cannot exclude involvement by non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Immunohistochemical stains could not be interpreted due to scant tumor cells.
[**2141-11-6**] CXR Increase in density of large left hilar mass.
As the patient is experiencing hemoptysis and the mass was associated with obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus on prior PET CT of [**2141-10-30**], consider bronchoscopy for further evaluation if not already performed.
[**2141-11-10**] Renal u/s FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.2 cm in its long axis and shows no masses, stones or hydronephrosis.
Off the inferior pole of the left kidney is an exophytic anechoic structure that measures 4.5 x 4.7 x 4.0 cm and shows through transmission and is most consistent with a cyst.
It exhibits no abnormal vascularity.
Transverse and sagittal views of the bladder show it to be collapsed as the patient had recently voided.
IMPRESSION: Left lower renal pole simple cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yoF w/ recent large B cell lymphoma in L suprahilar region diagnosed in [**4-/2141**] s/p 6 cycles [**Hospital1 **], w/ episodes of PE in [**2140**] and more recently in [**June 2141**] now on coumadin, p/w hemoptysis.
MICU [**Location (un) **] Course: [**Date range (3) 83472**] Patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for further management of hemoptysis in the setting of a bleeding vessel from her tumor.
Here, interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed a flexible bronchoscopy which showed a fungating mass in the left upper lobe with a bleeding vessel.
Patient was taken for rigid bronchoscopy in OR for debulking of tumor and argon cauterization.
However upon extubation, patient became extremely tachypneic and cyanotic, requiring reintubation.
It was unclear why patient had acute respiratory distress but may have been [**2-28**] flash pulmonary edema v. bronchospasm v. obstruction from tumor.
Of note patient was started on Macrodantin as outpatient for UTI however urine cultures were negative so this was dc'ed.
Also of note, patient has h/o PE for which she is coumadin.
Anticoagulation was not restarted given h/o hemoptysis.
In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was extubated without complications and maintained O2 sat in mid-high 90s on 2L of NC.
Pathology preliminary report received after day one of XRT to chest, bronchial washings were not suggestive of lymphoid cells.
Coumadin and aspirin were held during her course on the BMT floor considering her presentation with hemoptysis and she was advised to continue not taking these medications until a diagnosis and treatment plan have been determined.
daily PRAVASTATIN - 20 mg daily TIOTROPIUM BROMIDE [SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER] - 18 mcg daily WARFARIN - 7.5 mg daily ACETAMINOPHEN - 1250mg Daily ASPIRIN [ENTERIC COATED ASPIRIN] 81mg daily B.ANI-L.ACI-L.[**Doctor First Name **]-L.PLAN-L.CAS [PROBIOTIC FORMULA] - daily CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D [**Hospital1 **] - (OTC) FOLIC ACID - 0.4 mg daily MULTIVITAMIN - daily   Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puff Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Tablet(s) 6. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lung lesion, COPD, heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
This was most likely caused by a lesion found in your left lung by bronchoscopy, which the interventional pulmonologists coagulated during the bronchoscopy procedure.
Since there was not enough tissue to diagnose what this lung mass is, on Friday you are scheduled for another bronchoscopy to get more tissue to better diagnose and treat the lung mass.
