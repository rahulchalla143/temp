About one-half hour later he had bright red blood per rectum then came immediately to the emergency room where he reports three more episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
Usually the patient has one brown bowel movement per day, no melena or bright red blood per rectum usually.
He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes and coronary artery disease in his mother.
HEENT showed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm, a [**3-6**] murmur at the left lower sternal border that radiated to the axilla not to the neck.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally; no wheezes, no rales.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had no edema.
He had an EKG that was normal sinus rhythm at 67, left axis deviation with normal intervals, no ST elevation or T wave inversion.
He did have mild upsloping of the T wave in V2 through V4 which could be called J point elevation.
There is no old film to compare.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient received a total of four units of packed red blood cells with only one more episode of bright red blood when he reached the intensive care unit.
The patient had a colonoscopy which showed multiple diverticula and internal hemorrhoids.

On further information the patient said he has had some glucose intolerance in the past and actually sees a doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
He stated he has not had a recent stress test.
Due to the J point elevation and repeat EKG showing some T wave flattening, would recommend and outpatient stress and an outpatient echocardiogram to work-up the patient's murmur.
