However, the patient had brief, self-limited episodes of a narrow-complex tachycardia to 130-140s and would drops his SBP during these episodes.
Per report, the longest episode lasted 60 sec and SBP dropped to the 70s briefly and recovered with resumption of normal HR.
On arrival to the floor he noted persistent chest pain that he has noted for many months.
No abdominal pain.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma: presented [**2-/2145**] with what sounds like stage III disease.
Treated with [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxotere with good response by radiography but eventually developed obstructive esophageal mass requiring stenting on [**2145-9-9**].
Hypothyroidism 3.
He re-presented [**4-/2145**] and was diagnosed with right-sided DVT.
Family History: No history of cancers in the family.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing or cyanosis, 1+ edema to above ankles bilaterally right>left.

~100 cc of contrast infiltration in the right arm.
When IV access is re-established, a CTA of the chest can be performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
Clear lungs without evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
Distal esophageal thickening compatible with the patient's known esophageal cancer, with a stent present.
Intraluminal soft tissue material within the stent may represent neoplastic infiltration, debris, or food material.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, grossly unchanged since [**2145-10-8**], likely cysts.
Colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

He had significant ventricular ectopy that improved with electrolyte replacement and paroxysmal SVT that improved with uptitration of metoprolol and correction of electrolyte abnormalities.TSH level was also repeated and normal.
# Stage IV esophageal adenocarcinoma - Patient completed XRT while hospitalized.
He will need to continue follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29514**].Chest CT and EGD showed no evidence of disease progression .
#  DVT - Pt diagnosed with a DVT on [**5-1**] and since then treated with enoxoparin daily dose.
In-spite apparent compliance pt continues to have clinical evidence of a DVT as well as radiological evidence per LENI done on admission.
# Pancytopenia - Most likely related to chemotherapy;however,if counts do not recover there might be another underlying process.
# Hypothyroidism - Continued levothyroxine at home dose.TSh checked and within normal range.
# BPH - Finasteride in place of dutasteride per hospital formulary and held terazosin given hypotension.
During hospitalization pt had no difficulties urinating.
#Malnutrition/Nausea/Vomiting:An egd was done and showed a patent stent.
Pt did have nausea and emesis initiailly, which could have been partly delayed CINV and secondary to radiation.
Nausea and vomiting resolved , however , pt continued to have a lack of appetite without any odynophagia or dysphagia.
#Hypomagnesemia:Most likely secondary to carboplatin.
