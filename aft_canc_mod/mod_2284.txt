50 yo M with T3N2 squamous cell esophageal cancer s/p Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy in [**9-/2126**], chemo/XRT and CT in [**2-17**] with new para-aortic LAD concerning for disease progression, lingular opacity now presenting with 3 weeks of cough productive of yellowish sputum-->vomiting.
He denies dysphagia or odynophagia.
His cough has been productive and he has had left sided chest pain.
No fever, nightsweats.
He has not had abdominal pain, nausea.
He currently complains of left-sided, pulsating headache without radiation, no acute visual change.
Past Medical History: HTN esophageal cancer s/p chemoradiation h/o Tobacco abuse h/o Alcohol abuse Dyslipidemia  ONC history: Esophageal cancer stage (T3N2M0) poorly differentiated with squamous features with progressive disease - [**2126-6-6**] Admitted with dysphagia and odynophagia which was started 6 months PTA and had progressed over the past month.
He had an out pt barium swallow which showed an ulcerating mass at the distal esophagus.
During this hospital stay ([**Date range (1) 43748**]), he had an EUS which revealed T3N2 disease with a 3x1 cm mass in the lower third of the esophagus and GE junction involving the mucosa, submucosa, the muscularis and adventitia.
There were 4 lymph nodes in the peri-gastric and para-esophageal region which were unable to be sampled but were suspicious for malignancy.
Biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal squamous differentiation.
PET/CT scan showed FDG activity in the primary mass and peri-aortic lymph nodes as well as a suspicious area in the left upper quadrant small bowel (unclear significance).

- [**2126-8-22**] EGD with radiation esophagitis, no obvious recurrence - [**2126-9-23**] PET CT showed new FDG-avid celiac lymph node concerning for nodal metastasis as well as decreased uptake in treated esophageal cancer.
- [**2126-9-25**] Esophagectomy showed poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, 9 of 16 lymph nodes positive for carcinoma - [**2126-10-1**] Barium swallow with no leak, good gastric emptying - [**2126-12-4**] CT torso showed several celiac axis nodes, the largest of which measures 12 mm.
- [**2127-2-10**] CT torso showed new left para-aortic lymphadenopathy as well as increase in previously noted celiac axis lymphadenopathy consistent with disease progression.

small subcutaneous nodule in soft tissue of R shoulder Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
There is a gastric pull-up, which accounts for widening of the right side of the mediastinum.
There is a consolidation involving the left upper lobe which layers along the major fissure.
In addition, there is patchy opacification in the posterior portions of the lungs.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia.

A small 0.8 x 0.9 cm ring enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe, posterior parasagittal in location without significant surrounding edema or mass effect.
However, infectious, inflammatory or subacute ischemic etiology related lesions can also look similar.

There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
There are again seen multifocal opacities within the right lung which are stable.
There are no pneumothoraces.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo M with T3N2 squamous cell esophageal cancer s/p Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy in [**9-/2126**], chemo/XRT and CT in [**2-17**] with new para-aortic LAD concerning for disease progression, lingular opacity now presenting with 3 weeks of productive cough, vomiting, weight loss, hypovolemia and found to have multi-focal PNA.
Staging CT scan revealed LUL collapse, concerning for obstructing mass, with bronchoscopy complicated by desaturation, tachycardia, hypotension, requiring MICU admission.
Pt went for bronchoscopy, and post-procedure was hypotensive and in SVT in 150s.
He initially did well off the vent, but had persistent aspiration/vomitting secondary to malignancy and once again, he went into respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
Ultimately, his entire left lung collapsed secondary to bronchial compression from tumor burden and it was determined that he would not be able to be weaned off of the mechanical ventilation.
