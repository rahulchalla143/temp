There is a homogeneously enhancing mass extending from the sella into the suprasellar cistern, measuring 1.3 cm transverse x 1.0 cm AP x 1.0 cm craniocaudad.
There is no evidence of mass effect on the optic chiasm.
There is no evidence of cavernous sinus involvement.
CT Head [**3-9**]: FINDINGS: Post-operative changes seen status post transsphenoidal surgery and resection of the previously demonstrated sellar/suprasellar mass.
Expected post-surgical changes noted, with small amount of pneumocephalus, and packing material seen in the region of the sella, and posterior to the clivus extending down into the foramen magnum.
Equivocal increased density tracking along the tentorium and in dependent portions of the craniocervical junction may represent a small amount of subdural blood.
Otherwise, there is no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no significant mass effect, or edema.
There is a moderate amount of opacification throughout the nasal passages, and left maxillary sinus.
Equivocal tiny amount of subdural blood along the tentorium, and at the craniocervical junction.
There is packing material in the operative bed, with high T1 signal on pre-contrast images, compatible with fat.
Large amount of heterogeneous material adjacent to the clivus, and in the prepontine cistern is not significantly changed since previous CT, and remains most consistent with merocel, which has extended beyond the operative bed.
Posterior mass effect on the pons and brainstem is not significantly changed.
There is no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no infarction.
Minimal pneumocephalus has decreased.
Unchanged appearance of heterogeneous material tracking along the clivus, and into the prepontine cistern, most consistent with Merocel, which has extended beyond the surgical bed.
Head CT [**3-13**]: IMPRESSION: Expected evolution of post-operative changes.
Apparent contraction of Merocel between the clivus and the brainstem, with decreased mass effect on the brainstem.
Post operatively, she was monitored in the PACU overnight, during which she had increased urinary output and specific gravity consistant with diabetes insipidus.
On [**3-10**], she was found to have a new Cranial Nerve VI palsy, and was taken emergently to MRI to evaluate the new interval change.
Endorinology had been involved since post-op, following daily labs and making recommendations regarding lab monitoring and steroid dosing.
Optholmology was called and appointment arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 81320**] for the patient to be fitted for prism glasses to address her diplopia prior to her discharge.
On [**3-15**], the patient was discharged to home with instructions to follow up with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 81320**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and [**Doctor Last Name **] for ongoing managment.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
Prednisone should also be taken with a glass of milk or with a meal.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
It is normal for feel nasal fullness for a few days after surgery, but if you begin to experience drainage or salty taste at the back of your throat, that resembles a ??????dripping??????
