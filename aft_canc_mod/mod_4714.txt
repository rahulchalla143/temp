No focal liver lesions are identified.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no gallbladder wall edema.
There is no pericholecystic fluid or ascites identified.
The visualized pancreas shows a 2-mm pancreatic duct.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
Patchy opacity is seen at the left lung base with obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Patchy left lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-10-21**] 4:46 PM: FINDINGS: No acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
There is no mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence for major vascular territorial infarction.
There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with age-appropriate involutional change.
Hypodensities are seen in the periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel infarction.
A small hypodensity is seen in the right side of the pons consistent with old infarction.
There is bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening versus fluid.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion.
Old right pontine infarction.
Periventricular small vessel ischemic changes.
There is a suggestion of consolidation at the right lung base, which may represent an evolving pneumonia.
There is no large pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax or central adenopathy.
Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet could be due to tortuous head and neck vessels and/or enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of hypertension and possible lung cancer presents with change in mental status and persistent hypoglycemia.
1) Change in mental status: Most likely due to hypoglycemia.
Head CT was negative for any acute intracranial process.
Resolved quickly with glucose replacement.
2) Persistent hypoglycemia: Differential includes erroneous medications (patient may have taken his roomate's sulfonylurea or insulin), paraneoplastic phenomenon, salicylates, tumor producing insulin like growth factor, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency,  or insulinoma.
Most likely would be a medication error resulting in sulfonylurea dosing.
Would expect this to cause prolonged hypoglycemia since the patient has renal impairment.
Hypoglycemia corrected over the next 10 hours.
[**Last Name (un) **] stim test to r/o sepsis and adrenal insufficiency was not performed as patient's hypoglycemia resolved.
BUN/creatinine ratio c/w pre renal etiology.
4) Hypertension: Chronic.
Patient's BP remained slightly elevated so we added HCTZ 25 mg po qd for tighter control.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypoglycemia  Secondary diagnosis: Question of new renal insufficiency Hypertension Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Seek medical attention for fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, change in mental status, or any other concerning symtpoms.
