The patient has a history notable for CVA in [**2149**], HTN, as well as recently discovered lung mass.
The patient has a several month history of feeling progressively fatigued with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 40 pounds.
He denies nausea but does endorse some dysphagia to solid foods.
He also has shortness of breath with minimal exertion as well as a mucous producing cough.
This was worked up by his PCP which revealed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] large right-sided pleural effusion on CXR.
A follow-up CT chest with contrast on [**2154-4-23**] showed multiple concerning nodules consistent with a likely metastatic malignancy of primary lung origin.
He was seen by IP on [**2154-4-29**] for thoracentesis (>1000 cc of bloody fluid was removed) and ultrasound-guided biopsy, with a final diagnosis of poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 110 CBC, Chem-7: Reveals creatinine of 6.5 and K. of 4.2 Urinalysis: Revealed Small LE, Neg nitrite, few bacteria.
Although he did describe pain with coughing that resolved after the throcentesis on [**4-29**].
He does feel short of breath but feels more comfortable with 2L of O2.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

[**2154-4-23**] CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: Numerous heterogeneous masses in the patient's thorax, along with pleural effusion with nodules and cortical destruction, all concerning for metastatic disease with a lung primary.
[**2154-5-2**] RENAL U/S: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
[**2154-5-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Little interval change from prior with continued moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and right basilar opacification representing the patient's known malignancy and right middle and lower lobe collapse.
CXR [**2154-5-6**]:There is no pneumothorax.
No left pleural effusion.
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Chronic infarcts involving the left putamen, left cerebellar hemisphere and left centrum semiovale.
Mild cortical atrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] is a  61 year old male with a new diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer who was referred to the ED after he was noted to have a creatinine of 10.3 on routine pre-procedure labs.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 6.5 on admission, baseline was 1.1 in [**2153-10-30**].
Most likely pre-renal azotemia from poor PO intake and possibly ATN due to IV contrast.
Renal U/S negative for hydronephrosis.Crea improved with IVF an dreturned to baseline prior to d/c.
# Metastatic lung cancer: New diagnosis.
CT chest with multiple masses in the lung including pleural based masses as well as evidence of bone mets.Pt has no pains incluing back pain or other symptoms suggestive of other bone mets/other mets.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] will be pt's outpt oncologist and will follow next week.Palliative care was also consulted for early supportive care.
# Pleural Effusion: s/p thoracentesis [**2154-4-29**] (atypical cells).
# Anion-gap acidosis: Most likely from uremia.
# EtOH Abuse: Banana bag given in ICU.Pt had no evidence of withdrawal throughout hospital stay.
# Fever/Pneumonia:Pt was staretd on ceftriaxone empirically for positive u/a on admision.
Urine cx was eventually negative and pt with new fevers while on ceftriaxone.Pt was started on cefepime and vancomycin fo rpossible HCAP.
Sputum cxs positive for proteus and abx narrowed to cefepime per sensitivities.Pt defervesced and remained afebrile.
# Diarrhea:Pt developed diarrhea during hospital stay.
# Severe anion-gap acidosis: Due to uremia.
#Asthma/COPD: Pt with h/o asthma and heavy smoker.
Started albuterol nebs and switched to ipratropium due to tachycardia .
Pt started on low dose metorprolol dirng hospitl astay given elevated blood pressure measurements.
# Pain: None.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC.
# Lines: peripheral.
