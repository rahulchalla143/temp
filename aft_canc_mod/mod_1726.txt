Admission Date:  [**2150-8-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-9-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Fall and left sided inability to move.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 72 y/o male with PMHx significant for colon, prostate and stomach cancer who presents with concerns of a stroke.
Here he was noted to have a right gaze preference, word finding difficulties and right gaze preference.
A head CT was obtained and showed a right pareital stroke as well as 3 old subcortical strokes.
CTA also showed blockage in the right distal M1 segement.
Patient did meet time criteria for TPA and was given the bolus of iv TPA, however then the infusion was stopped as the circumstances that the patient had old cortical stroke came out.
TPA was stopped because of the potential for intraparenchymal bleeding due to  history of stroke in early [**Month (only) **].
Of note, during his last admission neurology was consulted for concerns with difficulties with complex spatial tasks and a recent fall.
His exam was notable for mild inattention, difficulty with calculations, mildly unsteady tandem gain, left neglect with spatial tasks and signs of apraxia.
MRI showed bilateral parietal gyriform enhancing lesions of unclear etiology with etiologies ranging from subacute stroke to leptomeningeal metastasis to cerebritis.
An LP to rule out infection (WBC 1, RBC 90 with 0 polys, 57 lymphs and 43 monos, protein 67 and glucose 60) and cytology to rule out malignant cells in CSF was recommended.
Clinically-localized prostate cancer - s/p XRT + adjuvant hormone therapy 2.
Stage IIIC colon cancer - s/p FOLFOX adjuvant chemo 3.
Metastatic ampullary carcinoma.
Extinction and inattention: 2  BP-120/42 HR-67 RR-21 O2Sat 100% Gen: Lying in bed, intermittent retching, awake HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: +BS soft, nontender Ext: no edema  Neurologic Examination: Mental status: General:  awake, answers questions with latency Orientation:  oriented to person and month, not situation  Executive function: *Follows simple axial and appendicular commands: closes and opens his eyes, opens mouth, smiles.
VII: Facial movement asymmetric with left faical droop.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: finger-nose-finger normal on right    Pertinent Results: LABORATORY STUDIES:  Admission CT /CTA/ CTP:  There is subacute-to-chronic-appearing right parietal lobe infarct identified.
There is no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation seen.
No hemorrhage identified.
There is no evidence of dense middle cerebral artery.
CT PERFUSION HEAD: CT perfusion of the head demonstrates a large defect within the right middle cerebral artery territory on mean transit time with a corresponding blood volume abnormality indicative of a large area of evolving infarct.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head demonstrates complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at the M1 region with subtle distal flow in the sylvian branches.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates subacute infarct in the right parietal lobe seen on the previous MRI of [**2150-8-5**].
Large perfusion defect in the middle cerebral artery region indicative of an evolving infarct.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates near complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at M1 region with minimal distal flow as described above  MRI/A: There is an acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct identified as seen on recent CTA examination.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage seen in this region.
There are linear areas of susceptibility abnormalities identified in the right parietal cortex at the site of previously seen infarct on the MRI of [**2150-8-5**].
In addition, signal abnormalities are seen in the left parietal lobe and also along the medial aspect of the left parietal lobe on diffusion images, some of which were present on the previous MRI and could be subacute infarcts.
However, the abnormalities in the medial aspect of the left parietal lobe on diffusion were not clearly seen on the previous study and could be interval infarcts but they are difficult to assess on ADC map secondary to motion.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.
Acute right middle cerebral artery infarct without evidence of a hemorrhage with minimal mass effect.
Evolving subacute infarcts in both parietal lobes with new diffusion abnormality in the medial left parietal lobe could be also due to subacute infarcts but were not clearly visible on the prior MRI.
Laminar necrosis with susceptibility abnormalities are seen in both parietal lobes at the site of previous infarcts.
MRA shows complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in the M1 region without visualization of the distal branches.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The previously noted multiple liver metastases are not well visualized on this current late urographic phase study, but heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma suggests progression.
No source of gastrointestinal bleeding demonstrated.
CAROTID ULTRASOUND: Bilateral ICA simple calcific plaque, no appreciable associated stenosis however (graded as less than 40% bilaterally).
He received iv tpa but it was stopped after several minutes once it became known that he had a prior stroke during early [**2150-8-5**].
He still has a dense L-sided neglect with anosognosia and with his eyes not crossing the midline.
CT brain on [**8-24**] did not show evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
ID: Patient was treated for UTI with 10 day course of ceftriaxone.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for contipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**12-6**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Neurologic status: left hemiplegia and neglect, no blink to threat and eyes cannot cross midline to the left   Discharge Instructions: You have had a large RIGHT MCA stroke.
You have developed LEFT sided weakness and neglect that will require rehabilitation.
