The patient was able to tolerate minimal po in between her episodes of nausea and vomiting.
The patient's nausea and vomiting persisted and on postoperative day number 15 had a dystonic reaction, which was felt to be attributed to the Compazine around the clock and the Reglan prn that she had been receiving.
The patient received Benadryl for the dystonic reaction with good results.
The patient continued to have nausea and vomiting despite the Anzemet, therefore Decadron was added.
The patient was maintained on the Anzemet and Decadron with some relief of the nausea and vomiting.
This was done, because the patient reported increased difficulty in breathing.
The pleurocentesis yielded approximately 1 liter of straw colored sputum that was negative for malignancy on cytology evaluation.
In the middle of the day on postoperative day number 18 the patient stated that her nausea had improved and she had not vomited.
