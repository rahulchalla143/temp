A biopsy of a left supraclavicular node was done on [**3-15**] which revealed evidence of classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma, nodular sclerosis subtype.
He had a chest x-ray on [**3-12**] as part of a preop testing before his lymph node biopsy which revealed Central adenopathy is predominantly in a pre- and paratracheal planes, extending from the neck to the upper mediastinum, as well as both internal mammary chains, probably not involving the lower poles of the hila.
PET scan on [**4-4**] revealed numerous FDG-avid nodules throughout the anterior chest wall along with extensive FDG-avid cervical, hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymphadenopathy.
There was an  indeterminate FDG-avid lesion in the right lobe of the liver.

Physical Exam: Admission Exam: VS: 99.1  100/60  121  18  100% 2L GENERAL:  Non-toxic although tired appearing, rigoring; diffuse indurated warm, red maculopapular rash in all areas that patient is able to reach (sparing of the mid-back) with scattered pinpoint areas of skin breakdown and scabbing HEENT:  Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, lesions, or thrush.
Focal dyskeratosis is noted, and mild pigment incontinence is present.
Overall, the findings are consistent with a reaction to chemotherapeutic agents, and compatible with early/inflammatory phase of flagellate erythema (due to bleomycin).
Rule out flagellate erythema.
Status post ABVD TX (includes bleomycin) who presents with several days history of intensely pruritic eruption, neck down which is strikingly flagellate appearing deep erythematous papules and plaque.
No mucosal involvement.
Patient febrile with elevated eos plus neutropenic.
IMAGING: [**4-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mediastinal widening relates to the patient's known history of lymphoma.
No acute pneumonia.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen but suboptimal study  [**4-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-22**], the right IJ catheter remains in place with the tip in the mid portion of the SVC.
Prominence of the superior mediastinum consistent with adenopathy is again seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 30yo M h/o Hodgkin's Disease on ABVD c1d13 on day of admission who presented w rash, febrile neutropenia, and was intially treated in the ICU for hypotension to SBP 80s and poor peripheral access.
Patient's exam was notable for pruritic, erythematous rash over extremities and trunk.
Biopsy confirmed that this flagellate erythema, thought to be either [**1-24**] bleomycin vs hypersensitivity reaction to allopurinol.
Pruritus responded well to prednisone and hydroxyzine; PO prednisone was changed to IV steroids for most of the hospitalization of of concern for poor absorption.
Patient was initially covered with cefepime/vanco in setting of febrile neutropenia.
WBC did continue to trend upwards to 70s in setting of steroids and previous neupogen but again trended down prior to discharge.
No infectious source was isolated, and his hypotension and fevers were attributed to allergic reaction.
