Admission Date:  [**2198-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-7-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Allopurinol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Thrombocytopenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L IJ triple lumen catheter R femoral aterial line  History of Present Illness: .
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 32416**] is an 88yF with CLL who presented to clinic the day prior to admission complaining of fatigue, anorexia, and nausea, at which time allopurinol was stopped (it had been started as initial treatment for CLL in [**Month (only) **]).
A CBC was drawn, which was significant for thrombocytopenia of 7.
She denies history of trauma and visual changes.
Oncological History: First documented elevated WBC was in [**2181**], with flow cytometry in [**2191**] confirming a diagnosis of CLL.
In [**2198-2-25**] she was noted to have bulky axillary lymphadenopathy.
A staging CT in [**2198-4-27**] showed widespread lymphadenopathy involving the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with a large conglomeration of mesenteric lymph nodes.
She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**2198-7-4**], but over the last week she had become anorectic, with sore throat and recent weight loss.
CLL as above Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension .
[**Name (NI) 4906**] died of metastatic colon cancer.
No family history of cancer, heart disease, or diabetes.
Vitals T100.5, HR 94, RR 20, BP 102/46, Sat 96%RA General: No acute distress, thin elderly woman HEENT: EOMI, left eye with conjunctival hemorrhage, 2cm ecchymosis below left eye; multiple confluent petechiae/ecchymoses on hard palate Neck: Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Heart: RRR normal S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated Abd: Soft, non-tender, no discrete splenomegaly appreciated, normal active bowel sounds Ext: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally, no edema .
CXR ([**7-5**]) - Severe elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is more pronounced consistent with severe eventration or phrenic nerve palsy.
Thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified but not dilated.
There is no pleural abnormality .
RUQ U/S ([**7-7**]) -  No evidence of cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis.
RLE U/S:  Focused scanning of the right lower leg over are of erythema demonstrates diffuse subcutaneous swelling however no focal fluid collection is identified.
No gas in the soft tissues or abnormal enhancement of the fascia is visualized to suggest necrotizing fasciitis 2.
No large deep fluid collection is visualized.
There is diffuse reticular edema to the soft tissues of the entire right leg, with a moderate dependent component.
Bone Marrow Biopsy: Hypercellular bone marrow for age with extensive involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Severely decreased hematopoietic elements.
Lung bases demonstrate bilateral moderate pleural effusion and patchy opacities.
This could possibly be consolidation due to infection considering recent history of bacteremia.
B/L upper extrem U/S: In the left IJ, there is a focal area of increased echogenicity, adjacent to the wall, that may represent a nonocclusive thrombus.
Areas of focal dilation present in the right basilic vein.
There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
The band of linear density at the right lung base has resolved.
There is persistent opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle, most consistent with atelectasis.
There is atelectasis at the left lung base as well.
# Septic shock: After admission, she became febrile overnight to 103 and was started empirically on cefepime.
The following morning, she was noted to be hypotensive to 70s/30s and tachycardic to the low 100s.
DIC labs were sent on the floor and revealed elevated fibrinogen, no FDP.
She was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name **] for GNR sepsis without obvious source.
On transfer, she met criteria for SIRS/septic shock w/ fever, tachycardia and w/ septicemia and hypotension.
Per review of systems, etiology of her GNR septicemia is not entirely clear as she denies GI/urinary/respiratory symptoms that would suggest underlying infective source.
Given ANC of 170 and CLL, however, she is clearly immunocompromised and this perhaps may be translocation of bacteria from gut.
Afebrile since transfer.
She developed RLE edema, erythema and was seen by both ID and surgery, thought to be ecthyma gangrenosum.
This was followed by a similar progression of erythema, edema on her arms b/l, also thought to be related to her gram negative sepsis.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely etiology is allopurinol induced thrombocytopenia, however w/ anemia worse than baseline and new renal failure, TTP was a concern.
However, no evidence of hemolysis by labs nor on smear (reviewed by hem/onc team).
# Cellulitis: New area of bruising, erythema, warmth, and tenderness on medial aspect of R lower leg, noted on [**7-9**].
# Pleural effusions: CXR ([**7-8**]) showed b/l pleural effusions.
No complaints of SOB this AM.
- continue to monitor O2 sat - low threshold for more diuresis, pt is likely volume overloaded given aggressive fluid repletion on transfer to ICU .
# Acid/base: Initial ABG prior to ICU transfer revealed acute respiratory alkalosis.
was in trendelenberg) revealed respiratory acidosis and is likely [**12-29**] to position for central line given her known right hemidiaphragm paresis and raised hemidiaphragm.
Mildly low HCO3, borderline gap acidosis.
- check ABG if respiratory status changes .
# Hypercarbia: As above, likely in the setting of trendelenberg position for line placement and her probable paralyzed right diaphragm as no underlying pulmonary process, COPD to suggest as a cause and not hypoxic.
- as above, recheck ABG if clinically worsens .
# Elevated t bili: Elevated to 2.6 on [**7-7**] with otherwise normal transaminases.
Concern for early biliary obstruction picture.
No abdominal tenderness on exam or h/o GI symptoms.
W/ fluid overload, respiratory status will remain an issue w/ further need for transfusion.
# Acute renal failure: Now resolved.
Uric acid normalized.
# CLL: As above, neutropenic w/ ANC 170.
- f/u hem/onc recs .
# Hyponatremia: Now resolved.
Likely represented hypovolemic hyponatremia as urine lytes c/w prerenal/hypovolemic state and sodium has since normalized with aggressive IVFs.
