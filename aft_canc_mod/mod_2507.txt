Lung, right middle lobe, wedge resection (G-L): -  Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (0.6 cm).
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma, mixed subtypes:  The tumor is composed of predominantly bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main bronchus).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Note:  A focus of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma measuring 0.6 cm in maximum dimension is present in the right middle lobe (slide L).
No invasive carcinoma is noted in this focus.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2118-12-5**] and had a flexible bronchoscopy, video-assisted thoracic surgery mediastinal lymph node dissection, video-assisted thoracic surgery right upper lobe and right middle lobe wedge resection.
Intraoperatively, right upper lobectomy was aborted secondary to EKG changes and TEE hypokinesis.
She also had an episode of hypotension/bradycardia and was given atropine, neo and ephedrine.
Neuro: The patient initially received Dilaudid PCA with adequate pain control.
CV: Postoperatively, cardiac enzymes were cycled and monitored, and echo was performed, showing LVEF 25% with global hypokinesis.
She continued to be on pressors for hypotension until POD#2, after which she was stable and transferred to the floor.
Daily CXRs were done to monitor her pulmonary status throughout her hospital stay with no evidence of a pneumothorax by the time of her discharge.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge on POD#4, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
