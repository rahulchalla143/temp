The patient was in his USOH until approximately 3-4 months ago when he developed a cough productive of white sputum, severe left-sided chest pain radiating to his back, as well as progressive dyspnea on exertion.
He was seen multiple times in the [**Hospital6 6689**] ER and diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with courses of antitbiotics.
His symptoms progressed over the last several months and he lost his appetite and lost a significant amount of weight.
During his last visit on [**2141-8-24**], he had a Chest CT which revealed a left hilar mass with no mediastinal LAD.
The hilar mass was encasing and narrowing the left main pulmonary artery and multiple central bronchi and primary anterior branches.
He was admitted and underwent bronchoscopy on [**2141-9-1**] with biopsy that presumptively shows small cell lung CA.
He describes his chest pain as sharp [**11-14**] left-sided chest pain that he thought was from a heart attack, though this was ruled out.
This pain is non-exertional and radiates to his back and abdomen.
He also reports loss of appetite with a 32 pound weight loss in [**3-10**] months (from 150->118).
He also endorses nausea and vomiting, without hemetemesis.
He reports significant fatigue and generalized weakness.
Past Medical History: Recent stab wound to the head with hematoma HTN Deafness  Social History: Social Hx: The patient grew up in the [**Location (un) 86**] area, recently moved to [**Location (un) 6691**] nine months ago.
Family History: No lung diseases or cancer.

Post-obstructive airspace opacity - could reflect post-obstructive consolidation or though alveolar hemorrhage is not excluded (givne history of hemoptysis.
CT ([**Hospital1 **] MC [**2141-9-1**]): Known life hilar mass with question of lymphangitic spread, low attenuation in the liver, too small to characterize  Bronch ([**Hospital1 **] MC [**2141-9-1**]): Significant narrowing of the left mainstem bronchus by extrinsic compression, as well as mucosal thickening.
Mucosa in the LMB was thickend and erythematous and abnormal appearing.
EKG ([**Hospital1 18**]): Sinus tach at 100 bpm, normal axis, RAD, non-sig Q waves in III and aVF, slight ST elevations in V2-3   Brief Hospital Course: 41 yoM w/ 20 pk yr tob h/o, weight loss, night sweats, found to have large left hilar mass c/w SCLC.
ICU Course: #SCLC - Patient had bronchoscopy at OSH with biopsy consistent with SCLC on [**9-1**].
He had a bone scan with abnormal areas of increased tracer uptake in the posterior left parietal skull and right lateral 2nd rib.
He had an MRI of his head notable for multiple enhancing lesions within the brain consistent with metastatic disease.
He was seen by Pulmonary who suggested sending sputums for cytology and treating for postobstructive pna seen on f/u CXR.
Patient with squamous cell lung cancer with metastases to brain and pancreas.
Patient's treatment for squamous cell lung cancer was on hold due to his pancreatitis, ventilator requirement, and acute illness.
Given patient's continued pancreatitis, heme-onc was again consulted who recommended that chemotherapy would likely not be an option for this patient due to his continued illness.
# Pancreatitis - Patient had abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Found to have elevated amylase and lipase secondary most likely to pancreatic metastases of his primary tumor.
Given the continued elevated amylase and lipase, hematology-oncology did not believe chemotherapy would be an option for him.
CT abdomen show diffusely edematous and enlarged pancreas.
He started to develop respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirement(90% on 2L, 93% on 4L, 90% on FM and then 94% on NRB).
He was transferred to ICU for management of respiratory distress.
Medicine service hospital course after transfer from ICU on [**2141-9-29**]:  # Comfort measures only: patient not in distress,normal resp rate, did not check daily vitals Acetaminophen Haloperidol Lorazepam Morphine Sulfate, titrate to comfort Scopolamine Patch  # Respiratory failure s/p extubation in ICU, sats low prior to transfer  # SCLC No treatment options  # MRSA No antibiotics given goals of care.
