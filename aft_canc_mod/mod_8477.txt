q waves in inferior leads c/w old inferior MI.
Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe with reactive mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy.
These findings have progressively worsened since the earlier chest radiograph of [**2147-8-16**] and are highly concerning for pneumonia.
No definite masses are detected on this non-contrast study.
Small left pleural effusion.
Bilateral apical predominant centrilobular emphysema.
Findings concerning for left upper lobe pneumonia.
Suboptimal study for assessing for pneumothorax as the lung apices are excluded from the field of view.
Subsequent volume loss of the left lung, where the pre-existing perihilar opacity has not changed.
Newly appeared parenchymal opacity at the bases of the right upper lobe, potentially related to volume loss.
[**2147-9-1**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound: No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old man who presented with hemoptysis and transient hypotension with concern for lung mass.
A repeat flex bronch was performed bedside the following morning and no signs of active bleeding were present.
He continued to have a profound cough with scant amounts of rusty colored sputum.
With ambulation, he was noted to have desaturations to ~88%, quickly resolving after rest.
Nevertheless, it was felt best to discharge him with home oxygen as a temporizing measure - until he is able to clear his airways fully of old blood and secretions.
(As a note, pulmonary embolism was considered as an etiology for his hemoptysis and hypoxia - during this admission, lower extremity dopplers were done which were negative for DVT.
Furthermore, his oxygenation improved rapidly after transfer from the intensive care unit - in tandem with resolution of hemoptysis and clearing of secretions/old blood.
CTA was deferred even after his renal function improved because of his improving clinical status.
Furthermore, he would not be a candidate for anticoagulation given the recent episode of massive hemoptysis.)
He will need repeat CT imaging to assess for underlying cause for the bleeding.
# Acute Renal Failure: Felt to be secondary to pre-renal azotemia in setting of blood loss.
Felt to be secondary to muscle strain.
# Hypertension: Hypotensive on presentation requiring brief use of Levophed and phenylephrine (as above).
Community-acquired pneumonia  Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Hypertension 2.
Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
