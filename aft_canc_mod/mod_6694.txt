Admission Date:  [**2111-4-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia, New Leukemia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line Placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 42 yo woman with PMH significant for morbid obesity with gastric bypass 3 years ago as well as HTN and hyperlipidemia, who presents with acute leukemia.
Four weeks ago she started developing pain in her thighs that she describes as an achy, bony pain, with no associated trauma or swelling.
She saw her PCP who [**Name9 (PRE) 78036**] increased ESR, decreased platelets and abnormal electrolytes and recommended followup with Rheumatology.
Her pain did not improve with this regimen and instead spread to her arms and lower back.
Around this time (5 days prior to admission) she also started to notice a L sided chest pain, worse with taking deep breaths.
She denies fever, chills, difficulty breathing, diarrhea or any other symptoms over the past few weeks.
Chest CT showed multiple bilateral prominent axillary lymph nodes and air trapping, ground glass opacities and consolidations in the L lung.
She was evaluated by Infectious Disease who were concerned for atypical PNA v. viral illness and gave her Levaquin.

BONE MARROW [**2111-5-3**]: Markedly hypocellular marrow with features consistent with myeloablative chemotherapy effect .
The aspirate is paucispicular, however increased blasts and monocytic precursors are noted.
CD117 highlights early myeloid precursors in clusters comprising 30% of marrow cellularity.
Overall, the morphologic differential includes regenerating marrow versus residual disease and correlation with cytogenetic findings is recommended .
Bronchial cells, macrophages and small lymphocytes.
Numerous mature lymphocytes with occasional atypical   cells (see note).
Note:   Occasional larger cells are identified; the differential   diagnosis includes reactive lymphocyte vs. leukemic blast.
A definitive distinction is difficult with this preparation,   although reactive lymphocyte is favored.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
There is markedly abnormal/paradoxical septal motion/position.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a large pericardial effusion subtending primarily the right atrial and right ventricular free walls.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
The right atrial free wall and right ventricular free wall appear markedly thickened with marked acoustic enhancement and impaired contractile function, suggestive of an inflammatory or infiltrative process.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-4-20**], a large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are now present.
IMPRESSION: large pericardial effusion subtending the right atrial and right ventricular free walls; cardiac tamponade is present .
[**5-8**] ECHO Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The presence of abnormal septal motion can be seen shortly after an effusion is drained ("effusive-constrictive" physiology).
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 yo woman with PMH significant for morbid obesity with gastric bypass who presented from OSH ED with acute monocytic leukemia, she was treated with 7+3 and her course was complicated by pericardial tamponade and febrile neutropenia.
# Acute Leukemia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia and initiated 7+3 induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine which she tolerated well.
Day 14 bone marrow biopsy was delayed due to pericardial tamponade.
Day 16 bone marrow biopsy showed hypocellular marrow by report however on review of the slides, few early forms were seen.
Patient continued to have nightly fevers and blasts were seen on pheripheral smear.
# Pulmonary Infiltrates: CT scan obtained on admission showed bilateral pulmonary opacitities in an interestitial pattern which were concerning for infection vs. leukemic involvement.
Pulmonology was consulted and bronchoscopy was performed which was culture negative and did not reveal malignant cells.
Repeat CT scan showed resolution of pulmonary opacities.
# Pericardial Effusion: The patient developed a dramatic friction rub on the day after admission that was concern for effusion.
An initial ECHO showed a small perical cardial effusion and subsequent ECHO described the effusion as trivial.
On [**2111-5-1**] the friction rub was absent, EKG showed low voltage across the precordium.
Pulsus was 8mmHg repeat ECHO demonstrated tamponade physiology.
Cardiology performed pericardiocentesis which dropped right atrial pressure from 15 to 1 by draining 85 cc of pericardial fluid which was sent for viral, bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal culture.
Repeat TTE on [**2111-5-2**] showed resolution of tamponade physiology and normal systolic function.
The study also showed  possible thickening of the posterior parietal pericardium, with tethering of visceral and parietal surfaces consistent with constrictive pericarditis.
She had a cardiac MRI showing constrictive pericarditis, with a small circumfrential effusion, normal RV function though RV hypertrophy was noted.
Repeat ECHO showed no evidence of pericardial tamponade and findings consistent with constrictive pericarditis.
Constrictive pericarditis is expected to resolve without intervention in the coming months, no specific cause of the effusion was identified however malignancy vs viral etiology were considered most likely.
# Febrile Neutropenia: The patient developed a fever on day+5 of chemotherapy.
She was initially treated with Vancomycin and developed a rash she was then pre-medicated for subsequent doses which were tolerated without issue.
She was treated with Vancomycin and cefepime and continued to have low grade fevers.
Micafungin was added and low grade fevers continued.
CT Abd/Pelvis on [**5-2**] was performed for further infectious workup and showed bilateral pleural effusions and presacral soft tissue thickening without fluid collection which was of unclear significance.
Antibiotics were changed again to Voriconazole, meropenem, and vancomycin nad metronidazole.
She continued to have fevers to 101 and repeat CT scan showed resolution of soft tissue thickening and no other fluid collections or pulmonary findings.
Antibiotics were held and fevers resolved.
Given previous reaction to vancomycin, this medication may have been the source of prolonged fevers.
At the time of discharge, she as afebrile >36 hours.
This failed to prevent menstrual cycle and was discontinued to lower thrombotic risk.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute monocytic leukemia .
Constrictive pericarditis Febrile neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with leg pain, pneumonia and abnormal blood counts.
You were found to have acute myelogenous leukemia and were treated with chemotherapy you had a repeat bone marrow biopsy prior to being discharged and the results are pending.
While your white blood cell count was low, you developed fevers and were treated with antibiotics, no source of fever was identified and the antibiotics were stopped.
It will be important for you to increase your intake of red meat and foods high in protein and phosphorous (meat, grains, nuts) while your body makes new cells to replace the cells destroyed by chemotherapy.
