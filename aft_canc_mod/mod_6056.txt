Pleasant, comfortable, NAD but inappropriately jovial affect; oriented to [**Location (un) 86**] and hospital but thinks it's "[**Location (un) 8599**]Hospital," and [**2077**], though he knows it's [**Month (only) 404**].
S1, S2, RRR, no m/r/g PULM: CTAB ABD: +BS, soft, NT, ND, no palpable mass.
EXT: + clubbing; no LE edema NEURO: Orientation as above.
No orbiting, no pronator drift.
Sensation intact to light touch in LE and UE b/l, no extinction with b/l stimuli.
+ Fine, high frequency tremor in hands b/l.
No difficulty with rapid alternating movements.
Mild dysmetria with finger to nose b/l but appropriate to age.
CT Head [**2158-1-2**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Symmetric large size of the ventricular system and prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces is chronic and unchanged compared to [**2157-4-20**], compatible with involutional change.
Approximately 9 x 3-mm focal hyperdensity along the falx cerebri is unchanged and likely a small meningioma.
The small focus of hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe corresponding to susceptibility artifact on the recent MR study is less conspicuous on today's examination.
There are small mucus-retention cysts in both maxillary sinuses.
No concerning osseous or surrounding soft tissue abnormality.
[**1-3**] EGD Ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus (biopsy).
Erythema and congestion in the first part of the duodenum compatible with mild duodenitis.
Small hiatal hernia.
[**1-5**] COLONOSCOPY: Findings:  Lumen: Evidence of a previous side to side ileo-colonic anastomosis was seen at the hepatic flexure.
# Melena/UGIB:  No coagulopathy identified.
Was kept NPO and GI performed EGD in the ICU, which showed large ulceration at GE junction with no active bleeding, and duodenitis.
The patient was transfused one additional unit of PRBCs on the general medical floor on [**1-4**] and underwent prep for Colonoscopy.
The colonoscopy showed evidence of a previous side to side ileo-colonic anastomosis at the hepatic flexure, with normal colonic mucosa in the whole colon.
On the medical floor he remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of recurrent bleeding, hematocrit 29, tolerating a regular diet.
# Episodes of tremor/facial droop:  ?
TIA or watershed infarcts in setting of decreased Hct.
No neurologic findings on exam to indicate stroke; no mass effect or bleed on CT Head.
No recurrence while on medical floor.
While he may indeed have cerebrovascular disease, further evaluation (eg carotid dopplers) were deferred for now, as he is not a candidate for aspirin or Plavix in the setting of his acute GI bleed.
It was d/c'd on the floor on [**1-4**], no further issues.
# H/o PE: L lower lobe segmental and subsegmental PE.
Previously on coumadin, but not currently anticoagulated at home due to fall risk and now due to active bleeding issues.
# History of colon cancer: colonoscopy negative [**2153**]; no active treatment, and with source for GIB identified, a bleeding tumor is unlikely to be the etiology for his presentation.
# Dementia: Mild mixed Alzheimer and vascular.
TSH elevated at 13, no changes made to regimen given acute problems.
