When EMS evaluated the patient at 8:05 he was nonverbal with right facial droop and questionable right arm weakness.
Twenty minutes later the patient had a grand tonic-clonic seizure in the transport vehicle and the patient's blood glucose was reported at 207 at the time.
The patient had full body CT's notable for chronic bilateral frontal subdural hygromas and nasal bone fracture.
once daily dose of Dilantin with stable vital signs and thereafter was transferred to the Neurology Service for further management and etiology of his new grand tonic-clonic seizure.
The patient notes that four to five weeks ago on further history that he had a traumatic fall which may account for bilateral subdural collection.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Low grade prostate cancer in [**2183-1-16**] with no treatment.
Recurrent invasive melanoma of the mid back status post excision in [**2176**] and [**2180**].
Carries all ADLs without assistance.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  He had periorbital hematomas.
Anicteric sclerae.
NECK:  Supply, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal S1/S2 with regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
PULMONARY:  Revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Although he did have a 1 cm open lesion on the left anterior calf.
The patient did not have any signs of ............, apraxia or calculation on cranial nerve exam.
On motor exam the patient had 4/5 strength throughout the upper and lower extremities in a symmetric fashion with normal tone and bulk without adventitious movements.
The patient did have decreased vibration in both lateral extremities.
The patient on reflexes had [**12-21**] reflexes bilaterally with upgoing toes bilaterally.
Dip stick urinalysis on admission showed large blood but no evidence of any urinary tract infection.
The patient did have elevated creatinine of 1.7 on admission which normalized to 1.2 prior to discharge presumably secondary due to rhabdomyolysis which was cleared with intravenous fluid hydration.
The patient had an elevated CPK 254 on admission.
Initial CT showed hemispheric bilateral chronic collections which at that time were supposed to be either subdural hematomas or hygromas, magnetic resonance scan later during the admission confirmed they were hygromas and not subdermal hematomas.
CT abdomen and pelvis performed on admission showed no traumatic organ injury or intra-abdominal hematoma.
CT of the orbit showed a nasal bone fracture with air fluid levels within the maxillary sinuses, no other fractures identified.
The patient had magnetic resonance scan of head on [**2185-9-23**] showing no acute definite evidence of acute brain ischemia and questionable hemorrhagic elements within the left side subdural fluid collection.
Multivariate regression analysis showed moderate stenosis involving the precavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery with presenting atherosclerotic disease.
There are no other areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or alteration.
A repeat head CT on [**9-24**] showed stable appearance of bilateral subdural fluid collections with higher attenuation of left cerebral collection than right.
The patient was scheduled to have magnetic resonance scan with contrast and susceptibility imaging during this admission but refused as he was anxious during the initial magnetic resonance scan and promised to follow-up as an outpatient after getting open magnetic resonance scan with primary care physician and neurology clinic.
The patient was transitioned from Dilantin to Keppra during the admission for seizure prophylaxis.
The etiology of the patient's seizures were unresolved at the time of discharge as they could be due to bilateral subdural hydroma collection or possible metastatic melanoma involving cerebrum.
The patient was informed that it would be to his advantage to have magnetic resonance scan with contrast and susceptibility imaging while he was an inpatient, but due to his anxiety during the first magnetic resonance scan the patient refused this test on three occasions and promised to have test preformed as outpatient with appropriate follow-up.
The patient had no more seizures during the admission and was placed back on his diabetes medication with Oxybutynin and chloride as patient was having urinary difficulties in the two days prior to discharge.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was ask to follow-up with Plastic Surgery Clinic on [**2185-10-4**] for suture removal.
The patient was also given a prescription to obtain outpatient head magnetic resonance scan in open setting so that the patient does not become anxious during this admission and refused closed myocardial infarction.
Electroencephalogram performed on [**2185-9-23**] showed abnormal electroencephalograms in awake and drowsy states consistent with encephalopathy but no focal epileptiform discharges.
