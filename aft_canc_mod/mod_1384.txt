Of note, the patient had partial amputation of his right great toe, caused by vasulopathy.
The patient thinks he may have had some dark stools earlier in the week.
He denies pain, chest pain, dyspnea, hematemesis of known history of liver disease, but states that he has been drinking since he was 16 years old.
CXR was negative for acute process and CT head revealed no .
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was resting comfortably and had no complaints.
He was being prepared for endscopy  Past Medical History: -Peripheral arterial disease -Diabetes -Hypertension -Hep C -Urinary retention requiring straight cath at home{has refused TURP} -hx of GI bleed with resolving [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear -ETOH abuse(active) -Dyslipidemia -Right superficial femoral artery and tibioperoneal trunk stenting for nonhealing hallux ulcer.

superficial abrasion over right knee.
No evidence of acute disease.
Newly apparent nodular focus projecting along the right lower lung, probably a nipple shadow, although a pulmonary nodule should be considered.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No evidence of retroperitoneal or intramuscular hematoma.
Left adrenal hypoattenuating mass is likely an adenoma.
Multiple bladder diverticula.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease and coronary artery disease.
Old right posterior rib fractures and anterior wedge compression of L2 and multilevel lumbar degenerative disease.
EGD [**2121-3-27**]: Impression: Small hiatal hernia Mild erythema and friability in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Serial hcts, monitor stool output; consider extraluminal blood losses given recent femoral puncture.
Would consider non-urgent colonoscopy prior to d/c if within patient wishes and no extraluminal bleeding site localized.
Would discuss [**Month/Day/Year 4532**]/aspirin with vascular surgery.
Given overall well appearance of the patient, would seem in favor of continuing if stent high risk for occlusion.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
No nodular opacity along the right lower lung is currently demonstrated, most likely reflecting nipple shadow on the prior examination.
Colonoscopy [**2121-3-31**]: Polyp in the proximal ascending colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the distal ascending colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the hepatic flexure (polypectomy, endoclip) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, Mallroy [**Doctor Last Name **] tear, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes who presents with confusion, weakness and hypotension, susequently found to a large hematocrit drop.
His anemia and episode of hypotension was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from a GI bleed.
GI performed an endoscopy which showed gastric erythema and friability, but no obvious source of GI bleed.
Because he had recently undergone stenting of peripheral artery, a retroperitoneal bleed remained on the differential.
CT of abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of RP bleed.
After contacting his vascular surgeon, his [**Name (NI) **] continued to be held in the setting of a likely lower GI bleed.
Colonoscopy showed 3 polyps but no active bleeding.
# Presumed urinary tract infection: The patient has a history of urinary retention requiring straight catheterization.
His urinalysis in the ICU was suggestive of infection so he was started on ceftriaxone therapy.
Urine culture showed mixed bacteria growth, without evidence of UTI.
# Urinary retention: Continued home tamsulosin.
# Incidentalomas: Left adrenal adenoma.
Multiple bladder diverticula Old right posterior rib fxs.
- Patient should have dermatology follow up for two skin lesions noted on his upper back - F/u GI biopsies.
daily  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life for Home Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal bleed Secondary Diagnosis: Peripheral Vascular Disease s/p stent placement Alcohol Abuse Diabetes Skin lesions   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you were feeling weak and were found to have very low blood levels.
You had a scope of your upper and and lower intestinal tract which showed polyps but no active bleeding.
You did not have any further episodes of bleeding and your blood counts improved during your time in the hospital.
