HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a previously healthy 77-year-old male with a T3,N0,M0 cancer of his right vocal cord.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was significant only for a previous left vocal cord biopsy as well as a Port-A-Cath placement.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
His oral mucosa showed no obvious lesions.
Findings included no gross extension of the tumor to the inferior incision of the tracheostomy.
There were no complications at that time.
There was a question of a lung nodule on the patient's chest CT scan.
The surgeons recommended a follow up CT scan in four to six weeks after laryngectomy, just to rule out postoperative changes.
They continued to work with the patient on a daily basis and his speech and swallowing techniques.
Of note, clinically the patient had no evidence of fistula at this time.
