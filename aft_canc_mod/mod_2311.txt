Spinal MR from [**2148-12-1**] showed multiple areas of metastatic disease in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine.
No evidence of cord compression.
Mild pathologic compression fracture of T3 and T6, bilateral small pleural effusions.
Pulmonary:  The patient was in moderate respiratory distress on arrival with an O2 sat of 80% on room air that increased to 94% on 4 liters.
The patient was also given significant amount of narcotics as well as benzodiazepines for pain and anxiety.
The patient became more lethargic and arterial blood gases showed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The patient did well with multiple Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers.
A chest CT showed large bolus emphysema.
