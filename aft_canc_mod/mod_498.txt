Low lung volumes.
Shrunken, nodular, and echogenic liver most consistent with cirrhosis.
Assessment for mass lesions is difficult and follow up / CT is recommended 2.
Occluded main portal vein, with no visualizable color flow.
Limited evaluation for intrahepatic masses, but echogenic focus in the region of the portal vein could suggest an intrahepatic mass.
Suitable spot for paracentesis was marked in the left lower quadrant, to be performed by the clinical team.

The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
