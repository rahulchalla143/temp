She subsequently underwant an FNA on [**2126-4-25**] that revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Surgery was complicated by recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.
Pathology revealed multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma.
At the time of surgery, extensive local disease was identified with residual tumor on the left thyroid bed and mediastinum engulfing local vascular structures and the trachea.
She was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further debulking of mediastinal disease.

Pertinent Results: Swallow study [**2126-8-24**] INDICATION: Status post sternotomy for metastatic thyroid cancer.
STUDY: Oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation.
Thin liquid, nectar thick liquid, puree consistency barium, and a cookie coated with barium were orally administered.
The patient demonstrated piecemeal behavior by dividing up boluses into multiple swallows regardless of size of consistency of the bolus.
There was subsequent premature spillover into the valleculae.
However, consecutive sips of fluid from the cup did not exhibit piecemeal behavior, suggesting possible action secondary to anxiety for aspiration.
There is no evidence for esophageal leak.
All consistencies demonstrated free passage into the stomach, without gross esophageal injury.
There is no evidence for aspiration.
IMPRESSION: Peacemeal swallowing but no evidence for aspiration.
There has been improvement of the right-sided pleural effusion and the left-sided pleural effusion appears worse.
There is also a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
There is atelectasis seen within the right suprahilar region.
