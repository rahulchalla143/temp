Admission Date:  [**2114-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-1-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-1-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Brochoscopy Intubation Selective embolization of bronchial circulation x2 Central venous catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 64 y.o.
man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA, non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for hemoptysis.
Pt was admitted there on [**12-28**] for febrile neutropenia.
On day of admission, pt noted himself to be febrile to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with some blood tinged sputum.
He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss over 2 weeks.
A bronchosopy was performed which showed a large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active bleeding.
3) non-small cell adenoCA of lung (RUL): Diagnosed after hemoptysis in [**9-13**] and subsequent biopsy by bronch; failed resection in '[**12**], now treated with XRT and chemo (taxol and carboplatin).
4) h/o salmonella sepsis: pt now on chronic levaquin.
Occassional social EtOH.
OP with ETT and OGT--no obvious lesions Neck: no JVD Lungs: decreased BS on right CV: RRR, nml S1S2, no mrg Abd: soft, mildly distended, NT, naBS Ext: chronic venous stasis hyperpig of b/l LE without edema, cords.
Back: mild diffuse blancing erythema; no focal lesions.
man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA, non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for hemoptysis.
He was admitted to OSH on [**12-28**] with fever and borderline neutropenia; he was started on levofloxacin for ?
He developed massive hemoptysis and was transferred here intubated.
On day of admission to the OSH, pt noted himself to be febrile to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with some blood tinged sputum.
He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss over 2 weeks PTA.
A bronchosopy was performed which showed a large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active bleeding.
Multiple attempts to control the bleeding via selective embolization were undertaken, and tenuous hemostasis was acheived.
The patient, who had been intubated for airway protection, was extubated without incident and suffered no respiratory failure.
He had arrived with fever and neutropenia from the OSH, and vanco/caspo/cefepime broad coverage was initiated.
Although the patient was stabilized via multiple bronchoscopies and interventional radiologic procedures, rebleeding remains a significant risk, and little could be done if another catastrophic bleed were to develop.
However, with persistent Neupogen dosing the patient's ANC and total leukocyte counts gradually increased into a non-neutropenic state.
He was continued on vanc/cefepime/caspo until ANC > 1000, then all were discontinued since the patient had remained afebrile for > 48 hours and had persistently negative culture data.
Hemoptysis: Recently extubated, with stable Hct and no visible hemoptysis.
CT surgery has evaluated patient and would only take back to the OR if massive bleeding recurs.
Patient will likely suffer recurrent bleeding and hemoptysis despite our best efforts.
Follow pulmonary exam and VS for signs of decompensation.
-- Hct slow decrease over past week, may be [**1-11**] decreased production.
No signs of active bleeding.
Hemolysis labs negative.
Fever/Neutropenia: Cause of neutropenia remains obscure, definitely a component of chemo-induced neutropenia, but also a possible component of HCL relapse.
NSCLC and HCL: Large tumor burden.
Chemo has been d/c'd due to pancytopenia.
-- Appreciate Heme/onc recommendations, unsure if palliative chemo/rads would be indicated.
Certainly chemo could not be undertaken right now due to low blood counts.
-- Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] after discharge -- No filgrastim for now as above -- Morphine PRN for pain .
Been on therapy since [**Month (only) 462**] or [**2113-9-9**], started after low grade fevers and cough with positive PPD.
No intervention would be warranted at this time as pressures appear normal and no evidence of shunting with saline contrast.
Due to strong cancer history, concern for LE DVTs.
-- R popliteal DVT seen on [**1-16**], very distal with no proximal extension -- *** This should be followed up in 1 week to assess for proximal extension *** -- Patient would be an extremely poor candidate for anticoagulation .
Patient with likely ICU delirium, fluctuant mental status.
Prostate CA: History of prostate CA s/p radiation treatment in [**2112**].
Patient reports significant urinary frequency/hesitancy at home.
Dysuria: Developed dysuria [**1-14**].
Diarrhea: New onset of diarrhea over weekend, moderate in severity.
Have sent for c. diff, would be at risk for this given recent ICU stay and broad spectrum antibiotics.
-- C. diff negative.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Non-small cell lung carcinoma Massive hemoptysis .
Secondary Diagnosis: Hairy cell leukemia Prostate cancer   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating adequate PO, pain well managed.
Discharge Instructions: If you experience fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, increasing pain, or any other concerning symptoms, contact your physician or return to the emergency room.
