He has been feeling dyspneic for 1-2 weeks prior to presentation accompanied by epigastric pain that radiated to his back.
Patient initially thought the pain was coming from his gallbladder - he requested a RUQ U/S from his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] which a mass was discovered in his liver.
CT with po and IV contrast was then obtained to better define the mass and confirmed a large mass in his left lobe.
He underwent EGD that showed a mass in the cardia.
Per patient's report, the biopsy of the mass was nondiagnostic, however he was told it was likely a leiomyosarcoma based on the location.
However, before that could happen, he had an episode of melena and felt lightheaded.
GI performed EGD and it revealed a 6 cm submucosal lesion with 3 areas of ulceration.
Lives with his wife who is his HCP.

Large heterogeneously enhancing mass predominantly centered about the fundus of the stomach as detailed above with overall features concerning for GIST tumor.
Three heterogeneously enhancing masses within the liver as detailed above with a large left hepatic mass resulting in replacement and expansion of the left lobe, and discrete masses within segments V and VI of the liver, concerning for metastasis.
[**2177-3-4**] XR L hip: No metastatic disease.
Technically successful percutaneous targeted biopsy of liver mass under real-time ultrasound guidance.
[**2177-3-1**] EGD: Large subepithelial mass with three deep cratered ulcers were noted in the gastric cardia - these ulcers are not amenable to endoscopic therapy.
