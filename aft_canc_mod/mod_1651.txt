Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 83 yo f w/ a hx/of htn, OA and myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with c/o severe right leg and knee pain since tuesday.
Pain became intolerable despite oxycodone and tramadol and pt was brought by family to ED.
She was found to have a RLE DVT and started on lovenox.
On [**7-12**], she was transferred to the MICU after nausea, vomiting, respiratory distress and multifocal pneumonia.
Had CTA of torso that showed a chronic PE and multifocal pneumonia and CT abdomen showed ileus.
MICU [**Location (un) **] COURSE  # Hypoxia: The original thought by the floor team prior to transfer was PE given that the patient was admitted for DVT.
She was sent for a CTA which showed what was read as chronic PE and a multifocal PNA.
This on top of her chronic pleural effusion are the likely reasons for her hypoxia.
For the PE and h/o DVT, the patient had originally started lovenox, however given her MDS and the dropping platelet count, we had to stop the anticoagulation.
Currently hemodynamically stable, however, so no shock.
# Abdominal Distension: ABd ct read shows ileus vs partial obstruction.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia in setting of fever, right knee pain, and PE.
We did a TTE which showed no RV strain.
# MDS: Has 11 blasts (highest to date) and 22 bands concerning for progression of disease.
ON RETURN TO THE FLOOR: Once fever came down, tachycardia improved.
For multifocal pneumonia, pt was on vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin (planning for 10 day course); tobramycin d/c'ed on [**7-17**].
MICU team spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] who wanted a permanent IVC filter placed instead of anticoagulation due to her thrombocytopenia and risk of bleeding.
Leg pain was significantly improved and pt was advancing diet as tolerated.
Pt continued to spike low grade fevers in the evenings which were controlled with tylenol but no infectious source could be identified; may be related to MDS.
Pt also had diarrhea after agressive treatment of her ileus but this improved with time and pt was C diff negative x3.
Echo showed no vegetations and nl EF.

Secondary: Ileus Multifocal pneumonia Transfusion dependent Myelodysplastic Syndrome   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for severe left leg pain in the knee area.
Because you had an allergy to coumadin, you were treated with lovenox.
You also experienced recurring fevers while you where in the hospital.
