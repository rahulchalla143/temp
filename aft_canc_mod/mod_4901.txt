Mood, affect appropriate, pleasant, conversant, able to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] in reverse w/o difficulty.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with JVP to jaw sitting upright CARDIAC: RRR, III/VI HSM at LLSB LUNGS: Decreased BS in right base and crackles in left base ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
+HJR EXTREMITIES: 3+ pitting edema to knee bilaterally SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Evaluation is limited given the low lung volumes and the patient's kyphotic and slightly rotated positioning.
There is a single-lead pacer device projecting over the left chest wall with single lead tip terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
There is a large right pleural effusion with probable atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes.
There is a rounded density projecting over the left lower lung, which could represent a prominent nipple shadow.
No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion with probable collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, though infection in the right lower lung cannot be entirely excluded.
Probable nipple shadow accounting for rounded density projecting over the left lower lung.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Pleural fluid cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS; CONSISTENT WITH ADENOCARCINOMA .
CXR: FINDINGS: Right pleural effusion has decreased in size following thoracentesis, with residual moderate effusion remaining.
No visible pneumothorax, but extreme right lung apex is partially obscured by the flexed position of the patient's chin and neck.
Asymmetrical airspace process within the right mid and lower lung could potentially represent reexpansion pulmonary edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.
On the left, a small pleural effusion is unchanged, but retrocardiac atelectasis has worsened.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with dCHF p/w worsening SOB and LE over last 3 weeks with increasing O2 requirements whose hospital course included aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt, pacemaker exchange, and transfer to the CCU for increasing respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: After pacemaker exchange, the patient required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation to oxygenate properly with hypercarbia to the 90s.
Her respiratory issues were multi-factorial: (1) large plerual effusion, with a thoracentesis that showed malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma and minimal symptomatic relief.
(2) Severe pulmonary hypertension with markedly reduced right ventricular function.
(3) Likely intrinsic lung disease.
Initial echocardiogram findings were suspicious for a PE given the level of RV failure, but this was felt to be a progression of her pulmonary hypertension.
# CHF exacerbation with hypotension: Though she was volume overloaded on exam from heart failure, she could not tolerate any appreciable diuresis due to her low blood pressures, requiring increasing amount of peripheral dopamine for support.
She was unable to maintain her pressures without dopamine, as multiple attempts at weaning were unsucessful.
AM cortisol was appropriately elevated, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
# 3rd degree heart block s/p pacemaker placement: Patient had 3rd degree AV block on admission.
Given CHF symptoms and declining respiratory status at home, it was though this may be due to AV dysynchrony and the decision was made to upgrade her pacer to a BiV pacemaker.
EP replaced the pacemaker, but the patient's respiratory status required CCU transfer and her cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities did not allow for any true resolution of her symptoms despite a well-functioning pacer.
