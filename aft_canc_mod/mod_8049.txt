Admission Date:  [**2154-9-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-9-26**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, rectal cancer status post partial colectomy and chemoradiation, who was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 14430**] on [**8-18**] with left lower extremity pain.
He was treated with intravenous antibiotics but had continued left lower extremity pain and was treated with a left below-knee amputation.
Postoperative course has been complicated by confusion contributed to the levofloxacin which was changed to ceftazidime.
Since his discharge from [**Hospital6 **] he has noted worsening dysphagia as well as odynophagia with both solids and liquids as well as postprandial vomiting beginning approximately five to six days prior to admission.
He has also noted an approximately 15-pound weight loss over the past month as well as increased fatigue and decreased appetite.
On the day prior to admission he was noted to have guaiac-positive stools which progressed to frank melena.
He had three episodes of melena on the day prior to admission.
He denied any palpitations, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.
The patient has also had a recent Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection and was started on ciprofloxacin on [**2154-9-20**].
An nasogastric lavage was noted to have a red aspirate which cleared after 600 cc of saline.
In the Emergency Department he continued to have active melena.
The patient had also noted some loose stools that were black in appearance over the past month.
Coronary artery disease, status post 4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2143**].
Left femoral tibial bypass in [**2147-9-26**].
Carotid endarterectomy, cerebrovascular accident in [**2141**] with multiple transient ischemic attacks.
Bilateral cataract surgery.
Congestive heart failure.
Left below-knee amputation in [**2154-7-27**].
Atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin.
Esophageal stricture, status post dilation times two.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, this is an elderly man in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
No thyromegaly.
Heart was irregularly irregular with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal border.
Lungs had decreased breath sounds, diffusely mild crackles at the bases.
No palpable masses.
Right lower extremity were without any edema.
Mild intention tremor.
Urine culture showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
There was symmetric thickening of the distal esophagus with extension into the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were identified, multiple subcentimeter AP window nodes were also noted.
There was significant right hilar lymphadenopathy.
There were small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
There were multiple subcentimeter lymph nodes about the celiac axis.
Barium swallow revealed a shelf-like mass seen in the distal esophagus and appeared to extend into the proximal stomach causing mucosal irregularity.
There also appeared to be a filling defect proximal to this mass.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with impression of mucosa was salmon colored, suggestive of [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus.
A large fungating mass with evidence of recent bleeding and malignant in appearance was found at the middle third of the esophagus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 79-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer two years ago, status post resection and chemotherapy and radiation therapy, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post recent left below-knee amputation, who presented with dysphagia, odynophagia, and melena.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was felt to be having an active upper gastrointestinal bleed and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He was transfused a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells, and his elevated INR was reversed with 1 mg subcutaneous of vitamin K.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on hospital day two which revealed a large fungating mass at the level of the middle esophagus as above.
Given his recent elevated INR no tissue biopsy was obtained at this time.
Chest and abdominal CT scan revealed multiple areas of lymphadenopathy in the hilar and mediastinal areas as well as the celiac area.
Barium swallow showed a distal shelf-like mass as above.
He was felt to be hemodynamically stable and with no further episodes of melena and was transferred to the medicine floor.
Because the brush biopsy was nondiagnostic, a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was scheduled with plans for a tissue biopsy.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On admission he was continued on Flagyl for a Clostridium difficile colitis, and ciprofloxacin for a Pseudomonas positive urinary tract infection.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  After endoscopy, he was started on a pureed liquid diet which he tolerated without difficulty.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The [**Hospital 228**] medical status was discussed in detail with him, and the patient wished to have no further interventions done.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of rectal cancer.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed with evidence of esophageal mass.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive urinary tract infection.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
