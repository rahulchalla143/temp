She was taken to the operating room on day of admission by Orthopedics for open reduction internal fixation of right both column acetabular fracture and examination of hip under anesthesia after fixation.
Her facial fractures were evaluated by Plastics and were managed non operatively.
She was also seen by Ophthalmology per recommendation of Plastics to assess for entrapment given her orbital fracture and none identified.
She was noted to have delirium tremors and was started on IV benzodiazepines per CIWA protocol.
She was transferred to the regular nursing unit on about HD # 5 and was there less than 24 hours when she had to be transferred back to the ICU because of increased tachycardia felt related to her withdrawal symptoms and also because of increased agitation.
While she was beginning to show some mild improvements as far as her mental status and behaviors were concerned she was still quite delirious.
She sustained a fall while attempting to get out of bed to go to bathroom.
As a result she caused further injury to her pelvis and had to be taken back to the operating room by Orthopedics for revision of both column acetabular fracture fixation.
It was felt that the thrombocytosis was likely reactive; possibly due to trauma, inflammation or blood loss and it was recommended to continue to monitor her platelet counts, monitor for any signs of clotting, and to continue the 325 mg of aspirin daily.
Because she was without insurance the application for Mass Health was initiated; the approval for this insurance can take up to 90 days.
Initially patient and her boyfriend agreed with this plan.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO once a day as needed for constipation.

DO NOT blow your nose as this generates increased pressure on your facial fractures.
Return to the Emergency room if you develop any fevers, chills, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased redness/drainage/pus from your incision (s) and/or any otehr symptoms that are concerning to you.
