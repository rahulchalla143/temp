He presented initially to OSH on [**12-24**], noted to have thrombocytopenia to 25 with elevated BUN/Cr and was discharged home on doxycycline.
Because of persistent fevers, he presented again to an OSH on [**12-26**].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued fevers to 105, hypotension requiring pressors despite 6L fluid resuscitation.
Parasite smear showed babesia parasitemia to >10%.
He underwent exchange transfusion for parasitemia >10%, with repeat smear showing 2%.
He had one episode of hypotension following exchange transfusion which responded to 500cc fluid bolus.
Reports that his thoughts are clearer, able to articulate better, general malaise has decreased as has pain in joints.
He still has slight residual pain in neck, and is now complaining of "voluntary hallucinations".

A four-fold rise in IgG titers between acute and convalescent samples and/or the presence of IgM antibody against E. chaffeensis suggest recent or current infection.

HGE is distinct and separate from Human Moncytic Ehrlichiosis (HME), caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis.
Serologic crossreactivity between A. phagocyto- philum and E. Chaffeensis is minimal (5-15%).
There is a moderate bibasilar opacification and small pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are no new focal opacities concerning for pneumonia.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There are osseous changes compatible with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
Bibasilar opacification likely atelectasis and effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old male with past medical history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (s/p CHOP, now in remission) who has had weekly tick bites and chronically on doxycycline until two months ago with history of two possible prolonged tick bites with one of them a deer tick.
He presents with two week history of malaise and five day history of high grade fever, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, anemia with possible hemolysis along with hypotension not responsive to IVF resuscitation requiring pressors.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Severe Babesiosis: Thrombocytopenia/transaminitis/fever/anemia/hemolytic anemia with history of tick bite is consistent with severe babesiosis in immunocompromised patient with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p chemotherapy who presented with fever, myalgias, hemoglobinuria, jaundice with transaminitis, hemolytic anemia.
He was treated with clindamycin 600 mg IV q8 and quinine 650 mg po q6 for severe babesiosis as well as doxycycline 100 mg po BID for other co-infections with tick borne illness.
He was continued on doxycycline until ehrlichiosis returned negative, at which time the ID team recommended stopping the doxycycline.
There was concern that quinine may have been the cause of his hallucination so he was switched to atovaquone.
This was attributed to his severe babesiosis infection.
He was not started on heparin SQ given concern for bleeding with severe thrombocytopenia.
# transaminitis: Pt also presented with significant transaminitis with ALT 777, AST 838, LDH 2399, and total bili 3.9.
This trended down throughout his hospitalization, though still remained elevated from baseline at time of discharge.
# vertigo: Pt has had issues with vertigo in the past.
This appeared to be exacerbated by his acute illness.
Pt should follow up with physical therapy as an outpatient for treatment of chronic vertigo.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Please evaluate and treat, pt with recent diagnosis of babesiosis.
Has history of vertigo.
However, during your hospital stay, you developed hallucinations and hearing impairment, possibly due to quinine.
