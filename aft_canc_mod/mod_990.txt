The patient reported that his abdominal pain was increasing in severity, persisting for a longer amount of time and was more intense.
He reported that the pain was associated with bowel movements.
Neck:  Supple without lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Irregular with a loud S1 and II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen:  Diffusely tender with diminished bowel sounds.
Atrial fibrillation for years, resistant to cardioversion.
[**2108**], inferior myocardial infarction with angioplasty time two.
[**2114**], cerebrovascular accident times two.
Congestive heart failure.
[**2117-5-2**], myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and rib fractures.
[**2117-5-2**], patient found to have a solitary lung nodule.
An abdominal CT showed no bowel wall thickening; it did show dilated loops of bowel and no diverticulosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular service with a presumptive diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia.
He underwent an abdomen angiogram on [**2117-10-10**] and had angioplasty of his superior mesenteric artery, with decreased abdominal pain.
On [**2117-10-12**], the patient was seen by the thoracic surgery service because he had been previously noted to have a left upper lobe lesion by chest x-ray in [**2117-5-2**].
A CT scan revealed a T2N2 left upper lobe lesion and possible right rib metastases on recent bone scan.
On [**2117-10-14**], the patient complained of increasing abdominal pain and was found to have evidence of obstruction.
On [**2117-10-19**], the patient was noted to have an increased respiratory rate to 30 and rales on examination, which was treated with albuterol nebulizers with some relief.
A chest x-ray revealed mild congestive heart failure.
He was ruled out with cyclic cardiac enzymes.
On [**2117-10-24**], the patient was started on vancomycin and, by [**2117-10-25**], the patient was noted to be much improved, feeling well, with decreased shortness of breath.
He still had a cough which was productive of clear sputum.
He denied fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
He was tolerating a small amount of oral intake, but this was limited secondary to his oxygen needs.
Please note that the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was in order to allow utilizing continuous positive airway pressure to improve oxygenation and gain alveolar recruitment.
His heart rate was 85 in atrial fibrillation.
He reported that he felt okay, although he appeared to be in mild respiratory distress.
He was afebrile with stable vital signs.
This was recommended secondary to a rare occurrence of amiodarone causing pulmonary infiltrates in an acute manner.
He reported that he had had a good previous night, with no complaints.
His pneumonia appeared to be clinically improving and he had a decreased oxygen requirement.
On [**2117-10-29**], postoperative day 15 and hospital day 19, the patient was doing very well, with no complaints.
He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable.
On postoperative day 17, hospital day 21, the patient was doing well, with no complaints.
