Admission Date:  [**2117-7-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-7-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-1-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Aleve  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9598**] Chief Complaint: Tachypnea, tachycardia and suspected PE.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R Thoracentesis pleurex catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 48 yoF with metastic Breast CA, now presents with worsening dyspnea.
Over past 2 weeks has had worsening SOB with minimal activity and sometimes at rest, which has acutely worsened over the past 3 days.
Has had intermittent HA, but no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, dysuria or change in bowel habits.
Also has had intermittent left-sided chest tightness that resolves with lorazepam.
No evidence of pneumonia.
A CT head was done prior to anticoagulation, as PE was high in the differential, (given her history of metastatic breast CA) and it revealed a new 7 mm mass possibly metastasis vs vascular lesion.
A CTA with gadolinium was performed that revealed no acute PE or aortic pathology.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Metastatic Breast Cancer a.
First primary: Stage I (T1C, N0, M0) 1.5 cm, ER positive, infiltrating ductal carcinoma diagnosed in [**2100**].
She underwent lumpectomy, 5 cycles of adjuvant CMF and radiation.
In [**10/2107**], diagnosed second primary, stage II B (T3, Nx, M0) 6 cm, grade III, ER positive, HER/2-neu negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast.
c.  Diagnosed with recurrent disease involving the left chest wall 01/[**2110**].
Last mammogram was of right breast on [**2115-1-7**]: No evidence of malignancy.
g.  Malignant pleural effusion diagnosed [**2116-9-16**] during diagnostic thoracentesis.
h.  s/p left VATS pericardial window as well as a talc pleurodesis, both performed on [**2116-9-17**].
Chest and abdomen CT with contrast on [**2116-9-16**]: Large non hemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion, multiple new scattered sclerotic lesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine compatible with osseous metastasis, new 5-mm nodular soft tissue in the anterior mediastinum since [**2111-12-29**].
Bone Scan ([**2116-10-6**]):  no obvious evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
However, regions of new osseous sclerosis on [**Month (only) **] CT Torso were too small for total body bone scan detection.
Asthma 3.
Depression and anxiety.
Renal colic.
Chronic lower back pain.
Chronic bronchitis.
cardiac event, patient states mother had multiple medical and psychiatric problems and may have had an MI but history is unclear.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.1   BP: 106/77   P: 110   R: 21   O2: 96 4L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: faint inspiratory wheezes, otherwise no rales or ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CN 2-12 intact  On discharge: r. pleurex in place.
Imaging: CXR PA/L [**7-15**]: IMPRESSION: Emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions appear stable.
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
New 7 mm ovoid hyperdense focus in the right frontal lobe without surrounding edema.
This is concerning for an underlying mass such as metastasis, or could conceivably represent a vascular lesion.
LENI [**7-15**]: IMPRESSIONS: No DVT of either lower extremity.
No central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Small peripheral emboli cannot be excluded given suboptimal contrast bolus and motion artifact.
Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the left.
Partial atelectasis of left lower lobe and right middle lobe.
Increasing and enlarging sclerotic foci in the osseous structures, consistent with progressive metastatic breast cancer.
No acute fractures.
CXR Portable [**7-19**]: FINDINGS: Following thoracentesis, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Since the study of [**7-18**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectatic change.
Innumerable T1-hypointense, FLAIR-hyperintense lesions through the cervical and thoracic spine, representing extensive osseous metastatic disease, with no evidence of pathologic fracture and no associated epidural or paraspinal soft tissue mass.
Central disc extrusion at C6-C7 with moderate spinal canal narrowing and remodeling of the ventral spinal cord, with no intrinsic signal abnormality and no evidence of exiting neural impingement.
Bilateral pleural effusions, incompletely imaged.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory distress - patient initially presented with new oxygen requirement, and was covered for COPD exacerbation but then was found to have pleural effusion, that required drainage, which improved her respiratory status.
# Pleural Effusions - patient was found to have large pleural effusions, most likley secondary to metastatic disease.
# Breast CA (brain met) - it was discovered that patient had new brain mets on a CT scan.
# Anxiety / Depression / Tachycardia - patient has been in tachycardia throughout her stay here.
We never found a cause for her tachycardia.
Patient will go home with Pleurex, and will need follow up regarding changes in the amount of fluid being drained at primary oncology [**Last Name (STitle) 4314**].
Please follow up on Blood pressure status, as patient had episodes of hypotension that required boluses to keep her BP up.
She was asymptomatic during these events.
