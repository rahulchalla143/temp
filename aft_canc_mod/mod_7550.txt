# Metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: Patient recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma to left shoulder of unknown primary.
Pt received further eval for primary site including RUQ US, upper and lower endoscopy, and thin sliced CT abd/pelvis with no primary source of cancer identified.
Pt received bone scan which revealed extensive uptake of tracer to left scapula, and also to right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], left acetabulum, and right sixth rib which possibly represents osseous metastases.
Mammogram pending to evaluate for possible breast cancer.
Pt also with left upper extremity swelling which has been unchanged over weeks and is likely secondary to tumor.
Past ultrasound of left arm revealed no DVT.
Beacause of severe pain to scapula, pt has been getting [**Doctor First Name 16859**] daily to site for pallative pain management.
She has severe lymphedema in the left arm [**2-24**] tumor in the shoulder and this has worsened over hospital course.
LUE US showed non-occlusive thrombus, not getting anticoagulation.
Her small bowel is the only area that has not been adequately investigated for cancer.
# Difficulty ambulating: Xray of hip showed left iliac bone suspicious lytic lesion with cortical disruption pointing more to mets for cause of pain in hips.
Pt also has lower extremity chronic lymphedema that may be contributing to decreased mobility.
Edema  is likely not from CHF given pt's normal EF.
LENIS showed no DVT.
TTE showed normal EF with dilated right ventricle.
Pt had compression stockings (TEDS) and ace bandages placed to help with lower extremity edema  # Acute on Chronic Hyponatremia: low sodium has been a chronic issue for patient with baseline of approximately 130.
At first this was though most likely due to hypovolemia (as pt as NPO with bowel prep over [**2-25**] days) therefore pt was given aggressive IV fluids over one day and Na improved initially to 123 and then dropped again to 119.
There was most likely a component of SIADH and pt was fluid restricted and sent to MICU for treatment with hypertonic saline.
Pt spent two days in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for correction with hypertonic saline for level of 120 with MS changes.
The thought is that SIADH is the predominant feature of her hyponatremia but was likely confounded by hypovolemia earlier in hospital course.
She appeared intravascularly euvolemic but is total body overloaded.
# Atrial fibrillation s/p PPM [**6-/2129**] on pradaxa at home.
Pacemaker is located on the left side, the same side of pt's scapula tumor and is in the radiation field.
# HTN: normotensive.
