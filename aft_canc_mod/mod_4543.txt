The finding is suspicious for either metastasis or primary tumor of the cerebellum.
[**2183-8-20**] Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple new noncalcified pulmonary nodules since [**2182-4-15**].
Given the history of malignancy, these are highly concerning for primary metastatic lesions.
Centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe predominance.
Well-defined 1.6 cm lesion in segment VII of the liver, which appears stable in size compared to [**2182-4-15**].
Additional 2-mm hypoattenuating lesion in segment V is too small to characterize.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in the left kidney too small to characterize.
Prominence of number of paraaortic lymph nodes which however do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Cortical defects involving the lateral aspects of both iliac bones, this is of uncertain significance, possibly related to prior bone donor sites or could be related to prior infection.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine most severe at L5/S1 and DISH of the thoracic spine.
[**2183-8-21**] Head MR: IMPRESSION:  A 3.1 x 2.9 x 2.8 cm enhancing well circumscribed centrally cavitating mass of the left cerebellum with minimal surrounding T2 hyperintensity which is superficially located but appears to be intraaxial.
Given the minimal amount of peritumoral edema despite the large size, lymphoma is favored.
[**2183-8-22**]: Cerebellar mass pathology: DIAGNOSIS: #1, CEREBELLAR MASS BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear and frozen section): METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA with PROMINENT NEUROENDOCRINE FEATURES.
#2, CEREBELLAR MASS RESECTION: METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA with PROMINENT NEUROENDOCRINE FEATURES.
The smear shows a nearly non-cohesive tumor composed of cells with minimal to no discernable cytoplasm but with large nuclei having a salt-and-pepper chromatin.
Permanent sections reveal a prominent organoid growth pattern.
Many organoid nodules have a necrotic center.
This pattern of growth and the cytology indicate the tumor is a neuroendocrine-type metastatic carcinoma.
The histology and the chest CT finding of multiple pulmonary nodules are consistent with a lung primary, although metastases to lung and brain from another primary cannot be excluded.
These results support the original diagnosis of a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features, most likely from a lung primary.
[**2183-9-1**] CXR: New infiltrate in mid lung field suggestive of aspiration pneumonitis.
[**2183-9-2**] CXR: There is an increase  in the left lower lobe predominantly retrocardiac consolidation not fully imaged on the current chest radiograph suggesting worsening of infection and/or aspiration pneumonia.
There is also increase in the right middle lobe opacity obscuring the right heart border.
Giving the presence of the multiple pulmonary opacities during the course over the last two weeks with their rapid development and relatively rapid resolution they may represent recurrent episodes of aspiration.
Superimposed infection as was mentioned cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 65215**] is a 72M with multiple medical programs who presents from an outside hospital with chief complaint of ataxia, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, and found to have a cerebellar mass.
His hospital course by problem is as follows:  # L cerebellar metastasis with presumed primary lung cancer: On [**8-18**], the pt had been intermittently ataxic and was vomiting at home.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **], where CT head showed cerebellar mass, and he was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-19**] for further workup.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he had CT body performed, which showed multiple lesions in the lungs, liver, kidney, bone (though the lesions in the liver, kidney, bone cannot definitely be attributed to cancer).
On [**8-22**], he underwent resection of the 2.5 cm L cerebellar mass without neurologic complication.
Mass pathology showed metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma with prominent neuroendocrine features, most likely from a lung primary.
Over the next week after surgery, his nausea and vomiting was much improved, but he developed vocal cord paralysis with subsequent aspiration pneumonia and PEG tube placement (see below).
In terms of his cancer, it was felt that the patient could not being systemic therapy until he had recovered from his surgery and until his infection had resolved.
# Vocal cord paralysis/Pneumonia/Nutrition: The pt has experienced vocal cord paralysis in the past as a consequence of intubation, and the problem has resolved in [**1-18**] weeks.
Unfortunately he again developed vocal cord paralysis after intubation for his neurosurgery on [**8-22**].
On [**9-1**], he deveoped fever to 102.4, tachycardic to 130s, hypoxemic to 91% sat on 70% shovel mask, SBP 120/60, and lethargy and confusion per his daughters.
He was found to have a UTI and PNA, likely aspiration secondary to his vocal cord paralysis.
The PEG was placed on [**9-3**] without complications.
On [**9-4**], the pt was stable for transfer to the floor, as he was afebrile with normal WBC and breathing comfortably on 0-2L O2.
Pt prefered foley as he had a history of urinary retention, but agreed to d/c on [**9-5**].
# Anemia: Hct on this admission has been 29-35, similar to or slightly improved from his baseline.
This is likely secondary to chronic disease given his Fe studies and normal B12 and folate levels.
# Renal failure: Pt has a history of acute renal failure.
Cr ranged from 1.1-1.9, with baseline apparently 0.7-1.1 (though difficult to determine from record given numerous episodes of acute renal failure).
This was felt to be of prerenal etiology.
On discharge, Cr was mildly elevated to 1.3, likely because the pt had recently been NPO with vocal cord paralysis and had only just had PEG tube placed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Lung cancer with metastasis to the cerebellum Pneumonia Urinary tract infection  Secondary: Hypertension Anemia Diabetes Mellitus II History of MRSA infection   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for difficulty walking (called ataxia) and vomiting.
It was found that you have a mass in your cerebellum that was cancer, which likely started in your lung.
The mass in your cerebellum was removed successfully, though unfortunately you developed vocal cord paralysis from intubation.
In terms of your medications, you will continue taking oral decadron to decrease the swelling in your brain.
Also, you will continue to take the antibiotic Zosyn for your pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
