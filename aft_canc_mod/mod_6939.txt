Labs were notable for hyponatremia to 128, hyperkalemia to 6.4, creatinine of 4.5 and bicarb of 18.
He underwent CT head and C spine- negative for acute bleed, but showed concern for fracture at T1 involving R pedicle.
His forehead laceration was cleaned and repaired w/ sutures and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He quickly became hypotensive to 70s systolic.
Fast exam negative, no pericardial effusion on bedside ultrasound.
He received 2 L NS w/ response in BP and was started on levophed.
He received an additional liter of NS, vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage.
UA remarkable for >182 WBCs, + LE, but no nitrites or bacteria.
He underwent pan CT scan of head, C-spine, and torso which in prelim showed no fractures, but some fluid/stranding at the pancreas.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated and unresponsive to verbal stimuli.
Mild response to sternal rub, and was moving all extremities spontaneously.

Skin: Marked improvement with leg rash now only involving the L outer thigh.
Urine legionella antigen [**3-3**]: negative Stool [**3-3**]: negative for C. diff Stool [**3-4**]: negative for C. diff  IMAGING: [**3-2**] CT head: No acute intracranial process or fractures.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Small amount of fluid superior to the endotracheal tube balloon.
Peripancreatic fluid - could be related to pancreatic injury or acute pancreatitis.
Thick urinary bladder wall - correlate clinically for underlying infection.
Bilateral dependent opacities in the lungs likely atelectasis and/or aspiration.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline/mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild stranding and free fluid in the upper abdomen.
Based on prior CT, early pancreatitis is favored, with gastritis and duodenal injury less likely.
Increasingly distended gallbladder, with possible sludge/stones.
Consider ultrasound if there is clinical concern for acute cholecystitis.
Thickwalled bladder, suggesting outlet obstruction versus infection/inflammation.
Mild volume overload with pleural/pericardial effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
Infrarenal aortic ectasia.
[**3-3**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive peripheral deep vein thrombosis of the proximal femoral vein with central flow within it.
No acute DVT.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion have both improved, and there is no pulmonary edema.
Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is probably a combination of persistent atelectasis and increasing small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**3-6**] CXR: Continued decrease in central pulmonary vascular prominence.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with interval improvement on the left.
Brief Hospital Course: 78M with past medical history notable for prostate adenocarcinoma on XRT, CKD stage III, MDS, G6PD deficiency, hypothyroidism and recent UTI on treatment transferred from OSH after a mechanical fall with concern for T1 fracture, with course c/b hypotension and hypothermia presumably secondary to septic shock, initially requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, aggressive IVF, pressors, and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Was ultimately felt shock was due to sepsis, from urinary source.
# FALL AND HEAD INJURY: Fall mechanical in nature.
Was initially concern for T1 fracture based on OSH imaging, though imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show evidence of a fracture.
Additionally, no acute intracranial process was seen on imaging.
Patient did not have any focal neurologic deficits on exam.
He did sustain a scalp laceration that was sutured at [**Hospital3 **] prior to transfer.
There was no evidence of infection involving the scalp laceration.
Patient will need suture removal [**2119-3-9**] if scalp laceration appears healed.
#  SHOCK Patient suddenly became hypotensive with SBP to 70s in the ED.
There was no pericardial effusion on bedside echo.
He was intubated and sedated given altered mental status (as below).
UA was notable for many WBCs and + LE, but no nitrates or bacteria.
He continued to have aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Antibiotics eventually narrowed to levofloxacin for presumed UTI,  given known history of urinary retention, prostate cancer currently on radiation treatment, prior UTIs, and dirty UA on presentation.
UCx and BCx were negative (though in setting of recent outpatient antibiotics).
Sputum Cx revealed GN rods, but CXR revealed no e/o infective process.
Patient was also found to have purulent discharge from both ears, consistent with bilateral otitis media.
It was thought that septic shock from urinary source was the most likely explanation for his hypotensive episode.
Of note, patient had a peri-pancreatic inflammatory picture and gallbladder distention on CT, with no clinical correlation (unremarkable LFTs, only slightly elevated lipase that trended down to normal, and no abdominal pain).
History of poor PO intake suggested possible hypovolemic status, but there was no evidence suggesting large volume loss on imaging studies or lab tests.
Adrenal insufficiency unlikely given normal cortisol level.
He was discharged with plan to complete 10d course of levofloxacin (last day [**2119-3-11**]) which will cover both UTI and otitis media.
# HYPOTHERMIA: Likely secondary to septic shock.
TSH slightly elevated but free T4 normal, and cortisol WNL.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: He was intubated due to an unresponsive state and failure to protect his airway, but there was no clear h/o any hypoxia.
Did however have A-a gradient and some opacities in bases, likely atelectasis, which gradually improved.
Repeat CXR [**3-6**] did not show any edema, bilateral effusions had improved, and atalectasis had improved.
Should have repeat CXR in several weeks to confirm that there are not any persistent abnormalities.
# UNRESPONSIVENESS He had sudden onset on unresponsiveness w/o any known prodrome.
Given hypotension on presentation, possibly related to hypoperfusion.
No evidence of other toxins on serum/urine tox screen.
No historical clues to suggest meningitis, but likely that infection played a large role given degree of hypotension and hypothermia.
CT head negative for any acute pathology.
# OTITIS MEDIA: Per patient, he had purulent discharge from both ears starting two days before the admission.
Patient remained asymptomatic without significant change in hearing difficulty (hard of hearing at baseline).
# [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: He had elevated Cr at 4.5 at OSH prior to transfer from baseline of 1.3.
Urine chemistry and clinical history was most consistent with ischemic ATN superimposed upon his CKD.
# DIARRHEA He developed frequent loose stools after transfer to the floor.
This was thought to be related to recent multiple abx administration, and possibly related to his recent radiation treatments.
Given no abdominal pain, leukocytosis or fever, had low clinical suspicion for C. diff.
#  ANEMIA: He presented with a Hct that 6 points lower than his recent Hct on [**2-27**].
Anemia currently attributed primarily to early myelodysplastic syndrome.
No evidence of hemolysis during the admission.
Patient was guiac neg in ED, and did not have any evidence of bleeding on imaging.
#  RASH He developed confluent coalescing blanching erythematous macules covering the entire lower extremities, sparing a few ovoid patches over the shins and back in the setting of multiple abx administration.
# NON-OCCLUSIVE CHRONIC DVT He was started on a heparin drip after he was noted to have R DVT on lower extremity ultrasound.
However, final report of ultrasound suggested a non-occlusive peripheral deep vein thrombosis of the proximal femoral vein with central flow within it, consistent with an old re-canalized deep vein thrombosis.
# PERIPANCREATIC FLUID COLLECTION ON CT: There were CT findings concerning for pancreatitis, but there was no clinical correlation.
Patient did not have any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain and had and unremarkable abdominal exam.
Amylase and lipase only mildly elevated.
No intervention other than fluid resuscitation and serial abdominal exams.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: s/p thyroidectomy.
Should have repeat TFTs in outpatient setting once acute issues resolve.
HTN: His home atenolol and enalapril were initially held in setting of hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **].
# Trigeminal neuralgia: Continued gabapentin, renally dosed.
# Prostate cancer: Patient currently getting XRT and per his son he only has a few sessions left.
He also reportedly had hypotension on Flomax which was recently stopped and has led to an exacerbation of his symptoms.
He would likely benefit from re-initiation of Flomax if BP remains stable at rehab.

You were initially brought to [**Hospital3 **], where there was concern for a fracture in your back.
However, our scans here did not show any evidence of a fracture.
While you were in the emergency department, your temperature and blood pressure dropped suddenly and you became unresponsive.
You were treated with various antibiotics for your ongoing urinary tract infection and ear infection.
You stayed free of fever and had no pain anywhere.
You should finish your prescribed antibiotics course (last dose [**2119-3-11**]) for your urinary tract infection and ear infection.
You should get the stitches removed after [**2119-3-9**] if the laceration on your head is well healed.
You developed rash on your legs which may have been caused by one of the antibiotics you received (vancomycin).
We tested you for an infectious cause of diarrhea called C. difficile, but this test was negative.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - STOPPED enalapril (you can restart this when your kidney function returns to normal, please discuss with your doctors) - STOPPED docusate sodium (Colace) while you are having diarrhea - DECREASED gabapentin to 300 mg daily - DECREASED allopurinol to 100 mg every other day - ADDED levofloxacin 250 mg daily (for urinary tract and ear infections), last day will be [**2119-3-11**] - ADDED sarna cream as needed for itching  We have continued all your other medications and adjusted some of their doses for your decreased kidney function.
