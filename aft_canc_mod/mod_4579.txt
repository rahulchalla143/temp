Admission Date:  [**2150-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-5-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Strawberry  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: "Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma.
She presents for scheduled admission for autologous stem cell transplant.
She was treated with combinations of velcade, decadron, cytoxan, Revlimid from [**8-/2149**] thru [**4-/2150**] with a decrease in paraproteinemia, but without significant response on bone marrow biopsies.
8 bags of peripheral cells were collected prior to admission to be transfused during transplant."
When patient became hyperglycemic while on 20mg IV dexamethasone, she was started on an ISS for a short time.
After her SCT, she had her  nadir at D+6.
The day prior to her nadir she has a fever and LLQ pain, which  appeared to be mild diverticulitis/sigmoiditis on CT scan.
Stem cell culture had no growth.
Left subclavian line had minimal erythema and tenderness.
Was receiving acyclovir ppx and was started on fluconazole for esophageal pain on swallowing.
Esophageal symptoms improved quickly after addition of fluconazle.
All symptoms improved with the return of her WBC and abx coverage was narrowed to cipro and flagyl which were discontinue several days prior to discharge.
Patient spiked to 100.6 on [**2150-11-3**] and CXR and CT showed ground glass opacity in RLL, suggestive of PNA.
Patient is currently afebrile and without complaints.
She had a fever as high as 101 at the apartment she was staying.
She has continued to have loose stool.
She denies any headache, chest pain, cough, sinus congestion, sore   Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: [**2129**]: Diagnosed with MGUS in [**Location (un) 14336**] at [**Hospital1 13199**] Hospital [**2134**]: Bone marrow bx at [**Hospital1 13199**]: "adequate core showing all  normal elements without granulomata nor ectopic cells seen."
Plasma cells were "plentiful, many showing cytoplasmic activity."
At that time  normal Cr and hematocrit, IgG 1360 [**11-30**]: creatinine 0.6, M-protein 0.2 g/dL [**2148-3-29**]: creatinine 0.9, hct 32.3, M-protein <0.2 g/dL [**2149-6-2**]: cr 1.12, hct 33.2, M-protein <0.2 g/dL [**7-3**]: routine dental x-rays showed new mandible lesion.
[**2149-7-22**]  oral biopsy of mandible from tooth #20 area showed extensive infiltration by monotonous population of intermediate sized cells with round eccentrically located nuclei; lesional cells CD[**Pager number **] positive, kappa restricted, consistent with involvement by  a plasma cell neoplasm.
[**2149-8-12**]: skeletal survey negative [**2149-8-15**]: bone marrow bx: 100% CD138 positive kappa restricted cells ("sections of the biopsy and clot show a marrow which has  been almost entirely replaced by a population of plasma cells.)
With cycle 2 revlimid (15 mg)  added, but was stopped within two weeks because of severe stomach cramps.
[**2150-4-23**]: bone marrow bx: bone marrow involvement by a monoclonal  kappa-restricted plasma cell neoplasm, comprising 70% of marrow  elements [**2150-4-24**]: last treatment (C4D4); further treatment held [**2150-4-29**]: skeletal survey negative, panorex no focal lesion [**2150-5-25**]: bilateral bone marrow biopsy done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87663**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1) Rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in the mid [**2119**].
2) Irritable bowel syndrome 3) Lactose intolerance .
Family History: There is no history of hematologic disorders.
Her mother died of lung cancer at 55.
Her father died of an unclear cancer at 46 - it may have been mesothelioma or stomach cancer.
She has 3 sisters - one of her sisters has osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and fibromyalgia.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: Tc 98.8, Tm 101, BP 120/74, HR 102, RR 18, O2 98% RA Gen: awake, alert, oriented x 3 EENT: EOMI, PERRL, dry mucus membranes with no oral lesions Neck: supple with no lymphadenopathy Heart: RRR without audible murmurs Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally with no crackles or wheeze, slightly decreased breath sounds in the LLL Abdomen: + BS, soft, non-distended, no tenderness to palaption, no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly Extremities: no edema Skin: + R sided port-a-cath with no erythema surrounding it.
No evidence for fluid collection.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
Subcentimeter hypodense lesion in the liver is too small to characterize but likely represents a cyst.
No evidence of acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or space-occupying lesion.
No abnormal leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement.
Bones of the skull and of the visualized cervical vertebrae show heterogenously hypointense marrow signal on T1-weighted images, which likely represents diffuse marrow infiltration by multiple myeloma  [**11-11**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of rhythmic and sharply contoured epileptiform discharges which evolve in frequency consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
This abates after administration of lorazepam, then recurred for about two hours, and remitted again after lorazepam and levetiracetam.
Inflammatory change in the left neck posterior to the carotid sheath at level II/III.
As detailed above, the differential includes thrombosis of a jugular venous tributary versus prominent lymph nodes with adjacent inflammatory change.
There is no focal fluid collection to suggest abscess.
Mild fat stranding in the submandibular region.
Patchy partial opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells.
[**11-20**] Neck US: Normal-appearing lymph nodes throughout the left-sided cervical soft tissues, which do not appear pathologically enlarged.
No venous thrombosis seen within the internal jugular vein or adjacent venous tributaries.
[**11-23**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of slow alpha rhythm, mild diffuse background slowing, and brief bursts of generalized delta activity.
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
No electrographic seizures are present  [**11-23**] MRI head: 1.
No space-occupying mass lesion, infarction, or hemorrhage.
No abnormal leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement.
Stable heterogeneous T1 hyperintensity within the skull and upper cervical spine, findings suggestive of marrow infiltration by multiple myeloma.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo woman with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma now s/p autoSCT D+22, presenting with weakness, chills and fever to 101.0F.
Previous admission for SCT complicated by diverticulitis/sigmoiditis, esophagitis, and possible pneumonia, discharged on Levofloxacin, now returning with fever and dehydration, as well as ongoing diarrhea and AMS.
AMS, Fever without neutropenia: concern for underlying infection, concerning for diarrhea and worsening MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28864**], was oriented X3, but hypersensitive and saying strange sentences.
Head MRI showed no acute pathology.
Neuro consulted and lumbar puncture performed showing slightly elevated protein and 88% lymphocytes.
Repeat MRI head again did not show any abnormality, and repeat 24 hr EEG [**Date range (1) **] did no show sign of seizure but generalized mild slowing.
The source of her seizures remains unclear at this point, though a viral encephalitis is though to be the most likely etiology.
She remained pancytopenic for the majority of her admission, which is unusual for being this far out from a autoSCT, as one would expect a more robust recovery of counts.
She was also transfused IVIg to help support her through her presumed viral illness, given that her Ig counts remained low.
# Candidal esophagitis:  developed a severe case of candidal esophagitis that prevented her from taking PO meds or nutrition for 1-2 days.
# Tachycardia:  persistently in sinus tachycardia throughout her hospital stay, thought to be due to sympathetic drive given her illness.
# Nausea: continue prochlorperazine .
# Pain: continue Oxycodone .
# Rheumatoid Arthritis: Currently stable.
# Bowel Regimen: continue Docusate .
Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple myeloma Autologous transplant status Non-convulsive status epilepticus Esophageal candidiasis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because of fevers and confusion.
You were sent to the intensive care unit, and it was found that you were having non-convulsive seizures that caused you to be confused but not have any jerky movements like typical seizures.
It is still not clear exactly why you had these seizures, but we believe that they may have been due to a viral infection, which appears to have gone away.
Your fevers were likely due to a viral infection, perhaps the same viral infection that caused your seizures.
You also had a severe thrush infection that could have made your fevers worse.
They will call you once you have an appointment.
