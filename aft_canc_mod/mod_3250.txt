HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male smoker with a history of Stage 3 nonsmall cell lung cancer who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2149-11-13**] after having 500 cc of hemoptysis and associated shortness of breath that morning.
One day prior to admission at the [**Hospital1 2177**], he was seen in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for a complaint of increasing lethargy and shortness of breath; a chest x-ray done at that time demonstrated a new left lung air/fluid level.
At the end of this procedure, the left main stem bronchus was obstructed with a bronchial balloon.
Given the complex vascular supply of the tumor, however, the procedure was aborted.
On the night prior to transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient had an additional 300 cc of hemoptysis with an associated drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was therefore started on a Dopamine drip.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 5.
Congestive heart failure; 6.
Blood loss anemia secondary to gastritis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  100 pack year smoking history, no ethyl alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of lung cancer at age 57, father died secondary to coronary artery disease at age 70, brother died secondary to coronary artery disease at age 55, sister with breast cancer.
F., his temperature maximum from earlier in the day was 102, heartrate 69 to 97, blood pressure 99 to 110/50 to 60, and mean blood pressure of 66 to 99.
His neck was soft and supple and there was no lymphadenopathy.
There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the bilateral upper sternal border and there were no rubs or gallops.
There were faint breathsounds over the left anterior chest wall.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were dopplerable, and there was no edema.
He had no skin rashes or lesions,  LABORATORY DATA:   Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated a white blood cell count of 4.4, hematocrit of 34.8 and platelets of 237,000.
A 10 by 40 Ultraflex left lower lobe stent and a 12 by 40 Polyflex left main stem bronchus stent were placed with visualization into good position; the patient was reintubated bronchoscopically with the endotracheal tube at 25 cm following this procedure.
The post procedure chest x-ray demonstrated some aeration of the left lung, right lower lobe effusion versus infiltrate.
An outside chest x-ray reportedly demonstrated left lung opacification and right lower lobe effusion versus infiltrate.
Hemoptysis - There was active bleeding seen at the time of initial bronchoscopy, of which the most likely source was the patient's malignancy.
This bleeding likely originated either from erosion of the tumor into small pulmonary vessels or from erosion or trauma to the vascular supply to the tumor itself.
The patient had some mild post procedural hemoptysis, although his bloody secretions rapidly tapered off.
He had no further significant clinical hemoptysis during this hospitalization.
Post obstructive pneumonia - The fluid that was released following the tumor destruction and airway debridement in the initial bronchoscopy did not have the appearance of frank blood, but rather had a somewhat purulent appearance, (slightly yellowish).
This gross finding raised the possibility of a post obstructive anaerobic pneumonia.
Although the patient did not have an elevated white blood count, he was febrile to 102 prior to admission.
His white blood cell count remained normal throughout his admission and he also remained afebrile throughout his admission.
Airway obstruction - The patient had a significant airway obstruction from his tumor that was largely relieved by the tumor destruction and airway debridement during the initial bronchoscopy as noted above; in addition, two stents were placed in an attempt to maintain airway patency.
A post procedural chest x-ray demonstrated increased aeration of the left lung, and breathsounds were heard over the left anterior chest wall following this initial procedure.
Hypotension - The patient reportedly became hypotensive on the morning of [**11-14**], after having a second episode of massive hemoptysis at the outside hospital and he subsequently required Dopamine to maintain his blood pressure.
He was transfused a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells at the outside hospital, and he did not have evidence of hypovolemia on admission to the [**Hospital6 1760**].
Blood loss anemia - The patient had a drop in his hematocrit following his hemoptysis at the outside hospital; following transfusion of 4 units of packed red cells at the outside hospital, the patient's hematocrit improved to 32.5.
Coagulopathy - The patient had a mild coagulopathy with an INR of 1.4 on admission.
Electrolyte abnormalities - The patient required repletion of his phosphate, potassium, magnesium, and calcium on multiple occasions throughout this admission.
DISPOSITION:  At the time of discharge from the hospital the patient was aspirating all foods and liquids he attempted to consume, however, given that the decision had been made to transfer the patient to home hospice medical care, the patient was sent home only on medications as needed for pain as well as Scopolamine for minimization of oral secretions.
