History of Present Illness: Patient is a 59-year-old female with h/o NSCLC, malignant pleural effusion s/p pleurodesis, and nonmalignant pericardial effusion, now presenting with increasing shortness of breath and worsening cough for the past 10 days.
Her cough was minimally productive at first, but increased in production with slightly blood-tinged sputum after starting Mucinex on her recent OSH hospitalization.
She also had some pleuritic chest pain with persistent coughing, rated [**8-13**].
She otherwise denies fever, chills, chest pain or palpitations.
Of note, patient has also been having vaginal bleeding for the past 2 weeks, worse in the beginning, but more recently improved with only some spotting now.
Previous CT abdomen/pelvis (done about 5 weeks ago) had revealed a uterine fibroid, suspected as a possible cause for her menorrhagia.
Her oncologist also suspects metastasis and wants a biopsy done.
After obtaining a pulmonology consult by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], CT chest was done which revealed occlusion of the right mainstem bronchus with associated collapse and consolidation of the right lobe with additional adjacent loculated pleural effusion, stable pericardial effusion, and bilateral renal masses.
Given her pulmonary status, patient is now being transferred here for further workup with bronchoscopy and possible stenting of the bronchus.
ROS: Positive for shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on exertion, abdominal pain, nausea, vaginal bleeding, bilateral lower extremity edema, back pain and occasional constipation.
Negative for fever, chills, headache, vomiting, tingling, numbness, seizures, loss of consciousness, chest pain, palpitations or diarrhea  Past Medical History: -Stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, s/p radiation and 3 lines of chemotherapy -H/o malignant pleural effusion, s/p pleurodesis -Nonmalignant pericardial effusion, s/p pericardial window ([**11/2161**]) -Radiation-induced esophagitis -Type 2 diabetes mellitus -Hypertension -Depression -s/p G-tube placement 3 weeks ago -Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Lives at home with her family.

Bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion.
Enlarged bilateral adrenal glands as well as an L4 lytic lesion, both concerning for metastasis.
[**2162-2-8**]: CXR:  In comparison to study of [**2-7**], there are decreased lung volumes and some increasing prominence of interstitial markings, suggesting overhydration.
Complete opacification of the right hemithorax persists, consistent with the CT demonstration of complete occlusion of the right mainstem bronchus and complete collapse of the right lung.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 41033**] was admitted on [**2162-2-5**] for further evaluation of her Stage IV NSCLC s/p chemo/XRT therapy now with malignant airway obstruction.
On [**2161-2-4**] she was taken to the operating room for Rigid bronchoscopy, balloon dilation, tumor debridement and therapeutic aspiration.
She was extubated in the OR monitor in the PACU were she was re-intubated for hypoxia, bronch with removal of a small blood clot partially obstructing the RUL.
On [**2162-2-6**] she had bronchoscopy with aspiration for the RMS & RUL.
LENIS were negative for DVT.
On [**2161-2-6**] the CT airway revealed No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Occlusion of the right main stem bronchus as well as complete collapse of the right lung.Bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion.
Enlarged bilateral adrenal glands as well as an L4 lytic lesion, both concerning for metastasis.
She was evaluated by GI for possible esophageal stricture and feeding tube placement.
On [**2161-2-9**] her INR was 1.5 she was given SL Vit k.  On [**2162-2-11**] she underwent EGD which showed severe gastritis and absence of GI motility.
Over the course of her hospitalization she had multiple bronchoscopy for muscus pluggings.
