Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is well known to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and ID with multiple stays here for BOOP exacerbations and pseudomonal pneumonia.
Per the patient he has had increased green sputum production and cough for the past 5-6 days with overall malaise.
He has felt febrile in addition to having measured fevers at [**Hospital1 **].
He has also had some occasional nausea and reports dry mouth but denies abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, sinus pain, rash, nasal congestion, chest pain.
Of note, he was recently admitted at the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**] with tachycardia and leukocytosis.
He has not had any recent hanges in vent settings and has been on AC 500 x 16 PEEP 5 FiO2 40%.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for  two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on, but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphoma and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].

Pt presented with known pseudomonas respiratory infections.
He was monitored closely and seemingly was improving during the initial days of his hospitalization, but then began to have increasingly thickened sputum production and was have more frequent episodes of respiratory distress.
Mucolytics, chest PT, and hypertonic saline were administered to thin out patients sputum and make him more comfortable.
Sputum was also collected to look for new sensitivities and whether the patient had developed resistance to the Abx.
Pt also had bronchoscopy done to re-evaluate underlying infection and also attempt to clear up some underlying thickened mucous.
Evaluation of the tachycardia showed it was sinus and his underlying respiratory distress and anxiety was treated with mucolytics, frequent suctioning, morphine for air hunger and chest PT.
Acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution [**Month/Year (2) **]: Six [**Age over 90 1230**]y (650) mg PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
