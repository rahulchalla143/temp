She was taken to the OR by neurosurgery on [**2126-11-27**] for posterior fossa decompression and EVD.
Her hospitalization has been complicated by Afib with RVR requiring IV metoprolol and PO metoprolol for rate control.
She also had an NSTEMI with a peak trop of 0.22 [**2126-11-25**] most likely in the setting of demand ischemia.
She also developed BRBPR during this hospitalization, and was taken to colonoscopy on [**2126-12-3**] which showed a colonic mass which was sent for biopsy.

From OSH: CTA head/neck was performed and showed occlusion of R vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment stenosis P2 segment of L PCA.
A brain MRI revealed bilateral cerebellar stroke and small punctate cortical infarcts R and L occipital lobes .
CT head [**2126-11-26**]: IMPRESSION: Areas of hypodensity within the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally corresponding to area of acute infarct seen on the outside hospital MRI with mass effect on the 4th ventricle.
No significant change in size of the lateral ventricles and 3rd ventricle since the prior study.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, and the distal anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior wall.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with mid LAD disease.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Evolving cerebellar infarcts, as well as more evident left occipital lobar and smaller parieto-occipital infarcts, superiorly.
No hemorrhage.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was without flow-limiting stenosis.
The LAD had a 30% stenosis  in the mid vessel just prior to the second diagonal branch which was a very small vessel that had an 80% ostial stenosis.
The RCA had minimal plaquing.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial  systolic hypertension SBP=152 mmHg.
One small branch vessel coronary artery disease.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 year old woman with HTN presented with vertigo, difficulty with balance without other associated symptoms who initially presented to OSH where she was found to have bilateral cerebellar infarcts in PICA distribution, as well as small infarcts in occipital lobes bilaterally.
CTA at OSH revealed occlusion of R vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment stenosis P2 segment of L PCA.
When she arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], her examination was notable for loss of color vision in right peripheral field, nystagmus in bilateral gaze, mild dysmetria bilaterally in UEs and L > R impaired coordination in LEs with a mild R NLF flattening.
She was noted to have progression of edema and infarcts on repeat CT and thus heparin was discontinued.
HOB was maintained at 30 degrees, ISS and tylenol were used for euglycemia and normothermia.
ECHO did not show a source of a thrombus, but did show extensive hypokinesis in the  mid to distal anterior septum, the distal anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior wall without an overt evidence of an embolism.
Repeat CT scans showed increased edema and mild tonsilar hernation.
Given this, she started heparin on [**12-2**], however, as noted below heparin was eventually stopped secondary to bleeding complications.
reported having left sided chest pain in the setting of her vertigo.
Initial EKG showed mild Tw flattening, however it progressed to TwI in II, aVF, and V1-6 by time of admission to Neuro ICU.
This was felt to be due to either central/CVA induced demand or an NSTEMI in setting of prior stenosis.
BB was started, ACEI held due to low BPs.
As noted above, patient developed Afib with RVR.
For risk stratification after her troponin leak,  she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 20% mid-LAD stenosis and 80% D2 stenosis.
She had no interventions and was deemed at average risk to undergo colonic surgery.
She had an episode of flash pulmonary edema which resolved w/ Lasix/BB/Hydralazine treatment.
She then had a staging CT for the colonic mass noted below, which showed subsegmental PEs bilaterally.
Subsequent LENIs showed right posterior tibial DVT.
Because of hematochezia (see below) she was not anticoagulated and instead an IVC filter was placed on [**2126-12-3**].
However, she then developed hematochezia with a hematocrit drop from 37 to 31.
GI was consulted and performed a colonoscopy showing a fungating colonic mass.
She had a staging CT as above which showed the PEs but no metastases.
Admitted to Stone 5 for post-op care.
Pain controlled with IV pain medication.
Multiple lap abdominal incisions OTA with dermabond, CDI.
Diet advanced gradually from sips to regular food as bowel function and abdominal distention improved.
Pain well controlled with oral oxycodone and Tylenol.
Out-patient follow up: The CT done for staging purposes showed a heterogeneous thyroid for which she will need an ultrasound as an outpatient.
It also showed an infrarenal 3.5 cm AAA for which she will need an ultrasound every 3 years.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
Embolic cerebellar infarcts (bilateral) 2.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 4.
Hematochezia 5.
Colonic mass 6.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response 8.
Hypertension 2.
Hyperlipidemia  Discharge Condition: ambulating with assist-tremulous, alert & oriented x [**2-12**].
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with vertigo and imbalance.
You were found to have a stroke of your cerebellum (a part of the brain).
You were also noted to have bleeding from your colon, and were found to have a colonic mass which was resected via the surgery team (Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1120**]).
Prior to this, you underwent cardiac evaluation with coronary angiogram, which showed no significant coronary disease.
During this admission, you were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate), for which you will require anticoagulation.
Should you develop any further difficulty with balance, vertigo, headache, weakness, changes in vision, difficulty with speech, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or any other symptom concering to you, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER for any of the following: * If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* Your pain is not improving within 8-12 hours or not gone within 24 hours.
Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or is changing location or moving to your chest or  back.
* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 101.5 (F) degrees or 38(C) degrees.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
-Please call the doctor if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision sites.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83632**] for continued management of your hypertension and anticoagulation once you are discharged from REHAB.
