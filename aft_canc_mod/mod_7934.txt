Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor.
KUB: IMPRESSION: Moderate colonic fecal loading without evidence of bowel obstruction.
CT (OSH): no report but note makes mention of solitary, 1.5cm hyperdense lesion in superior peripheral left parietal lobe with surrounding edema.
8 cm mass in the right lower lung, as above, with mass effect on the adjacent atelectatic lung parenchyma, the right lower lobe bronchus and two right pulmonary veins.
Hypoattenuation of this mass may be secondary to intrinsic tumor characteristics and/or necrosis.
Extensive mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy.
2.7 cm lytic lesion in the left scapula, concerning for metastasis .
MR head ([**2121-12-13**]) CONCLUSION: Left hemispheric cortical enhancing lesion with extensive surrounding edema and likely necrosis.
No other suspicious abnormalities are detected.
CYTOLOGY [**2121-12-15**] LYMP NODE BX POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma.
Note: Necrosis and mixed inflammatory cells are present in the background.
PATHOLOGY [**2121-12-15**]: DIAGNOSIS: Lung, right lower lobe, endobronchial biopsy (A): Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with areas suspicious for vascular invasion.
Large celiac axis and paraesophageal lymphadenopathy concerning for metastatic disease.
No evidence for an intra-abdominal or pelvic primary malignancy.
Large right lower lobe mass is better evaluated on previous chest CT. 3.
Moderate-sized ventral hernia containing fat and large bowel without evidence for obstruction.
Left parietal lesion with increased perfusion.
Functional MRI demonstrates no cortical activation surrounding the left parietal lesion after foot, tongue or hand movements.
Tractography images demonstrates anterior displacement of the fibers by the tumor.
BONE SCAN [**2121-12-17**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
[**2121-12-18**] TISSUE PARIETAL LESION PENDING .
No evidence for large territorial infarction.
Small area of enhancement along the inferior surface of the resected lesion may represent a small amount of residual tumor.
Attention on followup exam should to be paid to this area after the resolution of acute postoperative changes.
Mild edema, small amount of blood products, and a tiny left subdural hematoma are all expected postoperative findings.

He was found to have lung and brain lesions and underwent a lung biopsy which showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
#Neurosurgical course He was transferred to the neurosurgery service on then evening of [**12-16**] in preparation for surgical resection of his lesion on [**12-17**].
Postoperative head CT demonstrated mild left frontal pneumocephalus, no hemorrhage oe mass effect.
On [**2121-12-19**] POD 1 he underwent MRI brain which demonstrated good resection of the mass and was negative for stroke.
He was transferred to the Hematology/oncology service on [**12-19**] in good condition, tolerating a regular diet, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Stage IV NSCLC, squamous cell histology - Patient is s/p resection of brain met left parietal mass [**12-18**], neurosurgical operative note reports having obtained gross total resection.
His parietal lobe resection mass pathology was pending a final read at the time of discharge.
#Leukocotyosis: Patient with continued leukcytosis.
No mental status changes.
Also, given the fact that patient was on steroids it was also a highly likely cause of his leukocytosis.
He remaiend afebrile and the diarrhea resolved.
Hypercalcemia - Labs demonstrated hypercalcemia on admission, responsive to pamidronate.
Radiographic evidence of lytic lesion in L scapula.
Likely due to malignancy.
Microcytic anemia - Patient initially anemic to 25.2 with MCV in the low 70's.
Iron studies were performed, appears to be consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Unclear what his baseline hematocrit is.
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of the mass in your lung and brain.
Your lung mass was consistent with a primary lung cancer after it was biopsied.
You were placed on steroids to help with swelling and inflammation, and seizure prophylaxis.
In regards to your Surgical incision on your head: ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**6-2**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
