CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and stridor.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old white male with hypertension, history of congestive heart failure, multiple malignancies with metastases, who presented on [**2194-3-15**] with shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, and purulent discharge from infected site from thyroidectomy on [**2194-1-29**].
The patient was on three days of dicloxacillin for the wound infection prior to presentation.
The patient had a total thyroidectomy on [**2194-1-29**] for advanced papillary thyroid cancer with invasion of the esophagus and the right laryngeal nerve.
Eight days ago he developed swelling and erythema to the surgical wound site in his neck and upper chest.
Three days after initiation of treatment, he had purulent discharge from the site and developed progressively worsening stridor, dyspnea, and orthopnea (unable to sleep supine), one episode of chest pain (nonradiating, lasting seconds), and lower extremity edema.
Myocardial infarction was ruled out per serial creatine kinase and troponin I (troponin I level was 0.3).
CT of the neck showed severe focal narrowing of larynx and trachea.
He may have had a previous chest x-ray showing mild congestive heart failure and calcified granuloma in the left middle lung.
Renal cancer with lung metastases.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post femoral-popliteal over 10 years ago.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There was an oxygen mask near the tube.
Head and neck examination showed mild conjunctival injection (right more than left), and xanthelasma.
Head examination also showed supraorbital swelling.
There was no purulent drainage.
The patient had active secretions from the tracheostomy tube.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No jugular venous distention.
No carotid bruits.
On lung examination, there was good air movement bilaterally, coarse breath sounds with diffuse bilateral crackles, rhonchi, bilateral wheezes, loud air sounds from the tracheostomy tube in the upper lobes.
The abdomen was soft and nontender, slightly distended.
No masses palpated.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
On skin examination, he had multiple seborrheic keratosis and skin tags and was hirsute.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**3-14**] showed a possible left lower lobe pneumonia with a possible left pleural effusion.
CT on [**3-15**] showed focal tracheal narrowing, soft tissue density and piriform sinuses (right more than left), and a patent airway.
A chest x-ray on [**3-16**] confirmed tracheal tube placement and showed that there was no pneumothorax.
The patient had an I-131 scan on [**3-4**] which showed no evidence of distant metastatic disease from thyroid cancer.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 74-year-old white male with hypertension, history of congestive heart failure, multiple malignancies with metastases (status post total thyroidectomy on [**2194-1-29**]), an 8-day infection of thyroidectomy wound (treated three days with dicloxacillin) who presented on [**2194-3-15**] with worsening stridor, dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, chest pain, and purulent wound discharge.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction per serial enzymes (troponin I level was 0.3).
A CT of the neck showed focally narrowed larynx and trachea, and the patient had open tracheostomy performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2194-3-15**] with placement of tracheal tube.
Postoperative treatment for infection was with cefazolin in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient has no right laryngeal nerve from surgery, and a porotic left laryngeal nerve.
He was afebrile during his stay on CC7.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 18353**] recommendations, the patient was suctioned every two hours until secretions decreased, and special care was taken of tracheal tube.
The patient was comfortable and had no respiratory complaints.
Breath sounds were loud and coarse with diffuse crackles, bilateral wheezes, and bilateral rhonchi.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure.
His exercise test with MIBI in [**2193-10-26**] showed an ejection fraction of 58%, and no perfusion abnormalities, with 81% maximal calculated heart rate achieved on exercise.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction as a cause of his chest pain on this visit.
The patient also has a history of peripheral vascular disease, status post tib-fib.
The patient had several episodes of hypertension while in the hospital for which he was started on Cardizem, hydrochlorothiazide, and captopril.
His tracheal tube secretions had decreased and were suctioned twice per day by nurses.
He had no new complaints.
On physical examination, the patient's respiratory status improved; although, he still had some rhonchi in his lungs bilaterally and coarse breath sounds.
On neck examination, on the day of discharge, he had some serosanguineous exudate from the wound site, but no erythema or swelling.
For management of his wound infection, he was switched from cefazolin in the Emergency Room to cephalexin on [**2194-3-17**].
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to contact the hospital if he had any further respiratory distress, any worsening of symptoms, or no improvement.
He was also instructed to contact the [**Name (NI) **]/Nose/Throat team for management of any complications with the tracheostomy tube.
