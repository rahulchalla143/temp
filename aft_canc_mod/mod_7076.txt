The patient is delirious (see below) and mostly only answers yes or no.
He went to an ED where NCHCT showed a left frontal meningioma.
He then left AMA without antiepileptic drugs.
He was also noted to have a new right facial droop and aphasia.
Last night he seemed "altered", more confused, along with having a "low-grade temperature".
She did not obtain a description of events earlier that morning, so it is unclear if he had a convulsive seizure.

Given suspicion of a AAA, CT abdomen was performed without aneurysm noted.
No alcohol or drugs.

He initially was responsive to sternal rub, but later became febrile and unresponsive with Cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.
It is likely that the leukocytosis demonstrated in his CSF was likely secondary to his lumbar puncture.
He underwent a head CT that showed decrease in his left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
He had a CT of his abdomen to r/o AAA because of concern for abdominal pain that was negative.
During his admission, his Keppra dose was initially doubled to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] because of concern for ongoing seizure activity.
However, after it was clear that his EEG showed no ongoing seizure activity, it was weaned to 500mg [**Hospital1 **] again.
However, because of ongoing discharges from his left frontal region evident on EEG, he was loaded with more PHT for a goal to ~20 (most recent corrected level was 15 prior to discharge).
Of note, his EEG remained relatively stable with mild improvement of his slowing in the left frontal region with occasional sharps and delta waves.
He was allowed to have pureed foods at first and then soft mechanical diet with nectar thick liquids after he became more alert.
Heme:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] was admitted on Pradaxa because of his atrial fibrillation.
ID:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] remained afebrile during much of his admission after his initial fever.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipatioin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: seizure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of concern for seizure after you came in with unresponsive episodes.
Your EEG did not show any seizures, but was concerning for abnormal activity coming from your left frontal region, where your meningioma was.
