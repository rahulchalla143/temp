Admission Date:  [**2166-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-3-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nasogastric tube placed and removed x2 PEG tube placed in interventional radiology [**2166-3-28**]  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 8072**] is a 86 year-old man with a history of HTN and renal mass with hilar adenopathy concerning for RCC who was admitted on [**3-19**] and is now being transferred to the MICU for further care.
Initially presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea x [**3-12**] days--he has had dyspnea for several months with ongoing malignancy workup involving the lungs and has been on oxygen for several weeks.
EKG notable for new ST depressions in V5-V6.
Renal mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC - s/p 2 non-diagnostic EBUS-TBNA complicated by ?
of pneumothorax vs. trapped RUL (stable) - recent cervical mediastinoscopy and diagnostic bronchoscopy )([**2166-3-7**]) 2.
Hypertension 4.
Anemia 6.
No murmur appreciated Chest- CTA bilat Abd- +BS, soft, cachectic, NTND.
PEG tube in place with dressing c/d/i Ext- no pedal edema.
CXR [**3-18**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacity superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease, with recurrent pleural effusions.
This could reflect pulmonary edema or consolidation.
TTE [**3-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis and thinned, akinetic basal inferior and infero-lateral segments.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Findings consistent with severe emphysema and overlying failure or infection (less likely).
UIP is unlikely, given the minimal areas of focal traction and minimal fibrotic changes.
Left ventricular enlargement.
Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes might be reactive.
Moderate right pleural effusion, unchanged.
[**2166-3-25**] Video swallow eval: Moderate-to-severe pharyngeal dysphagia secondary to weakness with a right unilateral component, as well as reduced laryngeal elevation, valve closure and epiglottic deflection and decreased bolus propulsion, resulting in persistent penetration and frequent aspiration with all consistencies.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8072**] is an 86 yo M w/ h/o renal mass, HTN, mild dementia who was admitted with SOB and quickly transferred to the ICU.
SOB: Medical ICU Course: The patient was transferred to the Medical ICU after developing hypoxia during a blood transfusion on the floor.
Echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with EF 15-20%, and chest xray showed mild pulmonary edema with moderate pleural effusions.
The patient is a former smoker with emphysema, and had had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few months.
His acute hypoxia partly coincides with receiving IVF for possible cardiac catheterization and blood transfusion on the morning of transfer.
Given initial concern for PE, CT angiogram and LENIs were considered, however given patient's renal insufficiency, it was decided that he should not receive IV contrast.
In addition, after his ECHO showed dramatically low EF with pulmonary edema on imaging, suspicion for PE decreased and LENIs were not obtained.
Chest CT showed severe emphysema and evidence of CHF.
For his CHF with EF 15-20%, he will need close cardiology follow up with Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] to be arranged on Monday after discharge.
The severely depressed EF and global hypokinesis is concerning for severe LAD disease though the RV seems abnormal as well.
Per cardiology consult, suspicion for NSTEMI was low as hypokinesis was global, not regional, and plavix/heparin drip were discontinued.
Acute renal failure.
Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.
Pt has had several procedures to attempt biopsy with thoracic surgery including bronchoscopy without ability to characterize pathologically.
The pt had persistent swallowing problems throughout hospital stay and was evaluated several times by speech and swallow therapy.
He showed persistent aspiration.
ENT scoped pt and saw bowing of vocal chords consistent with weakness and deconditioning.
Due to this, PEG tube was placed [**3-28**] and initially used on [**3-29**] with no problems.
[**Name (NI) 30294**] Pt has BPH with new use of tamsulosin as outpt prior to admission.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) neb Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for SOB/ Wheeze.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for respiratory distress.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Systolic CHF with EF 15-20% Secondary diagnoses: COPD Renal mass Pneumonia Aspiration Weight loss   Discharge Condition: Good- O2 sat high 90's   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
This was determined to be due to a combination of congestive heart failure, COPD exacerbation and possibly a slight pneumonia as well.
ENT evaluated you and think you are suffering primary from weakness of your swallowing and speech muscles.
Please call your doctor or return to the ED if you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomitting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fevers or any other concerning symptoms.
