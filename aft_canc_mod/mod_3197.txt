History of Present Illness: 73F w/ metastatic lung cancer to brain, on radiation therapy, here with severe nausea and vomiting since this morning; sent from Rad [**Hospital **] clinic with severe hypertension and nausea/vomiting concerning for increased intracranial pressure.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (3) 48728**] with hypoxia and back pain; nausea and vomiting.
Patient's symptoms completely resolved with dexamethasone, complicated by steroid-induced psychosis.
States that she has not had any other symptoms, including headaches, changes in vision, dizziness, weakness, or numbness.
Reports exhaustion from not being able to sleep for 1.5d due to vomiting and nausea.
Pt reports fatigue and sleepiness.
CT head w/out contrast: vasogenic edema unchanged, but right parietal hyperdense lesion is more conspicuously hyperdense and slightly increased in size than on the prior.
This degree of increased hyperdensity would not be expected in the interval and raises concern for intralesional hemorrhage.
Recommended no acute neuro intervention.

[**2107-9-13**] CT HEAD W/O CON: Increased size of the hyperattenuated focus with a more amorphous appearance raises suspicion for a possible intralesional hemorrhage of the right parietal metastasis.
Otherwise, unchanged degree of vasogenic edema in the right parietal lobe.

Inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.

Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P  QRS  T  72 150 76 376/397 62 -53 29  Brief Hospital Course: This is the brief hospital course for a 73 year-old female with non-small cell lung carcinoma metastatic to the brain who presented here for evaluation of nausea, vomitting, and altered mental status.
CT scan was suspicious for intralesional brain hemorrhage in the right parietal metastasis and notable for an unchanged degree of vasogenic edema in that same parietal lobe.
Her nausea and vomitting were thought to be due to her intracranial processes and changes caused by weaning from decadron and the most recent episode of whole brain radiation which the patient underwent.
She was started on 6 mg Dexamethasone every 6 hours per neurosurgery recommendations, and after discussion with the cardiology service primary medicine team, and her family, her Plavix was discontinued as the risks of intracranial bleeding was thought to outweigh the benefits of blood thinning to prevent myocardial ischemia and stent re-stenosis.
# HYPERTENSION: She presented with systolic blood pressures in the 220s.
This was thought to be due to her intracranial process following weaning from decadron and also cerebral changes post-whole brain radiation.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Psychiatry was consulted given the patient's history of steroid induced psychosis, and they recommended starting Seroquel nightly at 12.5mg and once the patient's QTC was checked for prolongation, she was increased to a dose of 25mg nightly prior to bedtime.
# RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: This issue was stable and the patient remains on her Methotrexate and steroids for disease control.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: This issue was stable and the patient continues on ASA 81 mg daily, but has been discontinued from her clopidogrel dose for reasons listed above.
