Admission Date:  [**2121-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-12-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**] Chief Complaint:  BRBPR s/p catheterization procedure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory Laparotomy Right Colectomy Ileocolostomy  Cardiac cathetrization with stenting of the RPLB and RPDA.
man with a history of HTN, CAD who underwent catheterization on [**2121-9-24**] with placement of a total of 5 stents (4 drug eluting in the PLB, PDA and RCA (mid, distal and proximal) transferred from the CMI service for BRBPR.
The patient was cath'd in the setting of uncontrolled HTN, progressive DOE x 6 months and a positive stress test.
The patient's cath was without complication and revealed one vessel disease with in-stent restenosis from a prior cath to the RCA.
The patient is without symptoms, denying CP, SOB, dizziness or lightheadedness.
s/p cath in [**2116**] due to abnormal stress with totally occluded mid RCA and 50-70%proximal RCA with successful stenting x3.
Integumentary: No rashes or lesions.
CV: Systolic ejection murmur at 2nd intercostal space with faint radiation to the carotids.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%), without regional wall motion abnormalities.
There is abnormal flow in the left ventricle, consistent with a mid-cavitary gradient.
The aortic root and the ascending aorta are mildly dilated.
There may be minimal aortic valve stenosis, however present evaluation of aortic valve area is limited by high-velocity contamination from the intracavitary gradient.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small left ventricular cavity with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Probable minimal aortic stenosis.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
A repeat transthoracic study to reassess the mid-cavitary gradient and determine severity of aortic stenosis may be performed following an intravenous fluid challenge.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2121-9-27**] 8:38 PM  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with 2 infrarenal aotic aneursysms, HTN, CAD, s/p elective cath, with new LGIB, s/p EGD, cauterized for polyps/hemmorhoids, today w/ severe abd pain, unable to have BM.
There is stranding and cecal wall thickening within the right lower quadrant, with tiny adjacent foci of air.
This is consistent with focal perforation.
There is calcification of the gallbladder wall and then the gallbladder lumen, findings are consistent with a single large calcified stone or porcelain gallbladder.
There is aortic calcification noted, however there is no significant aneurysmal dilatation identified.
Localized area of transmural ischemic necrosis in the cecum, with acute perforation.
Acute peritonitis.
Mesentery (W-Z):  Adipose tissue with focal fresh hemorrhage.
A Colonoscopy showed 2 AVMs near the cecum in the ascending colon, started bleeding on manipulation - BiCapped/injected, accidentally perforated cecum.
[**3-5**] episodes of SOB lasting ~ 10 mins EKG unchanged, sinus with RBBB, old inf qs.
Pain: He became slightly confused with IV Morphine.
***** On [**10-5**], he was getting ready for discharge, but then was noted to have salmon-colored fluid emanating from the lower portion of his midline incision.
Bedside inspection demonstrated no evidence of evisceration.
He also received Lasix for LE edema and scrotal edema over the next several days.
