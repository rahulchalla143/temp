Admission Date:  [**2101-12-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-1-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2025-8-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer, type 2 diabetes, who presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of weakness.
The patient has been in declining health since [**2101-8-24**] secondary to his esophageal cancer and has noted decreasing po intake secondary to mucositis over the last few months.
The patient has also complained of increasing bilateral lower extremity edema over the last month and has been seen by his primary care physician in the past for intravenous fluid administration.
The patient was subsequently immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for progressive hypoxia.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for a cough for the last three to four weeks, which was worse when he attempted to eat or drink anything, as well as a low grade temperature and chills for the last two days.
The patient also has noted significantly increasing leg edema over the last few weeks.
Esophageal cancer treated with local radiation therapy, 5FU, Cisplatin diagnosed in [**2101-8-24**].
Status post Billroth 2 in the [**2060**] secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus times ten years.
Questionable abruption of many deep venous thrombosis.
Recurrent bladder infections.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a son who has been diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma.
Cardiovascular tachycardic, no murmurs.
Pulmonary diffuse rales.
Extremities 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees.
Free calcium 1.05.
CT of the head no evidence of bleed or mass, but low attenuation left cerebellar area.
CT of the chest, diffuse infiltrate consistent with congestive heart failure, but no evidence of PE.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was noted to have marked hypoxia at the time of admission, which was originally thought to be secondary to a PE, however, his CT angiogram was negative.
The CT scan also demonstrated evidence of an alveolar process, which was felt to be congestive heart failure versus pneumonia.
Given the lack of fever, sputum or increased white blood cell counts and given the patient's symptoms of increasing lower extremity edema, it was felt to be most likely secondary to congestive heart failure.
However, the patient was also noted to have a supraventricular tachycardia versus atrial flutter of unclear etiology.
However, cardioversion was attempted with 200 jewels and then 300 and 360 jewels without success resulting in a rhythm of multifocal atrial tachycardia.
The patient was treated with Lasix for gentle diuresis and cardiac enzymes were cycled to evaluate for the potential of myocardial ischemia as an initiating event.
The patient's multifocal atrial tachycardia persisted and an echocardiogram was obtained.
The echocardiogram demonstrated 4+ MR with a flail mitral leaflet and a normal end systolic dimensions.
Given that blood cultures obtained at the time of admission were subsequently demonstrating gram positive coxae in pairs and chains it was felt the patient was most likely suffering from endocarditis.
Therefore it was determined to attempt medical management of the patient's acute mitral regurgitation and endocarditis.
The infectious disease consult recommended removing the patient's Port-A-Cath so that the infection would be easier to cure with antibiotics.
They felt the most likely bug responsive was staph aureus versus enterococcus versus strep viridans versus a coag negative staph and therefore requested treatment with Penicillin.
Given the patient's history of a Penicillin allergy desensitization to the drug was initiated per protocol.
The patient's heart rate remained tachycardic, which is felt to be likely a compensatory response given the patient's poor forward flow secondary to acute mitral regurgitation.
Given the length (two weeks) of Gentamycin therapy for synergy against enterococcus the concern for ototoxicity was raised and an audiology consult was obtained.
Audiology recommended that the patient already had some hearing loss prior to admission for which he was seeking amplification therapies and recommended as little Gentamycin as possible with follow up audiology testing following release from the hospital.
Following transfer to the floor the patient's rhythm converted from a multifocal atrial tachycardia to atrial fibrillation.
Given the state of the patient's mitral valve endocarditis it was unlikely that the patient would be able to maintain his heart rate and normal sinus rhythm successfully.
They were incapable of curing the patient's primary problem and would likely only help with short term benefits.
However, the patient and his family once again reiterated their desire not to undergo surgical correction of his valvular disease.
Over the next few hospital days the patient continued to improve very slowly with mild decreases in his lower extremity edema and subjective decreases in shortness of breath and fatigue.
However, the patient continued to demonstrate mild setbacks such as on [**4-5**] when the patient was transferring from bed to chair and became acutely short of breath with a subsequent heart rate in the 150s, systolic blood pressure in the 60s and a drop in his oxygen saturations to 80 to 85%.
At this point, however, the patient was treated with intravenous Lopressor 5 mg times two doses with a subsequent drop in his heart rate to the 100s and a bump in his systolic blood pressure to the 190s.
In addition, the patient was started on a daily dose of Lasix at 20 mg po q day and was monitored for the appropriateness of that dose for continued effective gentle diuresis.
Therefore it was felt that the most important therapeutic intervention was to maintain the patient's heart rate at approximately 100 and therefore the patient's beta blocker should not be held unless his blood pressure was low enough to cause low urine output or mental status changes.
The patient was transferred to rehabilitation on the 20th with thirty more days of antibiotic therapy remaining via his PICC line and a stable cardiac regimen obtained for management of his acute mitral regurgitation.
