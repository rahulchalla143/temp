History of Present Illness: 70 year old male with h/o Whipple in '[**01**] for duodenal adenocarcinoma and esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell ca  in [**2108**] who became jaundiced with fever in [**9-2**].
MRCP on [**9-2**] showed diffuse dilatation of intrahepatic biliary tree.
[**9-5**] Cholangiogram demonstrated a high-grade stricture in the common hepatic duct, with dilation in both R and L hepatic duct.
MRCP on [**9-10**] showed a 1.9 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm mass concering for cholangiocarcinoma,located centrally in Klatskin location, causing obstruction of R and left hepatic bile ducts.
Past Medical History: Duodenal adenocarcinoma (Whipple surgery in [**2101**]), esophageal squamous cell cancer with esophagectomy in [**2108**], dental abscess with drainage in [**5-2**], left incisional hernia repair in [**2109**], right incisional hernia repair [**2113**].
ECHO (PMG Internal Medicine and Cardiology, [**2115-8-13**]): normal LV and RV size and systolic function mild thickening of the aortic and mitral valves without vegetations or stenosis trace AR, MR, and TR.
No history of recreational drug use.
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: Post Op T-101, 84, 96/57, 18, 98%2L, 68.7 kg Gen: Drowsy but arousable, c/o pain with movement HEENT: temporal wasting noted, dry mucous membranes Card: RRR, no M/R/G Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abd: 3 PTC drains in place with bilious appearing fluid and 1 JP.
Abdomen soft, tender on palpation non-distended Extr: No edema, 2+ DPs Neuro: no focal deficits Skin: warm and dry GU: Foley in place, 400 cc in bag  Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2115-10-15**] WBC-9.1 RBC-3.73* Hgb-11.0* Hct-32.3* MCV-87 MCH-29.5 MCHC-34.1 RDW-20.6* Plt Ct-487* PT-15.8* PTT-34.4 INR(PT)-1.4* Glucose-102 UreaN-11 Creat-0.4* Na-136 K-4.0 Cl-101 HCO3-26 AnGap-13 ALT-119* AST-183* AlkPhos-226* TotBili-3.5* On Discharge [**2115-10-25**] WBC-5.7 RBC-3.52* Hgb-10.6* Hct-30.4* MCV-86 MCH-30.1 MCHC-34.8 RDW-18.5* Plt Ct-468* Glucose-84 UreaN-11 Creat-0.7 Na-135 K-3.6 Cl-102 HCO3-26 AnGap-11 ALT-30 AST-33 AlkPhos-600* TotBili-2.2*  Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o male admitted following Exploratory laparotomy, hepaticojejunostomy, bile duct biopsy.
No tumors or malignancies demonstrated within the metastatic deposits within the abdominal cavity or on the liver itself.
On the distal aspect of bile duct there appeared to be a large amount of sclerotic tissue and possibly intraluminal mass.
Extending further up into the hilum, there was extensive sclerotic reaction, and at this time patient was deemed unresectable.
In the post op period in the PACU the patient became hypotensive and was febrile to 101.9.
Blood and urine cultures reported as no growth.
He was slowly transitioned to POs On [**10-21**] he underwent tube cholangiogram which showed evidence of a small leak at the level of the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis.
As well, he has redemonstration of hilar, right and left biliary strictures as before.
CT of abdomen on [**10-22**] shows: Four drainage catheters  are in place, including: the external-internal biliary drain, a right lateral drain coursing through the liver and terminating at the hepaticojejunostomy (2:23), a drain entering the skin at the right lower abdomen and coursing superiorly and terminating medial to the left lobe of liver near the diaphragm, and a drain entering the left mid abdomen, coursing medially, possibly through the left lobe of liver into the hepatic hilum.
The second mentioned drain located in the right lateral abdomen posterior to the external-internal biliary drain is well positioned adjacent to the hepaticojejunostomy, at the site of demonstrated leak.
No significant collection is seen surrounding this drainage tube.
Patient to have cholangiogram during the following week and follow up with DR [**First Name (STitle) **] to determine plan of care.
He remained afebrile and was discharged home on PO Cipro.
