He called 911 and by the time the EMS arrived his pain had dissipated.
1 week priro to presentation, pt reports similar pain which lasted 10 minutes in duration, then resolved.
had again similar right sided back/shoulder/flank pain [**11-4**] acute in onset.
He was supposed to leave on vactaion to [**State 108**] today, but due to the pain decided to come to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaulation.
By the time he arrived, his pain had resolved.
He explains the pain is non-reproducible with no aggravating or alleviating factors.
INR was 1.5 with normal Tbili, ALT of 24 and AST of 75, and alk phos of 227 (all consistent with recent baseline).
CXR showed no infiltrate.
EKG was without ischemic changes.
Of note the patient has been seen in the H/O clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **], where he has been noted to have decreased PO intake and low blood pressures.
In regards to his RCC diagnosed in [**11/2130**], he is curreenlty a high risk candidate for resection given his pulmonary disease.
He was recently admitted in [**9-/2131**] for similar symptoms of hypotension deemed to be from poor PO intake which was fluid responsive.
ROS: Currently, patient endorses flank pain x2 weeks, started out [**11-4**], in the middle of back, radiating up to right shoulder.

Was manager of a truck shop.
Family History: No family hx of cancer, CAD, or kidney disease.
Mother died of a stroke at 91.
Anicteric sclera.
No sublingual jaundice.
No oral ulcers, lesions, or poor dentition noted.
No cervical LAD palpated.
Lungs:  Basilar dry inspiratory crackles noted bilaterally, Left>Right.
No wheezes or rhonchi auscultated.
Midline scar c/w prior bypass surgery.
Midline ventral hernia under scar.
Diffuse hypopigmentation on chest s/o tinea versicolor.
POor nail hygiene.
1+ PTP noted bilaterally.
No asterixis, but does have tremulousness at baseline.
No spider angiomata, no palmar erythema.
Neck:  Supple, has minimal JVD Resp: [**Hospital1 **]-basilar end expiratory crackles CV: RRR, fixed split S2, no m/r/g Abdomen:  Obese, soft, non distended, caput medusa, mild reducible ventral hernia along mid upper abdominal surgical scar, unable to reliably assess for organomegally d/t obesity.
Extremities:  bil tibial edema L>R (long standing per patient) no calf tenderness, normal peripheral pulses.
Studies: CXR [**2132-1-13**]: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with chronic interstitial lung disease, unchanged.
No new areas of focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other explanation for hematocrit drop.
Overall stable size and appearance of heterogeneous right renal mass which continues to be highly suspicious for renal cell carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64-year-old man with history of COPD/Pulmonary fibroiss, RCC and EtOH/NASH cirrhosis who presented with right flank pain and hypotension.
# Hypotension: Differential of poor po intake vs. adrenal insufficiency vs. infectious etiology.
He had no focus of infection and his cultures were negative on the day of discharge.
He was cared for the in the ICU with hypotension to continuously 60's to 80's SBP despite receiving fluid boluses.
Cause of hypotensive most likely mild dehydration [**2-27**] poor oral intake, as patient admits to poor po intake and drinking a 6 pack of beer daily.
Considered adrenal insufficeincy in the face of chronic steroid use.
It was thought that although he had been a slow steroid taper for his chronic lung disease, he could be mildly adrenally insufficient.
On discharge, he should continue on prednisone 5mg every other day and prn IVF if SBP<90 or symptomatic.
# Right flank pain: Likely related to renal capsular distention from right renal mass, with referred pain to right shoulder likely due to diaphragmatic irritation.
Had CT scan as HCT dropped from 30's to mid 20's in the face of multiple fluid boluses.
No retroperitoneal bleed or subcapsular hemorrhage noted.
No clinical signs of cholelithiasis.
No nephrolithiasis seen on CT.
His pain was controlled on oxycodone 2.5 mg q6 prn.
# Acute kidney injury: Possibly secondary to hypovolemia from poor po intake.
Urine electrolytes c/w prerenal etiology.
Labs to follow-up: Mr. [**Known lastname 35121**] had an elevated TSH to 27 while in house.
