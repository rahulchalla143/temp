New wall thickening and inflammatory change around a short segment of right colon near the hepatic flexure.
While this could represent inflammation related to diverticular disease, or other infectious or inflammatory causes, this loop of colon is situated close to multiple metastatic foci within the liver, and metastatic disease, or direct extent of tumor should also be considered.
Increased size of multiple hepatic metastases.
Free intraperitoneal air, presumably related to peritoneal dialysis.
Moderate right hydronephrosis, with dense material now seen in the right renal collecting system and bladder.
This appearance is concerning for hemorrhage, unless there has been recent radiographic procedure with injection of contrast directly into the collecting system.
Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
Grossly unchanged appearance of 5.5 cm descending thoracic and suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
KUB: IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel with residual air in the colon, this could be an ileus and less likely a new or incomplete SBO.
There continue to be dilated small bowel loops measuring up to 4.6 cm consistent with patient's known small-bowel obstruction.
There is some increased opacity at the right base and right mid lung consistent with infiltrate that is slightly improved compared to the prior exam.
2) Occlusive thrombus in the left basilic vein.
Multilevel degenerative changes, with neural foraminal narrowing and spinal stenosis, most pronounced at L4-5 level.
Faint foci of sclerosis in several vertebral bodies, unchanged from the most recent prior study; however, not present in [**2142**] and while these can represent bone islands, given the history, also concerning for metastatic foci.
Upper abdominal ascites.
Given the increase in size, these may represent metastatic lesions, though the appearance is nonspecific and resembles bone islands.
No cortical discontinuity noted.
Lung, pleural and vascular changes as described above, incompletely imaged and characterized on the present study.
Distended bowel loops on the scout image with mildly increased diameter since the prior study scout- to correlate clinically to exclude obstructive etiology.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above, causing moderate-to-severe neural foraminal narrowing as described above, and mild canal stenosis.
Partially imaged T3 sclerotic focus, better assessed on the concurrent CT T spine study.
Significant atherosclerotic vascular calcifications as above.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Limited evaluation for intracranial metastases, though no obvious mass or edema is identified.
Chronic left posterior parietal infarct.
Octreotide-avid disease in a right pubic bone sclerotic lesion and increased uptake in the musculature posterior to the left greater trochanter, compatible with carcinoid.
Innumerable heterogeneous hepatic lesions in both lobes, some of which are subcapsular, warrant follow-up.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MI, Metastatic Carcinoid and chronic abd/back pain who presents with decreased po intake, diarrhea, lethargy and hypotension found to have colitis on CT. His hospital course showed a progressive decline in function where his mental status and physical condition slowly declined despite treatment of his medical problems.
AMS: Variable course over his stay, likely multifactorial with possible etiologies including narcotics, toxic/metabolic related to renal failure.
It appears to be most consistent with delirium.
The patient initially presented with abdominal pain to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with hypotension and a hct drop.
At [**Hospital3 417**] the patient had a CT Abd/Pelvis scan which revealed stable AAA and colitis adjacent to the hepatic flexure and worsening metastatic disease.
He was evaluated by surgery and vascular who did not feel there were any acute surgical issues.
The patient was hypotensive and required levophed and transferred to the MICU.
He was also empirically started on Zosyn for colitis/diverticulitis and also initiated on IV vancomycin for peritonitis.
The patient's peritoneal fluid was sent for analysis and was found to have elevated WBC count, however the culture showed no growth.
He was started on TPN for nutrition and bowel rest per surgery.
The patient's pain was managed initially with percocet.
He continued to have pain and was seen by Pain & Palliative Care.
Peritonitis ??????
The patient peritoneal fluid was negative for organisms.
Thrombus: Pt was found to have increased upper extremity swelling.
Additionally, his PICC line was also removed given the concern of thrombus formation and due to the fact that his PICC line was on the right side.
Ileus: On [**3-7**] the patient had a KUB that showed dilated loops of bowel likely ileus/partial SBO.
Metastatic Carcinoid: The patient with known liver mets and followed by hem/onc with apparent worsening disease on his CT.
Addtionally, if the patient continued to have pain octerotide could be utilized for palliation.
The patient was also seen by pain and palliative care who recommended oxycontin 10mg Q12 with percocet for breakthough pain and was increased to 10mg TID.
His pain regimen was changed and was increased to oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **], gabapentin 100mg qHS, standing tylenol, and dilaudid 2mg q4:prn for break through.
The patient had continued back pain and additionally weakness.
He underwent CT scan of his C,T,L spine that showed new sclerotic lesions concerning for malignancy.
He was evaluated by Spine Surgery that did not feel the patient's exam or imaging were consistent with cord compression or need surgical treatment.
He underwent octreotide scan that showed carcinoid in the right pubic bone, musculature poas[**Name (NI) **] to the left greater trochanter, and liver.
LFTs peaked now trending down, patient had coagulopathy which improved during hospital course.
There was concern for GI bleed given his dark stools, but was guaiac negative.
CAD s/p CABG/NSTEMI: The patient denied CP and EKGs was at baseline.
The patient's BB was held due to hypotension and was not restarted.
At discharge did not have any peripheral access.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor Last Name **] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Colitis Peritonitis  Secondary: Carcinoid tumor with mets to liver Hypertension Hyperlipidemia CAD s/p CABG x 4 ESRD on PD CAD AAA H/o ruptured disk   Discharge Condition: Stable, normotensive, O2 sat >95% RA   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the hospital.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of low blood pressure, back pain and abdominal pain.
You were treated with antibiotics for colitis and peritonitis.
You were also seen by Pain and Palliative Care who recommended a pain regimen for you to control your pain.
