Admission Date:  [**2167-12-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-3-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital6 33**] for cord compression  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: XRT to spine  History of Present Illness: 69 year old man with past medical history significant for htn, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hosp on [**2167-12-19**] with concern for thoracic cord compression.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2167-12-15**] with a complaint of low back pain and difficulty ambulating.
He was sent for CT scan on [**12-15**] and CT scan showed a large bulky soft tissue mass 13x12 cm encasing the left kidney with extension into the pelvis, partially encasing left common iliac artery.
The pt returned home on [**12-15**] with a prescription for Vicodin, but on [**12-16**] the pain in the pt's back became too severe and on [**12-17**] he presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED.
The pt reported that since [**Month (only) 1096**] he had been experiencing anorexia, weight loss of 12 lbs, increasing abdominal bloating and drenching night sweats.
The pt was admitted for management of acute renal failure, abdominal mass concerning for lymphoma and hypercalcemia.
During his OSH hospitalization the pt was found to have low back pain with difficulty ambulating and was evaluated by neurology which recommended MRI of the lumbar spine.
MRI of lumbar spine showed marrow enhancement with evidence of cord compression from L1 to T11.
The pt was then transferred on [**2167-12-19**] for further management of cord compression.
HEENT: Oropharyngx clear, poor dentition, EOMI, PERRLA, no cervical or clavicular LAD.
CARDIAC: RRR no m/g/r S1, S2 nl LUNG: CTA anteriorly, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi ABDOMEN: soft, NT/ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, bowel sounds present EXT: warm, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema NEURO: A+O x3, CN II-XII intact Motor: Symmetric strength in upper extremities, absent pronator drift bilaterally, Diminished strength in bilateral lower extremities, legs in frog-leg position, unable to lift legs off bed, able to wiggle toes [**Last Name (un) **]: Symmetric sensation bilateral upper and lower extremities.
DERM: Left forehead lesion with hypopigmentation and two nevi   Pertinent Results: Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2167-12-19**]: BONE MARROW EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED BY A HIGH-GRADE B CELL LYMPHOMA Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: a Lambda restricted B cell lymphoma that co-expresses CD10.
Cytospin preparation of the FNA demonstrates a lymphoid population that consists of large atypical cells with high N:C ratio and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles.
Previously identified posterior, epidural lesion in the region of approximately T11 through L1 is not well evaluated on the current study.
Diffuse abnormal, heterogeneous signal seen throughout the vertebral bodies, most consistent with diffuse infiltration with lymphoma.
Low signal lesions consistent with previously seen lytic metastases identified within the iliac bones.
Acute-appearing right lower lobe lobar and segmental pulmonary embolism.
Distended gallbladder containing multiple gallstones and mild pericholecystic fluid.
These findings are suspicious for acute cholecystitis.
If clinical concern remains for acute cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be of diagnostic benefit.
Left retroperitoneal mass encasing the left kidney and ureter diagnosed by recent biopsy as B-cell lymphoma.
Probably no interval change in extent or appearance compared to CT of [**2167-12-29**].
Delayed left renal nephrogram concerning for poor renal function.
Marked hydroureteronephrosis suggesting an obstructive component to the surrounding mass, likely near the UVJ.
Areas of ureteral wall irregularity raise concern for local invasion as described.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Possible bone lesion right iliac bone.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14966**] is a 70 year old man with past medical history significant for hypertension, who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospitak on [**2167-12-19**] with concern for thoracic cord compression who was found to have mantle cell lymphoma, blastic variant.
He ultimately died in the ICU secondary to a GI bleed.
He was transferred back to the floor and the following evening had a large bloody bowel movement which prompted transfer back to the ICU.
He had a brisk bleed and was transfused multiple units of RBCs, platelets, and FFP.
# Mantle Cell Lymphoma, blastic variant: The pt had biopsy of his retroperitoneal mass on admission, and the biopsy revealed a high-grade lymphoma.
Further pathology revealed likely Mantle Cell Lymphoma, blastic variant.
Counts steadily increased and the patient underwent the following regimen: ICE: Tolerated without significant issue Intrathecal Ara-C: After first round of intrathecal chemotherapy patient experienced altered mental status which did improve after one week.
# Tumor lysis syndrome: The pt was initially in acute renal failure likely secondary to tumor lysis syndrome.
# Pulmonary Embolus: Pt.
was complaining of pleuritic chest pain on [**2167-1-13**], localized to the right upper quadrant.
Previous port site with hematoma on [**2168-1-18**], heparin stopped.
Hypoxia and hypotension resolved, unclear as to etiology.
# Cholecystitis: Pt.
was complaining of constant RUQ pain around the same time as his complaints of pleuritic chest pain.
was draining normally with no bilious liquid in JP drain, drain was removed and staples removed.
Had an episode of bleeding from site while on heparin, but no other problems since heparin stopped.
His mental status cleared completely and his left leg weakness did improve allowing him to walk several steps with assistive devices.
Intrathecal Depocyt([**3-13**])/ICE([**3-15**]) # 2: Overnight [**3-17**] the patient developed fever, altered mental status, vomiting and poor cough.
He was transfered to the ICU for intubation and supportive care.
AMS: The patient was admitted to the ICU in mid [**Month (only) 547**] for altered mental status and his work up revealed encephalitis likely secondary to chemo effects.
He had an EEG consistent with encephalopathy, an MRI showing two small CVAs, and a negative LP.
Overnight, approximately 6 hours after his return he passed a large bloody bowel movement and was again transferred to the ICU.
# Cord Compression: Got XRT to spine for cord compr from L retroperitoneal mass on [**12-20**], 22, 23.
Mass decreased, seen by urology who decided against stent placement.
