New bilateral patchy opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia/aspiration.
Findings concerning for fluid overload.
3) No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
5) Cirrhosis without mass lesions 6) No gallstones, no evidence of cholecystitis 7) Low portal flow velocities, likely [**3-13**] low systemic BP .
Rounded atelectasis in the right lower lobe, which has increased slightly in the interval.
Stable appearance of pancreatic cystic lesion.
Cirrhosis and small amount of ascites in the left pericolic gutter.

Blood cx [**12-19**] and [**12-21**] pend Urine cx [**12-18**] neg   Brief Hospital Course: Brieflyl, this is a 53 yo M w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis on the transplant list, chronic pancreatitis with DM, anemia, admitted w/ hypotension refractory to fluids, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.
#Hypotension:  Likely due to hypovolemia and infection.
Initially it was felt that the most likely etiology of the pts hypotension was his cirrhosis, but possible other etiologies of acute change included distributive (septic), cardiogenic and hypovolemic.
There was initial suggestion of infection with CXR findings and lactate of 2.9, but the pt was afebrile with only mild nonproductive cough and good UOP.
The pt had no signs of SBP, and per hepatology services the pt did not meet criteria to require paracentesis.
The pt was started on levofloxacin and flagyl on [**12-18**] in the case of pneumonia (given new CXR infiltrates).
A component of hypovolemia/dehydration was also suspected, supported by clinical exam and FeNa of 0.07%.
# PNA:  Given the pts new cough, elevated WBC, and CXR infiltrates, the pt was started on levofloxacin and flagyl IV on [**12-18**].
The pts bilirubin was elevated throughout this admission (21 on admission, baseline 3)w/ no evidence of obstruction; but RUQ US did not have good view of CBD.
The pt is extremely jaundiced.
The pt has chronic ascites [**3-13**] cirrhosis.
UNa was less than 10 with U osm 577 c/w low intravascular volume.
He did not show signs of encephalopathy during his stay on the floor.
Diabetes: No prior h/o DM but presenting glucose >500, suspect due to chronic pancreatitis.
No gap metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.
Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased from baseline plt 70-100 ([**3-13**] cirrhosis) with no evidence of bleeding.
Anemia: Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
Hyponatremia: The pt had hyponatremia on admission of Na 119 (baseline 31) likely due to cirrhosis with decreased EAV.
His hyponatremia resolved with IVF.
