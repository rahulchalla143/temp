Of note she has had multiple admissions for the same symptoms and recent admission [**Date range (1) 69952**] for altered mental status (worsening gait, aphasia) of unclear etiology though seemed to improve with antibiotics (though no clear infection).
Of note her MS waxed and waned during that admission with no evidence of seizure activity corresponding, negative LP and MRI.
She does have a chronically trapped left ventricle so neurosurgery was consulted regarding semi-elective stereotactic drainage of her chronically trapped left ventricle when all infectious issues resolved.
She returned to the ED today with complaint of functional decline at home, characterized by increased episodes of agitation and yelling.
In the several days prior to admission, she had a slowly decline, with episodes of aggitation (sometimes aggressive), worsening aphasia, and worsening ambulation (she was unable to get to bathroom, seemingly unable to move her feet).
He notes no focal symptoms at home (no cough, HA, sob, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria, rash).
Patient was given ativan 1mg iv x2 for agitation with good effect, though on previous admit had paradoxical rxn to ativan and responded well to haldol.
She was seen in the ED by the neurology service and thought to have no new neurologic symptoms on exam.
Over the course of the subsequent hour, she became arousable and followed commands but remained somnolent and confused.
Per her husband no fevers, chills, c/o HA, neck pain, cough, sob, cp, palpitations, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, back pain, rash, joint swelling or pain, abdominal pain.

Interval increase in right maxillary sinus opacification and air-fluid level.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Altered mental status: admitted to ICU for monitoring after episode of somnolence which improved with Ativan administration.
Patient had EEG which demonstrated diffuse slowing without seizure activity.
No evidence of infection.
During ICU course, had brief periods of calling out initially, but at transfer, no further episodes of agitation or somnolence for hours.
Hip Pain: X-ray negative for fracture  3.
on [**2160-3-25**] patient had a prolonged episode in the morning where she was unresponsive, EEG showed fast activity but lots superimposed artifacts were noted.
She was in a presumed non convulsive status, Ativan 2mg + 2mg was given and we noticed EEG changes and clinically the patient improved and became responsive.
On [**2160-3-26**] Keppra was decreased and the discontinued on [**2160-3-27**] due to the possibility of contributing for her behavioral deterioration.
Patient had a schedule ventriculostomy with shunt of the encephalomalacia cavity per neurosurgery.
During this admission this procedure was cancelled and will be re-addressed after evaluation of her lymphoma stage status.
On [**2160-3-30**] patient presented episode of unresponsiveness, not responded to ativan IV, No obvious change in the EEG.
Chest CTA was done concerning for PE which she had in the past, and showed 1.
New ground-glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities within both lungs concerning for an infectious process.
In addition urine culture was positive for enterococcus.
The prolonged EEG monitoring showed frequent activity in the left temporal region.
Patient underwent brain PET to evaluate areas of abnormal metabolism and significant changes were observed.
After D/C ATB she continued to present episodes of agitiation and confusion.
It occurred while she was on continuous EEG monitoring and there was no seizure activity present.

She also had a positive UA at that time.
She had a relative decrease in her BP and metoprolol was stopped and during recovery again titrated for elevated SBP.
In the setting of c. dif she was found to have some subclinical seizure activity on EEG while off lyrica and lamotrigine due to inability to take po.
She also has an episode on [**4-26**] of decreased responsiveness.
On [**2160-4-10**] she developed a gradually increasing transaminitis which resolved by [**4-18**].
