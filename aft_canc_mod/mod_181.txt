Course:  The pt is a 69 year-old R-handed male with minimal PMH who presents with new onset R sided weakness, slurred speech, left eye deviation, and right sided field cut.
In  the ED, he presented with with eye deviation left eye deviation and right hemiparesis and aphasia.
His CT showed left MCA sign and his CTA shows left ICA occlusion( can not rule out carotid dissection) and MCA occlusion.
He was given tPA at 323am, but tPA was held due to severe vomiting and headache (also notice trace blood in the emesis).
His exam then worsened at 430am and he had hemiplegia and worsening aphasia.
He had an MRI/MRA which showed an acute L-ICA thrombotic occlusion with a large left hemispheric infarct.
The etiology of ICA occlusion could be either atherosclerotic or due to a dissection.
Mr [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by speech and swallow, and was unable to consistently initiate oral transit with a high risk of aspiration.
He had a video swallow which also showed significant aspiration.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a severe global aphasia, although it does appear at times he is comprehending information, responding with occasionally appropriate yes/no head responses.
Speech pathology worked with Mr. [**Known lastname **] with AAC picture boards and a Lightwriter were, but neither were successful at this time.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did seem to have complaints of leg pain, though it was difficult to assess given his severe global aphasia.
There was no warmth or erythema or tenderness to palpation, although he was noted by sursing to have a slight asymmetry in his calf size, with the left side larger (circumference 1.5" greater).
Therefore, lower extremity ultrasound was obtained, which was negative for DVT.
Also, 2d after Foley was removed, he exhibited urinary frequency and seemed to c/o lower abdominal discomfort.
He was straight-cathed at that time, and may require repeat Foley catheterization or straight catheterization for urination initially.

6. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) ML Injection TID (3 times a day) as needed for DVT ppx.
The patient has a history of left knee pain and has      undergone arthroscopy several times.

Prostate Cancer, s/p radiation seeding   Discharge Condition: alert, awake.
Right facial droop.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to our Neurology service at [**Hospital1 18**] and found to have a large stroke on the left side of your brain.
The stroke has caused you to have weakness on your right side and to be unable to communicate verbally or fully understand language.
If your swallowing ability recovers, this could be taken out in the future.
