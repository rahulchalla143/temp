Admission Date:  [**2142-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-5-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**] Chief Complaint: Hematuria  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 79M with severe AS, metastatic prostate cancer with recent pseudomonal UTI, hydronephrosis s/p bilateral stent placement last month, presenting with hematuria and found to be hypotensive.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 79432**] with ARF and new hydronephrosis/hydroureter requiring urologic stent placement.
Since this admission he has been watching his fluid intake and has actually lost weight (7#) in addition to noting improvement in leg edema.
He thinks his doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have further decreased torsemide down to 20 mg daily but is unsure.
He had mild but continued gross hematuria at time of discharge.
This became sigificantly worse about 3 days ago and was associated with urinary frequency (voiding hourly) and feeling of distension and spasm.
Given the hematuria and anemia, asked to come to [**Hospital1 18**].
He had some small clots.
He was going to the floor, but developed intermittent episodes of hypotension to the high 80's.
On the floor, patient reports feeling well, no complaints.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, headache, neck pain, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath since discharge.
No change in orthopnea.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: - severe aortic stenosis: 0.8-1 valve area echo [**3-/2142**] - Prostate cancer s/p radiation therapy with metastatic disease to bone and lungs.
- CAD: high coronary calcium though no flow limiting disease on cath [**3-/2141**]; no history of MI.
- Atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin - chronic kidney disease: creatinine 1.4-1.7 - diastolic dysfunction - pericardial calcification with ?restrictive physiology on cath [**3-/2141**] - s/p appendectomy   Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 3844**].
-ETOH: None -Illicit drugs: None   Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Father passed away of pneumonia in his 40s.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no distress.
CV: irregular, loud systolic murmur best at RUSB with radiation to carotids.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place, fruit punch colored urine but most recent urine appears slightly less bloody Ext: slightly cool, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
2+ bilateral pedal edema.
Low lung volumes, new retrocardiac opacity could be atelectasis.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
Stable cardiomegaly, with pericardial calcification along the right heart.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
[**2142-5-15**] Echo EF > 65%; Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension; Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-4-3**], the findings are similar.
Brief Hospital Course: 79M with metastatic prostate cancer, hydronephrosis s/p recent urologic stenting, recent pseudomonal UTI, and severe aortic stenosis was admtited with hematuria and hypotension.
Due to his hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s, he was initially admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the medical floor.
Upon arrival in the ICU, the differential diagnosis for his hypotension was broad, including infection, volume depletion, and adrenal insufficiency.
He was started initially on broad spectrum antibiotics for coverage of urinary pathogens, fluid resuscitation, and stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
His hypotension was ultimately thought most likely related to volume depletion in light of aggressive diuresis and hematuria.
Etiology was thought most likely related to radiation cystitis.
As his hematuria improved, continuous bladder irrigation was discontinued and the patient was able to void independently.
Acute Renal Failure.
He had an acute elevation in his creatinine.
A renal ultrasound did not show any evidence of obstruction.
Metastatic prostate cancer.
He was initially on stress dose steroids for treatment of adrenal insufficiency as a cause of his hypotension.
Adrenal insufficiency appeared less likely and his steroids were rapidly tapered to his home regimen.
Recent pseudomonal UTI.

Benign Hypertension 2.
Atrial Fibrillation 3.
Coronary Artery Disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with hematuria (blood in the urine) and low blood pressures.
This was most likely related to bladder problems related to your radiation.
You also developed significant swelling in your legs after receiving fluids and this gradually improved.
- flomax: We have discontinued this medication due to your low blood pressure.
- Metoprolol: We have decreased this dose due to your low blood pressures in the hospital.
