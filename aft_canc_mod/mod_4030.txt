Admission Date:  [**2146-11-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-11-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-9-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Latex / Cefazolin / Red Dye / Cephalosporins / Nickel  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**] Chief Complaint: low abdominal pain, bloating, CT with abdominal ascites  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: paracentesis  History of Present Illness: This is a 55 yo G0 s/p [**4-7**] exlap/BSO for a large left adnexal mass found to be stage 1C mucinous borderline tumor of the ovary who presented to gyn oncology clinic yesterday with concern for low abdominal pain and bloating.
She had been attributing her abdominal pain to diet and NSAID use, but found that altering these had minimal effect.
She reports that laying supine leads to nausea and vomitting.
This has led her to sleep in a reclining chair, which she believes has caused some back pain.
Prelim read revealed:  "Moderate ascites with multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes and peritoneal implants, worrisome for metastatic disease.
There is a loop of jejunum demonstrating marked wall thickening, raising concern for metastatic involvement.
There is no evidence of obstruction with passage of contrast beyond this point and lack of upstream dilation.
Other loops of small bowel also demonstrate mild mucosal thickening.
Periumbilical subcutaneous nodule, measuring 2.1 cm, may also represent metastatic disease.
There is a 8 mm right breast nodule.
Moderate sized axial hiatal hernia.
Stage IC borderline mucinous tumor of the left ovary, treated with BSO and biopsy as above.
Family History: No history of breast or gyn malignancy.
[**2146-11-17**] CT scan Final Report INDICATION: 55-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with recurrent ovarian cancer.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast [**2146-11-9**].
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases show evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions.
A 2-mm nodule reported along the pleura of the left lower lobe is not visualized in this study.
A hiatal hernia is once again noted.
A hyperdense lesion measuring 9.2 x 9.2 mm is once again noted in the right breast.
At the junction of segments V and VI of the right lobe of the liver, there is a 25 x 25 mm well-demarcated, low-density lesion which has not changed in size, previously measuring 25 x 25 mm.
The pancreas is normal appearing without evidence of masses.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Ascitic fluid is noted throughout the abdominal cavity, unchanged in appearance from that noted on prior CT. Mesenteric stranding and thickening consistent with omental caking is noted.
There is thickened peritoneum suggesting peritoneal implants.
Findings are consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis, concerning for metastatic disease.
Small supradiaphragmatic/left paracardial lymph nodes are noted (2, 15).
Within the region of the umbilicus, in the soft tissues, there is a 20 x 10 mm density that likely represents a small umbilical hernia, but could represent a metastatic lesion (2, 38).
The proximal and mid small bowel loops appear dilated.
Findings are suggestive of partial small-bowel obstruction.
The aorta and abdominal vasculature appear patent.
There is no free air noted.
The uterus and adnexa are not clearly visualized secondary to ascitic fluid, however a nodular mass about the fundus of the uterus is noted, which could be exophytic fibroid or metastases.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: An area of sclerosis is seen in the posterior aspect of the right iliac bone.
Proximal and mid small bowel loops are dilated with a possible transition point in the distal terminal ileum, with no dilation of large bowel.
Findings are consistent with partial small-bowel obstruction.
Ascites with omental caking and peritoneal implants are noted unchanged from prior CT, concerning for recurrence of ovarian metastatic disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusion.
A nodular mass is noted above the fundus of the uterus.
The differential diagnosis includes metastases versus exophytic fibroid.
A right-sided breast nodule is noted.
A hypodense lesion is noted in the lower pole of the right kidney, too small to characterize; attention on follow up.
No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion persists.
No gross osseous abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
Small right pleural effusion.
Extensive alveolar diffuse opacities and consolidations have worsened consistent with worsening severe pulmonary edema.
[**2146-11-20**] SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM: Severe ARDS.
There has been markedly improvement in still moderate diffuse alveolar opacities most likely due to markedly improved moderate pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the gyn oncology service for further work up of her ascites, abd pain, and nausea and vomiting.
*) Recurrence of ovarian mucinous cancer The pt was given IV fluids for rehydration and symptomatic relief with zofran and famotidine.
Her CA-125 was noted to be elevated at 275.
She underwent paracentesis on HD#2 which led to drainage of 3000cc of ascitic fluid.
Cytology revealed malignant cells consistent with involvement by the patients known mucinous ovarian neoplasm and likely represented a recurrence.
A pelvic US [**11-12**] revealed a heterogeneous endometrium consistent with appearance in [**2142**] and a large amount of complex ascites.
HD#5 the pt was to undergo a biopsy of an abdominal nodule but this area was felt to be a hernia at time of biopsy and no biopsy was performed.
HD#6 a mammogram was done to evaluate the right breast nodule and it was felt to be benign.
HD#7 the pt underwent another CT abd/pelvis due to worsening abd sx which revealed a partial SBO.
She was added on for the OR for a likely bowel resection, possible resection of recurrent mucinous borderline tumor on HD#9.
She had an EKG which was unremarkable except for sinus tachycardia and a normal CXR.
Upon entering the abdomen 5 liters of ascites was drained and diffuse invasive tumor was noted throughout her dilated small bowel as well as within the mesentery and coating the large bowel and stomach.
There were multiple areas of small bowel with also complete obstruction.
The small bowel was edematous and there were no areas noted to be free of tumor.
There was no distinct tumor seen on the appendix.
The tumor also covered the surface of the uterus and bladder and pelvic sidewall.
The patient became unstable with hypotension requiring a pressor and becoming hypoxic and tachycardic.
Anesthesia had noted a small amount of aspiration at the time of intubation and a bronchoscopy was done which revealed a small amount of aspirate and this was suctioned.
The patient became slightly less hypoxic but later again desaturated and anesthesia again did bronchoscopy and pushed in 100% oxygen to open the aeriolae.
She was given deep, high pressure breaths and 2units of PRBCs were pushed to improve the hypotension and likely hypovolemia given the 5 liters of ascites removed.
She was noted to be in shock and a CXR revealed signficant bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS.
CXR showed radiographic improvement of lung opacities bilaterally the following day, however the patient remained hypoxic with multiple pressor requirement.
Given substantial tumor [**Last Name (STitle) 8373**] and poor prognosis, the patient's husband made the decision to make the patient comfort-measures only.
Pain was controlled with morphine.
