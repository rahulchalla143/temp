Patient was intially admitted to the [**Hospital 332**] Medical ICU for management of septic shock.
(1) Hypotension/Shock:  The patient met criteria for septic shock on admission.
She initially had significant mental status changes, suggesting end organ dysfunction, although other parameters such as lactate remained normal.
Her urinary obstruction and pyelonephritis were treated with meropenem 500 mg IV Q6H and percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.
- The etiology of her obstruction remains unclear.
(3) Pyelonephritis: - Initially managed in the ICU setting with IV Meropenem - Urine culture from [**Hospital3 417**] was positive for E. Coli, sensitive with MIC <0.12 to levofloxacin.
(4) Macrocytic Anemia:  Her Hct has dropped from 44 to 33.7 in the past week with no current evidence of bleeding.
Her Hct was 42.9 at OSH, so lower Hct could be secondary to hemodilution.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of a urinary tract infection near your kidney, a condition called pyelonephritis.
You also underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement to relieve an obstruction in your ureter.
You will follow up with the Interventional Radiologist tomorrow to discuss management of your percutaneous nephrostomy.
You will have a CT scan as an outpatient on [**2185-2-28**] to evaluate your abdomen for a cause of the narrowing or blockage in your ureter.
