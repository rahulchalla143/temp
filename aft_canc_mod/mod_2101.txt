Admission Date:  [**2128-7-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-8-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2070-7-3**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 5253**] is a 58-year-old female with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer.
In [**2128-4-28**], the patient noted a decline in weight, appetite, and energy after being diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer.
The following day, she became encephalopathic and her Lactulose was increased.
Status post her chemoembolization therapy, it is presumed that this resulted in her hepatic encephalopathy, as well as acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (presumably by dye, dehydration, chemo).
On [**2128-6-16**], the patient became hypocalcemic as well as hypotensive.
At that point in time, the patient was nearly unresponsive, and was admitted to the MICU for mental status changes and questionable sepsis.
She was started on hemodialysis, as well as broad spectrum antibiotics.
Throughout her MICU admission, the patient had fevers of 102-103, and on [**2128-6-23**], the patient was extubated and made DNR/DNI status.
Diet-controlled diabetes mellitus.
Metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer times two months.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  This patient has severe cachexia of the face, cervical area, upper limbs, and chest.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
CV: Tachycardiac, very loud flash prominent heart sounds, no murmurs.
Lungs:  Auscultated and anteriorly only, but very clear breath sounds, shallow breathing with limited movement of air, the patient becomes fatigued with breathing and respirations are mildly labored, able to visualize each rib and intercostal space separately.
She has pitting edema from her costal margins to her toes, although no weeping is present.
Extremities: Grossly edematous, strong dorsalis pedis pulses, palpable posterior tibialis pulses.
Area of skin around Quinton catheter clean, dry, no erythema, no warmth, no signs or symptoms of infection.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  The patient is a 58-year-old female who is at the terminal stage of her disease (metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer).
Her pain was controlled with a Fentanyl drip (175 micrograms per hour, which was titrated to 0) as well as a Fentanyl patch (100 micrograms q.
72 hours) transdermally.
A Palliative Care consult was placed for the patient, Palliative Care was to help with social as well as supportive care in dealing with her pain as well as terminal illness.
She was able to review the options of continuing hemodialysis-needing a permanent catheter placed, as well as a possible need to remain inpatient for her hemodialysis.
On [**2128-8-3**], after the patient had her hemodialysis catheter placed, the patient was noted in hemodialysis to be tachycardiac, tachypneic, low oxygen saturation, with a respiratory distress.
Her Perma-Cath site was intact with no signs or symptoms of infection.
At this point in time, the family as well as the patient expressed a desire to have the patient return to home as the number one priority, instead of having hemodialysis as the number one priority.
Her blood pressure predialysis was 120/75, pulse rate 111, and her blood pressure postdialysis was 107/59, pulse 124; 2.7 kilograms were removed from the patient, and she tolerated this procedure well without any shortness of breath.
The patient was given prescriptions for all of her pain medications (Oxycodone elixir/Fentanyl patches) as well as her nausea and anxiety (Ativan).
