Shortly thereafter the patient became hypotensive to 60s systolic with HR 97.
He was also diagnosed at that time with Pseudomonal pneumonia and was treated with a course of vanco, cefepime, Flagyl, which he has completed.

Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo man with h/o cOPD, recent pseudomonal pneumonia, longstanding trach on ventilation presents with dislodged trach tube, high peak airway pressures which resolved with manipulation of tube and elevated white count as well as transient hypotension in the ER.
Respiratory failure: likely secondary to dislodged trach tube.
Pt's respiratory distress resolved upon physical resetting of the trach tube while he was in the emergency department.
Of note, a small air leak from his trach cuff was discovered, but it is not significant enough to comprimise his respiratory status.
He recieved ipratropium and albuterol inhalers standing and prn for copd, as he was getting prior to admission for his COPD.
Hypotension: Pt had a transient episode of hypotension to SBP of 60's in the emergency department after his trach tube was position.
