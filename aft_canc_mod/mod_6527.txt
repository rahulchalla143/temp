Clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism.
Multiplanar reformation images were submitted for review in conjunction with axial images.
FINDINGS: Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified with contrast, and demonstrates no evidence of an acute pulmonary embolism.
Coronary artery calcifications are present in the right, left main, left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and valvular calcifications are also demonstrated within the aortic valve.
Enlarging lymph nodes are present within the mediastinum, including a 1.4 cm lower right paratracheal node, previously measuring about 8 mm.
Additionally, apparently new hilar lymph nodes have developed.
Very small bilateral pleural effusions are also new.
Within the lungs, there are new dependent areas of confluent opacification with air bronchograms, involving the left lower lobe to a greater degree than the right, and associated with mild degree of volume loss.
Widespread emphysema is without change.
A new linear and nodular opacity has developed at the left lung apex with maximal nodular component dimension of about 8 mm image 8, series 3).
Additionally, new smoothly marginated septal thickening has developed diffusely.
Previously reported tiny pulmonary nodules are largely obscured by the acute lung abnormalities that have developed in the interval.
No suspicious skeletal lesions are identified.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
New bibasilar confluent lung opacities, in conjunction with airway secretions, raising the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, although atelectasis is an additional consideration.
Mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema and very small pleural effusions.
New small nodular opacity at left lung apex, very likely benign considering rapid development over a two-week period.
Previously reported small nodules are not well assessed due to obscuration by acute lung findings.
Coronary artery calcifications and aortic valvular calcifications.
New enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive in the setting of presumed acute aspiration pneumonia.
Trace ascites and mild anasarca.

Final Report CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION FOR STUDY: Pylorus sparing Whipple, now with bilious output from NG tube.
TECHNIQUE: Following ingestion of oral contrast, a helical scan was obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without use of intravenous contrast material and images reformatted in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.
FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Bilateral pleural effusions are present with bilateral lower lobe areas of consolidation.
A small amount of ascitic fluid surrounds the liver.
No focal mass lesions are seen in the liver.
The patient is recently post-surgery and a small amount of air is seen within the bile ducts in the left lobe of the liver.
No abnormal dilatation of small bowel is identified.
No abnormal dilatation of the afferent or efferent loops is identified.
Extensive vascular calcifications are noted.
No free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
No enlarged deep pelvic nodes or inguinal nodes are identified.
Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis is noted with no definitive evidence for diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen within the skeleton.
The axial, sagittal and coronal reformatted sequences demonstrate contrast within the stomach passing out into the proximal small bowel with no abnormal dilatation of the bowel.
IMPRESSION: No gastric outlet obstruction and no evidence for obstruction at the jejunojejunostomy site.
