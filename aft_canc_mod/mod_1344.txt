ICD placement ([**2108-5-17**])   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40230**] is a 78 year-old male with a history of SSS s/p PPM, multiple myeloma c/b CRI, who presented today in Vfib arrest.
Per family report, he initially had a weak pulse but was not breathing.
SSS/2nd degree AV block s/p St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Identity ADx pacer in [**2106**] 2.
Multiple Myeloma - initially dx'ed in [**2105**] on BM bx, free lambda light chain variant.
Nephrotic Syndrome/CRI d/t MM (baseline Cr 3.4) 4.
HTN 6.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Unable to obtain due to being sedated/unresponsive.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.4 BP 128/72 HR 68 (v-paced) RR 16 O2: 100% on vent Vent settings: 550x12, PEEP 5, 100% Fi02 Gen: Elderly male; unresponsive to tactile or aural stimulation or sternal rub.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Corneal and gag reflexes present.
Pupillary reflex present.
Not able to cooperate with rest of neurologic exam.
Evidence for development of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
CT HEAD ([**2108-5-7**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction.MRI would be more sensitive for acute ischemia.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no evidence of acute thrombus or flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 30% lesion in the mid-vessel and 50% stenosis in the D1 branch.
The RCA had a 30% lesion in the mid-vessel.
Limited views were obtained in an effort to conserved IV dye given (30cc) the patient's history of multiple myeloma and chronic renal insufficiency.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right and left heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 14mmHg and mean PCWP of 21mmHg.
There was systemic arterial hypertension with an aortic SBP of 155mmHg.
Coronary arteries without acute thrombus or flow limiting disease 3.
Moderate diastolic biventricular dysfunction.
ECHO ([**2108-5-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Views are technically suboptimal for assessment of left ventricular function but global LV systolic function appears grossly preserved.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen in suboptimal views.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen in suboptimal views.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 1. s/p VF arrest: Patient had a witnessed syncopal event, found to be in VF arrest by EMS and shocked with 360J x1; after shock, was in paced rhythm with no recurrant episodes of vfib thereafter.
Regarding etiology, there was no clear precipitant as cardiac cath showed no suspect lesions and while his Troponin was elevated, his CK-MB was not and his renal disease may confound the utility of troponin.
The echo showed no obvious structural cause.
Coronary artery disease: No significant coronary disease was seen on cath to explain VF arrest.
Head CT negative for bleed, CVA, edema or herniation.
Acute on chronic kidney disease: Underlying renal disease felt to be secondary to amyloidosis and light chain disease in setting of multiple myeloma.
This improved after resucitation and IVF, but worsened (up to 4.4) after hypotensive episode.
Last BM biopsy [**2108-4-30**] which did not show evidence of MM.
Hyperlipidemia and hypertension:  Continued statin; metoprolol was held during hypotensive episode, but restarted thereafter.
Ventricular fibrillation arrest s/p ICD placement 2.
Acute renal failure 3.
Sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer placement 2.
Multiple myeloma 3.
Chronic kidney disease 4.
Diabetes mellitus 5.
Hypertension 6.
Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a ventricular fibrillation arrest (vfib).
your gabapentin and allopurinol were changed to one pill every other day due to your worsening kidney function.
