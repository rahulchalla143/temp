He denied any assoicated chest pain, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema or calf pain.
He denies any recent cough, nasal congestion, sore throat.
No obvious bleeding.
Concern was for PE and pt awaiting V/Q scan.
On labs, noted to have bicarb of 8, nongap met acidosis, so resp distress likely tachypnea from compensation.
So V/Q scan defered, LENIs negative.
Access was difficult so pt t/f to MICU given severe acidosis.
Seen by renal who felt that the metabolic acidosis and hyperK is [**3-10**] RTA IV on top of CKD IV.
Only new med from last admission was acyclovir for genital herpes, but there are no reports of this causing metabolic acidosis so renal felt okay to resume on d/c so pt could complete course.
Other issues: Also had severe hyper K to 6.2 with peaked Twaves on admission, which improved with kayexalate, insulin/D50.
Was noted to have R arm swelling but no DVT noted by IR at time of midline placement, and this was improving at time of discharge.

Found to have severe metabolic acidosis, which has been corrected, with improvement in his symptoms.
Short ICU stay for access issues.
Unclear why he had acute drop given his baseline bicarb is 20s while on NaBicarb tabs.
pt has new LFT elevation as well as acidosis.
however, renal does not feel this is the cause and are okay with resuming acyclovir to complete course -f/u renal/transplant on [**5-4**] -okay with them to cont tacro/bactrim .
