Admission Date:  [**2115-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-7-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for stenting of right mainstem bronchus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Bronchoscopy with bronchial stent removal.
History of Present Illness: 80 yo man w/ h/o Stage 3B lung cancer (s/p chemo, XRT, and stent placement [**5-12**]), COPD on home O2, CAD (multivessel disease and 80% LM stenosis), A fib, and LLE DVT who presents from OSH with obstructed right sided bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonia for possible stenting.
After this procedure, the patient went into respiratory distress in the PACU and required intubation.
He was also noted to have ST elevations on EKG in leads V2 and V3.
Cardiology felt that his previous changes were due to myocardial stunning.
During his OSH MICU course, he was also found to have focal neuro deficits (left ptosis, left facial droop) so a head CT was done.
This study revealed an old right parietal infarct with moderate chronic small vessel infarcts without evidence of enhancing lesions.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of his right sided bronchial occlusion.
He was hemodynamically stable on arrival, and denied CP, SOB, abdominal pain, headache, or dizziness.
Chest CT the following day revealed bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), complete RUL/RML/RLL collapse with apparent obstruction of the bronchial stent within the right main stem bronchus.
Past Medical History: - Stage 3B Lung Cancer: dx [**2114-10-8**]; s/p 8 courses of chemo; s/p XRT; s/p stent in right bronchus [**5-12**]; s/p 5 therapeutic bronchoscopies (for reocclusion of stent) - COPD on home O2 - CAD: s/p cath [**2114-11-22**] showing multivessel disease, LM 80% - A FIB: started on digoxin 3 weeks prior to admission - s/p LLE DVT: [**2109**] and [**2114-12-8**] (s/p hernia repair); treated with coumadin and plavix in the past - s/p CVA x 2 - s/p hernia repair - s/p left eye surgery for ptosis (3.5 yrs ago) - s/p cataract surgery  Social History: Lives at home with his wife.
PORTABLE CXR @ OSH ([**7-2**]): improvement in vascular congestion and slight alveolar fluid from yesterday.
Persistent opacification of the right hemithorax.
CT CHEST @ OSH ([**6-29**]): 1) Large right sided pleural effusion and moderate size left sided pleural effusion.
2) Complete collapse of the RUL, RLL, and RML with apparent obstruction of bronchial stent within the right main stem bronchus and soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess likely representing patient's known lung cancer.
3) Emphysematous changes throughout the LUL w/ septal thickening which may be due to scarring, atelectasis although no lymphangitic spread of disease cannot be entirely excluded.
4) Areas of compressive atelectasis within the LLL.
LABS ON ADMISSION TO [**Hospital1 18**]: [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   WBC-6.4 RBC-3.33*# HGB-9.7*# HCT-29.3*# MCV-88 MCH-29.3 MCHC-33.2 RDW-16.9* [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   PLT COUNT-164 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   PT-13.0 PTT-30.2 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   GLUCOSE-94 UREA N-9 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-109* TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-12 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   ALT(SGPT)-9 AST(SGOT)-15 ALK PHOS-52 TOT BILI-0.4 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   CALCIUM-7.7* PHOSPHATE-2.5* MAGNESIUM-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: Pt bronched [**7-3**], showing right main bronchus stent frayed at distal end, blocking RUL and with thick secretions distally.
Spontaneous breathing trials were poorly tolerated.
He had acute drop in blood pressure with cardiac enzyme leak on [**7-11**] and throughout his course remained intermittently hypotensive and also bradycardic at times.
It became clear given the patients invasive lung cancer and severe coronary artery disease that the prognosis was extremely poor.
The outcome of this was that pt would remain intubated but would also still be DNR and would be given no escalation in care including pressors or antiarrhythmics.
The patient went into respiratory failure on  the evening of [**7-23**] and expired that night.
In summary Mr [**Known lastname 24642**], is an 80 year-old gentleman with a history of stage 3b terminal lung cancer, atrial fibrillation and severe coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requring intubation that was secondary to total R bronchial obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia.
It became clear that efforts to treat his disease proved futile in the setting of his terminal disease, and eventually the patient placed in comfort measure only care and passed away.
