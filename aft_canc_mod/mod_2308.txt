Admission Date:  [**2143-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor / Gemfibrozil / Zosyn  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**] Chief Complaint: Fever and Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line placement Left Nephrostogram   History of Present Illness: 52M with h/o BPH, markedly elevated PSA (>200) and outlet obstruction, presents with fever and hypotension.
He presented to the ED with confusion, fever and abdominal pain on [**4-11**].
In the ED, he was found to have a positive UA with CT Abdomen revealing bilateral hydronephrosis with pyeloneprhosis.
He was hypotensive requiring vaspressors 5L NS.
On [**4-12**] urine culture grew enterococcus so Linezolid was started for concern for VRE.
Due to concern of ureteral obstruction as well as bladder outlet obstruction, IR atempted placement left perc nephrostomy tube, but ureterogram did not reveal obstruction or hydroureter and therefore no tube placed.
On [**4-13**] he developed acute SOB and CT chest/abd showed small RP bleed at site of prior procedure with no PE.
There was concern for anaphylaxis to zosyn (as SOB was temporally related to infusion) so he was given steroids, Epi, H1 and H2 blockers.
S/P hemorrhagic CVA [**2127**] with residual partial right hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopsia and partial aphasia.
Etiology of CVA thought to be thrombotic; MRA at that time showed no vascular abnormality.
High homocysteine resolved with B complex.
Chronic headaches, improved.
Hyperlipidemia / hyperuricemia.
Abnormal lfts - noted [**6-/2140**]; unclear if related to lipitor or hyperlipidemia or other etiology, resolved.
did not try cialis and is not currently having sexual relations.
HTN 9. left hydronephrosis .
S/P shrapnel wound upper back.
Lung: crackles at bases, no wheeze Cor: RRR, nml S1S2 no MRG Abd: NABS, soft NT, mod distended, no CVA tenderness Ext: trace bilat LE edema, contracted on the R upper ext.
Back: mild Left CVA tenderness   Pertinent Results: [**2143-4-11**] CT ABD: 1.
Perinephric stranding with thickening of Gerota's fascia on the left not identified on previous study dated [**2143-2-18**].
The differential includes an inflammatory process versus a slow forniceal leak.
There is mild increase in left hydroureter since previous study.
There is a suggestion of a small bladder diverticulum at the insertion of the left ureter.
No definite bladder mass identified to explain hematuria, although full evaluation is limited secondary to lack of IV contrast administration.
Bibasilar airspace opacity representing either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left.
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
[**2143-4-12**] NEPHROSTOGRAM: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically-guided left nephrostogram.
No evidence of left hydronephrosis or hydroureter or urinary obstruction.
New high-density material surrounding the left ureter and tracking within the retroperitoneum consistent with hemorrhage.
Abnormal perfusion of the left kidney, most severe at the upper pole.
Findings are consistent with pyelonephritis.
Edema and abnormal perfusion at the upper pole and interpolar region medially with multiple peripheral hypoenhancing wedge- shaped regions likely represent ischemia and a component of infarction.
Limited examination for pulmonary embolism due to suboptimal contrast bolus with no large central embolus seen.
Small bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Patchy predominantly ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes, left worse than right could represent pneumonia or pneumonitis.
5mm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas.
[**2143-4-13**] CXR: Questionable small right pleural effusion, vague indistinct linear opacity in the right infrahilar region, likely atelectasis.
Enterococcus isolate pan-S; pt switched to Doxycycline on discharge given concern for ?Zosyn allergy.
#?Anaphylaxis to Zosyn:  episode of acute SOB in ICU that was thought to be temporally related to Zosyn.
Resolved with treatment for anaphylaxis.
CTA negative for large PE, CXR without overt volume overload.
Will complete a total of 4 days of steroids to prevent possible late anaphylaxis.
#Urinary Retention:  No Hydronephrosis noted on Nephrostogram (after Foley placed).
Likely secondary to prerenal causes/sepsis.
#Retroperitoneal Bleed: likely secondary to Nephrostogram (IR procedure).
#5mm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas: Noted on imaging.
Enterococcus Pyelonephritis/Urosepsis 2.
Urinary Retention/Hydronephrosis secondary to above 5.
Acute Renal Failure, resolved 6.
Retroperitoneal Bleed, likely secondary to Nephrostogram   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please come back to the emergency room should you develop any fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, burning with urination,  or any other complaints.
