History of Present Illness: 65 yo M with h/o duodenal ulcer and GERD p/w BRBPR who was recently diagnosed with a splenic flexure mass, most likely originating from the kidney who presents with fatigue, chills, shortness of breath and decreased appetite.
The pt reports that for about one week now he has had decreased appetite and has only been able to soft foods and liquids.
Last Friday he started to notice worsening SOB but only with ambulation associated with a mild, dry cough.
Today in the afternoon he started to note chills and rigors and decided to come into the hospital.
Lactate was found to be elevated at 7.8.
A CT abdomen was done whihc confirmed the large LUQ mass but did not show signs of other pathology, specifically an ischemic bowel.
The patient continued to be tachycardic but was never hypotensive in the ED (lowest BP 92/66).
The patient also reports intermittent abdominal pain, present for weeks, but worsening since discharge from the hospital.
He reports that the pain is worse when lying on the R side and about 15-20min after eating especially cold foods.
Pt denies HA, vision changes, CP, N, V, D, changes in the color of his stool or urine and specifically melena or BRBPR.
He also denies myalgias or arthralgias.

NOT CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS OR CLOSTRIDIUM SEPTICUM.
Marked short-interval progression of extremely large and aggressive left upper quadrant mass that appears to arise from the tail of the pancreas with new compression of the stomach and near-complete encasement of the splenic flexure of the colon.
Previously reported splenic vein thrombus now extends to the portal venous confluence and there are now new enlarged collateral vessels present within the anterior abdomen.
The presence of splenic thrombosis at time of presentation also favors a pancreatic origin of this mass.
Innumerable new liver metastasis with interval growth of two dominant metastases compared to CT of only two weeks ago.
Multiple lung metastases and left hilar nodal masses, as described.
No CT evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
No pulmonary embolus.
Multiple nodules/masses scattered throughout the lungs consistent with metastases.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Scattered ground-glass opacities seen throughout both lungs with more focal consolidative process within the right lower lobe which may represent infection.
Diffuse hepatic metastatic lesions and splenic flexure mass, better evaluated on CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2105-2-22**].
Asymmetric enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid.
BIOPSY: CYTOLOGY POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   consistent with poorly-differentiated malignant neoplasm,   see note.
Brief Hospital Course: PNEUMONIA / GRAM POSITIVE ROD BACTEREMIA: The patient was admitted to the MICU from the ED for an elevated lactate and concern for early/evolving sepsis, with new RLL pneumonia.
He was fluid resussitated and empirically started on vanco, cipro, and cefepime for antimicrobial coverage.
Imaging showed interval progression of his flank mass, including more hepatic lesions and extension of his splenic vein thrombosis, previously seen but not anticoagulated given his admission for GIB.
Blood cultures grew out gram positive rods, and he was continued on his empiric antibiotics.
His CXR was consistent with aspiration or hemorrhage, along with several metastatic desposits.
METASTATIC CARCINOMA, UNKNOWN PRIMARY The patient was found to have a malignant lesion, large in size and diffusely metastatic to liver, peritoneum, and lung, on prior admission last month.
On admission, he had interval progression and increase in number of his liver lesions.
Final pathology was pending at time of discharge, but consistent with a very poorly differentiated carcinoma.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS The patient had an increase in lactate, likely reflective of anaerobic metabolism from his extensive tumor burden.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Pre-renal etiology by low FENa, possibly contrast induced nephropathy.
Continued to have elevated creatinine toward end of course.
SPLENIC VEIN THROMBOSIS No active management given recent large GI bleed.
Secondary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder  Discharge Condition: Expired
