[**2116-9-21**] Bronchoscopy  [**2116-9-25**] Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 71yo gentlman who was admitted to the hospital on [**7-29**] of this year for dyspnea, cough, and some low volume hemoptysis.
No endobronchial disease was noted, but a radial EBUS was performed from the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
Bronchial washings were positive for adenocarcinoma and the transbronchial biopsy showed atypical cells suspicious for large cell carcinoma.
He has undergone imaging that includes both CT of the head on [**2116-6-17**] that shows no metastatic disease.
CTA of the chest shows a left perihilar mass that is 4.0 x 1.9 cm.
This mass is centered in the left lower lobe, but does partially encase the left lower lobe superior segment PA.
There are also two nodules in the left upper lobe and a 0.9-cm nodule at the right apex.
PET scan performed on [**8-11**] shows the hilar mass to be FDG avid with an SUV of 17.
There was no metastatic disease on this study.
He subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7343**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-8-25**], which was negative for malignancy.

Substantial opacification of the left hemithorax persists with the right lung being essentially clear.
No appreciable pneumothorax.
Gas within soft tissues is seen in the supraclavicular level on the left  [**2116-9-26**] CXR : There continues to be elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left effusion and an alveolar infiltrate in the left mid lung.
On [**2116-9-18**], the patient underwent left thoracotomy, left lower lobectomy, arterioplasty of lower lobe pulmonary artery, mediastinal lymphadenectomy, which went well without complication.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and an epidural for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received the epidural with good effect and adequate pain control.
Pulmonary: The patient had an episode of desaturation into the 80's when chest physical therapy was being performed.
The secretions were sent for gram stain and culture, which grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient received vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage for possible pneumonia.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
