She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia, where she was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with CTX/azithromycin transitioned to cefpodoxime, as well as a COPD exacerbation for which she was given pulse steroid dosing with taper.
There has been noted worsening in the patient's respiratory status over the last few months, including episodes of lethargy and decreased responsiveness as reported to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient's steroid dose was increased recently out of concern for COPD exacerbation.
She presents from home with dyspnea increasing over the past 2 days and increased sputum production for the last week, as well as rhonchi and wheezing throughout per EMS.
There have been no fevers or chills.
Patient triggered for hypoxia and dyspnea when the NRB was taken off and patient desaturated to 85% on RA.
Portable CXR showed signs of fluid overload.
ECG showed NSR at a rate of 80, with leftward axis, normal intervals, and evidence of LVH, with no ST deviations.
On the floor, patient reports feeling well, and that her breathing is near her baseline.
She reports no pain or discomfort.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone, HTN, recurrent pneumonias, asthma/COPD, who presented with acute respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and pulmonary edema.
She had signs on exam of end expiratory wheezes consistent with a COPD exacerbation.
In addition, she had an elevated BNP with CXR findings of mild edema.
She was therefore diuresed for a component of pulmonary edema.
TTE and EKG showed LVH without any acute changes concerning for ischemia.
She does have probable pulmonary hypertension which may contribute to her pulmonary problems.
She received steroids, nebs, diuresis and chest PT with good effect.
She continued to have mild labored breathing with some audible wheezing and intermittent cough with sputum production but by the report of the patient's family and home health aides, this was consistent with her baseline status over the past several weeks to months.
Though she presented with a leukocytosis, this resolved and she was not felt to have a pneumonia.
They are interested in hospice care and indeed attempted to enroll the patient in hospice recently however they were refused care because she did not meet criteria based upon the hospice assessment of life expectancy and severity of illness.
She should have 1:1 supervision for feeding: no straws- single cup sips only, slow rate of intake, sit up fully to 90 degrees for all PO intake, no mixed consistencies with liquids and solids, check for pocketing before lying her down after meals.
The patient had poorly controlled hypertension and her home metoprolol was uptitrated.
The remainder of her medical issues including RA on chronic prednisone, seizures, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism and depression were stable and the patient was continued on her home med regimen.
