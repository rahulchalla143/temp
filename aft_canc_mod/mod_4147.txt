Echogenic and coarsened liver are consistent with chronic liver disease.
Thrombosis of the left portal vein; main and right portal veins as well as splenic vein are patent.
Small ascites.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2173-3-26**] 4:39 PM IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
Large complex mass centered at the gastroesophageal junction with erosion into the gastric lumen.
Innumerable hepatic metastases.
Two 7-mm pulmonary nodules in the left lung are indeterminate.
One or both may represent a small focus of infection, a benign nodule, or metastatic disease.
Severe coronary artery calcifications.
EGD on [**3-31**]: Mass in the gastroesophageal junction Normal mucosa in the stomach The duodenum was not entered due to the findings at the GE junction.
Biopsies were not taken due to elevated INR.
EUS [**4-1**]: Mass in the gastroesophageal junction and cardia - this was biopised.
EUS of the mass could not be performed due to constriction of esophageal lumen by tumor.
New mass seen at GE junction & e/o metastatic disease on CT scan.
# GE junction mass/Anemia: Pt presented with hct drop and EGD performed on [**3-31**] revealed a large polyploid mass at the GE junction that was actively bleeding.
Pt had a CT performed that revealed a large complex mass centered at the gastroesophageal junction with erosion into the gastric lumen and innumerable hepatic metastases.
Pt had developped antibodies and blood bank was having difficulty finding an appropriate match for transfusion.
# Afib: Pt presented in A.Fib with RVR in setting of acute anemia.
Coumadin was held on admission due to GI bleed and supratherapeutic INR.
Pt was explained the risk of bleeding on Coumadin given his poor synthetic function and the ongoing bleeding seen in the esophageal mass.
# Cholestatic jaundice: Pt was noted to have a significant cholestasis with only mild transaminitis.
CT abdomen revealed innumerable mets in the diffusely enlarged liver.
The overwhelming burden of metastases is likely causing cholestasis & impaired synthetic function in setting of underlying ETOH cirrhosis.
Pt was started on Ursodiol 300mg [**Hospital1 **] to help with pruritis and biopsy was taken of esophageal mass.
# Chronic CHF: Pt has a significant CAD history s/p NSTEMI and ETOH abuse likely contributing to cardiomyopathy & EF 30%.
Pt maintained his sats well on RA without any evidence of volume overload on exam.
# Leukocytosis: Pt was noted to have low grade fevers and significant leukocytosis on admission.
ROS was negative and all blood/urine Cx were NGTD, CXR showed no evidence of infiltrate.
CT scan showed large esophageal mass and it was thought likely that the leukocystosis was due his primary malignancy.
Ativan 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for anxiety for 14 days.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw a CBC and send results to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**] office #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8506**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Gastrointestinal bleed Esophageal/Gastric Mass .
Secondary: Coronary Artery Disease s/p MI Cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood counts and found to have a bleeding mass between your esophagus & your stomach.
We have started Ursodiol 300mg twice daily and Ativan 1mg up to twice daily as needed for anxiety.
If you develop any new chest pain, shortness of breath or any other general worsening of condition, please call your PCP or come directly to the emergency room.
