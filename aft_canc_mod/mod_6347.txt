There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small left ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic function.
There is systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve with a severe LVOT gradient, due to apposition of the valve leaflet to the septum at end systole.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Gyriform high density focus at left frontovertex, without associated edema, mass effect, or gyral effacement, likely a chronic finding.
This could likely represents mineralization, related to old trauma or infarct.
Air-fluid levels in the left maxillary and frontal sinuses and sphenoid air cells, bilaterally, with mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells,representing acute-on-chronic inflammation.
No associated fracture.
Bibasilar dependent consolidation with peripheral nodular/tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities worrisome for infection or aspiration.
Marked enlargement of the left chest wall musculature and right gluteal muscles.
Exophytic right renal mass, most c/w heamorrhagic cyst.
Severe scrotal edema, with no evidence of fluid collection or abscess.
Normal testes with small hydroceles bilaterally.
There is no ascites.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.
No gallstones or wall thickening.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation.
Trace fluid around the pancreas compatible with acute pancreatitis.
No evidence of fluid collection or biliary ductal dilatation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites are increased from the [**2-4**] study.
Indeterminate lesion in the mid right kidney which has evidence of hemorrhagic components.
Brief Hospital Course: # s/p Sepsis secondary to Salmonella/Coag Neg Staph:  Resolved.
A CT scan revealed pancolitis, and Surgery was consulted and recommended conservative management.
Patient's blood cx grew out coag neg staph and salmonella; group B strep was cultured from the sputum.
When he stabilized off pressors, the CVL which was placed at [**Hospital1 **] in the R subclavian artery was removed with angio guidance by Vascular Surgery; a stent was deployed due to ongoing extravasation.
Patient had fluctuating WBC count during his stay (likely reactive), but surveillance cultures remained negative, and was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Patient had been improving during hospitalization, but was noted to have an elevated WBC count (18) on [**2-2**].
Patient had been afebrile, hemodynamically stable, but there was concern for possible intra-abdominal abcess vs worsening colitis (noted on admission) that raised suspicion for occult infectious process.
On [**2-3**], patient was noted to have elevated amylase/lipase, elevated direct bilirubin and Alk phos, and was noted to be somnolent.
Patient had a Valproate level and Carbamazepine level checked as the doses of these medication had been increased on [**1-30**] to his home doses.
CT abdomen, MRCP, RUQ u/s were performed and were unremarkable as to the etiology of the patient's hepatic and pancreatic involement -- no evidence of ductal dilation or gallstones.
Patient's cholestatic markers continued to trend upward over several days and so hepatology was consulted.
Hepatology attributed patient's cholestatic pattern to Zosyn that he received in the MICU earlier in his course.
C difficile Colitis: Patient developed C diff colitis on [**2-20**] with a fever, increased white count, and tachycardia.
# Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis:  On [**2-3**] patient was noted to have an erythematous [**Month/Year (2) **] involving his inguinal region that was initially thought to be a candidal cellulitis.
Dermatology was consulted and diagnosed this [**Month/Year (2) **] as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, attributed to use of B lactam antibiotics in the past.
#Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Patient was admitted with a Cr of 5, thought to be related to patient's septic shock.
Additionally, patient reports known history if diabetes insipidus due to prior Lithium use.
Patient was in septic shock when he was initially admitted and was noted to have pancolitis on CT scan on admission.
#History seizure disorder:  Patient has a history of seizure disorder and has been on carbamazepine and valproic acid at home.
Patient was noted to have hepatotoxicity/pancreatitis on [**2-3**], but it is unclear if these medications are related to his state.
He was taped off over several days and was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
# Bipolar disorder: Transitioned to risperidone in house and patient did well on this regimen.
Hypothyroid: Thyroid studies checked in the setting of hypothermia and diarrhea.
[**Name (NI) **] to retest TSH as outpatient after acute issues resolve by PCP.
# RCC: Mass noted on MRI abdomen in house.
Acute Renal Failure 4.
Respiratory failure 5.
Salmonella septicemia 6.
Clostridium difficile colitis  Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were initially admitted with septic shock from [**Hospital1 6591**].
You were found to have a very serious blood infection, likely originating from your colon.
You were treated with antibiotics which caused hepatitis and pancreatitis that resolved on their own.
These antibiotics also caused a severe skin [**Hospital1 **] that improved on its own.
You subsequently developed another infection of your colon called clostridium difficile colitis, and were treated with different antibiotics which would will need to continue.
Finally, your depakote was thought to have caused some of your liver problems, so it was stopped and you were started on Risperdal and Keppra instead for your bipolar disorder and seizures respectively.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nauasea, vomitting, fevers, chills, worsening diarrhea or any change from your [**Hospital1 5348**] health status.
