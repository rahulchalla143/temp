Pertinent Results: [**5-8**] RUQ U/S: Findings most consistent with acute cholecystitis, as discussed with General Surgery houseofficer, and posted to the ED dashboard, at the time of dictation  [**5-8**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.
Inflammatory process involving the right upper abdomen as described, which appears more likely centered on a distended gallbladder with sludge and stones, rather than on the ascending colonic diverticula, though there is a spastic-appearing colonic segment in the vicinity.
Evidence of chronic pancreatitis with calcifications and atrophy.
No evidence of inflammatory process in the right lower abdomen.
Extensive vascular calcification with no aneurysms seen.
Small-moderate right pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis.
200 cc of bilious fluid was aspirated, a portion which was sent for microbiology.
[**5-11**] RUQ U/S: Large biloma in gallbladder fossa with decompressed gallbladder with thickened, ruptured wall.
Findings including possible percutaneous drainage of the biloma were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at completion of examination  [**5-11**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.Compared to prior CT from [**2198-5-8**], there is increased eccentric fluid collection adjacent to the anterolateral aspect of the gallbladder fundus with marked pericholeycstic stranding, concerning for rupture.
In addition, since the prior exam, the patient has developed increased peripancreatic stranding, which may be related to the gallbladder, however, an acute pancreatitis cannot be entirely excluded.
No pancreatic ductal dilatation or stone within the duct is identified.
Recommend correlation with pancreatic enzymes.
Bilateral ground-glass opacity and pleural effusion with an area of consolidation within the right lung base.
He became anuric with an elevated lactate after placement of this drain, receiving 8 L of IV fluids, and forming only 500 cc of urine despite lasix.
