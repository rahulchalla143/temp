Peripheral blood smear revealed a single, normal appearing platelet without clumps or schistocytes.
In the emergency room he had bright red blood per rectum times two and significant hematuria complicated by clot retention and difficult Foley placement necessitating urology consult.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, he was a very pleasant man in no apparent distress.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of CLL presenting with severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding.
Early differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia included medication or chemo effect, ITP, TTP, HUS, sequestration or viral infection.
The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed the presence of sparse megakaryocytes which looked normal, but low in number.
CT scan showed a normal sized spleen with a small infarct.
The source of the GI bleeding is unknown.
At this time he has not had a colonoscopy, but once his platelet count improves and he is discharged, he should be seen by gastroenterology in followup for further workup of his GI bleeding.
He also had hematuria associated with low platelet count.
to place a Foley after he developed urinary retention.
For several days he had hematuria associated with his low platelet count.
The plan will be to continue Proscar for an additional three days and try to have a voiding trial and remove the Foley.
Acute renal failure.
