([**Telephone/Fax (1) 83256**])   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 30yoM with h/o HepB and metastatic HCC (Dx in [**5-/2125**], s/p 14cm mass resection in [**6-/2125**], with several different cycles of chemotherapy), several admissions recently, and per reports with significant increase in multiple pulmonary nodules who presented to ED with severe bilateral crampy leg pain and swelling that started acutely Friday am.
His wife called the covering oncologist, then called 911 due to pain severity.
He had RUQ u/s which was consistent with known hepatic disease and with apparently patent portal vein but with "low, to-and-fro flow" which was different from the previously hepatopetal flow.
Finally, had CT abd pelvis showing some possible disease progression, moderate ascites, areas of bowel wall thickening called as edema vs infection, and mass effect of enlarged liver compressing the IVC and ?
distending the stomach, and pulm nodules at the L base as previously seen.
Finally, pt had a Dx paracentesis which showed WBC's 27.6k (92% polys) and 22k RBC's, no organisms on GStain and culture pending.
Of note, there was a recent discussion on [**11-25**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re: hospice vs. further chemotherapy and code status is now DNR/DNI per that discussion, and referring physician recommended strong consideration of palliative care/hospice consult.
Review of her recent notes indicates that the plan was to try palliative Doxorubicin to see if any effect, with clear understanding of the risk for life threatening side effects.
Currently ROS is only positive for BLE pain, and negative for all other systems.
He is feeling better after getting pain meds.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-21**] abdominal pain, u/s demonstrated a large hepatic mass - [**5-22**] biopsy at [**Location (un) 745**] showed hepatocellular carcinoma - [**6-21**] one week of sorafenib (prescribed by oncology at [**Hospital1 2025**]) - [**2125-6-21**] right hepatic trisegmentectomy and cholecystectomy in a wedge resection of left lateral segment nodules x2.
Path showed grade III poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Post op course complicated by fluid collections and need for abx.
- [**2125-8-15**] MRI abdomen: multiple focal liver masses c/w HCC - [**2125-8-27**] started sorafenib 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] with stabilization of AFP - [**2125-10-12**] sorafenib 200mg [**Hospital1 **] b/c hand foot syndrome - [**10-22**] sorafenib 400 mg qam, 200 mg qpm --> significant hand blisters.
No evidence of immediate response.
Completed 1+ cycles -- initial AFP response, but unable to continue b/c of prolonged thrombocytopenia about 50 [**2126-1-22**]: started xeloda and progressed within 6 weeks on imaging and AFP.
History of nephrolithiasis in [**2119**].

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
An 8 x 8 mm lesion (2:1) also appears unchanged.
There are small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Within the abdomen, the liver is markedly enlarged and heterogeneous compatible with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma.
For instance, a lesion in the left hepatic lobe measuring 5.0 x 4.9 cm (2:15) measured approximately 4.8 x 4.4 cm previously.
A lesion in the right lobe measuring 4.4 x 4.0 cm (2:24) previously measured 3.9 x 3.8 cm.
There is mass effect including compression of the IVC, though patency is not assessed on this non-contrast examination.
The stomach is distended and may also be due to mass effect.
There is moderate ascites.
Some nodularity in the peritoneal fat posterior to the right lobe is present.
Diffuse colonic wall thickening is seen in the ascending colon, descending colon, sigmoid and rectum.
No free air is identified.
There is diffuse subcutaneous anasarca.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Multifocal liver lesions compatible with known hepatocellular carcinoma.
Moderate ascites; the presence of infection is not assessed on this examination.
Additionally, diffuse areas of large bowel wall thickening may be related to edema/ascites, however, infection would appear similar by CT.  Nodularity posterior to the liver could be seen with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Mass effect due to enlarged liver including compression of the IVC.
Distention of the stomach may also be secondary to obstruction from mass effect.
Pulmonary nodules at the left base as previously seen.
RUQ u/s FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely heterogeneous and enlarged, compatible with multifocal HCC replacing much of the liver parenchyma.
Of note, the patient is status-post right lobe resection (trisegmentectomy), causing some distortion of anatomy and the image labelled main portal vein may representleft portal.
A moderate amount of ascites is present.
Enlarged, heterogeneous liver compatible with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma.
In the region of the lower calf bilaterally, subcutaneous edema is noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 30yoM with h/o HepB, metastatic HCC with extensive disease in his liver and pulmonary mets who presents with BLE edema and subcutaneous hemorrhage and found to have SBP, GNR bactermia, hypotension, consistent with severe sepsis.
Pt had Gram negative rods grow from cultures from his peritoneal fluid and blood and was treated with several days of IV Ceftazadime before switching to PO Cipro on discharge to hospice.
Pt did not have any abdominal pain from the SBP.
Pt with elevated lactate, worsening renal and liver failure as evidence of end organ ischemia; but mental status was very clear through admission.
Pt was tachycardic on admission to 110-120's which remained elevated 100-110's by discharge.
BLE edema and subcutaneous hemorrhage: Likely due to low albumin, hepatic disease, compression of his IVC due to hepatic mass.
SubQ hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia.
Pain was controlled with IV and PO Dilaudid and started on MS Contin by discharge.
Thrombocytopenia: Due to liver disease.
Notable because the pt had gross hemorrhage into his legs, and also he developed rapid bilateral scleral hemorrhage through admission.
Hepatitis B/HCC: Pt with end stage hepatocellular carcinoma s/p resection and numerous cycles of chemotherapy, most recently palliative Doxorubicin after having discussed with his Oncologist the risk for life threatening infection.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Ativan 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety.

Activity Status: [**Hospital 83258**] Hospice level care   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with bilateral lower extremity pain and hemorrhage and were found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacterial infection in your blood, low blood pressure, worsening kidney function, low platelets, and worsening liver function.
