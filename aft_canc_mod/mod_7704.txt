Discharge labs:  - ECG: Sinus tahcycardia to 125, NA, NI, ?LVH [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 19300**] criteria, no t wave changes or ST segment changes concerning for ischemia .
- ECHO OSH: EF 20-25%, with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild AR, severe aortic stenosis.
- CT from OSH [**2131-12-17**]:  CT CHEST: There are no filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is severe cardiomegaly.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of a dissection.
There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasal atelectasis.
In addition, there are perihilar consolidations in the upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, and the superior segments of the lower lobes.
There is a mildly enlarged right hilar lymph node measuring 13 mm, and a prominent right infrahilar lymph node measuring 8 mm.
No enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes are seen.
CT ABDOMEN: There is diffuse mesenteric fat stranding with trace fluid, as well as severe gallbladder wall edema.
These findings suggest fluid third spacing, such as may be seen in a low protein state or chronic systemic illness.
No focal hepatic or pancreatic lesions are seen on this single phase exam.
Small bowel and colon loops are normal in caliber and grossly unremarkable, allowing for absence of oral contrast.
CT BONES: The bones are diffusely mottled with apparent diffuse sclerotic infiltration.
There is an 11 mm lytic lesion in the superior endplate of the L4 vertebral body (series 306b, image 36).
NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
SEVERE CARDIOMEGALY AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
NO PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.
MULTIFOCAL PERIHILAR CONSOLIDATIONS, MOST SUGGESTIVE OF PNEUMONIA.
SMALL-TO-MODERATE BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS WITH ASSOCIATED BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS.
MILD RIGHT HILAR LYMPHADENOPATHY, PROBABLY REACTIVE.
SEVERE GALLBLADDER WALL EDEMA AND MILD FAT STRANDING/TRACE FLUID THROUGHOUT THE MESENTERY.
THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A LOW PROTEIN STATE OR SEQUELA OF CHRONIC SYSTEM ILLNESS.
DIFFUSELY ABNORMAL, MOTTLED BONES WITH DIFFUSE SCLEROTIC INFILTRATION, SUGGESTING MALIGNANCY.
FOCAL LYTIC LESION IN THE L4 VERTEBRAL BODY, WHICH [**Month (only) **] BE BETTER ASSESSED BY A LUMBAR SPINE MRI.
ECHO [**2131-12-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
Aortic stenosis is present, probably severe, (but could not be precisely quantified due to uncertainty regarding the reliability of the left ventricular outflow tract dimension).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 M with no significant past medical history who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for severe AS with heart failure, and possible new malignancy, with PSA of ~500s and evidence of possibly bone malignancy.
# Systolic CHF with critical AS, concern for cardiogenic shock: The patient was found to have EF 20-25% with severe AS at OSH which is confirmed on echo here with additional findings of smokey appearance of LV cavity (prelim read) concerning for possible developing thrombus.
He has had progressively worsening heart failure symptoms over the past few weeks, including shortness of breath, increasing LE edema over the last few weeks, and new orthopnea.
The patient does not appear volume overloaded on exam but is somewhat clamped down at periphery with cold feet.
Etiology of heart failure still unclear, but possibly related to his severe aortic stenosis.
Because of the presence of spontanous echo contrast, the patient was initially started on IV heparin drip out of concern for thrombus formation.
# aortic stenosis:  The patient was found to have critical calcific aortic stenosis on ECHO.
It is possible that his heart failure is secondary to AS.
While here, the patient was seen by C-[**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement.
It is likely that his heart failure was at least, in part, due to his aortic stenosis.
# Respiratory Status: The initially had oxygen requirment on transfer from OSH, and was satting well on 6L NC, with increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and severely decreased exercise tolerance.
CT from OSH shows evidence of pneumonia and he was started on Ceftriaxone/Azithro at BIDN.
Pt has been afebrile while here, no clear infiltrate seen on wetread CXR.
It is likely that his respiratory status was due both to be volume overloaded, as well as an overlying pneumonia.
# PNA:  The patient had shortness of breath, and new oxygen requirement, likely in part due to his heart failure and volume overload.
CT from OSH shows evidence of pneumonia and he was started on Ceftriaxone/Azithro at BIDN  The patient did not have a clear infiltrate on his CXR here.
He was started on antibiotics to cover for community acquired PNA and completed a ten day course of Azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
His respiratory status improved with the antibiotics, and upon discharge the patient was breathing comfortably on room air, with no oxygen requirement.
# ?Prostate cancer/Malignancy work-up:  The patient was found to have PSA ~500s, with evidence of bony lesions on OSH imaging; CEA 2.2, CA19.9 <3, and alk phos of 1500 at OSH, also with hilar adenopathy on CT chest.
Rather than pursuing a full work up inpatient, the oncologist felt that his cardiac status be optimized first; he will follow up with heme/onc as an outpatient for skeletal survey, as well as possible tissue diagnosis, in addition to possibly initiating anti hormonal treatment.
# Microcytic Anemia: Crit of 28, MCV of 78.
Hypoproliferative, likely combo of BM infiltration and anemia of chronic disease in the setting of his likely underlying malignancy.
# Protein Malnutrition/Protein Status: Pt with albumin of 2.5, states he has had poor PO intake for weeks and has tried to consume milks and juices.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # [**Month (only) 116**] need a bonescan prior to CT surgery to evaluate for ?lytic mets in sternum .
# outpatient heme follow up for further work up of prostate cancer .
