History of Present Illness: Patient is a 79 year old male with history of interstitial lung disease on oral prednisone taper (5-10 mg) at home, 3-4L nasal cannula oxygen at night at home, diastolic congestive heart failure, type two diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with recent NSTEMI, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status-post ex-laparotomy with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy ([**2138-9-16**]) with positive margins, common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy and percutaneous drain placement ([**2138-9-16**]) who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**10-26**] with fever, hypoxia, confusion thought to be PNA/CHF treated with levofloxacin and diuresis.
He was found to have NSTEMI which was medically managed.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible abscess in setting of recent surgery, but CT abdomen was negative for abscess.
He was given nebs but no diuresis since [**10-31**] due to increased Cr.
He has been followed by pulmonary consult while in house - unable to get workup for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for high res CT. Has been on 5L NC and stable.
On morning of transfer, around 4:15am, desat to 40-50s and found to be in respiratory distress with accessory muscle use and cyanotic.
On 6L NC and high flow mask with O2 sat of 94% but with paO2 of 55 on ABG.
CXR showing increased effusion with increased haziness on right side.
Patient's code status still full code - from a cancer perspective, the patient has been told that his expected life expectancy in the 5 year range.
Past Medical History: -Cholangiocarcinoma - unresectable; s/p Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2138-9-16**] after had positive proximal and distal margins.
-Biliary Stricture s/p [**Date Range **] and stenting -Interstitial lung disease, on home O2 and taper of prednisone daily -DM2 -HTN -Dyslipidemia -Arthritis -GERD - GI bleed in [**2137**] -Osteoperosis -Cataracts (Bilateral) -Diastolic CHF -CAD - s/p recent NSTEMI   Social History: Patient is a former smoker.
Family History: Father with DM, mother died at 97   Physical Exam: At time of admission to medical intensive care unit: GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - PMI non-displaced, RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs) SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-16**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait   Pertinent Results: High resolution chest CT [**2138-11-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Recent changes over four days documented by conventional chest radiographs indicate that at least some of the reticular and ground-glass abnormalities in the lungs, which have worsened since [**10-29**] are pulmonary edema.
The progression of the same abnormalities between [**10-9**] and [**10-29**] could be due to some component of interstitial lung disease, which was clearly present on the earliest examination.
Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension and global cardiomegaly.
Severe coronary atherosclerotic calcification.
Large thyroid cysts or nodules.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-25**], no definite change.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old male with past medical history of type two diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease status post NSTEMI with recent diagonsis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status post common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy, percutaneous drain placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
Hypoxia - Differential at time of arrival to medical intensive care unit included exacerbation of his interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and PCP.
Given that he had been on long-standing steroids, and after a high-resolution CT was obtained as noted above, therapy for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn was initiated.
Gentle diuresis was attempted, although it did not appear as though he was volume overloaded on exam.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and his symptoms were not felt to be consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
Given that it appeared most likely that he had a flare and exacerbation of his pulmonary fibrosis, he was started on high dose pulse steroids.
The patient, along with his family, pastor, and friends, made the decision to not pursue intubation or resuscitation, as the patient understood that it was unlikely that he would be able to be weaned off of the ventilator should he be intubated.
