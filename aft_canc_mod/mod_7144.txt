Admission Date:  [**2133-1-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-1-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Lipitor / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1232**] Chief Complaint: CC: elective admission for right adrenal mass removal.
An ABG at this time showed slight respiratory acidosis with 7.24/56/91.
Patient then underwent chest x-ray that showed no pneumothorax and no evidence of focal infiltrate.
Per report, there was concern about worsening respiratory status which is why the patient was transferred to the ICU.
Per report, she is alert and oriented to person and place, but slightly delirious.
ROS: currently, patient endorses mild pain at the surgical site.
She denies fever, chills, or sputum production.
Past Medical History: - Pheochromocytoma - resection [**2133-1-5**] - Polychondritis - Mild COPD - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - Appendectomy - Tubal Ligation  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname **] lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 3844**].
There is a right chest tube in place and no evidence of pneumothorax.
Patchy area of increased opacification at the left base most likely represents atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical situation, pneumonia would have to be considered.
Multiple surgical clips in the upper abdomen on the right, and a well-marginated apparent lesion in the proximal humerus that is probably of no clinical significance.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary a 59-year-old woman with history of mild COPD and right pheochromocytoma admitted to urology service after undergoing right adrenalectomy.
She was admitted to the medical ICU post-operatively for close respiratory monitoring given concern of worsening hypercarbia post-extubation.
Ddx includes COPD versus cardiogenic wheezes from pulmonary edema, likely compounded by splinting related to pain from recent surgery.
Suspect COPD and splinting as the main causes for impaired ventilation given her relatively normal echocardiogram in [**2123**] and no signs of decompensated CHF on exam.
A repeated arterial blood gas after one treatment with bronchodilators showed improved ventilation with resolution of the respiratory acidosis.
She was monitored overnight in the medical ICU and there were no significant events.
A repeat chest x-ray in the morning showed evidence of atelectasis.
# Hyperlipidemia: no active issues.
At discharge, patient's pain was controlled on oral pain meds, tolerating a regular diet, and was ambulating.
