INDICATION: 59-year-old with metastatic lung cancer and known T7 spinal lesion.
Assess for cord compression.
There is a large right upper lobe lung mass measuring at least 3.6 x 6.2 cm on scout images.
Compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body has progressed since the prior examination now with marked retropulsion of fragments and increased soft tissue mass associated with increased compression of spinal cord.
Soft tissue is seen extending into and essentially obliterating the left neural foramen and pressing upon the spinal cord causing moderate-to-severe cord compression.
No increased STIR signal intensity or T2 signal intensity is seen within the cord to suggest cord edema.
Soft tissue mass is also seen extending into the right neural foramen, but to a lesser extent than the left.
A new linear area along the superior aspect of the T4 vertebral body is seen, demonstrating decreased T1 and increased STIR signal intensity.
A new 7 x 7 mm rounded somewhat ill-defined lesion is seen in the posterior right aspect of the T6 vertebral body concerning for a new metastatic static focus.
Decreased T1 signal intensity along the inferior endplate of T6 likely is due to degenerative changes.
Heterogeneously decreased T1 and increased T2/STIR signal intensity throughout the T8 vertebral body is also seen and new from the prior examination.
There has been slightly increased diffuse T1 signal intensity throughout the vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine likely related to post-radiation changes.
Vertebral body alignment is also normal elsewhere as is vertebral body height and disc space height.
Progression of metastatic disease involving T8 with increased collapse of the vertebral body and soft tissue component involving the vertebral body.
There is extension of soft tissue component into both neural foramen, left greater than right, and moderate-to-severe cord compression without definite cord edema.
Probable new metastatic focus in T6 posteriorly on the right.
Post-radiation changes throughout the thoracic spine.
Signal abnormalities in the T4 vertebral body is probably due to insufficiency fracture post-radiation.
Signal abnormalities in T8 are less certain and may be due to new metastatic involvement or insufficiency fracture.

There is no pleural effusion.
The osseous structures of the spine are not well assessed secondary to technique.
There is mild shift of the trachea from the midline to the right.
No pneumothorax.
Thanks   [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old woman with lung Ca mets to T7, s/p radiation.
INDICATION: 59-year-old female with lung cancer and mets to T7 status post radiation therapy.
FINDINGS: A large mass is seen in the apex of the right lung consistent with the patient's known history of lung cancer.
Again identified is a pathological compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body.
Large right upper lobe lung mass measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.7 cm, consistent with history of lung carcinoma.
Metastatic disease with pathologic compression fracture involving T7 collapse of the vertebral body and soft tissue component causing destruction of the posterior vertebral body with retropulsion.
Correlation with recent MR shows that the cord compression seen on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 21837**] due to soft-tissue mass.

The patient has a known T7 metastasis which was previously treated with XRT.
Her MRI on admission demonstrated worsening cord compression.
An Xray was checked which demonstrated mild tracheal deviation but upon discussion with the radiologist this was thought to be unchanged from previous.
Patient seen and evaluated by neurosurgery for palliative resection of T7 lesion and instrumentation.
Patient transferred to neuropsurgery service and taken to OR on [**6-10**] under general anesthesia for T7 metastatic lesion resection and T4-10 fusion and instrumentation and facia JP drainplacement without intraoperative complications.
She transferred to floor status on day two, JP drain removed, her insicion site dry and clean, no redness or swelling noted.
Two contiguous mid thoracic compression fractures are visualized.
A large consolidation/mass is present in the right upper lobe of the lung.
There is normal alignment of the thoracic spine.
The patient will have a CT torso for tumor staging post-operatively.
The patient received duonebs for shortness of breath and congestion.
She was continued on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism which is stable.
For anxiety she received imipramine and remeron.
We avoided administration of ativan as she has had some paradoxical side effects.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon  Discharge Diagnosis: non-small cell lung cancer with spinal cord compression T7 metastatic lesion   Discharge Condition: transferred to neurosurgery stable   Discharge Instructions: none Keep your insicion site dry clean, call with drainage, redenss, swelling, fever>101.5 any neurologic changes.
