The pain is described as substernal, pleuritic, sharp, radiating to her back, unchanged quality from prior.
Pain initially [**10-24**] in severity.
Associated symptoms include dyspnea, the patient denies diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.
An EKG showed NSR with nnormal axis and intervals and no ischemic ST or T-wave changes.
Initial CK was flat at 50, with troponin slightly elevated to 0.1, from a recent baseline around 0.8.
A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism and demonstrated a new RUL opacity tracking along the fissure, and thought by radiology to most likely reflect plate-like atelectasis related to her history of sarcoidosis.
Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVTs.
Her labs were otherwise normal except for her baseline elevated bicarbonate.
She was given Morphine IR 2mg IV x 3 for chest pain, with some effect.
Incidentally, patient has not taken any of her antihypertensives today.
Sigmoid colon cancer -Mucinous adenocarcinoma (>50%), pT3, pN2, and M1 (stage IV) with mets to the omentum and peritoneum, s/p sigmoid resection on [**2175-6-9**] -s/p 5 cycles of FOLFOX -irinotecan started on [**2176-5-24**] c/b hypercapnic respiratory failure on the first day of her sixth cycle ([**2176-10-8**]) and was admitted to the ICU and required intubation, on [**2176-10-18**] she received another dose of irinotecan which was c/b a SBO -C3D15 of cetuximab/rinotecan on [**4-8**] .

INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with known sarcoidosis, metastatic colon cancer, now with dyspnea.
FINDINGS: There are no central or segmental filling defects within the tortuous and enlarged pulmonary arteries, whose appearance is unchanged compared to prior studies.
The heart size is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the coronary arteries as well as within the thoracic aorta.
There is no significant pericardial effusion.
No lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
The thyroid remains heterogeneous with isthmic and right-sided hypodensities suggestive of nodules.
Within the lungs, again noted is fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis involving primarily the upper lobes.
In addition, there is a newly apparent more consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe, tracking along the fissure and to a lesser extent in the left upper lobe also along the fissure.
There are no pleural effusions.
In the visualized upper abdomen, note is made of an incompletely evaluated large hypodense left upper quadrant mass whose appearance is similar to the prior studies, measuring upwards of 9 cm.
A calcified retrocrural lymphadenopathy is also noted and unchanged.
A hypodense posterior right lobe of the liver lesion is stable.
New opacity tracking along the major fissures bilaterally in the upper lobes is suspicious for superimposed infection in the setting of chronic changes due to sarcoid.
No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
Large left upper quadrant abdominal mass and retrocrural calcified lymphadenopathy, similar to prior studies and compatible with metastatic disease.
Heterogeneous thyroid.

She also had her pain medications uptitrated and in the setting of her new pain regimen, she developed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory distress on [**2177-4-14**], necessitating transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and NIPPV.
Again on the floor she developed increased confusion on [**4-18**] with slow response to questions and PCO2 of 97.
Received 500cc [**4-21**] for hypovolemic hyponatremia and 1000cc on [**4-22**], and 1 unit PRBCs on [**4-23**].
Developed increased RR on [**4-23**] to 26-30 and CXR was c/w volume overload.
During her course her O2 was again increased to 97-100% and she developed progressive somnolence.
She was given 40 IV lasix and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for noninvasive ventilation.
Again 2 days later the patient developed mild confusion with slow response to questions.
During her hospital course patient had numerous transfers to the ICU for mental status changes and respiratory failure, which became increasingly difficult to control, she was DNR/DNI and remained BiPAP dependant.
On [**4-30**] her respiratory status did not respond to NIPV and she died in hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Etiology of patient's propensity towards hypercarbic distress was likely her multiple primary pulmonary pathologies, including pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, diastolic dysfunction, and presumed obstructive sleep apnea.
These, coupled with narcotic use for pain related to malignancy require careful management to prevent inappropriately high bicarbonate levels.
Treated with BiPAP 8/5/30%, aimed to avoid further sedating medications, continued hydroxychloroquine and prednisone for sarcoidosis, continued sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension and albuterol prn.
Hyponatremia: presentation and urine lytes c/w SIADH in the setting of pulmonary disease.
Pain control: Acute Pain consult requested by ICU team prior to transfer.
