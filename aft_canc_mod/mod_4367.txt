Admission Date:  [**2119-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-8-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Pollen Extracts  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Incidental finding of cystic neuroendocrine neoplasm.
Ligation of intra-abdominal vessel for control of hemorrhage (splenic arterial takeoff).
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old gentleman who has pulmonary issues including COPD and chronic bronchitis and pulmonary infections.
In the workup of one of his recent bouts with this, a CT scan was performed and cuts from this revealed a cystic lesion in the pancreas.
He subsequently was worked up with an endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration of this tissue revealed a cystic neuroendocrine neoplasm.
The features of this were a size close to 3 cm in diameter along with some enhancing features suggestive of solid tumor growth and malignancy.
Furthermore, a detailed CT scan the abdomen showed that he had multiple cystic lesions throughout his liver and kidneys; but that there was a suspicious-appearing lesion in the superior pole of the left kidney that might also be a neoplastic problem.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Pre-Admission Examination [**2119-11-20**]: His abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
There is no evidence of recurrent hernia.
There is no evidence of any hernias or masses in his inguinal and genital region.
The rest of his physical exam is entirely normal with the exception of coarse expiratory rhonchi bilaterally.
2.6 x 2.4 x 2.7 cm predominantly cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas, with a thin periphery of enhancement, and 1.5 x 1.1 cm nodular area of enhancement along its superior margin.
Results from recent endoscopic FNA biopsy are consistent with a neuroendocrine lesion, which is concordant with the imaging findings.
No definite evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen.
Multiple bilateral renal cystic lesions, several of which are hyperdense.
The majority of these are consistent with renal cysts, and are statistically most likely benign.
However, 2.4-cm left upper pole cystic lesion is more mass-like, enhances substantially more from the other lesions, and is suspicious for renal neoplasm.
Mediastinal vasculature is engorged but there is no pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar atelectasis is severe, worsened since [**11-20**].
Post-surgical changes, status post partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy with small amount of fluid at the pancreatic bed just at the tip of drainage catheter.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations may represent aspiration,pneumonia, or atelectasis.
Apparent air in the nondependent portion of the cecum and proximal ascending colon is unlikely to represent pneumatosis and likely represents air mixed with fecal material.
There is no portal venous air or free peritoneal air to suggest ischemia.
Dilated loops of small bowel with no definite transition point most likely representing paralytic ileus.
Bilateral renal lesions, with the largest measuring 2.4 cm in the left upper pole which is suspicious for renal neoplasm due to soft tissue attenuation.
Small hiatal hernia.
Multifocal bilateral lung consolidations compatible with pneumonia.
Partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy changes with inflammatory changes and fluid in the surgical bed.
No discrete or drainable fluid collection is identified on this limited non-contrast study.
Interval worsening small-bowel dilatation with bowel wall thickening.
These findings are concerning for developing partial small-bowel obstruction, with a transition to normal caliber near the surgical site.
No pneumoperitoneum or portal venous air is demonstrated.
Multiple hepatic cysts.
Bilateral renal lesions, some of them dense, which may represent complicated cyst versus underlying mass lesion.
Diverticulosis with no signs of acute diverticulitis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2119-12-26**] CXR: Bibasilar opacities most consistent with atelectasis although underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.
Spleen (I-J): Spleen with congestion; no malignancy identified.
Pancreas (Endocrine): Resection Synopsis  MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Partial resection, pancreatic tail.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
The tumor has a mitotic index of 0-1/50 HPF.
The tumor invades into adjacent pancreatic parenchyma but does not invade peripancreatic soft tissue.
It consists of an unoriented segment of pancreas with attached blood clot measuring overall 5 x 3.1 x 2.1 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal soft tan yellow lobulated cut surfaces with no obvious lesions noted.
It consists of a distal pancreatectomy specimen measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm with attached peripancreatic adipose tissue measuring 5 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm.
The specimen is represented as follows: C = sections through the parenchymal resection margin, D = section of the mass in relation to the normal pancreas and the parenchymal resection margin, E-G = additional representative sections of mass, H = sections of the peripancreatic fat containing possible lymph nodes.
The spleen is serially sliced to reveal maroon brown cut surfaces with no gross lesions identified.

On that date, the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, which was complicated by major intraoperative hemorrhage requiring additional ligation of intra-abdominal vessel for control of hemorrhage (splenic arterial takeoff).
After the surgery, the patient was admitted to the TICU, where he arrived NPO with an NG tube, intubated on mechanical ventilation and neomycin infusion, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and two JP drain in place, and a Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural for pain control.
While in the TICU, he was treated for hyperkalemia with a return of his potassium to a baseline of 3.8-4.6.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with the epidural, which was converted to just a Dilaudid PCA on POD#4.
Post-splenectomy immunizations consisting of the Pneumovax, Meningicoccal, and Haemophilus B vaccines were given on POD#5.
He was intubated, placed on a neomycin drip, and treated for hyperkalemia.
When hemodynamically stable, he was returned to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 on [**2119-12-10**], at which point the NG tube was out, he was NPO except medications, on IV fluids, the foley was still in place, and the patient still on the Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural for pain control.
On [**2119-12-15**], the patient again experienced atrial fibrillation, which could not be converted on the floor.
He was transfered back to the TICU, started on a Diltiazem drip, which was converted to an Amiodarone drip due to hypotension.
Chest CT revealed findings consistent with aspiration pneumonia, for which patient was started on IV Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Abdominal/pelvic CT revealed apparent air in the nondependent portion of the cecum and proximal ascending colon is unlikely to represent pneumatosis and likely represents air mixed with fecal material.
There is no portal venous air or free peritoneal air to suggest ischemia.
Dilated loops of small bowel with no definite transition point most likely representing paralytic ileus.
He developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.4, which responded well to IV fluid boluses x2 with inproved urine output.
Following the removal of fluid, his SaO2 improved to low 90s, his nausea resolved, and his abdominal pain decreased to a [**12-10**].
Repeat Chest/abdominal/pelvic CT on [**2119-12-17**] demonstrated multifocal bilateral lung consolidations compatible with pneumonia, which had worsened in the interval.
Interval worsening small-bowel dilatation with bowel wall thickening concerning for developing partial small-bowel obstruction, with a transition to normal caliber near the surgical site was also noted.
Also, the patient had been experiencing multiple loose stools.
He was NPo with an NG tube, on IV fluids and TPN, continued on IV Vancomycin, Flagyl, and Cefepime as well as PO Vancomycin, a foley was in place, and he received acetaminophen for pain control.
He experienced a transient low grade temperature on [**2119-12-25**], and he was again cultured, but then defervesced.
By discharge, the aspiration pneumonia was treated, and there was four days remaining of treatment for C.diff.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating his diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
