Admission Date:  [**2177-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-3-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-3-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 52-year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, s/p lt. mastectomy now enrolled in clinical trial "05-395" (lapatinib monotherapy 1500 mg), who noted lt. arm swelling [**2-28**].
Echo [**3-3**] revealed: small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion, most prominently inferolateral to the left ventricle and around the right atrium, but ~1cm anterior to the right ventricle.
There is mild right ventricular diastolic collapse consistent with increased pericardial pressure/early tamponade physiology.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
[**3-7**]: There is subtle RV diastolic compression without collapse (no overt tamponade).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-5**], there is slightly less pericardial fluid anteriorly.
A pericardial drain was placed with return of approximately 250 cc of serosanginous fluid and normalization of right heart pressures.
She recurred in [**7-/2169**], with metastasis to her left supraclavicular node and lung.
Metastatic breast cancer as above.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
There was no thyromegaly.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
The lungs were clear to ascultation bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There were no rubs, clicks or gallops.
There was a slight [**1-28**] HSM.
There is a pericardial drain in place in the sub-xiphoid position.
Drainage bag connected, contains approx 10 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Labwork on admission: C.CATH Study Date of [**2177-3-10**]   *** Not Signed Out ***  BRIEF HISTORY: This 55 year old female with known diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer presented with pericardial effusion diagnosed on echocardiogram with significant respiratory mitral flow variation.
The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and RVEDP was 12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated  measuring 35/15mmHg.
There was significant respiratory variation of systemic arterial pressure up to 20mmHg.
There was equalization of RA and pericardial pressures.
Elevated right sided filling pressures with equlization of RA/LA/pericardial pressures.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-7**], there is now minimal residual pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-3-11**] IMPRESSION: AP chest, small right pleural effusion is present.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is new since [**2-28**].
Consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and a right apical paramediastinal mass are unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion primarily inferolateral to the left ventricle with minimal effusion anterior to the right ventricle.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology are seen.
Labwork on discharge: [**2177-3-12**] 09:25AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-3.67* Hgb-11.9* Hct-36.0 MCV-98# MCH-32.3* MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.2 Plt Ct-185 [**2177-3-12**] 09:25AM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-8 Creat-0.7 Na-136 K-3.7 Cl-104 HCO3-21* AnGap-15  Brief Hospital Course: 55 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with pericardial effusion.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with approximately 250 cc of serosanguinous fluid output and normalization of right heart pressures.
A repeat echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade as above.
The patient may need a pericardial window or balloon pericardiotomy procedure if the effusion increases in size.
The patient's only localizing symptom was a nonproductive cough the patient has complained of for the past three weeks, overall improved since that time.
Chest x-ray showed atelectasis but no new consolidations.
The fever was likely secondary to atelectasis or the patient's underlying malignancy.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement/removal .
Metastatic breast cancer 2.
Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
You will need a repeat echocardiogram to assess for fluid reaccumulation.
You spiked a fever during admission without any localizing symptoms.
Please contact a physician if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.
