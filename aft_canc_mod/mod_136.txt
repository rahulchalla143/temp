She also reports diarrhea per the bowel prep, but denies any blood in her stool; she has generalized mild abdominal discomfort but denies specific areas of more severe pain.
Otherwise, she has had no significant changes to her health since she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5797**] in the office, and denies fevers and chills, or any history of gastric ulcer, GERD, or GI bleeding.
She is passing flatus; uses laxatives at baseline for constipation.
She initially was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5797**] because of abdominal distension and CT notable for omental thickening and stranding, large ascites, and an enlarged pelvic lymph node, 1.3cm.

Paternal grandmother had breast cancer but was alive to her mid 90s.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals - T:97.4  BP:130/60  HR:92  RR:16  O2sat:100% r/a General: NAD, appears mildly uncomfortable, vomits intermittently CV: RRR Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: faint bowel sounds present, significantly distended, dull to percussion, diffuse discomfort with palpation but no pain, no rebound/guarding Ext: 2+ edema to mid-calf b/l, NT Pelvic deferred in ED.
Vaginal mucosa smooth.
On rectovaginal exam, mobile uterus is appreciated, some irregularity consistent with mass is appreciated posterior to the uterus in the adnexa.
Pathology: [**2117-8-10**] Peritoneal fluid: Positive for malignant cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
P53 shows scattered nuclear staining (equivocal).
[**2117-8-10**] Paracentesis: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANCY consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Imaging: [**2117-8-9**] KUB Upright: Almost gasless abdomen which could represent known ascites.
Limited assessment of bowel, but no definitive evidence of small bowel obstruction.
[**2117-8-9**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
Hazy density throughout the visualized upper abdomen is likely due to known ascites.
Mild cortical thinning compatible with atrophy but no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
Moderate abdominal ascites.
[**2117-8-9**] LENIs: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the bilateral lower extremities.
No evidence of obstruction, ileus, or free air in the abdomen.
[**2117-8-14**] KUB: Generalized haziness over the abdomen suggests ascites.
No evidence of obstruction.
The new right internal jugular central venous catheter is in satisfactory position with the distal tip projected over the lower SVC.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, allowing for the limitations of this supine radiograph.
Moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
bliteration of the left medial hemidiaphragm is unchanged and suggests left lower lobe atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of newly inserted right internal jugular catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Stable moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema.
Non-specific bowel gas pattern with no definite evidence of obstruction.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema may have improved slightly, small left pleural effusion is stable.
Right pleural effusion is minimal, if any.
No pneumothorax.
Limited exam secondary to ascites.
No evidence of dilated loops of bowel.
Non-distended gallbladder, with no evidence of stones, sludge, or wall thickening.
There is no evidence of cholecystitis.
No focal hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation detected.
Extremely limited scan; however, no evidence of hydronephrosis.
[**2117-8-30**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-29**], there are slightly lower lung volumes but otherwise little change.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some element of increased pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with relatively low lung volumes.
Transfer to the medical oncology service took place on [**8-16**] for chemotherapy.
She was cardiovascularly stable throughout her hospitalization  # Respiratory:  On admission she had a chest x-ray which was clear without effusion or edema.
The following day she developed an oxygen requirement.
Repeat chest x-ray showed significant pulmonary edema.
# GI:  In the ED she had a gastric lavage, which cleared the coffee grounds with 300 cc of fluid.
Briefly her study was significant for diffuse gastritis and esophagitis without active bleeding.
Her H. pylori was positive and GI biopsy revealed rare yeast concerning for [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.
She had no further upper GI bleeding during this admission although she developed nausea and vomiting on [**8-13**].
She was made NPO as there was concern of SBO secondary to tumor obstruction.
# Renal: On admission, she was noted to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.4.
In their opinion, she had acute tubular necrosis on microscopic urine exam.
# Oncology: She had a paracentesis with removal of 2L of ascites on [**8-10**].
She was given chemotherapy on [**2117-8-17**] at which time she was showing signs of mild volume overload, with trace to 1+ pitting dependent edema.
She was given prophylaxis for and monitored for tumor lysis syndrome and her kidney function remained stable.
She became profoundly nauseated the day after chemotherapy, first with bileous emesis and ultimately with bloody emesis.
She also became significantly volume overloaded in the setting of aggressive hydration with bicarbonate, with portable CXR showing significant pulmonary edema and her clinical exam showing substantial third spacing.
# Hematology: She had bilateral LENIs on admission which were negative.
================ ICU Course: [**8-19**] Patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress from increased pulmonary edema and an aspiration event.
# Respiratory Failure: Upon transfer, the patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Spontaneous breathing trials were completed, however mental status remained a barrier to extubation.
# Sinus arrest: The day of expiring, she had episodes of sinus arrest with reflexive tachycardia and hypotension.
Cardiology deemed that the episodes were likely vagally induced - from common vagal triggers, including suctioning and ventalator manipulation - and recommended against emergent temporary wire in the setting of her longterm prognosis.
# Hypotension / Sepsis / Lactic acidosis: The patient became hypotensive on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], requiring goal directed therapy, including blood pressure supporting medications and aggressive intravascular repletion with crystalloid and pRBCs.
The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for concern for sepsis with Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl as well as stress dose steroids in the setting of known low dose steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica.
Patient also had elevated lactic acid, peaking at 5.3, which was initially concerning for sepsis, however after resolution of sepsis, lactic acidemia remained, with a nadir of 1.4.
# Acute renal failure: UOP and renal function improved with goal directed therapy.
# Transaminitis: Presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with a mild transaminitis that resolved after goal directed therapy.
# Nausea / bloody emesis: Transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] following 36 hours of substantial nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy.
Prior to transfer, she was noted to have bloody emesis thought to be due to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the nausea and emesis abated.
# SBO: Transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with a known obstruction of cryptogenic origin.
It was thought that the patient's constipation was due to mass effect from her primary peritoneal cancer.
She has been on prednisone for approximately one month since her diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica and is currently tapering.
