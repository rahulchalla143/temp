Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left radical nephrectomy and excision of tumor thrombus from left renal vein and IVC.
History of Present Illness: 61-yo-woman w/ renal cell CA dx [**2128-8-11**] after developing painless hematuria, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED yesterday w/ increasing dyspnea on exertion.
CTA of the chest, which had been done in preparation for left nephrectomy (scheduled for [**2128-9-6**]) revealed PE in the RUL, w/ multiple wedge shaped consolidations concerning for pulm infarcts.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initial management.
Of note, admission workup revealed guaiac positive stool and continued hematuria, w/ occasional clots passed in the urine.
The decision was made to transfuse 1 unit PRBCs to bolster the pt's baseline HCT, then treat w/ heparin for PE and monitor HCT closely.
This pain has been constant; there are no associated fever, rigors, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
She denies any melena or hematochezia.

Large, complex left renal mass with imaging features most consistent with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
Tumor invasion of perirenal fat and Gerota's fascia and tumor thrombus in left renal vein extending to junction of IVC.
Right adrenal metastasis.
Atypical hemangioma vs. metastatic disease of L5 for which correlation with bone scan or CT may be obtained.
Pulmonary embolism in the interlobar arteries of the posterior basal segment as well as of the branch feeding the right upper lobe.
Multiple numerous nodules scattered throughout both lungs, which in this patient is worrisome with surrounding ground-glass opacity, which in this patient is worrisome for metastatic disease.
Several wedge shaped opacities scattered throughout both lungs, which could be secondary to emboli.
Multiple pulmonary emboli are again seen within the arterial branches to the right upper and right lower lung lobes as well as the left lower lung lobes.
New pulmonary embolus in the arterial branch supplying the lateral segment of the right middle lobe probably an extension from the large clot burden in the right main pulmonary artery.
New airspace opacification within the left lower lung lobe, which likely represents infiltrate from infection versus infarction.
Multiple, unchanged nodular opacities scattered throughout the lungs, which are consistent with metastatic disease.
Right adrenal gland mass, not completely characterized as it was seen only on the non-contrast portion of this examination.
[**9-14**]: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DVT STUDIES:  Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed.
There is normal flow, compressibility and augmentation of these vessels.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.
The embolus may represent tumor fragments, which is likely given visible tumor thrombus in the L renal vein.
There is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise at present.
Patient had left upper quadrant pain on admission that was thought secondary to intra-tumor hemorrhage vs renal capsular stretching.
Abdominal CT did not reveal any retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
The patient was given dilaudid for pain control.
3) Hyponatremia: Most likely seconary to SIADH in the setting of pulmonary nodules.
Diagnosis was supported by as supported by decreased serum sodium after normal saline administered in the ED (likely hypoosmotic compared w/ urine osm).
High urine osmolality and high urine sodium.
4) Guaiac positive stool: Source was unclear at present, though metastatic disease is a likely possibility given lack of localizing GI symptoms.
5) Anemia: Iron deficiency in this pt.
6) Diabetes type 2: metformin and glyburide were discontinued on admission in preoperative period.
A chest CT which was obtained at our institution had demonstrated a pulmonary embolus.
There were no significant intra-operative complications.
On postoperative days five and six, a new pulmonary embolus was discovered; the pulmonary service was asked to consult in regards to the best treatment options available.
Their advice was LENI's to determine whether there was a lower extremity source for the recurrent emboli and if so, to consider placement of a filter.
They also reccomended for an echo, which did not show any evidence of right heart strain.
