She then had progressive shortness of breath over the last 2-3 days which worsened this AM and prompted her to present to the ED.
She does report pleuritic left sided chest pain with deep inspiration but no baseline chest pain.

Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Interval development of hyperenhancement and thickening of the peritoneum with large volume loculated ascites raises concern for peritonitis.
Small bowel wall thickening likely reactive given the concern for infected peritoneal fluid.
No bowel obstruction.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower lobe consolidation, likely reflects atelectasis and aspiration.
Extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Shortness of Breath/Pulmonary Embolus: shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain likely related to known PE, confirmed on CTA.
She was mildly hypoxic (92% on RA) but in no respiratory distress.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: HR to 150s in the ED, given 10mg IV dilt x 2 and 30mg po dilt with some response (HR decreased to 120s).
Pneumoperitoneum/non-draining pleurex: Found to have locules of gas within ascites on abdominal CT scan, which was initially felt to be due to catheter placement rather than perforation given her benign abdominal exam.
A small amount of ascitic fluid was sampled and showed 825 WBCs (65% polys), cultures were sent, and she was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed bacterial peritonitis.
Culture grew bacteroides fragilis.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you had decreased output from your pleurX catheter and abdominal pain.
A CT scan of your belly was concerning for either perforation of your colon or the catheter lying very close to the colon.
However, since your abdominal pain got better and you didn't have any fevers we decided the best approach was to not disturb the catheter, which you can continue to use.
Additionally, your heart rate was noted to be high and in an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibriallation.
We provided you with a continous drip of medicine to slow your heart rate, and it resolved.
