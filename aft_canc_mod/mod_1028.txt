He has been evaluated for this pain previously by his PCP and oncologist and was put on a Fentanyl patch, with escalating doses.
The pain started in his chest and then spread to his abdomen and back.
The abdominal pain is diffuse and has no relationship to food.
The back pain is also diffuse, but he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or lower extremity weakness or paresthesias.
He was found to be neutropenic and developed a fever to 101.3 in the ED and was started on Cefepime.
He had a noncontrast CT abdomen which did not reveal a cause of his pain.
After 5 hours on a diltiazem gtt he developed relative hypotension with SBP in 80s and the drip was stopped.
Esophageal cancer:  presented wtih severe indigestion which progressed to difficulty swallowing.
Barium swallow [**5-21**] demonstrated esophageal lesion--8 cm infiltrating carcionma of distal esophagus.
Biopsy demonstrated atpyical glandular proliferation.
[**8-21**] demonstrated total esophagogastretcomy.
PET [**7-22**] showed multi-focal FDG avid left pleural nodular thickening and right medial upper pleural nodular thickening worrisome for metastatic disease.
Left lung base nodule and right upper lobe nodule both FDG avid.
History of diabetes but currently off insulin given significant weight loss.
Hypercholesterolemia which has resolved at this time.
Operation for cholesteatoma at [**Hospital 31406**] 2.
Family History: Father died of lung cancer Mother is [**Age over 90 **] [**Name2 (NI) **] and living in nursing home No other family history of malignancy   Physical Exam: On admission: vitals: 97.5, 98/50, 71, 17, 97% RA General: cachectic, ill-appearing male, no distress, complains of severe pain, needs assistance to change position HEENT: PERRL, OP clear Neck: neck veins flat Car: RRR no murmur Resp: CTAB-ant/lat, could not sit up for posterior exam Abd: soft, diffuse mild ttp, no guarding, no rebound, + BS Ext: no edema Neuro: CN II-XII intact, UE/LE strength preserved.
Abd CT: Pleural and parenchymal abnormalities in the lung bases whose overall appearance is similar compared to the prior study.
Certain opacities in the left lower lobe do appear more prominent, although whether these are atelectatic in nature, or neoplastic is difficult to discern.
No evidence of acute abdominal or pelvic pathology given the limitations of a non-contrast study.
High density within a nondistended gallbladder suggestive of sludge.
ECG: AF with RVR rate 167 bpm-->NSR with normal axis, normal intervals, TWI I, aVL, II, aVF, V5, V6, <1 mm STD V4-V6-->NSR, NA/NI, TWF I, aVL, no ST changes.
Barium Swallow:  No evidence of stricture or obstruction within the gastric pull-through.
Bone Scan: No osseous metastasis seen.
Gallbladder US: Cholelithiasis and gallbladder sludge but no cholecystitis identified.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male with esophageal cancer on chemotherapy presenting with uncontrolled chest, abdomen and back pain, failure to thrive, now with neutropenic fever and PAF.
Neutropenic fever: Pt was started on cefepime and flagyl for neutropenic fever.
Vancomycin was not added as patient did not have a permanent line.
CXR demonstrated no infiltrate.
No infectious etiology to abdominal pain seen on CT scan.
Pt ruled out for MI after cardiac enzymes were drawn given ST/T wave changes on ECG.
ECHO on [**9-5**] demonstrated inferolateral wall hypokinesis but normal EF.
Afib was considered likely [**1-17**] extreme hypovolemia from poor PO intake and stress from recurrent malignancy.
Hypotension: Pt had significant recent weight loss and baseline low BP.
Pain: Pt's chronic, multifocal pain was considered to stem from known malignancy and ongoing chemotherapy as per pt, pain arose concurrently with recurrence of disease.
ARF likely prerenal, from poor PO intake.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea, agitation.
Oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: One (1) PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain: please hold for sedation or rr less than 8.
Metoclopramide 10 mg IV Q6H PRN nausea 11.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea, agitation.
Oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain: please hold for sedation or rr less than 8.
Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: On [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation, dehydration, esophageal cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for atrial fibrillation that we thought was related to dehydration and stress from your cancer.
Please inform your care providers if you feel ill, develop chest pain, shortness of breath or any other symptoms that concern you.
