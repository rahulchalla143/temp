The patient remained stable with no further episodes of bright red blood per rectum and was discharged on [**2149-3-3**].
On the evening of discharge, the patient had four bowel movements with bright red blood per rectum and returned to the Emergency Department.
Patient's posttransfusion hematocrit was 24.8 and the patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after a tagged red blood cell scan showed bleeding at the hepatic flexure.
The patient had angiography which showed the bleeding site to be suggestive of diverticular dz, and the bleeding site was therapeutically embolized.
The bleeding vessel was the branch of the middle colic artery.
Hernia repair.
Glucose intolerance.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mom with diabetes and coronary artery disease.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute, normal axis, no Q waves or ischemic ST-T wave changes.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension, history of diverticular bleed with recent admission for the same, readmitted one day after discharge found to have a bleed at the hepatic flexure status post angiography and thrombosis.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation after he had a nuclear red blood scan which showed the bleed at the hepatic flexure and had therapeutic intervention with embolization of the middle colic artery.
He again had a mesenteric angiogram, however, no active bleeding was seen in the superior or inferior mesenteric artery.
Patient remained stable with no further episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
On the day of anticipated discharge, the patient had a bowel movement which was again significant for bright red blood per rectum.
His hematocrit again was checked on the day of discharge, and it remained stable at around 30, VS continued to be stable without orthostasis, and he had no further bleeding from the rectum.
The impression was that he may be clearing out old blood, and that as long as this progressively decreases over the next wk, further small amts of blood per rectum would not be worrisome.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of hypertension currently on atenolol 50 mg po q day and Accupril at home, however, patient was unclear of his dose.
We suggested that he continue his Allopurinol as that is probably why he is not having any flares, but to address this issue as an outpt  4.
Psych:  The patient's family was extremely concerned that patient had depression and anxiety with anxiety significantly contributing to his elevated blood pressures.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Home, ambulating, eating, urinating, and having bowel movements without difficulty.
Blood loss anemia Hemorrhage DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
The patient should also have his anxiety issues addressed for possible pharmacologic intervention.
