Admission Date:  [**2164-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-10-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 65686**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Stereotactic brain biopsy  History of Present Illness: This is a 42 year old woman with a history of MS diagnosed in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year when she had recurrent vertigo.
She began to have left sided weakness 3 days ago.
This showed a large ring enhancing lesion on the right.
She had a colonoscopy and mammogram last year without abnormal finding.
She denies fever chills,pain, nausea.
Past Medical History: MS, ulcerative colitis, asthma, bony tumor removed for her right ear with a mastoidectomy > 10 years ago.

Dry crackles at right lung base.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds Extremities: No edema or cyanosis.
Neuro: Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact with exception of left facial droop.
Unchanged heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the right frontal region with significant edema in the basal ganglia and mass effect as described above.
Unchanged right cerebellar enhancing lesion with mild vascular enhancement, adjacent to the cerebellar nodule on the right, possibly consistent with a developmental venous anomaly, a second lesion in this region cannot be completely ruled out.
CT head [**2164-7-29**]  A large right frontotemporal mass with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures to approximately 8 mm.
The above findings in conjunction with the prior MRI are concerning for a tumefactive multiple sclerosis or a primary malignant tumor (including primary versus secondary).
Limited study for surgigal planning showing mild interval improvement in the ring-enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with reduction in degree of mass effect.
Relatively stable appearance of right cerebellar enhancing focus, suggesting multifocal disease.
Pneumocephalus and small amount of acute blood products in the right frontal region after biopsy.
Right frontotemporal edema due to large mass with subfalcine herniation, better-delineated on MRI of earlier today.
Mild effacement of the right perimesencephalic cisterns is improved from [**2164-7-29**].
[**2164-8-9**] Chest X-ray (PA and lat) CONCLUSION:  New airspace consolidation at the base of both lungs, but more prominent in the right lower lobe, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
[**2164-8-9**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: Deep venous thrombosis within the left gastrocnemius and soleus veins.
No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic process.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidative opacities, right greater than left, possibly secondary to compressive atelectasis given the adjacent pleural effusions, although infection or aspiration could have a similar appearance.
Small quantity of sludge within the gallbladder.
No associated gallbladder wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 yo female with a history of multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, and asthma who presented with a rapid decline in strength and level of consciousness and found to have Primary CNS B cell lymphoma after stereotactic brain biopsy.
Active Diagnoses: # Primary CNS B cell lymphoma: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transfered from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital to the NSICU.
CT head was done to rule out hemorrhage as her exam was dramatically worse then what was portrayed in the transfer notes.
It was negative for hemorrhage but showed a frontotemporal mass.
With medical management her exam improved with less weakness on her left.
On the night of [**8-2**], she was taken to the OR on [**8-3**] for a stereotactic brain biopsy.
Preliminary pathology was reviewed with Heme-Path and thought to be primary CNS B-cell lymphoma.
Postoperative CT head demonstrated mild pneumocephalus and small amount of acute blood products in the area of the biopsy.
Over the next several days her exam improved with improvement of her left facial droop and left-sided weakness.
She was transitioned from Dilantin to Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
# DVT/PE: Patient developed pleuritic right sided chest/abdominal pain and tachycardia.
It was suspected that she had a PE, so lower extremity ultrasound was obtained which confirmed left lower extremity DVTs.
Unable to perform CTA chest  given concern for contrast affecting renal function while dosing MTX.
She was given dilaudid as needed for pain control.
# Health care associated pneumonia: Patient developed fever and hypoxia during her hospital course and was found to have right pleural effusion and bilateral opacities worrisome for pneumonia.
She remained afebrile for >48 hours prior to discharge.
Pt was given senna, colace, miralax, in addition to prn lactulose.
# Abdominal pain: Likely referred from right-sided pleuritic pain as discussed above.
CT abdomen showed no acute process.
Pt's pain improved when treated for thrombosis and pneumonia.
Most likely related to phlebotomy, acute illness and MTX treatment.
# Asthma: No signs of exacerbation.

You came to the hospital for weakness in your legs and were found to have a brain lesion.
You also developed blood clots in your leg and most likely had a blood clot in your lungs causing you pain in your back.
You developed a fever and a CXR showed that you probably have a Pneumonia.
