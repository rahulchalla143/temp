Mental status:  The patient continued to have improving mental status throughout the remainder of his hospital stay with fewer episodes of agitation at night.
However, the patient continued to remain confused and disoriented.
The medical team and consulting neurologist felt that these continued mental status changes were most consistent with diffuse cerebral edema secondary to metastatic disease.
His neurological examination had no focal deficits at the time of discharge.
The patient displayed no evidence of alcohol withdrawal at this time.
If the patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleed he should be evaluated by Gastroenterology.
