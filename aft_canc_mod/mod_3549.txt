Admission Date:  [**2149-5-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-2-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Fever, rigors  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: 68 F w/ metastatic NSCLC, known mets to brain s/p whole brain [**First Name3 (LF) 16859**] for numerous foci and s/p craniotomy for R temporal lobe mass resection [**2149-4-10**] who was found to be more somnolent at rehab.
She developed right facial droop in summer [**2148**] and a head MRI showed 5 enhancing lesions suggestive of brain metastases.
She then developed right lower extremity swelling caused by a deep vein thrombosis.
She then developed a R temporal lobe mass w/ surrounding edema that was felt to be not amenable to [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] surgery was performed [**4-10**] for palliation.
Pt w/ post-op dysarthria.
On presentation, pt was noted to be poor historian, but denied fever; reported dyspnea, cough, chest pain (states has had in past, not new), rigors, x 1 day.
CXR showed RML and RLL infiltrate; CT suggestive of post-obstructive PNA on R. Mildly hypoxemic and borderline BP ~100.
A bronchoscopy with stent placement was considered, but position of obstruction not ideal for stenting, and pt's clinical condition improved with antibiotics alone.
Review of systems was difficult to obtain, but the patient does complain of a sore throat.
- developed right facial droop in summer [**2148**] and a head MRI showed 5 enhancing lesions suggestive of brain metastases.
- developed right lower extremity swelling caused by a deep vein thrombosis.
- developed a R temporal lobe mass w/ surrounding edema that was felt to be not amenable to [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] surgery was performed [**4-10**] for palliation.
Pt w/ post-op dysarthria.
Right LE DVT (noted during previous hospital course in [**2149-3-15**]) - s/p IVC filter placement (no anticoagulation due to brain mets, recent craniotomy)   Social History: She was smoking 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 8 years; she stopped in [**2119**].
Family History: Her mother died of an unspecified cancer while her father passed away from a heart attack.
She has 11 siblings and 3 of them are alive; a sister died of ovarian cancer, another sister died of breast cancer, and a brother died of an unspecified typed of cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals - 98F 110/81 HR 98 R 18 99%5L NC Gen - Comfortable in bed, fidgeting, NAD HEENT - Pupils minimally reactive.
Abd - Obese, soft, nt/nd Ext - RLE: 2+ pitting edema to the knee [**Name (NI) 298**] Pt noncooperative w/ exam.
Large right hilar mass consistent with known history of lung cancer invading adjacent mediastinal structures.
Mass narrowss the bronchus intermedius and occludes the right upper lobe bronchus.
There is near complete consolidation of the entire right middle and right lower lobes.
Probable metastatic nodules in the left lower lobe and right upper lobe.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
CXR ([**2149-5-1**]): 1) New large right middle and lower lobe consolidation, aspiration or pneumonia, with small left- sided pleural effusion representing atelectasis vs pneumonia.
2) Right paratracheal density corresponds to lung mass on same- day CT.  CT HEAD ([**2149-5-2**]): There appears to be a small amount of subarachnoid blood remaining in the posterior right frontal lobe.
There appears resolution in the minimal mass effect.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post obstructive pneumonia:  Patient presented with fevers, rigors, dyspnea, cough, hypotension found to have large RML and RLL post obstructive pneumonia on CXR and Chest CT.  Urine culture were negative and blood cultures showed no growth as well.
Pulmonology was constuled to determine if a bronchoscopy and possible stend would be worthwhile.
It was felt that the area of pneumonia did not have a large blockage in the upstream bronchus and that the bronchus that appeared obstructed did not have an associated pneumonia.
She was intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and anesthesia noted food in her oropharynx suggestive of an aspiration event.
She underwent bronchoscopy in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2149-5-7**] which showed no evidence of bronchial obstruction.
The patient was empirically treated with vanco/Zosyn/azithromycin but, in spite of these antibiotics, her respiratory failure continued to worsen and she developed ARDS and septic shock.
She required vasopressin and norepinephrine for blood pressure support but developed progressively worsening oliguria.
