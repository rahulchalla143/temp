The patient was referred from an outside institution for further investigation of a right scapular lesion, but on evaluation, she was found to have 2 large aortic aneurysms was transferred to the cardiac surgery service.
It is not clear if she had any left sided weakness at the time of admission.
The cardiac team got an MRI of her head this AM which demonstrating a large mass with new bleeding.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

Although the mass itself is not characteristic of a metastasis, given the enhancement in the internal auditory canals and a possible enhancement on the left side of the fourth ventricle, metastatic disease should be considered.
Postoperative changes in the right temporal lobe with no definite evidence of residual enhancing tissue, although blood products in the operative bed limit evaluation.
No evidence of leptomeningeal seeding along the fourth ventricle.
Persistent extensive discogenic edema in the right temporal parietal lobes, with persistent moderate-to-severe mass effect and shift of normally midline structures to the left, which is slightly decreased since the previous study.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 70F presented with right sided intracranial bleed/effacement.
Her inpt brain MRI showed right parietal/temperal mass.
No intra-op or post-op complications.
Post-op pathology result: metastatic poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma; immunohistostaining is most consistent with lung primary.
post-op MRI showed complete resection of the tumor.
