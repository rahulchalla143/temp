# RUQ U/S [**2168-4-16**]: 1.
Cirrhosis with ill-defined 15-mm nodule in the left lobe, without a clear correlate on the prior MR. 3.
Stent in the CBD without intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Interval increase in the size of the hepatic mass in the left lobe of the liver which causes more extensive obstruction of the left lateral segment bile ducts and has increased intraductal extent into the primary bifurcation of the biliary system.
Rounded, expanded lesion in the right 9th rib at the level of the costochondral junction that demonstrates heterogeneous signal on T2 weighted images and post contrast enhancement.
Dedicated CT examination is recommended to rule out metastasis.
Slight increase in size of satellite lesion (9 x11mm) in the border of segment V/VIII that shows increased signal on T2 weighted images, arterial hyperenhancement and washout pattern.
Two gold fiducial markers placed within liver mass as described above.
Bilateral atelectasis in the lung lower lobes.
Soft tissue density surrounding the right 8th rib, favor nondisplaced fracture with callus formation (please refer to the body of the report).
# CXR [**2168-4-19**] Mediastinal silhouette with left mediastinal shift, most likely due to left lower lung atelectasis/volume loss, is unchanged.
Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely present bilaterally.
There is no pneumothorax.
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Biliary Tree Fluoroscopic Interpretation: A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the right main hepatic duct and left main hepatic duct.
There was a large filling defect in the common hepatic duct c/w known HCC invading and causing bleeding within the biliary tree.
Impression: Previously placed plastic stents were removed Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
There was a large filling defect in the common hepatic duct c/w known HCC invading and causing bleeding within the biliary tree.
Given tumor in the common hepatic duct and a double pig tail biliary stent was placed  # CTA CHEST [**2168-4-27**] 1.
Progressive left lung and right lower lobe collapse.
This is likely related to chronic mucoid impaction, and possible underlying tracheobronchomalacia.
No pulmonary embolism.
# TTE [**2168-4-28**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No obvious vegetations seen  # CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2168-5-4**] IMPRESSION:  Complete left upper and lower lobe collapse.
# RIB BILAT, W/AP CHEST Study Date of [**2168-5-4**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Near-complete whiteout of the left lung with areas of cystic changes in the left upper lobe which are better evaluated on prior chest CT. 2.
There are subacute fractures of several of the left lower ribs, which demonstrate some bridging callus.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-5-6**] FINDINGS:  Whereas the left hemithorax was previously completely opacified, there is now marked improved aeration of the left upper lobe, with residual atelectasis involving the left lower lobe.
Small-to-moderate pleural effusion on the left is difficult to compare to the previous study for change due to the presence of complete lung collapse on the prior exam.
Partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe is present, manifested by a right retrocardiac opacity and inferior displacement of the right hilum.
Small right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M w/ HIV, Hep C cirrhosis, HCC with recent admission for CAP, presented with RUQ pain and increasing bilirubin with progression of HCC on imaging, s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**4-25**] resulting improvement in tbili.
Pt had placement of fiducial and completed [**2-6**] rounds of cyberknife treatment.
His hospital course was complicated by VRE bacteremia and complete left lung collapse, requiring brief ICU stay.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Complete Left Lung Collapse: Pt has poor baseline lung capacity secondary to inclusion body myositis and diaphragmatic weakness.
During his hospitalization, he had increasing difficulty clearing his secretions, due to his myositis, immobility and pain from subacute rib fractures.
The etiology of his respiratory decompensation was thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
His respiratory status improved with chest PT, suctioning, standing nebs, acapella device and incentive spirometry.
Pt was also encouraged to get out of bed and his rib pain was well controlled with medications.
He continues to require BiPAP at night secondary to his myositis.
# VRE and Staph epidermidis Bacteremia: Pt was found to be bacteremic with multiple blood cultures positive for VRE and s. epidermidis on [**4-19**].
The etiology was likely a biliary source, possibly secondary to fiducial placement, or pneumonia given chest CT findings of complete left lung collapse.
# Left Lower Chest pain: Pt developed left lower rib pain during his hospitalization.
His rib xray revealed multiple subacute fractures, likely responsible for his pain.
He was treated with pain medications and his pain improved.
On MRCP, the patient's HCC lesion was enlarged and causing mass effect on his biliary system (the likely the etiology of his pain) so he underwent ERCP and is s/p stenting with resulting improvement in his LFTs and Tbili, despite lack of improvement in pain because the lesion was still large.
# Diarrhea: Pt continue to have diarrhea throughout his hospitalization.
His diarrhea was thought to be secondary to his antibiotics.
For his HAART, his dosing was confirmed with pharmacy given liver failure, thus, he was continued on Leviva, Zetia and Truvada  # Hep C cirrhosis c/b HCC: slight elevation in LFTs, which were normal in [**2168-3-6**].
# Cdiff: Pt had recent C diff infection and was on PO vanc at time of admission.
His course was continued and repeat PCR showed no evidence of C diff.
