Rigid bronchoscopy at the yellow Dumon bronchoscope, Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration, Bronchoalveolar lavage of the left lower lobe, Balloon dilatation, left main stem, Stent placement.
[**10-16**] Flexible bronchoscopy, Stent revision, Therapeutic aspiration of secretions [**10-16**] Thoracentesis under thoracic ultrasound.
Placement of A-line, CVL R IJ  # TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA The patient was transferred intubated from [**Hospital 61603**] Hospital in NY on [**10-15**] for stent revision to a tracheo-esophageal fistula.
On [**10-16**] she underwent a CT scan that revealed collapse of the left lung with partial sparing of the lingula.
Left main bronchus stent was seen in place and was patent, although there was diffuse attenuation of the airways distal to the stent on the left, with moderate pleural effusions b/l.
However, contrast was seen within the left main stem bronchus and distal airways, most likely reflecting aspiration although without lateral views, persistent tracheoesophageal fistula could not be excluded.
The right-sided basal consolidation has decreased in extent.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
# VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA The BAL on [**10-18**] revealed MRSA > 100K, and so the patient was started on IV vancomycin for a total therapy duration of two weeks.
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her stay.
# HYPERTENSION The patient's hypertension was eventually controlled through a combination of clonidine patch, enalapril, labetolol, and metoprolol.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient has a history of Atrial fibrillation and was initially placed on IV diltiazem and esmolol for rate control, which was then converted to PO meds via the PEG; however, her rate was not controlled until she was digoxin loaded on [**10-19**] and her rate slowed from AF in the 120s to the 80s.
# ATRIAL THROMBUS The CT on [**10-16**] revealed a filling defect along posterosuperior wall of left atrium could represent direct extension of tumor or intraluminal thrombus.
Given this finding in the presence of Atrial Fibrillation, she underwent an echocardiogram that revealed a possible 1.1cm mass in the body of LA,Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, but normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
# DYSPHAGIA The patient had a PEG tube placed by IR on [**10-16**] given that she was intubated for feeding.
# C DIFFICILE The patient was transferred from [**Location (un) 61603**] with a history of C difficile diarrhea, and so she was kept on her PO vancomycin.
# ANEMIA The patient was admitted from [**Location (un) 61603**] with anemia (Hct 26.6), which has slowly trended down to 23.8, likely secondary to phlebotomy.
