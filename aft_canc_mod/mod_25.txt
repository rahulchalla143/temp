Admission Date:  [**2160-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-4-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Rectal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy Esophagogastroduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: 87 yo F with h/o CAD, A fib on coumadin, HTN, hyperchol, hypothyroidism p/w melena.
Pt notes that for the past 2.5 weeks she has been "run down with the flu," principally with symptoms of malaise and poor appetite.
Two days ago the pt noted the new onset of black stools, described as "clots", passed with large amounts of flatus.
She had one episode of NB/NB vomitous one week but no hematemesis.
Of note, pt has had recent changes in her coumadin dose over the past 2 weeks though is unsure of doses.
ekg: nsr@77bpm, LAD, no ishcemic changes.
Past Medical History: CAD: stress MIBI '[**56**]: IMPRESSION: At the level of exercise achieved, there is a mild, partially reversible inferior wall defect.
MIBI in [**3-21**] without evidence of ischemia.
hypothyroidism HTN hypercholesterolemia A fib   Social History: widow, no tob, etoh, illicits, lives alone  Family History: Three sisters with CAD after age 65 but all still living (ages 95, 81, 77).
Physical Exam: Temp 98.8 BP 136/63 Pulse 75 Resp 18 O2 sat 95 % ra Gen - comfortbale, alert, no acute distress HEENT - PERRL, extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes dry Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abd - Soft, nontender, nmildly distended, with normoactive bowel sounds Extr - No edema.
The aorta is tortuous and there is calcification within the aortic knob.
The left retrocardiac density corresponds to the hiatal hernia and appears unchanged compared to the prior study.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
Equivocal densities scattered through out both lungs need further evaluation by nonurgent chest CT.  CT Abd/Pelvis:  Innumerable nodules measuring up to 13 mm in diameter are seen in the imaged portion of the lung bases.
The imaged portion of the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.
Several enlarged lymph nodes, some with hypodense centers, are seen in the pericardial fat measuring up to 15 mm in diameter.
Several peripherally located heterogeneously hypodense lesions are seen about the right and left lobes of the liver in subserosal location consistent with metastases.
At the gastric fundus, a heterogeneous mass measures 3.4 x 2.6 cm and protrudes into the lumen (2:18).
Numerous enlarged lymph nodes and mesenteric masses are seen throughout the entire abdomen.
Numerous additional mesenteric lymph nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes along the celiac axis and in aortocaval and paraaortic location have hypodense centers consistent with central necrosis.
The pancreatic duct is nondilated and no definite pancreatic masses are identified.
The adrenal glands are mildly nodular appearing although no definite masses are identified.
Bilateral hypodense renal lesions are too small to characterize.
There is no hydronephrosis.
The aorta is normal in caliber with mural calcification consistent with atheromatous disease.
A serosal mass involving the descending colon (2:60) measures 3.5 x 3.3 cm.
The colon is displaced in multiple other locations by multiple omental and serosal masses.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A heterogeneous centrally hypodense mass spans the width of the lower abdomen and pelvis, tethering the terminal ileum and cecum as well as the sigmoid colon, and is contiguous with the uterus and adnexa.
Additional nodular implants are seen in the rectovaginal cul-de-sac (2:78).
BONE WINDOWS: No definite lesions worrisome for osseous metastatic disease are identified.
There is lumbar scoliosis and degenerative change.
Innumerable omental and peritoneal masses throughout the abdomen and pelvis, with the largest confluent mass in the deep pelvis.
3.4 x 2.6 cm gastric fundal mass.
Pulmonary metastases.
Serosal hepatic metastases.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Please correlate with any possible history of recent Foley catheterization.
Possible etiologies for the extensive metastatic disease could include gastric cancer with metastases, versus other gastrointestinal primary with metastases, or ovarian cancer.
COLON BIOPSIES: Proximal sigmoid colon mass, biopsy:  Colonic mucosa with chronic active inflammation.
No neoplasm seen.
Note: Possible causes include compression from an external lesion or an intrinsic chronic colitis.
No sign of gastric mass.
Colonoscopy: Partially obstructing mass noted in the proximal sigmoid colon (40cm) covered by normal appearing mucosa.
Brief Hospital Course: GI bleed: The patient intitially presented with a GI bleed.
Based on the presentation of more maroon stool than melena, it was felt to be consitent with a lower GI bleed.
Her INR was reversed with 2 units of FFP and 10mg of Vitamin K. She was initially monitored in the ICU but remained hemodynamically stable and required no blood transfusions with a stable hematocrit after INR reversal.
The colonoscopy found a partially obstructing mass in the proximal sigmoid colon with normal appearing mucosa.
It was unclear if this was an instrinsic vs. an extrinsic colonic mass pressing in so she underwent a CT of her abd/pelvis.
This found what is likely diffuse metastatic disease, further discussed below.
Her coumadin has been stopped secondary to her increased bleeding risk with her abdominal malignancy and for improved quality of life.
Her hematocrit remained stable througout her admission with no further bleeding  Abdominal malignancy: As noted above, the patient was found to have what appears to be diffuse metastatic disease throughout her abdomen and lower lungs.
The spread was consistent with a gastric primary.
Initial biopsies from the colonoscopy returned as normal tissue, not surprising given the mass was only extrinsically compressing the colon.
An EGD was performed which was entirely normal, indicating that the gastric mass seen on CT was likely extraluminal.
She does not desire any surgery or chemotherapy.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also set up with an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in GI oncology to allow her to ask further questions or discuss further options.
Pneumonia/UTI: The patient initially had a leukocytosis and a positive U/A for a UTI.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of the [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Likely metastatic abdominal cancer, primary unknown Lower gastrointestinal bleed HTN Atrial fibrillation Coronary Artery Disease   Discharge Condition: All vital signs stable, pain free, tolerating POs.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a GI bleed, likely from your lower abdominal tract.
This was likely caused by your elevated coumadin level.
During the work up for this, it was discovered that you likely have metastatic cancer throughout your abdomen, including pushing on your lower colon.
We have stopped your coumadin as the risk from bleeding is greater due to your cancer than the risk of stroke.
You were also diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia and a urinary tract infection while here.
Please call your doctor or the hospice nurses if you experience abdominal pain, bleeding, nausea/vomitting, constipation, difficulty urinating or any other symptoms that concern you.
You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (abdominal cancer doctor) on [**5-2**] at 2pm.
