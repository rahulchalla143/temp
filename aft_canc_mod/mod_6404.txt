Admission Date:  [**2155-6-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-6-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: mental status changes/hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: continuous renal replacement therapy  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old male who was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma in [**1-/2154**] who is admitted from the ED with mental status changes.
The patient was admitted from [**2155-3-26**] to [**2155-6-10**] initially for autologous BMT.
On [**2155-4-11**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress, altered mental status, renal failure, and transaminitis secondary to [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease.
He was subsequently intubated and remained so for 3 weeks secondary to restrictive physiology and impaired mental status.
He subsequently had a tracheostomy and was weaned to a trach mask which coincided with improvement in his mental status.
This was intially thought to be sepsis related versus splanchnic vasodilation versus hypovolemia.
He was initiated on levophed and had a prolonged course due to persistent hypotension.
His pressors were weaned down and his pressor requirement and perfusion was determined based on mental status.
He was placed on midodrine and florinef for orthostasis and autonomic dysfunction which was thought to be a result of deconditioning.
He also had a persistent leukocytosis with intermittent fevers.
He did later have one positive pseudomonas sputum culture.
His CVVH catheter tip did grow pseudomonas as well; however, he did not have any positive blood cultures.
His improved but persistent leukocytosis was thought to be in part a result of autosplenectomy that occurred during the previous admission.
He did have worsening MS, INR elevation suggestive of liver failure.
He was started on defibrotide protocol for his VOD; however, this was discontinued after an MRI demonstrated an unexpected subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Renal failure also occured during this admission thought to be consistent with ischemic ATN.
He received stress dose steroids there as well and had a low grade temperature of 99.
Past Medical History: -Follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma in [**1-/2154**] (These cells were CD19 and CD20 positive and also co-expressed CD5 and CD10.
He received R-CVP x 3 cycles (vincristine discontinued 2.2 neuropathy), then continued on 2 additional cycles of RCVP;  neupogen after each cycle of chemotherapy; then 4 cycles of R-Bendamustine; susbequently had mobilization HiDAC [**1-8**] followed by stem cell harvesting and transplant -Right thigh lymphedema (significantly improved, per patient) -RLE DVT from compression (was on coumadin until [**2154-11-25**]) -Mild diverticulitis -s/p vasectomy, tonsillectomy  Social History: Currently living at LTAC.
Worked in a management position at a metal fabrication plant overseeing production and quality control.

Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2155-6-1**] sinus tachycardic rate is slower and further ST-T wave changes are present.
[**6-17**] CXR: Worsening large bilateral pleural effusions with layering on the right.
Comparison cannot be made  [**6-18**] CXR: Very large bilateral pleural effusions obscure the lungs, unchanged since [**6-17**].
[**6-19**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 117.
There is slight ST segment depression in leads I, II, aVL and V2-V6.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year old man with past medical history of follicular lymphoma status post-BMT complicated by VOD, respiratory failure, renal failure on HD, and hypotension as well as pseudomonas pneumonia with positive culture tip last admission who is admitted with altered mental status and dyspnea.
His mental status changes were thought to possibly be secondary to being underdialyzed while at his facility.
He had bursts of tachycardia to ~200 bpm, and he was given PRN doses of lopressor.
