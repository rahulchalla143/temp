Pt reportedly found sleeping on the (carpeted) floor of his apt yesterday but w/o obvious signs of a fall.
Pt denies pain but is otherwise unable to give any history.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] granddaughter spend much of yesterday w/the pt & states that he did not have any complaints at that time.
Pt has apparently had very limited mobility since d/c from [**Hospital1 112**] due to weakness.
Past Medical History: hypothyroidism dementia prolactinoma diabetes s/p multiple falls  Social History: lives at [**Hospital3 **].
Per pt's granddaughter, the pt's primary caregiver has been the pt's daughter x many years but this daughter recently had an MI and stroke so is at a rehab facility.

head CT: large sellar mass- no intercranial hemorrhage or infarct .
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral wall.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed with marked hypokinesis of the RV apex.
4.The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR: : Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
Thought to have early sepsis (e.g., from PNA), vs. mucus plug.
This was thought to be from either a cardiac event or from sepsis in setting of ARF.
A head CT in the ED was negative for a bleed but notable for large sellar mass (which per daughter is known & old).
Old records were reviewed, and it was found that patient has known prolactinoma invading his sella space and rendering him panhypopit.
Apparently not a surgical candidate, currently on Dostinex for the tumor.
He remained hemodynamically stable with no other suggestions of sepsis or infections.
This temperature decrease was thought to be possibly related to his hypothyroidism or hypopituitarism from the prolactinoma, no clear etiology was found.
His Levaquin was discontinued one day early for concern of prolonged QT interval seen on EKG.
It was thought that given his cardiac function (an echo done on [**3-1**] showed depressed LV and RV function, hypokinesis) he could benefit from initiation of either a beta-blocker or ACE, however given his tenuous blood pressure, this was deferred for now.
On the day prior to discharge, he became acutely hypoxic down to oxygen saturation of 88% on RA.
CXR and physical exam most suggestive of fluid overload and the patient had received IVF the day prior for lyte replacement and hypernatremia.
