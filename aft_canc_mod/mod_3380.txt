Admission Date:  [**2137-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-5-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**] Chief Complaint: fevers and chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 122**] [**Known lastname 4507**] is a 42-year-old gentleman with history of proximal femur chondrosarcoma s/p resection and left prosthesis, known mets to lung s/p wedge resection, recurrent tumor in left hip soft tissue undergoing active chemo-XRT (weekly Adriamycin infusion M-F, completed 2 cycles; last XRT [**2137-4-26**]) who presented to the Emergency Department on [**2137-4-28**] with complaints of fever to 102.5.
Patient reports that his symptoms began approximately 3 days prior to admission, when he noted gradual increase in pain in his L buttock region.
The following morning, pain increased further and he developed fevers, chills, and diaphoresis.
He denied cough, headache, dysuria, visual changes, abdominal pain, rash, new joint pains, or pain/redness at his port.
No recent travel.
He received 6L of NS as well as pain meds.
Orthopedics was consulted who recommended CT pelvis that showed replacement of normal gluteal musculature with tumor with some evidence of necrosis but no abscess.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC: First presented with vague left hip pain in the fall of [**2135**].
Seen by ortho in [**1-/2136**] given persistent pain; x-ray and AP and lateral views of the femur revealed a radiolucent lesion in the left proximal femur with cortical scalloping, no evidence of fracture.
An MRI of the whole femur revealed a marrow  replacing process which extended from the femoral neck, but not crossing the old physeal scar down to the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the femur.
Proximally there was surrounding periosteal reaction within the soft tissues external to the bone as well as the soft tissue mass in the anterior aspect of the proximal thigh and this measured 2 x 0.5 cm.
At the time of his evaluation, he also had a chest CT done that revealed a right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
In [**11/2136**], he went on to have wedge resections of his pulmonary metastases.
He had a resection in the right upper lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe and left lower lobe.
The patient had been doing well until [**1-14**] when he noted a vague pain in his left buttock, initially thought to be MSK via hamstring tendinitis.
However, the pain got worse and he started to feel a mass at which time he was seen by his PCP who performed an MRI that did reveal a soft tissue mass in the gluteus maximus muscle.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Gen: young man lying in bed in no acute distress, pleasantly conversant HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP moist without lesion Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: CTA bilaterally CV: reg rate, normal S1/S2, no murmur Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS present, no HSM Ext: large hard mass on left gluteal area, moderately tender  Pertinent Results: [**2137-4-28**] 10:20PM   WBC-11.5* RBC-4.02* HGB-12.9* HCT-35.1* MCV-87 MCH-32.1* MCHC-36.7* RDW-13.4 [**2137-4-28**] 10:20PM   NEUTS-98.8* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-0.7* MONOS-0.4* EOS-0.1 BASOS-0 [**2137-4-28**] 10:20PM   PLT COUNT-218 [**2137-4-28**] 10:20PM   PT-12.8 PTT-29.9 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2137-4-28**] 10:20PM   GLUCOSE-121* UREA N-9 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-2.7* CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-14 .
CXR [**2137-4-28**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process .
Hip films [**2137-4-29**]: Appearance of left hip bipolar arthroplasty is little changed since [**2137-2-4**].
There is no sign of hardware-related complication, or change in alignment.
There is no sign of osseous erosion or bone destruction.
There is no abnormal soft tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign object.
Pelvic CT [**2137-4-29**]: Markedly abnormal appearance of the left gluteal musculature, similar in size and extent to PET CT of [**2137-4-12**].
Replacement of the musculature with abnormal low attenuation is most consistent with local recurrence of chondrosarcoma, possibly with tumoral necrosis secondary to chemo radiation treatment.
Mass is noted to enter the pelvis along the course of the piriformis and obturator musculature, where it surrounds the sciatic nerve and inferior gluteal artery.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Chest CTA [**2137-5-2**]: The pulmonary arteries opacify thoroughly without evidence for pulmonary embolus.
No pericardial effusion.
There are new small right greater than left pleural effusions.
Respiratory motion limits the evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma slightly, however, in the presence of previously resected nodules there are postoperative changes, and a new focal nodular opacity in the left lower lobe measuring 7 mm (6, 88), which was not present on prior study.
These two foci may represent atelectatic lung, due to slightly expiratory phase of imaging, however, they do bear attention on followup studies as they were not present on most recent prior.
A linear hyperechoic structure is identified extending beyond the margin of the liver and this suggests that this entire lesion may be artifactual and secondary to suture line seen at the right lung base.
No other liver lesions are identified.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
Brief Hospital Course: 42-year-old man with history of metastatic chondrosarcoma with mets to lung and relapse in gluteal muscle presented with fever, increasing buttock pain found to be bacteremic and tachycardic.
The pain in his left leg was well controlled with narcotics.
# Tachycardia: patient had sinus tachycardia in setting of infection.
He remained intermittently tachycardic throughout his admission without any symptom.
# Transaminitis: with elevated AST and ALT since [**2137-4-30**], after the patient was initially started on ceftriaxone.
A RUQ ultrasound showed no biliary obstruction.
