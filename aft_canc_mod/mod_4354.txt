Patient provides a history that he has been having severe headaches for the past five weeks.
He describes them as presenting with pressure at the top of his head and at times has had blurred vision that accompanies it.
He denies any nausea or vomiting, difficulty with speech or abnormal motor movements.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger,   Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD WBC-9.1 RBC-5.19 Hgb-15.6 Hct-45.1 MCV-87 MCH-30.0 MCHC-34.5 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-353 [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD Neuts-76.3* Lymphs-17.5* Monos-4.8 Eos-0.8 Baso-0.7 [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD PT-12.9 PTT-27.3 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD Glucose-95 UreaN-15 Creat-1.1 Na-145 K-4.1 Cl-107 HCO3-27 AnGap-15 [**2138-4-19**] 02:24AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-2.4* Mg-2.1  Labs on Discharge: XXXXXXXXXXXX  ---------------- IMAGING: ---------------- MRI Brain from OSH: Large right temporal and parietal mass with severe vasogenic edema.
There is leftward subfalcine herniation measuring 8.8 mm.
There is mass effect and compression of the right lateral ventricle.
CT head [**2138-4-21**]: A large right temporal and parietal, with severe vasogenic edema is unchanaged, measuring 7.5 x 6.6 cm.
There is mass effect and compression of the right lateral ventricle.
Mild enlargement of the left lateral ventricle is unchanged.
Low lying tonsils are appreciated however the basilar cisterns are still patent, close attention on follow-up is recommended.
IMPRESSION: Large right frontotemporal mass with associated vasogenic edema and 9 mm leftward subfalcine herniation, largely unchanged.
Unchanged right parietotemporal mass with significant vasogenic edema, 9 mm leftward midline shift and suggestion of early uncal herniation.
There is no evidence of enhancement and no evidence of significant neovascularity associated with the mass.
This mass most likely represents a low-grade glioma (e.g.
low-grade astrocytoma), PML or tumefactive demyelinating disease like MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
PET SCAN [**4-22**]: HEAD: A large right frontal/parietal hypodense lesion is present, with a slight leftward shift of midline structures and effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
There are no FDG-avid foci present.
CHEST: No FDG avid lymphadenopathy or mass is detected.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is no intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic FDG-avid lymphadenopathy or mass detected.
There is no free air or free fluid.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Diffuse mild FDG-avidity of the bony marrow is seen throughout the spine and pelvic bones (SUVmax 4.04).
Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and GU tracts, liver and spleen.
Large right fronto-parietal mass demonstrating relatively decreased FDG avidity.
No PET evidence of extracranial malignancy.
Mild FDG avidity of the marrow is non-specific.
Compared to the outside hospital MRI from [**2138-4-18**], unchanged large right temporoparietal nonenhancing mass with surrounding vasogenic edema causing unchanged 8 mm shift of normally midline structures to the left.
Unchanged mild right uncal herniation  CT HEAD [**4-26**]: 1.
Status post right frontotemporal craniotomy with small amount of hyperdense material layering along the frontoparietal convexity compatible with acute blood products.
Persistent large area of vasogenic edema in the right temporoparietal region and associated mass effect  MRI Head [**4-27**]: Status post anterior temporal lobectomy with residual massive infiltrating tumor and unchanged right hemispheric mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency room and after review of his MRI(significant for large right frontal mass), he was given 20 mg of decadron and 500 mg of Keppra for seizure propholaxis.
He had an episode of bradycardia to the 30s, given the amount of edema and midline shift that was observed on his MRI and concern for brainstem compression, he was sent for a STAT head CT that was stable when compared to previous.
In preparation and for staging purposes, a PET scan was scheduled for [**4-22**] and showed decreased FDG avidity.
Post-operatively he did well; he had no post op hemorrhage on CT scan, and had a non focal exam.
He was then scheduled for open right craniotomy on [**4-25**] to resect/decompress the right frontal mass to facilitate managment.
Because of the OR schedule being so busy, this was unable to be done on [**4-25**]; he was therefore rescheduled for this surgery on [**4-26**]/ Post-operatively, he was returned to the Surgical ICU for q1h neuromonitoring.
Overnight on [**4-28**], his foley catheter had to be replaced due to urinary retention of 900cc(by bladder scan).
On the evening of [**4-29**], his catheter was discontinued, and he was able to void independently without difficulty.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**10-23**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
