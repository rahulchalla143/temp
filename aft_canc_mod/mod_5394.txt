WOUND CULTURE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old man with Parkinson's and chronic aspiration who presents with GI bleed and sepsis.
A chest x-ray on admission showed bilateral focal airspace opacities.
Sputum was positive for MRSA at OSH and here.
He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for broadspectrum coverage of nosocomial pneumonia, and started on a sepsis protocol with aggresive IVF rehydration, transfusions and transient use of levophed.
A repeat CXR showed worsened pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions right > left.
This was felt to be secondary to his aggressive fluid resuccitation and transfusion with 5 units of RBCs here + 2 units of RBCs at the OSH + 3 units of FFP here.
He was diuresed aggressively ~ 1 L per day for 2 days with a marked improvement in his pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, but with continued multifocal opacities bilaterally.
His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to vancomycin, and he was started on flagyl to cover for anaerobes given his history of chronic aspiration.
He had occasional desaturations, but these resolved with aggressive chest PT and expectoration of large mucus plugs.
GI bleed: The patient was noted to have frank melena on admission.
His INR was found to be elevated to 2.1 on admission secondary to coumadin therapy for his atrial fibrillation.
On transfer to the floor, an EGD was pursued again, but his respiratory status was felt to be too poor to pursue an EGD without intubation.
He may benefit from an elective EGD once his respiratory status has completely improved.
He had a recent colonoscopy at the VA which showed multiple polyps but was otherwise negative for a source of bleeding.
CAD:  The patient did not appear to be having active ischemia and never complained of chest pain.
His EKG at the OSH showed ST depressions in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and hct 17.
He was ruled out for an MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Atrial Fibrillation:  He has chronic atrial fibrillation, and was on amiodarone on admission.
His INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K, and his coumadin was held secondary to his GI bleed.
Per old records, he had been evaluated by a cardiologist earlier in the year and the decision had been made to rate control him, but avoid anticoagulation given his past history of falls and antral gastritis.
He will be continued on a baby aspirin for CVA prophylaxis.
His amiodarone was discontinued because of his history of restrictive lung disease secondary to asbestos exposure and because he did not appear to have any rhythm benefit from it.
Additionally, he had no symptomatic benefit from it.
Parkinson's: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration secondary to gradual deterioration from his parkinson's disease.
Low anion gap: The patient was found to have a low anion gap of 5.
He could be further worked up as an outpatient with an SPEP and UPEP to screen for multiple myeloma, though his UA had only trace protein and he has no bone pain.
Anemia - The patient has a history of myelodysplasia and chronic Vitamin B12 deficiency.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and he had a normal Vitamin B12 level and folate during this admission.
Hematuria - The patient was noted to have microscopic hematuria on this admission, which was followed by macroscopic hematuria seen in his foley after he was seen to pull on his foley.
Given his elevated INR, this was felt to be due to foley trauma.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 38**] Landing  Discharge Diagnosis: Parkinson's Disease MRSA pneumonia with sepsis Congestive Heart Failure Gastrointestinal bleeding Hematuria   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Please have him seek medical attention if he develops fevers, chills, worsened shortness of breath, chest pain, recurrent melena or has any other concerning symptoms.
