pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old man with atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism, who was diagnosed with squamous cell CA of the tongue in [**2153**], s/p chemo and radiation.
Recently, he has biopsy proven mets in the sternum and T3-T7.
He notes that approximately 3 weeks ago he presented to his doctor [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7186**] of breath and was diagnosed with pneumonia and given a Z-pack.
In the last week he has felt progressively short of breath and has been staying on the couch.
He denies fever, but says he has sweats on most days.
Also denies cough, occasional chest pain, some swelling in his ankles, no blurry vision, confusion.
Otherwise, he complains of xerostomia and difficulty in swallowing.
- CHF:  echo [**11-14**] w/ moderate regional left LV systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, LVEF 35%, 1+ MR. - Atrial fibrillation: s/p DCCV in [**11-13**] w/ subsequent reversion to AF.
- ICD:  placed [**12-17**] - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Depression   Social History: He is a retired salesman who lives with his long-term partner named [**Name (NI) **] for 30 years.
He has no children.
No alcohol or IV drug use.
CV: RRR Pulm: Diffuse expiratory wheezing, bilateral crackles at the bases.
Multifocal bilateral air space opacities most consistent with acute infection.
New moderate left pleural effusion.
Progression of thoracic spine osseous metastases.
CT Head [**2156-1-15**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift or other acute abnormalities.
No evidence of enhancing brain lesions.
No significant change on the pre-contrast images compared to [**2154-8-5**].
Right upper lobe opacity persists, likely due to aspiration.
Left lower lobe opacity increased, could be due to worsening atelectasis or superimposed aspiration.
Left pleural effusion also increased.
There is no other overallchange.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2156-1-19**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
if pulmonary Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis,       Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis is strongly suspected, contact the       Microbiology Laboratory (7-2306).
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2156-1-13**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2156-1-25**]):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
NOCARDIA CULTURE (Final [**2156-2-1**]):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..   Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male with squamous cell CA of tongue, with recurrent disease and evidence of metastases and recent spread to spine who presented with worsnening dyspnea on exertion and weight loss.
The patient's chief reason for presenting to the ICU was multifactorial hypoxia due to his COPD, CHF, pleural effusion and probable aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.
Nevertheless he continued to have worsening of his dyspnea and sputum production and during the day of [**2156-1-11**] he was noted to be increasingly hypoxic and his oxygen saturations were dropping to the 80's on 6L NC.
At that point a blood gas revealed profound respiratory acidosis and he was then intubated for ventilatory failure.
The patient has treated with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole for aspiration/HAP and was gently diuresed.
No microbiologic diagnosis of the patient's pneumonia was ever made and despite BAL no organisms were ever isolated.
On [**2156-1-13**] a thoracentesis was performed to evaluate for complicated effusion and this showed sterile inflammatory fluid consistent with parapneumonic effusion.
Unfortunately, after extubation mental status remained poor and the patient became progressively more hypercarbic requiring reintubation on [**2156-1-15**].
On the morning of [**2156-1-16**] NIF was checked and was less than 30 suggesting generalized muscle weakness and high likelihood of ventilatory failure if extubated.
He was extubated on the evening of [**2156-1-16**] and gradually became more hypoxic before expiring of respiratory failure.
