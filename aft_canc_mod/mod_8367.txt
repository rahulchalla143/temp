Patient states that beginning last friday she began to feel short of breath.
Thereafter she noted that she felt short of breath with speaking, and began to have chest pain.
She says the pain was sharp, located in the center of her chest but at times radiated to the back, and shoulder.
This pain was constant, but worse with exertion and ?
Patient endured pain over the weekend, but on Sunday AM was brought to ER by EMS after counselor in her shelter insisted.
Patient was uncomfortable appearing and c/o pleuritic chest pain.
EKG demonstrated diffuse PR depressions and 1mmHg ST elevations.
CT chest demonstrated large pericardial effusion and possible RV diastolic collapse.
Patient complained of [**7-8**] left shoulder pain following drain, better with movement, given 75ucg of fentanyl with some relief.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Denies h/o opportunistic infections.
- Depression - Lung Cancer - diagnosed on recent admission -> found to have post-obstructive pneumonia, Bronchoscopy demonstrated non-small cell lung cancer in washings although endobronchial lesion reportedly negative for malignancy.
Recent MRI brain negative for metastatic disease to brain, PET scan + for mets to left lung, hilar lymphadenopathy, possibly r-ischium and spleen.
Splenic lesions possibly c/w lymphoma or inflammatory response to tumor.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Overweight, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Massively increased pericardial effusion which is now large and measures slightly dense, worrisome for complex effusion including malignant or hemorrhagic etiologies.
There appears to be compression on the right ventricle and right atrium and echocardiogram is recommended to assess for tamponade.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
No significant interval change to known non-small cell lung carcinoma involving the right suprahilar region causing obstruction of the posterior upper lobe bronchus.
New peripheral opacity within the upper lobe likely represents a post-obstructive pneumonitis/pneumonia.
Slight enlargement of bilateral metastatic lesions since chest CT [**2114-12-3**].
New small bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left).
Increased interstitial septal thickening, best appreciated within the left upper lobe, is likely related to mild amount of interstitial pulmonary edema.
Lymphangitic carcinomatosis cannot be excluded.
Short interval development of marked cardiac enlargement, without overt pulmonary edema, concerning for pericardial effusion.
Right upper lobe opacity, consistent with known mass/consolidation.
Numerous pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with hypokinesis of the mid-free wall.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
A catheter is seen in the pericardial space.There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the prior study of earlier in the day (images reviewed; [**2114-12-16**]), the pericardial effusion has nearly resolved and tamponade physiology is no longer observed.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis is now identified.
There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion with right ventricular and right atrial diastolic collapse as well as accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows all consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Pericardial fluid: Pericardial fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS  consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Markedly atypical cells present.
Interval decrease in overall cardiac size as well as pulmonary vascular congestion.
Right upper lobe volume loss and right suprahilar mass as well as multiple pulmonary nodules again noted.
Persistent left basilar atelectasis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no accumulation of pericardial fluid.
[**12-19**] ECHO: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-19**], no change.

# Pericardial Effusion: With clinical and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade on presentation.
The patient was sent emergently to the cath lab where tamponade physiology was confirmed with a R heart cath and a pericardiocentesis was performed with aspiration of 685 ccs of sanguinous fluid.
She was then transferred to the CCU where a repeat TTE was significant for an absence of remaining pericardial fluid.
Pericardial fluid studies were significant for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Subsequently, she was assessed clinically daily and visited often by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**] (cardiologist), with no recurring signs of jugular distention or tamponade.
In OMED, the patient received chemotherapy (carboplatin/gemcitabine regimen)  but a second dose was not feasible due to neutropenia.
Neutropenia subsequently corrected.
# ID/HIV: The patient had never previously been on HAART and CD4 count 801 in [**11-4**]; HAART therapy initiated due to need for palliative chemotherapy.
PPD was negative for w/u of her hemorrhagic pericardial fluid.
# Anemia: c/w anemia of chronic disease.
Follow up was arranged with all of the different specialists and the patient was not SOB and had no pain at discharge.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain and trouble breathing and you were found to have fluid around your heart.
The fluid was drained and your symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath improved.
The cause for the fluid around your heart is related to your cancer.
You were found to have non-small cell lung cancer and you were treated with two cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
