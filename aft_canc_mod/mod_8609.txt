ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 103501**] is a 69 year old male admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] for transduodenal ampullary resection of tumor of cystectomy, common bile duct exploration and splenic artery aneurysm ligation.
On the day following removal of the patient's nasogastric tube he began to develop some nausea for which Zofran was prescribed.
On this day, postoperative day #4, the patient also had his first bowel movement with some flatus.
On postoperative day #5 an attempt was made to advance the patient's diet to sips and then clears but with worsening nausea this plan was discontinued and the patient was made NPO again.
On postoperative day #6 because of persistent nausea, a KUB was obtained of the patient's abdomen which revealed an unremarkable gas stool distribution in the abdomen, no free air and no evidence of obstruction.
By postoperative day #7 it was clear that the Tylenol was inadequately managing the patient's pain particularly his chronic inguinal pain at which point the decision was made to start the patient on Dilaudid 2 mg by mouth every 2 to 6 hours.
At this point the patient's overall status had markedly improved and the decision was made to advance the patient's diet first to clears and then to regular food.
The patient tolerated this transition well with no recurrence of nausea and absolutely no problems.
OxyContin for his chronic inguinal pain 12.
