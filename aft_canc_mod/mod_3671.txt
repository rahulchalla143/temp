Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED earlier today complaining of worsening SOB for the past few [**Known lastname **].
In the ED he underwent a CTA to r/o PE, and a CXR was done which showed increase in left lung base opacity.
While in the ED, the patient had coffee- ground emesis.
While on the floor, the pt was noted to be febrile, tachycardic and pale, BP in low 100's systolic.
Denies feeling lightheaded or dizzy.
Denies recent melena or BRBPR, denies hematemesis.
Notes worsening SOB over the past few [**Known lastname **], mild cough of whitish sputum, no hemoptysis.
Past Surgical History: [**4-25**] Partial resection of GIST, takedown of splenic flexure and omental flap '[**93**] Bilateral inguinal hernia repair '[**72**] Appendectomy s/p repair of cleft lip/palate .
Oncologic history: Developed abdominal pain, back pain, and anorexia in [**2101-4-19**], and noted to have a large abdominal tumor on CT scan; he went to the OR for operative management, and the tumor was discovered to be hemorrhagic with wide involvement of several organs.
On follow up 5/29, he was noted to have extensive recurrence with compression of various organs; on [**2101-5-18**] he was started on imatinib, after which he had worsening back pain, nausea, and anorexia.
Family History: Father: CAD, died from complications of CHF Mother: [**Name (NI) **] cancer, alive at age 85  Physical Exam: vitals: temp 100.6/ bp 107/65/ hr 131/ rr 14/ 99% on 2L NC GEN: awake, alert, pale, lying flat in bed, NAD HEENT: atraumatic, anicteric sclera, PERRLA, EOMI, dry mucosa NECK: no JVD, no LAD CV: tachy, nml s1/s2, no murmurs LUNGS: decreased BS at bases, no conversational dyspnea, no accessory muscle use ABD: tight, distended, hypoactive BS, + diffuse tenderness, guarding mainly in upper quadrants, questionable rebound EXT: [**12-21**]+ pretibial pitting edema B/L, symmetric.
Low lung volumes.
Mild interval increase in the left lung base opacity likely represents moderate pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Cannot rule out consolidation.
Interval increase pleural effusions.
Abdominal radiograph:A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with air noted distally within the [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and excreted contrast like layering within the urinary bladder.
There is no evidence of pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum.
A large density is noted projecting over the mid portion of the abdomen consistent with known recurrent GI stromal tumor.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2101-7-14**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: A&P 44 yo M with GIST on Sutent, presenting with dyspnea and 1 week history of coffee ground emesis including 1 episode in ED today.
# Hematemesis: Source is most likely his GIST tumor as noted to be hemorrhagic on op note from partial resection.
The patient remained predominantly NPO with intermittent liquid intake and nutrition was supplemented with TPN.
On [**7-17**] received another blood transfusion for low HCT, which responded well.
# Fevers of Unknown Origin.
In the setting of initial neutropenia, many possible etiologies of potential infection.
These included the abdominal wound where drain had been placed and the left lower lobe consolidation/ pleural effusion on CXR.
Cultures showed multi-bacterial colonization of abdominal wound site, while blood and urine cultures were negative.
Pt was afebrile on the [**Known lastname **] of discharge.
# Anemia: Baseline pancytopenia likely sceondary to chemotherapy.
Further anemia due to acute GI bleed as above.
# Dyspnea:  Progressive dyspnea over the past few [**Known lastname **].
Possibly related to worsening pleural effusions (hypoalbuminemia vs. impairment of lymphatic drainage secondary to metastases).
# GIST: Aggressive GIST, currently being treated with Sutent since [**6-1**], last dose 14 [**Known lastname **] ago.
Bolused PRN for tachycardia/ hypotension.
Scopolamine Base 1.5 mg Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) patch Transdermal every 3 [**Known lastname **] as needed for secretions.
Gastointestinal stromal tumor   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of a GI bleed, and treated with blood transfusions, antibiotics and received IV nutrition.
