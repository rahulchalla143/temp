Admission Date:  [**2112-9-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-10-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2037-3-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old Italian male with a known history of coronary artery disease, who presents status post carotid stent placement.
He had uninterpretable EKG changes and no signs of angina.
The MIBI portion of the examination revealed that the patient had a moderate large completely reversible inferior wall perfusion defect.
On [**2112-9-16**] the patient underwent a carotid duplex scan which revealed significant plaque of the right carotid artery with a 70-79% stenosis and a 60-69% carotid stenosis on the left.
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2112-9-16**] which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic regurgitation, severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Given the results of the carotid ultrasound described above, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2112-9-26**] for stenting of his right carotid lesion.
At this time, the patient had a change in mental status and appeared to be disoriented.
Lymphoma in [**2090**].
Coronary artery disease.
3+ mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary:  No wheezes or crackles appreciated, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac:  Grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard at the apex.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic: alert and oriented times three, no focal deficits noted on examination.
EKG:  Tachycardia with a rate of 125, right bundle branch block.
The patient was without complaint of chest pain, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion.
Patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2112-9-29**] for elective PCI of his LAD and RCA lesions detected on a prior cardiac catheterization.
During this second catheterization, the patient underwent successful stenting of his mid LAD lesion and successful PTCA and stenting of his proximal RCA lesion.
Both vessels demonstrated no residual stenosis status post procedure.
Coronary artery disease.
Severe aortic regurgitation.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Carotid stenosis status post right carotid stent placement.
