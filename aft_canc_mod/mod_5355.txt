MEDICAL DECISION MAKING EKG [**6-25**] - HR 50, irregular, TELEMETRY demonstrated: bradycardia 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**10-27**] demonstrated:  EF 40-45%, mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral/inferior akinesis.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 14  K 4.9  Cl 109  Bicarb 24  BUN 69  Cr 3.6  Glu 155 WBC 8.7  Hct 30.0  Plt 201  (83.8% N, 11.6% L) Pt 12.9  Ptt 25.8  INR 1.1  Troponin  0.02  [**1-27**] CT abdomen: - Cystic renal cell carcinoma left kidney, likely high-grade papillary type.
- Multiple left lower lobe nodules (in the lungs) are new since [**2197-1-13**].
Though the largest has an appearance concerning for metastasis, this would be unlikely to have grown to 1 cm in this short interval and this may represent a small airways infection or aspiration as is evident in the right middle lobe.
[**6-25**] CXR mild interstital fluid overload without evidence of PNA or pleural effusion.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 84 yo male with pmh of CAD s/p CABG, htn, and renal and pulmonary masses who presents with ARF and a juntional bradycardia.
- Are holding B-blocker due to bradycardia.
Pump  - patient has some signs of volume overload - crackles halfway up his chest and interstial fluid on CXR.
Will monitor and watch his I/Os as he is in renal failure and may become volume overloaded.
- We will continue BP control with norvasc, but are holding metoprolol and diltiazem as he is bradycardic.
Rhythm  - patient is currently in a juntional escape rhythm likely due to his ARF as diltiazem is renally cleared and may be accumulating causing AV block.
Acute renal failure - Differential includes prerenal vs intrarenal vs postrenal.
Unlikey to be prerenal as there is no history to suggest volume depletion.
As for postrenal, he has a history of RCC which could have metastasized or he may have BPH which could have caused obstruction.
Intrarenal causes included extension of his RCC, intrinsic golmerular disease, or interstitial disease.
-  Renal US to rule out obstruction -  F/U urinary electrolytes and [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes -  F/U UA amd UCx -  Consider CT abd/ pelvis to evaluate renal mass .
#  Kidney/ lung masses - last CT abd was in [**1-27**] -  Consider CT abd/ pelvis to evaluate renal mass .
#  Wheezing - patient has crackles and interstial fluid on CXR - albuterol nebs prn - Will monitor respiratory status .
#  Hx of diarrhea and bowel obstruction - continue home PPI, ranitidine and miralax.
#  Sinus problems - continue zyrtec and nasonex .
No IVF at present.
Dispo:  pending resolution of his junctional rhythm and diagnosis of the cause of his ARF .
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI and CABG hx recurrent partial small bowel obstructions htn diverticulitis s/p ccy s/p sigmoid colectomy Dengue fever and malaria in WWII small bowel obstruction in [**2196-1-21**] colonoscopy [**10-16**] with one polyp removed EGD [**2196-10-15**] with gastritis  Social History: Wife died within the 2 months prior to admission.
Notes decreased appetite and endorses depression symptoms.
H/o smoking, but has quit.
Sclera anicteric.
No thyroid enlargement.
Chest: Faint crackles at bases but essentially clear anteriorly.
Bilateral hypoechoic renal lesions, not meeting son[**Name (NI) 493**] criteria for simple cyst.
In setting of the suspicious left renal mass previously described on CT, further characterization of these lesions with MR is recommended.
The left renal superior pole mass highly suspicious for pappillary RCC, seen on CT, [**2197-1-20**] was not demonstrated today.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2197-7-6**]  6:19:00 AM Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats including a slow triplet.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Consolidation is unchanged at the left base since [**6-29**], either atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: Patient is an 84M with a hx of HTN and CAD s/p CABG who p/w weakness and dizziness.
He was found to have renal and pulmonary masses of unknown significance and also found to have bradycardia and renal failture.
He ultimately underwent intubation for hypoxic respoiratory failure due to a combination of NSTEMI and aspiration pneumonia.
He improved to NC 4L on the floor and was stable with improving pulmonary exam until on [**2197-7-2**], he developed hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to mucous plugging and/or aspiration with blood pH 7.08 and CO2 74.
However, he improved without CPAP and has been transitioned back to 4L NC with last ABG on [**7-3**] showing pH 7.26.
He currently feels well with no SOB, CP, abdominal pain or any other complaints.
# Hypercapneic respiratory failure: This was thought to be secondary to witnessed aspiration and either pneumonitis or PNA.
He was started on aspiration and hospital acquired PNA antibiotics.
# NSTEMI:  Patient had many PVCs on telemetry but no evidence of a second infarction.
# Bradycardia: Cause of original admission.
HR was initially in 30s due to junctional rhythm and B-blocker, CCB.
His bradycardia resolved and his HR remained in the 60s.
# Acute renal failure: Cre 2.9 on admission, down to 1.5 at time of discharge, with a baseline of 1.0 - 1.2.
His ARF is likely [**1-21**] hypoperfusion, probably from bradycardia and/or hypotension after NSTEMI.
A renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis/post-renal obstruction from mass, but did identify a lesion suspcious for RCC.
# Kidney and lung masses: Had CT abd in [**1-27**] (showed Cystic renal cell carcinoma left kidney, left lower lobe nodules largest measures 1 cm).
# Anemia: Patient's baseline hematocrit is low 30s, and he likely has anemia of chronic disease.
# Acute decompensated systolic heart failure: with EF 25-30%.
Tolerated IVFs for treatment of ARF which largely resolved.
FEN: cardiac diet, crushed meds, soft solids w/ thin liquids, and one-to-one supervision w/ meds.
Code: DNR/I, not CMO, but no escalation in care.
# Communication: During the hospital stay, we contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's sister [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **]) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 67896**] to inform her of respiratory arrest and intubation; she is the patient's HCP.

You slow heart rate was found to be due to accumulation of the diltiazem secondary to your renal failure.
You were also found to have suffered a heart attack and you developed pneumonia.
Please contact your primary care physician if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or any other concerns.
