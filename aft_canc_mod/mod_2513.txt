Admission Date:  [**2162-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-2-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-11-3**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old male who presented with shortness of breath in [**2161-3-8**].
His workup demonstrated a malignant pleural effusion secondary to metastatic left renal cancer.
He required evacuation of the pleural fluid and talc pleurodesis which led to significant pulmonary function loss.
His abdominal imaging studies demonstrated a large left upper pole renal mass which measured 8 cm X 8 cm in the left renal upper pole.
He has had a CT scan and a bone scan which have shown no other sites of metastatic cancer except some pulmonary nodules which have been noted.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  He is on no medications.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, there was no palpable lymphadenopathy.
He had decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe.
His abdomen was soft, and there was no palpable mass.
His genitourinary examination was normal, and there was no evidence of varicoceles.
The operation was complicated by difficulty in separation of the left upper pole renal mass from the tail of the pancreas which made the operation more challenging.
At one point of the operation there was brisk bleeding from the renal artery stump.
This bleeding was controlled, and a standard flank incision was used to gain access to the abdomen and the retroperitoneum.
On postoperative day one, there was concern that there may be an ischemic bowel.
An emergent CT angiogram demonstrated poor flow in the celiac and the superior mesenteric artery access.
The patient had a hemodialysis in order to better control his hyperkalemia and severe acidosis.
The exploratory laparotomy demonstrated a gangrenous gallbladder and ischemic distal stomach and ischemic pancreas.
The superior mesenteric artery and the celiac arteries were explored by the vascular surgeon, and there was no evidence of any surgical clips in the superior mesenteric artery or the celiac arteries.
The patient's gallbladder was removed during the exploratory laparotomy, and the patient's spleen was also removed because there was poor flow.
Given his multiorgan system failure with his acute respiratory distress syndrome, and DIC picture, and his advanced malignancy, it was discussed with the family to withdraw support, and the patient expired on postoperative day two.
