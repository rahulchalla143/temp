She was admitted on [**2148-4-15**] with shortness of breath and cough and also noted chills and low grade temperature in the Emergency Room.
She was treated for pneumonia with symptomatic improvement.
Hemolysis laboratories were negative.
She reports that after one week at the [**Hospital3 2558**] she began having loose foul smelling stools as frequently as seven times in an hour.
She denied fever, chills and vomiting.
Denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
Her abdominal pain was diffuse but worse on the left side and not always relieved by bowel movements.
Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of atypical chest pain.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, 3/6 systolic murmur throughout.
Abdomen is diffusely tender to deep palpation with guarding, question rebound.
Bruises throughout her extremities, 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted on [**6-1**] with acidosis, elevated lactate and gram negative stool and started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for infectious versus ischemic colitis.
Abdominal CT revealed trace ascites and pan colitis.
Therefore, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was switched to intravenous Flagyl and po vancomycin for better C. difficile coverage, as well as intravenous vancomycin because of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her PICC line.
She developed extremity erythema believed to be secondary to trauma.
Levophed was started because of low blood pressures.
Head CT was negative on [**6-11**] because of mental status and echocardiogram revealed no vegetations.
There was no evidence of green dye from the tube feeds in the suction secretions.
Her 02 saturations remained stable and she had not complained of chest pain or discomfort.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe opacities.
The right pleural effusion appeared possibly larger than the previous one, however, the chest x-ray was PA and lateral versus portables on prior films.

He was able to palpate a pulse in her carotid arteries only.
She appeared comfortable and was pronounced dead at 5:20 p.m. without breath sounds, heart sounds, pulse, with fixed and dilated pupils.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Probable etiologies for this acute event in unclear, however, because of the quick change in mental status to unresponsiveness and the manner of the breathing, a central nervous system bleed is in the differential diagnoses with her history of thrombocytopenia with platelet count around 20,000.
Other possibilities include pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction or massive aspiration, however, there was no evidence of increased secretions when suctioning was performed.
