Sensation: Intact to light touch and cold throughout.
Gait: Narrow based, mildly unsteady and wobbles twice.
Multiple high-attenuation foci in bilateral cerebral hemispheres.
Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic, hypervascular or adenocarcinomatous metastases.
There is a 6.8 mm leftward subfalcine herniation with early uncal herniation.
MRI brain: [**4-26**]: FINDINGS: There is extensive metastatic disease with multiple rounded rim- enhancing lesions in all lobes of the brain.
The largest lesions include: A 1 x 0.9 cm mass at the left frontal vertex, 2 x 1.6 cm mass in the right parietal lobe, 1.6 x 1.4 cm mass in the right lentiform nucleus, 1.3 x 1.2 cm mass in the right temporal cortex, 1.9 x 1.7 cm mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere, and 1.5 x 1.2 cm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as well as multiple subcentimeter lesions.
There is moderate vasogenic edema, with severe extensive edema in the right frontal and parietal lobes surrounding the right parietal and right lentiform nucleus lesions.
Mass effect and effacement of the right lateral ventricle as well as subfalcine herniation with 9 mm of leftward midline shift are stable from prior CT.
The suprasellar cisterns are poorly visualized and there is distortion of the interpeduncular cistern.
Nearly all of the lesions demonstrate hypervascularity and hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Innumerable hypervascular and hemorrhagic metastases throughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres with extensive edema in the right frontal and parietal lobes and evidence of subfalcine and early uncal herniation.
CXR: [**4-26**]: Left lower lobe mass as described highly suspicious for metastatic spread.
With question of worsening diplopia, pt'd decadron was increased to 4 Q4hrs.
Neuro oncology evaluated her and will follow her in brain tumor clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].Pt with diplopia worse with lateral gaze to either direction suggestive of bilateral VIth nerve palsies.
