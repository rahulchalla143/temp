The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is a dissection flap visible originating in the aortic sinus and extending into the distal arch at the level of the left subclavian artery.The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
AV paciong for slow ventricular response.
Ascending aortic graft without leak or visible dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room on [**2163-5-27**] for type A dissection, after initial assessment he underwent emergent Ascending aortic/hemi-arch aorta replacement with 30-mm Gelweave graft and resuspension of the aortic valve.
during subsequent attempts to wean from ventilator he developed atrial fibrillation, he converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone and Bblockers.
He was extubated on POD 3, after which he experienced post-op delerium, which improved with Haldol and  discontinuation of narcotics.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD eight the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
