Alert, no acute distress.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, decreased breath sounds RLL, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: tachycardic, normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: well healed midline surgical scar, +ventral hernia that reduces on its own.
Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, some peripheral edema, LLE > RLE.
no clubbing, cyanosis.

ventral hernia noted M/S: moving all extremities, however unable to lift left arm against gravity, otherwise strength 5/5.
trace LE edema bilaterally.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is again notable for thickening of the right paratracheal stripe compatible with known mediastinal adenopathy.
[**2122-1-27**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON -  No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
Incompletely evaluated large right lower lobe pulmonary mass, not significantly changed in size compared to CT from [**2121-12-15**].
No evidence of obstruction or strangulation.
Non-specific lucency within the left iliac bone, not significantly changed in appearance.
LENIS [**1-28**]: IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT.
# GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING - Patient had guaiac positive stool in the ED (confirmed by GI physician) with an unsuccessful nasogastric lavage.
There was initial concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding given his hematocrit of 17% (10% drop since [**2122-1-20**]) - though that was after transfusion for a hematocrit of 23% on [**2122-1-15**].
Patient has been taking  Ibuprofen for headache while on steroids, which could predispose the patient to gastritis among other issues.
Patient does report history of polyps on colonoscopy 6-years prior and has known diverticular disease, which could be a source for lower GI bleeding.
We initiated a Protonix infusion following a bolus and consulted the GI specialists.
He was maintained NPO with plans for endoscopy, however HCT stabilized and he remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 92416**] or hematochezia.
Given risks associated with intervention and the lack of evidence for acute bleeding the decision was made to empirically treat with PPI without endoscopy.
# SEVERE MICROCYTIC ANEMIA - Patient has unclear hematocrit baseline and has known anemia with recent hematocrit of 23% following recent transfusion in [**Hospital 20722**] clinic.
Chronic GI bleeding, marrow suppression given his underlying malignancy vs. marrow suppressive therapy could be contributing.
# METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER - The patient is status-post resection and cyberknife of brain metastatsis and first cycle of chemotherapy.
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA - On reviewing his record, patient's baseline heart rate has been in the 110-120s (lowest HR recorded in clinic was 112), except for a single EKG from [**2121-12-17**] documenting a rate of 80 bpm.
Patient continued to have sinus tachycardia despite blood tranfusions and IVF making hypovolemia less likely.
Had CTA chest on [**2121-12-25**] which was negative for PE and patient remained in no respiratory distress, without pleuritic chest pain, and maintained oxygen saturations in the 90s on room air.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Also, likely component of overlying anxiety.
# ASTHMA, COPD - Patient denies history of COPD, however given his smoking history, this was likely.
# FEVERS - Patient had reported temperature of 99.2F in the ED, and was given Cefepime for unclear source.
An infectious work-up was performed with reassuring blood and urine cultures.
