New enhancing hepatic mass and increased number and size of pulmonary nodules at the lung bases compatible with worsening metastatic disease.
Several osseous metastatic lesions with soft tissue components are not significantly changed in the interval.
Worsening diffuse septal thickening, likely reflective of worsening pulmonary edema, though lymphangitic carcinomatosis is not excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right larger than left.
New moderate volume ascites.

Active Issues: --------------- # Septic shock: [**3-11**] SBP:  He met SIRS criteria (HR, RR, WBC)on admission and required levophed after 2L NS with most likely etiology SBP.
Hypersensitivity reaction to gadolinium has been described but is rare, and he has previously received gadolinium.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out.
# SBP: He completed a course of ceftriaxone and given albumin on day 1 and day 3.
#New Onset Ascites: likely due to new hepatic mets and or carcinomatosis.
No portal or splenic vein thrombosis seen.
He had difficulty removing fluid during HD due to hypotension, which had been a problem at his out patient facility as well and so he was started on midorine.
# HTN: pt remained normo-tensive with his baseline SBP in the 100s.
# Anemia: likely [**3-11**] chronic disease and chemo.
