Severe destructive changes of the T9 vertebral body and the T10 vertebral body with focal kyphosis measuring approximately 50 degrees.
This is causing severe canal stenosis and likely compression of the cord.
High-density material seen within and around the destroyed T9 vertebral body and right posterior elements with some well-circumscribed bony defects of the T9 body on the left.
These findings likely represent prior corpectomy with graft material or polymethylmethacrylate placement.
The lytic lesions causing the bony destructive changes at these levels likely represent metastases given the prior right nephrectomy.
Differential diagnostic possibility would also include myeloma.
Mild anterior wedge deformity of the T11 vertebral body.

H etolerated this procedure well, was kept intubated and transferred to ICU post op for close monitoring.
On discharge he was noted to have some serosangous drainage from his wound no redness, fluid collection or edema.
