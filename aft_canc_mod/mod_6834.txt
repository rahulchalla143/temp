Admission Date:  [**2134-8-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-8-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-7-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 72 y/o M with hx of stage 4 squamous cell esophageal CA who has been on palliative chemo with xeloda and s/p recent radiation therapy who presents from home with respiratory distress.
Per the ED and the family, he had been home about a week with plans to transition to home hospice and eventually recover enough to make it home to [**Country 3587**] when he started having more [**Last Name (LF) 83413**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] increasing morphine requirement for pain in his whole body and then the last two days, respiratory distress.
They deny that he was coughing or choking, saying that he just doesn't swallow at all anymore.
He had no other focal complaints.
In the ED, initial vitals were significant for tachypneia, hypoxia and an SBP in the 80s.
On arrival to the floor, he was intubated and sedated and not withdrawing to pain or moving on his own.
History of squamous cell esophageal cancer 2.
History of hypertension for the last two years.
History of mild depression under control.
History of mild benign prostate hypertrophy.
History of mild elevated cholesterol levels and glucose levels.
He had major surgical procedures at that time .
# stage IVb esophageal cancer of squamous cell histology: Patient presented in with a three-month history of dysphagia to our clinic in [**2133-9-12**].
Further workup disclosed a circumferential lesion in the mid third of the esophagus.
A biopsy of the lesion disclosed a squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Additional findings included lymphadenopathy in the periesophageal area corresponding to a locally advanced cancer as well as additional lymphadenopathy in his right supraclavicular and cervical area.
His PET CT scan demonstrated FDG uptake in all enlarged lymph node areas and biopsy of the supraclavicular node confirmed carcinoma.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Given his recent hospitalization for dysphagia and increased cancer pain at home, most likely cause was aspiration pneumonia.
Repeat chest X rays showed no significant change.
Initially, he was ventilated on Assist Control, but overbreathing on this setting and high autoPEEP prompted switching him to PS with increased sedation.
Pt was too agitated and weak to breathe adequately off the vent.
# SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: Pt had positive blood cultures from [**8-22**] of Strep anginosus, but the validity and source of this bacteremia is not clear: the Strep grew in only 1 out of 4 tubes, and the sputum culture from [**8-22**] grew GNR.
No sign of skin breakage or other potential skin source of infection on physical exam.
Pt did not have diarrhea in the unit, so bowel infection unlikely.
Despite finishing an 8-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration PNA/sepsis and improving in terms of infectious signs (pressures, wbc, lactate), pt's overall condition did not improve.
# Hypotension: Most of this was probably due to his sepsis, but bleeding as evidenced by his continually dropping hct may also have been contributing.
Initially adrenal insufficiency was also in the differential: this became unlikely since stress-dose steroids in-house did not improve his pressures.
# Acute Anemia: hct dropped from 40 to 25 in the week before admission; no evidence of frank bleed, guaiac positive in the ED.
Pt seemed to be bleeding, likely [**3-16**] indolent GIB from esophageal cancer, but other factors also contributing: hemodilution, anemia of acute illness.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have had underlying pancytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration of his cancer or suppression from extended course of palliative chemo.
#Thrombocytopenia: Pt initially thought to have pancytopenia at admission, but leucopenia normalized after the first day of hospitalization ??????
likely due to acute infection ??????
There was an acute drop in plt count to 69 mid-course that may have been drug-related.
DIC was unlikely given wnl and then elevated fibrinogen.
D-dimer at admission was elevated, but that could also have been [**3-16**] cancer or septic shock.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] communicated important information on [**8-24**], that pt's goals of care were not hospice per se but stabilization before returning to [**Country 3587**] on commercial flight.
Pt's family seemed ready to keep him at intubated on a vent and sedated for an indefinite period.
# ARF: had new ARF at admission, but Cr returned to [**Location 213**] after receiving fluids and remained stably normal.
Likely pre-renal from septic shock with poor perfusion.
# Hypothyroidism: no hx of hypothyroidism.
Could be [**3-16**] sick euthyroid vs pituitary hypoperfusion from septic shock or (unlikely) metastasis.
No role for Synthroid initiation at that point.
# Hyperlipidemia: simvastatin held in the unit.
