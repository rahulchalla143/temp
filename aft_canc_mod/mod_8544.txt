History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a a 76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer who presents with failure to thrive.
Recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2191-3-25**] - [**2191-4-3**]) with abdominal pain and constipation.
An abdominal CT showed a 28 x 53 mm mass in the body and tail of the pancreatic as well as multiple hepatic lesions, the largest measuring 19 x 21 mm, peritoneal implants, and omental caking.
Cytology of the peritoneal fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma, and the left groin biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma staining positive for CK7, CK20, and CEA, negative for mammoglobin and GCDFP.
Since that visit, she has been "dramatically worse" with little to no PO intake.
This is partly due to poor appetite and partly due to inability to keep down significant PO.
Her pain has been minimally controlled and is focussed in the back and right chest area.
Breast cancer: - Left breast cancer diagnosed in [**2162**] treated with mastectomy.
- Right breast cancer diagnosed in [**2168**], treated with mastectomy plus six months CMF adjuvant chemotherapy.
Rheumatoid arthritis 4.
Asthma 5.
Hypertension 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
Hypothyroidism 8.
Status post USO for endometriosis 9.
Family History: Her brother died of lung cancer at 70 years.
Her sister had a questionable history of breast cancer or calcium deposits.
GEN - Thin woman, lying in bed in no distress but ill appearing.
PULM - Decreased breath sounds; poor effort.
ABD - Distended and tender.
No rebound or guarding.
ECG #1 ([**2191-4-8**]) - Sinus tachycardia.
ECG #2 ([**2191-4-8**]) - Sinus tachycardia.
There is mild decreased activity in the posterior perfusion and ventilation images of the right lung that likely corresponds to atelectasis/ effusion on the chest x-ray.
There are small matched perfusion and ventilation defects in the lung periphery.
Overall, findings are consistent with a low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: Mild decreased activity in the right lung on posterior views likely corresponds to the effusion on the chest x-ray.
Findings are consistent with a low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
Abdomen X-ray ([**2191-4-8**]) - FINDINGS: There are some gas filled loops of centrally positioned large bowel.
Bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and does not suggest ileus or obstruction.
There is evidence of a spinal fusion likely at L4 and L5.
There is degenerative disease in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
CXR ([**2191-4-8**]) - FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no definite evidence of pneumonia.
The aorta is somewhat tortuous and calcified.
There is no overt congestion.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusions which are not appreciably changed from prior study.
CT Head ([**2191-4-8**]) - FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major territorial infarct is apparent.
There is a linear region of hypoattenuation within the anterior limb of the internal capsule on the left and in the periventricular deep white matter adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle on the right consistent with old lacunar infarctions.
There is mild periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
There is mild prominence to the bifrontal extra- axial spaces bilaterally most consistent with atrophy.
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Old lacunar infarcts and mild bilateral frontal lobe atrophy.
CT Abdomen / Pelvis ([**2191-4-8**]) - CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate pleural effusions bilaterally with associated relaxation atelectasis, increased from previous.
Evaluation of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic organs is quite limited given lack of intravenous contrast administration and moderate-to-large amount of ascites within the abdomen.
However, numerous metastatic lesions within the liver are again noted, many of which have increased in size over the short interval of time.
The gallbladder, spleen, and visualized large and small bowel appear within normal limits.
A gastric hiatal hernia is again noted.
The kidneys again demonstrate numerous cystic lesions and other lesions not well characterized on this non-contrast study.
There is dense calcified atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta.
There is no hydronephrosis.
Given lack of IV contrast administration, the exact boundaries of the pancreatic mass within the body and tail is difficult to adequately measure; however, it appears grossly unchanged.
No free air is identified within the abdomen.
CT PELVIS: A large amount of ascites is present within the pelvis, limiting evaluation.
Several soft tissue nodules are again identified to the right of the bladder along the peritoneal surface, consistent with peritoneal drop metastases.
A lower anterior left abdominal wall lesion is again noted.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
There is stable grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 and marked degenerative disc disease with endplate sclerosis from L2 to L5.
Limited evaluation given lack of intravenous contrast and moderate-to-large amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
There is no evidence of small-bowel obstruction or acute process.
Increased size and number of hepatic metastatic lesions consistent with progression of metastatic disease.
Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions and associated relaxation atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 76-yo woman with recently-diagnosed extensively-metastatic pancreatic cancer, who initially presented with worsening shortness of breath and right rib pain.
She was admitted to the MICU, where goals of care were addressed with the patient and the family with regards to her extensively-metastatic pancreatic cancer, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.
They wanted to make the patient comfortable without aggressive measures.
shortness of breath.
