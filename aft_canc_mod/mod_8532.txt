Admission Date:  [**2195-12-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-12-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-7-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: The patient presented electively for surgical excision of multiple hypodense liver lesions.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59 year-old male with a history of chronic HCV and cirrhosis diagnosed 5 years ago and a diagnosis of HIV positivity approximately 1 year ago.
He was first demonstrated in [**2194-11-19**] to have multiple hypodense lesions within the liver with nodular hyper enhancement that were thought to represent hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric and gastroesophageal varices but no ascites.
On [**2-6**], he underwent a biopsy of a segment III mass that demonstrated cirrhosis and focal areas of coagulated necrosis but no evidence of malignancy.
Repeat biopsy on [**3-11**] demonstrated at well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis consistent with viral hepatitis C. He has had several repeat CT scans and MRI scans.
His most recent CT scan on [**11-16**] demonstrated a lesion at the junction of segment VIII and [**Doctor First Name 690**] that measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm.
He also has a mass in segment II that this 4.2 x 2.9 cm.
There is a second lesion in segment  II measuring 1.6 x 1.6 cm and there are numerous lesions within the left and right lobe too small to be fully  characterized.
We therefore felt that he was a potential surgical candidate for left hepatic lobectomy and possible radiofrequency ablation of a small lesion that was questioned deep in the right lobe of the liver on prior scans.
Past Medical History: HIV HCV with cirrhosis HCC HTN Diverticular disease with bloody diarrhea   Social History: Lives with his partner, [**Name (NI) **] x 20+ years (HIV status unknown) Food service prep manager Quit smoking in [**8-/2194**] (-) EtOH since [**2178**] Denies any other drug use No children Cat (indoor)  Family History: Uncle-colon CA Both parents-died of old age, he does not know of any heart or kidney disease  Physical Exam: On admission - weight 68.2 kg Vital Signs T 98.3, HR 97, BP 118/60, RR 18, 99% RA Neuro- alert male in no acute distress.
Skin:  No palmar erythema or spider angiomata.
He has no ascites.
Extremities:  No peripheral edema.
Left lateral segment: Multiple nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma ranging from 1 mm up to 3.5 cm.see synoptic report.
Comments:  Focal tumor necrosis is seen.
Liver away from the tumor shows grade 2 inflammation and cirrhosis (stage 4).
Segment 3 liver nodule right 3.
It consists of a segment of liver measuring 1 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm.
The capsular surface is remarkable for a nodule measuring 0.2 x 0.2 cm raised 0.1 cm above the capsular surface.
It consists of a fragment of liver measuring 1 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm.
It consists of a fragment of liver measuring 0.8 x 1 x 0.3 cm.
It consists of a segment of liver measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm.
The capsular surface is micronodular in appearance but with no gross nodules or masses.
The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm firm white nodule and otherwise unremarkable cut surfaces.
The deep surface is remarkable for a firm white nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.7 x 1 cm, which is adjacent to the cauterized margin of the specimen.
This nodule is just deep to the previously mentioned posterior nodule and comes to within 0.1 cm of the cauterized margin grossly.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: H=posterior nodule with respect to cauterized margin and larger nodule, I=two sections of larger nodule at closest cauterized margin, J=additional section of larger nodule, K=additional section of unremarkable cauterized margin, L=representative sections of small nodule, M=representative sections of relatively unremarkable liver.
It consists of a segment of liver measuring 3.8 x 2.6 x 3 cm with a central ulcerated nodule at the capsule measuring 2 x 2 x 2 cm and raised 0.5 cm above the capsular surface.
The specimen is serially sectioned and represented as follows: cassettes N-O=large nodule at cauterized margin, cassette P=additional section of larger nodule at capsule and relatively unremarkable liver.
His pain was well controlled and he was encouraged to ambulate.
The patient had increased drain output and was started on IV fluid replacement POD 5 and supplement shakes were added for poor oral intake.
