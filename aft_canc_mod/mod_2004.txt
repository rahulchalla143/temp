The patient was admitted to OSH on [**4-18**] with acute shortness of breath.
She was found to have RLL PNA on CXR and intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She was treated empirically with ceftriazone, azithromycin for CAP and Solumedrol for COPD exacerbation.
Initial ECG was notable for TWI throughout the precordium and CK and troponin peaked on HD 2 at 205, 1.21.
An echo was notable for EF 65% with concentric LVH.
The patient was (+) 4.5 L, F/U CXR were suggestive of b/l effusions and her BNP peaked at 3120 so she was diuresed with lasix 40 PO bid.
On AC, her hypoxia and hypercarbia improved but she was difficult to wean [**12-23**] to decreased mental status despite a negative head CT. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with "anoxic brain injury" and attempts to wean.

finishing neb HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, OP clear Neck: no JVD appreciable due to large size, bandage of central line site CV: RRR, no g/m/r Chest: crackles at both bases but on left [**11-23**] of the way up, unchanged from this am,  moderate air movement.
** CXR: Findings suggest probable failure with bilateral effusions and post-surgical changes in the left hemithorax.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded at the left base.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Distal septal hypokinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
** RUE U/S: No evidence for deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity veins.
No wall perfusion defects.
** VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT)  [**2145-4-30**] 1:42 PM No evidence of DVT, left lower extremity.
She completed her course of antibiotics for a ?
There was a question of whether an acute MI caused the patient's respiratory failure on the day of her presentation to the outside hospital.
At midnight on HD #12, patient was noted to go into acute respiratory distress.
She had very poor air movement and was hypoxic to 83%.
EKG with persistent Q waves in lateral leads and continued poor R wave progression.
No new changes.
Of note patient had a recent normal P MIBI, but this may be a false negative if patient has L Main disease.
The patient was then transferred back to the floor with a plan to have a pMIBI for rule out ischemia.
MIBI was performed the following day, and was found to be negative for perfusion defects.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient was treated for LLL PNA and COPD exacerbation at OSH.
The patient had slight EKG changes during acute hypoxia this hospitalization (pseudonormalization of T waves in V4-6), and positive troponin leak (but always < 0.1).
EKG is now unchanged from previous and stress MIBI done was negative for ischemia.
COPD - She was eventually changed to her outpatient regimen of Combivent, Fluticasone, and Salmeterol inhalers.
DIABETES - She was continued on fixed dose of NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
This increased requirement is likely due to steroid treatment and should be titrated down when appropriate.
ANEMIA - The patient was anemic on this admission.
There were no active signs of bleeding.
RIGHT UPPER EXT EDEMA: A RUE ultrasound was done which did not show evidence of DVT.
CONCERN FOR HIT: The patient had a slight drop in her platelets on this admission.
