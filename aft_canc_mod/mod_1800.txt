CT A/P ([**2115-7-27**]) - Findings compatible with a small-bowel obstruction, with transition point difficult to ascertain, though likely in the left mid abdomen.
Cholelithiasis and a mildly distended gallbladder with no secondary signs of cholecystitis.
GI Bleeding Study ([**2115-7-27**]) - No definite evidence of GI bleed.
However, there is a questionable mild area of uptake in the rectum on the lateral view, and active bleed cannot be entirely excluded.

Stigmata of recent bleeding was seen up to the distal sigmoid colon.
Areas of erythema likely secondary to NGT trauma.
Anastomosis patent.
