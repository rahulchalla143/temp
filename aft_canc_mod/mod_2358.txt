Esophagus and proximal stomach, esophagogastrectomy (A-AK):  A.  Esophageal adenocarcinoma; well differentiated, with invasion into the superficial submucosa (pT1b); see synoptic report.
B.  Twenty two lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/22).
C.  Single focus of lymphatic invasion identified and confirmed with D2-40 immunostain (block F).
Lymph node, level 7, excision ([**Doctor Last Name **]):  One lymph node with no carcinoma seen (0/1).
Gastric fundus, excision (AM-AN):  Segment of gastric fundus, within normal limits; no carcinoma seen.
IV:  Esophagus, "donut", excision (AO-AP):  Unremarkable segment of squamous-lined esophagus; no carcinoma seen.
V.  Stomach, "donut", excision (AQ):  Unremarkable fundic mucosa/submucosa; no carcinoma seen.
[**2134-12-19**] CXR ; 1) Compared with earlier the same day, improvement in CHF findings and in the right pleural effusion.
2) Patchy opacities throughout the right lung slightly improved, but persistent.
3) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion unchanged  [**2134-12-24**] CXR : 1.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusion unchanged.
Stable post-operative widening of the mediastinum due to fluid filling the neoesophagus.
Moderate bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Heart size normal  [**2134-12-27**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
He required reintubation for hypercarbia but was easily extubated on post op day #1.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was controlled with an epidural catheter.
During his ICU stay he developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was started on Lopressor and amiodarone which eventually controlled his rate.
He had low grade fevers and a leukocytosis to 14.7K with chest xray findings of bibasilar opacities.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor his nasogastric tube was removed and he had a barium swallow on post op day # 8 which revealed no leak.
He was also evaluated by the Cardiology service as he had persistent bouts of atrial fibrillation sometimes as high as 140 but was asymptomatic.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was out of town but his office staff was very helpful in reviewing his past history as there was a question of a GI bleed on aspirin in [**2131**].
On [**2133-12-28**] his Amiodarone was decreased to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month then 200 mg daily.He also was diuresed with Lasix 20 mg daily with dramatic effect on his peripheral edema and therefore was discharged on lasix 20 mg daily for 3 days.
