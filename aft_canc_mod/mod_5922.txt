History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 98931**] is a 68-year-old man with a history of cervical myelopathy and CIDP who presents with worsening weakness.
He has in the past been treated with CellCept, but this was ineffective, and Imuran caused a flu-like reaction.
He has also recently been treated with IVIg, but this has had to be held due to an acute worsening of his chronic renal insufficiency - last treatment was [**2148-12-26**].
However, at the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], he developed tingling in his nose and hands, and his prednisone was increased to 10 mg daily alternating with 15 mg daily.
His proximal arm weakness was noted to be worse at his visit on [**1-9**].
At the time, this was thought perhaps due to his cervical myelopathy.
However, he has progressed further since that time to the point of being unable to get up the stairs to his apartment without assistance; as recently as one month ago he was walking up 46 steps at the [**Location (un) **] T station without help.
He did have a C-spine MRI last week that showed a large disk compressing the cord at C4/5.
Mr. [**Known lastname 98931**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
[**Last Name (Titles) **] difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
[**Last Name (Titles) **] focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, he reports some recent diarrhea, consistent with his alternating constipation and diarrhea of IBS.
He [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] recent fever or chills.

Pertinent Results: Radiologic Data: MRI C-spine: Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine with severe canal stenosis at C4/5.
Although the cord is compressed at this level, there are no cord signal abnormalities.
Fragmented bone marrow biopsy with maturing trilineage erythroid dominant hematopoiesis.
Absent iron stores .
Renal US: LIMITED LIVER ULTRASOUND: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
The gallbladder appears normal without evidence of stones on this non-fasting study.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation; the CBD measures 4 mm in diameter.
Color Doppler demonstrates patent and anterograde portal venous flow.
There is no ascites.
No pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Patchy right upper lobe airspace opacity.
Mid thoracic vertebral body compression deformity of unknown chronicity.
CT NEck: CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with acute hypoxia and tachypnea.
There is slight thickening of the right aryepiglottic fold identified.
There are postoperative changes in the lower cervical region with patient status post anterior discectomy.
There are degenerative changes visualized in the cervical spine.
No definite focal abscess identified.
Soft tissue changes are seen in the partially visualized right sphenoid sinus and a retention cyst is seen in the left maxillary sinus.
At the right lung apex, linear opacities are identified with opacities at the posterior lung base which could be due to atelectasis.
Soft tissue changes identified at the level of upper aspect of the postoperative change with indentation on the posterior aspect of the oropharyngeal airway, thickening of the right aryepiglottic fold, and obliteration of the right piriform sinus could be related to surgery but are slightly unusual in position and direct inspection is recommended to exclude focal abnormality.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has improved, right lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged, ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe is also stable.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.

He also has sensory loss distally.
These findings are consistent with a neuropathy, although the progressive weakness may be a result of his myelopathy.
Cervical myelopathy: The patient was admitted to the neurology service as his exam suggested an upper motor neuron pattern of weakness (consistent with spinal cord compromise more than his known CIDP), for consideration of surgery.
Orthopedics evaluated him (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**]) after an MRI showed cord compression in the upper cervical cord.
Lower motor neuron signs of weakness consistent with the CIDP were quite mild throughout the admission, and in fact, as his renal function improved (initial reason IVIG was stopped), IVIG was re-initiated, both for CIDP and for platelet dysfunction.
Acute on chronic renal insufficiency FENa was checked and was 0.3, suggesting an element of pre-renal failure, likely due to poor po intake and chronic diarrhea from IBS.
Respiratory illness On post-op day 3 following the discectomy and fusion (decompression of spinal cord), he was found to be febrile to 103.5 axillary, with low level of responsiveness and sats in the low 80s (80-82%), tachypneic on exam with rhonchorous lung sounds, and no improvement with high-flow nasal cannula.
He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanco, levaquin and flagyl), and maintained on nonrebreather as this was unable to be weaned without substantial drop in oxygen saturations.
CTPA and CT of the neck were ordered which showed no post-surgical abscess and no PE but confirmed a bilateral consolidation consistent with a significant aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagl to cover for aspiration pneumonia and also to cover for MRSA given his long hospital course.
In addition to his thrombocytopenia, he was anemic, felt to be severe iron deficiency-related.
he had a bone marrow biopsy on this admission - this was not consistent with a myelodysplastic syndrome.
Diabetes Team held metformin in preparation for possible surgery and imaging studies, continued glyburide, while covering with ISS.
Cervical stenosis with myelopathy.
Cervical spondylosis.
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuritis.
Thrombocytopenia with idiopathic thrombocytopenic     purpura.
During your hospitalization, you had an aspiration pneumonia.
If you notice drainage or redness around the incision, or if you have a fever greater than 100.5, please call the office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].
