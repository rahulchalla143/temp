Left sided craniotomy for resection.
Microscopic dissection.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76 year old woman with a history of high blood pressure and cholesterol now presenting on transfer from [**Hospital3 **] with decreased responsiveness and a question of mass on head ct.  She is unable to give a history, so the story is gathered from family members (sons) at her bedside.
This morning, she awoke, called a family member and said she felt dizzy and couldn't breath.
The ED staff was concerned for seizures and gave her 4 mg of ativan and loaded her with dilantin.
They obtained a head ct which showed a left parietal hypodensity with some "vasogenic edema".

[**2103-6-15**] 02:19AM BLOOD Phenyto-6.3* [**2103-6-15**] 12:30PM BLOOD Phenyto-8.1* [**2103-6-25**] 10:15AM BLOOD Phenyto-6.1* *  *  *  * Head CT w/contrast [**2103-6-14**]: FINDINGS:  In the posterior left frontal lobe, at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, there is a 2 cm rim mass with relatively thick enhancing rim and extensive surrounding vasogenic edema.
There is no evidence for acute hemorrhage in the mass or elsewhere.
The overlying left frontal sulci are compressed secondary to edema, but there is no significant shift of midline structures, and only minimal mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
There is no parenchymal or meningeal enhancement elsewhere.
There is no evidence of bone destructive lesion.
There is mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:  2 cm rim-enhancing posterior left frontal lobe mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There are sub segmental bilateral lower lobe opacities.
Tiny low attenuation focus in the left kidney may represent a cyst but is too small to be fully characterized.
There is no free air or free fluid.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.
Colonic diverticula are noted without evidence of diverticulitis, most prominent in the sigmoid colon.
There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities more likely to represent a small amount of aspiration than atelectasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
No abnormalities identified as a potential source for the potential cerebral abscess.
EEG [**2103-6-15**]: IMPRESSION: EEG most consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
No evidence of ongoing seizures is seen at the time of the recording.
Head MR/MRA [**2103-6-15**]: FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI: The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
There is an area of brain edema seen in the left posterior frontal lobe with rim enhancing approximately 2-cm lesion in the subcortical region of the left frontal lobe.
There are no other foci of abnormal enhancement seen.
Mild mass effect is seen on the adjacent sulci and the left lateral ventricle without midline shift.
No definite other areas of abnormal enhancement are seen.
There is no evidence of slow diffusion seen within the center of this lesion.
The ventricles are normal in size, and there is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:  Rim-enhancing left posterior frontal lobe subcortical lesion with edema in the surrounding brain.
The most likely diagnosis is metastatic disease.
Head CT [**2103-6-18**]: FINDINGS:  There is no  interval change in the extent of vasogenic edema involving the left frontal lobe compared to [**2103-6-14**].
There is minimal mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle with effacement of the overlying left frontal sulci secondary to edema.
There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures or  hydrocephalus.
Polypoid mucosal thickening is present in the right maxillary sinus.
There is no evidence of bone destructive lesion.
IMPRESSION:  No  interval change in extent of left frontal lobe vasogenic edema.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
EEG [**2103-6-19**]: IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) over the entire left hemisphere and due to a slow and disorganized background.
The second abnormality suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a mild encephalopathy.
The first abnormality represents epileptiform discharges.
There was no continuous seizure activity recorded.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left common femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal veins.
Head MRI [**2103-6-20**]: IMPRESSION:  Enhancing left posterior frontal lobe mass with surrounding edema for stereotactic localization prior to surgery.
There is no interval change in the extent of vasogenic edema involving the left frontal lobe compared to [**2103-6-18**].
There is a minimal amount of air and hemorrhage at the resection site.
There is mild mass effect on the adjacent lateral ventricle which is unchanged compared to the prior study.
No other sites of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage are identified.
There is mild mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION:  Status post resection of left parietal mass with expected postoperative changes as described above.
No interval change in the extent of left frontal lobe vasogenic edema or mild mass effect on the lateral ventricle.
Head MRI [**2103-6-24**]: FINDINGS:  Pre-contrast study reveals T1 hyperintensity within the left temporal tumor resection bed as well as along the contiguous convexity surface.
Some of this signal abnormality also manifests susceptibility, primarily along its rim.
Presumably, the findings are consistent with postoperative hemorrhage, with the more superficial T1 hyperintensity, possibly relating to surgical material (?
Following contrast infusion, there is minimal residual enhancement, although somewhat irregular in contour, around the margins of the resection site.
This enhancement, while potentially postoperative, may also represent residual tumor and obviously will require continuing followup examinations to determine which diagnosis is correct.
There is persistent extensive surrounding edema, with mild compression of the left lateral ventricle.
There is no subfalcine herniation and there is no overt change in ventricular size.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 76 year old woman with a history of high blood pressure and cholesterol now presenting with decreased responsivenss.
Imaging shows rim enhancing lesion L-post frontal lobe with vasogenic edema.
The differential for her lesion included a neoplasm, infection, or stroke (would be atypical).
A head CT w/contrast performed in the ED showed that the mass was contrast-enhancing which could be suggestive for tumor (primary or metastatic) vs abscess.
While intubated, she underwent a head MRI which showed rim-enhancing left posterior frontal lobe subcortical lesion with edema in the surrounding brain, and a torso CT, part of a metastatic work up.
The latter was negative and showed only bilateral lower lobe opacities more likely to represent a small amount of aspiration than atelectasis.
An EEG showed no seizure activity.
She developed a free water deficit as manifested by hypernatremia, hyperchloremia and elevated BUN.
Floor course: After transfer to the floor, her neurological status could be better evaluated: she was alert, awake, oriented, able to speak, no difficulty understanding or repeating words; she had no pronator drift but a mild weakness (4+) of the finger extensors on the R; she also appeared to have a deep perineal nerve palsy (foot drop) on the left which was treated conservatively.
A head CT showed normal post operative changes, no acute unexpected bleeding.
A post op MRI w/gadolinium showed some postoperative blood and minimal residual contrast enhancement, although somewhat irregular in contour, around the margins of the resection site.
This enhancement, while potentially postoperative, may also represent residual tumor.
From a neurological standpoint, the patient is alert, oriented, has some mild word finding difficulties and makes paraphasic errors.
She will continue to wear a brace for her L-foot drop.
She had no clinical seizures after her surgery.
CV: For hypertension she was put on the following regimen: metoprolol 75mg PO TID, amlodipine 10mg PO daily, lisinopril 10mg PO daily.
She ruled out for MI per serial cardiac enzymes.
An ECG showed NSR, no strain.
Prophylaxis includes protonix, tylenol, hep sc, and a bowel regimen.
