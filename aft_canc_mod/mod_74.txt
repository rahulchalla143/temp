Admission Date:  [**2169-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-8-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-11-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Bradycardia (slow heart rate)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Implantation of a Pacemaker ([**Company 1543**] VDD type single lead)   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname 1975**] [**Known lastname 5512**] is a 74 yo [**Known lastname 595**]-speaking male with ESRD on HD, h/o mild CAD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diastolic dysfunction, who presented to hemodialysis today and was found to be bradycardic.
He completed hemodialysis without any complications and had 2.5L of fluid removed.
He denied having any previous episodes of bradycardia.
He has had one hospital admission ([**11-17**]) for bradycardia in the past in the setting of severe hyperkalemia (K=8.9).
At that time he was treated with atropine and ended up with a wide-complex tachycardia requiring intubation and pressors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
- CAD - cath here in [**2155**] with moderate ramus intermedius disease (discrete 50% stenosis) and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction - History of atrial fibrillation with [**Year (4 digits) 5509**] documented once in the ED in [**3-/2167**] - H/o bradycardia and WCT as above in HPI - ETT [**2153**]: Atypical symptoms in the absence of ischemic ECG changes or reversible defects by thallium to the acheived low level of exercise  Social History: Pt lives alone, wife has passed away, retired.
HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear, Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - Diffuse wheezing throughout lung fields, specifically in right posterior lungs, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use.
No m/r/g auscultated, although difficult to hear due to diffuse wheezing.
No thrills, lifts.
ABDOMEN - NABS, slightly distended with large kidneys palpable bilaterally, liver palpable in center of the abdomen as likely shifted due to kidney size, no rebound/guarding.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Lower legs both newly wrapped by home nurse due to stasis ulcers, not unwrapped at this time.
LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-16**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, gait not assessed PULSES:  Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ (DP and PT not assessed due to wrapping, will do in am before procedure)  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs ([**2169-8-9**]): WBC-7.1 HGB-11.3* HCT-35.6* PLT-207 GLUCOSE-88 UREA N-24* CREAT-4.3* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-18 CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-3.2 MAGNESIUM-1.7 CK-MB-7, cTropnT-0.27*, CK(CPK)-103 PT-13.2 PTT-39.1* INR(PT)-1.1  CXR ([**2169-8-11**]): Compared with [**2169-8-10**], a single lead right-sided pacemaker is in place, with lead tip over right ventricle.
No pneumothorax identified.
Pleural effusion again noted.
Right upper zone calcified granuloma again noted.
ECG ([**2169-8-9**]): Sinus rhythm with 2nd degree AV block with 2:1 conduction and occasional ectopic beats.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname 1975**] [**Known lastname 5512**] is a 74 yo [**Known lastname 595**]-speaking male with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and mild CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement.
# Bradycardia - Patient presented with bradycardia consistent with 2nd degree AV block.
He ended up having it placed via axillary access on the right side, with some bleeding during the procedure.
He had one episode of chest pain after an attempt at pacemaker insertion that was associated with no ECG changes and no elevation in cardiac enzymes.
This pain was not thought to be cardiac-related.
# Hypertension - Patient with persistent hypertension while in the CCU.
# CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius)who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
It was felt that his bradycardia was unlikely to be related to current ischemia, and patient's ECG was not suggestive of ischemia or infarct.
# Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function, with LVEF = 55% and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
It was felt that his pump would benefit most from optimal blood pressure control.
# Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed MWF while in house, and has follow-up with dialysis clinic.
# Peripheral [**Date Range **] Disease - patient with significant peripheral [**Date Range 1106**] disease and recently seen by [**Date Range 1106**] here at [**Hospital1 18**].
Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with wheezing at baseline.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 1952**], [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Second degree heart block  Secondary diagnoses: End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialyis COPD/Asthma Coronary Artery Disease Hypertension Dyslipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to a slow heart rate (bradycardia).
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5102**] if you notice any increasing swelling, bruising, bleeding or increasing pain at the pacer site.
Also call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5102**] for fevers, chills, dizziness, chest pain or trouble breathing.
