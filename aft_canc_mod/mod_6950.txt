The patient reports progressively worsening difficulty breathing for the past couple weeks.
She does not recall bladder or bowel incontinence or tongue/lip biting.
The patient went to [**Hospital3 **] and had CT showing e/o SAH with possible brain mets and edema, as well as pericardial effusion, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient was given decadron 10 mg IV, and a bedside ECHO was done showing large pericardial effusion with RV wall bowing and the patient was taken to the cath lab for pericardial drain placement.
Post Echo with small posterior collection, much improved from prior.
Large left pleural effusion still present.
Currently, she is reporting some pain at the drain site as well as irritation in her neck from the C-Spine collar but no pain in the neck itself.
She still c/o SOB but denies cough, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, urinary or bowel symptoms.
Of note she has recently started desatinib for CML recurrence.

Reactive mesothelial cells, macrophages and mature   lymphocytes.
Given presence of abnormal FLAIR signal along the sulci, meningo-encephalitis is also a consideration.
[**10-31**] pre-MRI orbits: ORBITAL RADIOGRAPHS, TWO VIEWS: There is no evidence of retained metallic foreign body in either orbit.
The included portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly clear.
Deeper levels revealed more evaluable marrow spaces, with sparse erythroid colonies, and absent megakaryocytes.
While a sampling issue cannot be ruled out, the constellation of findings is suggestive of bone marrow suppression, concomitant to therapy or infectious etiologies.
Red blood cells are hypochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including dacrocytes, elliptocytes and rare schistocytes seen.
The white cells consist predominantly of dysplastic neutrophils including hypogranular and pseudo-Pelger forms, occasional hyperlobated forms are also seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The core biopsy material is inadequate for evaluation   It consists of a 0.6 cm core biopsy of periosteum, trabecular marrow with a cellularity of <5%.
The bone marrow consists almost exclusively of adipose tissue and stroma cells.
Rare clusters of erythroid cells are seen.
Clinical:   62 y/o female with history of CML, most recently on dasatimib now with persistent pancytopenia.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-10-24**], the left ventricle is now frankly hyperdynamic (including the apex), but the right ventricle now appears severely hypokinetic.
A small/moderate pericardial effusion is now present.

CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2159-10-30**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate       when immunity is compromised.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2147**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.

INTERPRETATION:  NO ANTIBODY DETECTED.
The FDA is advising that the result from any one toxoplasma IgM       commercial test kit should not be used as the sole determinant of       recent toxoplasma infection when screening a pregnant patient.

At outside hospital she was found to have brain lesions concerning for bleed or possible brain metastases as well as pericardial effusion.
During her stay she required ICU level care for acute systolic heart failure, bilateral pleural effusions and septicemia, and required a period of intubation for respiratory failure.
Re-imaging of brain lesions via MRI reveals findings consistent with PRES vs. evolving infarcts.
Pericardial Effusion: Following a fall at home, patient was found to have pericardial effusion at OSH.
Bedside ECHO in the ED showed evidence of RV wall bowing and pericardiocentesis was done, draining 700 cc of straw colored fluid.
Follow-up TTE revealed LVEF 75% demonstating frank hyperkinesis and severe right ventricle free wall hypokinesis.
Stress induced cardiomyopathy with Acute Systolic Heart Failure:  Unclear what patient's heart failure history is, but Lasix 20mg PO is home medication.
Apical akinesis was seen on Echo with depressed EF of 25-30% and takasubos distribution.
The patient also developed resiratory distress early on in the admission, with hypoxic failure and was intubated.
This was thought to be due, in part, to volume overload as per CXR.
Once intubated, the patient became hypotensive, likely from fent/versed and an IJ and a-line were placed.
Once her pressures were stablized, diuresis was continued; creat was closely trended, as patient was found to have creat bump.
She had normal hemodynamics following and repeat echo showed hyperdynamic LVEF of 75% and severe right ventricular wall hypokinesis on discharge.
The acute heart failure was likely due to sepsis and resolved with completion of IV antibiotics.
Respiratory status/bilateral pleural effusions: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema from acute heart failure and was intubated for about a week.
She was also found to have b/l pleural effusions on CXR.
This was thought to be contributing to her respiratory difficulties.
The patient had a R thoracentesis done, taking out ~ 700 cc of straw colored fluid.
Strep pneumo bacteremia/infection:  The patient spiked a temperature after the R thoracentesis, was found to have Strep pneumo growing out of her blood and sputum.
Was also found to have Staph aurues, Strep pneumo, and H. flu growing out of sputum.
When afebrile for several days, patient was placed ceftiraxone and patient remained afebrile through completion of an 14-day course of cefepime then ceftriaxone.
Bone Marrow suppression:  The patient has been thrombocytopenic since admission, and because of her recent head bleed/fall, her platelet goal was kept >50 during ICU stay and she required mulitple platelet transfusions.
Bone marrow biopsy showed bone marrow suppression from drug effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitor vs. infection with no evidence of active CML.
SAH/Brain lesions with edema:  The read on patient's OSH CT head showed that there were possible metastatic brain lesions, as well as SAH s/p fall.
CML is unlikely to met to the brain, however, another primary cancer should be considered, including breast or colon cancer.
EEG was negative, with no electrographic evidence of seizure seen.
Brain MRI showed findings consistant either with evolving infarct or PRES involving the parieto-occipital region.
Patient has vision deficits related to the lesion in this area.
Ophthalmology saw the patient and agrees that she has likely cortical blindness.
C diff colitis: Upon transfer to the floor, patient developed profuse watery diarrhea.
Marrow suppression is likely from drug effect from dasatinib vs. infection as read in a bone marrow biopsy in-house.
This biopsy showed no increased blasts or other marrow invasion.
CHRONIC CARE .
2. senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Artificial Tears     Drops Sig: 1-2 drops Ophthalmic as needed as needed for dry eyes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pericardial effusion from adverse drug reaction Secondary: Strep pneumo septicemia, C. diff colitis, PRES syndrome, bilateral pleural effusions, CML, pancytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You also developed fluid around the lungs which was also drained.
There are lesions that we imaged in the brain that are contributing to your memory problems and your vision loss.
We believe there may be some degree of reversibility of these lesions.
Other problems that were treated were sepsis, and C. diff colitis.
You will need to continue treatment for the colitis as an outpatient.
