No N/V, +1 episode of nonbloody stools today.
In the ED, he had a RUQ U/S that showed concern for cholangitis.
Patient became hypotensiove requiring pressors.
Smear was reviewed by heme-path and it was concerning for clostridium perfringens and started on broad Vanc, [**Last Name (un) **], [**Doctor Last Name **] & Clinda.
Physical Exam: GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
2+DTR's-patellar and biceps   Pertinent Results: OSH Imaging: CT abd/pelvis [**11-24**]: Prominent CBD (11 mm) and pancreatic duct (7 mm) with probable 7 mm distal CBD stone at level of pancreatic head.
duct, consideration should be given to distal obstruction (stone, stenosis/stricture, pancreatic head mass).
No evidence of free air, SBO or pneumotosis.
No intra-abdominal abscess of fluid collection.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Gallstones as seen on US.
CXR [**11-24**]: There is no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The lungs are clear and pleural surfaces are smooth with no effusion or pneumothorax.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Prominent common bile duct, however, it can be traced in nearly its entirety with no evidence of CBD stones.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct; however, the CBD can be traced quite distally to the region of the pancreatic head, with no evidence of CBD calculus.
Dilatation of the CBD and pancreatic duct, raising the possibility of distal obstruction at the ampullary level due to stone, stricture/stenosis, ampullary or pancreatic head mass.
Evaluation for mass is significantly limited due to lack of IV contrast.
There is a 7 mm hypoattenuating structure within the distal CBD, proximal to the ampulla, which is likely a stone.
Given the patient's clinical scenario of RUQ pain, marked leukocytosis and sepsis, cholangitis is a consideration and ERCP should be considered.
Extensive vascular calcification throughout the aorta.
No evidence of free air, pneumatosis, or bowel pathology.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
There is also a suggestion of abnormal rounded soft tissue in the region of the ampulla (2:38; 301b:29), protruding into the 2nd portion of the duodenum.
While this could represent edema surrounding an impacted calculus (given the other calculi), an ampullary carcinoma is a distinct consideration and an additional reason for ERCP with brushings/biopsy, if feasible.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Pathology Reports: AMPULLARY BIOPSY [**2189-11-25**] DIAGNOSIS: Ampullary body biopsy: Fragments of adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
Adjacent duodenal mucosa with chronic active enteritis and focal ulceration.
Brief Hospital Course: # Septic [**Name (NI) 21020**] Pt was found to have an ampullary mass and stricture leading to cholangitis thought due to clostridium perfringens.
Once his blood grew out gram negative and gram positive rods, the antibiotics were tappered to meropenem, cipro and vanc with renal dosing.
He subsequently was treated for a 14d course of cipro and meropenem to treat c. perfringens and GNR per d/w ID.
He intermittently had hypotensive episodes and intermittent fevers requiring volume resuscitation in the MICU.
Ultimately, given that he was afebrile and there were no positive culture data, all antibiotics were stopped.
# Respiratory Failure Pt was intubated in setting of severe sepsis.
He had no known previous lung disease.
Pt was slow to wake up given sedation on board in setting of renal and liver failure.
He then developed ARDS with increased dead space.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Calculated dead space was 76% with increased esophageal balloon pressure of [**1-18**].
He was initially treated with anticoagulation for possible PE and started on CVVHD to take fluid off.
# Thrombocytopenia: He developed low platelets in setting of his infection.
# MS: His mental status while intubated was intially poor, and it was difficult to arouse.
This was felt to be secondary to sedation (he was on fentanyl, propofol, midazolam, ativan, and haldol during his ICU course); however, when he did not wake up after sedation weaned, neurology was consulted for further evaluation.
# ARF: His ARF was likely due to ATN in setting of septic [**Hospital1 **] and profound hypotension.
He did not respond to furosemide bolus and was started on HD by renal consult.
As above, he required CVVH for fluid removal for pulmonary edema.
The nephrology team expect recovery of his kidney function.
# Metabolic Acidosis: He initially had lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis, which resolved.
# Ampullary Mass:  Patient had an ERCP and was found to have a large ampullary mass with pathology c/w adenoma.
# HTN:  Patient had elevated BP on the medical floor.
ACEI/ARBs were advoided due to his renal function.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1) Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Normandy Senior Care Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses Cholangitis Ampullary intestinal adenoma Acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis Acute respiratory distress syndrome .
Secondary diagnoses: Hypertension Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Alcohol abuse   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable, abdominal pain resolved, tolerating PO diet.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for abdominal pain and were found to have a mass in your intestines and an infection of your gall bladder duct.
If you notice worsening abdominal pain, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact your primary care physician or report to the emergency room.
