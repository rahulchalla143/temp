Admission Date:  [**2127-8-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-8-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-11-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nitroglycerin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 33596**] Chief Complaint: Mental status changes  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: 63 yo metastatic carcinoid, HTN, hyperlipidemia, s/p recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] (d/cd [**8-21**]) who presents with altered mental status.
Pt had a RLL PNA with b/l effusions (transudative on tap) and CHF.
He was found to have a decreased EF to 35-40%, and P-MIBI showed moderate reversible defects in the apex and septum.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2127-8-15**] showed mild coronary artery disease (prox RCA 40%, mid-LAD 50%, 20% stenosis at D2), elevated RV and LV filling pressures, severely depressed EF, moderate pulm HTN, mild aortic stenosis (mean gradient 10) with a restrictive defect.
Course was complicated by ARF secondary to overdiuresis as well as contrast nephropathy, and shock liver.
He developed some altered mental status and confusion on [**2127-8-22**].
Today, pt desatted to 80% at rehab, "was blue in the face",  and had altered mental status.
Head CT report showed central and peripheral atrophy, though no mass or hemorrhage.
Metastatic carcinoid tumor, Dx'ed [**2123**], was on a study drug for a year and a half (ended about a year ago) and was on octreotide for a few months earlier this year but stopped because of diarrhea 2. hypertension 3. hyperlipidemia 4. carotid endarterectomy [**2120**] 5. depression/anxiety 6. cellulitis 4 weeks ago, given Keflex IV at [**Hospital3 **], now resolved 7.
CV: III/VI systolic murmur best LLSB Lungs: ?crackles at bases anteriorly.
b/l pleural effusions.
Hypokinesis of the septum and apex with a calculated ejection fraction of 42%.
Transient ischemic dilatation of the left ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW: 63 yo male with metastatic carcinoid, HTN, DM, CHF, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after prolonged course [**1-29**] pneumonia, admitted to the ICU with MS changes, now with improving mental status but continued edema and s/s heart failure R>L thought to be from carcinoid heart.
Mental Status change - The differential diagnosis of etiology of encephalopathic state was thought to include serotonin syndrome, underlying pneumonia and bacteremia and acute renal failure (consistent with asterixis).
The patient remained afebrile and cultures thereafter remained negative.
Whereas he had some paranoia regarding CIA agents on admission to the ICU and in the day prior, these delusions resolved on transfer to the floor.
He had received a total of 5L of fluid in the ICU to support pressure working under the assumption that the patient was intravascularly dry but total volume overloaded.
Severe TR and elevated R-sided pressures were thought to be from carcinoid heart.
His lungs remained somewhat dull to ausc/percussion, but he exhibited no crackles.
Based on his large JVD and edema and these lung findings, it was thought that he continued to have the R heart failure physiology seen on echo at this hospitalization and on cath at the past hospitalization.
On the floor, he was anxious initially and received ativan PRN initially.
Shortly after arriving on the floor, his breathing took on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pattern and it was felt that he was volume overloaded both intra and extra-vascularly.
He was diuresed with IV lasix at increasing doses with poor response.
The pt was put on telemetry to monitor cardiac rhythm given extensive heart failure.
CT angio ruled out PE and LENI's ruled out LE DVT.
It was thought to be elevated due to poor forward flow in the setting of low EF.
However, the pt also received a PE protocol chest CT, which may have further stressed the renal function.
FeNA was measured to be low consistent with a prerenal picture from vol depletion or poor forward flow, and pointed away from ATN.
After arriving on the floor, small amounts of lasix were given for diuresis with poor response.
There was a second peak in the creatinine as diuresis was increased and hydral/nitrates were added to the regimen.
Respiratory [**Name (NI) 97891**] Pt had a respiratory alkalosis on admission.
Likely [**1-29**] psychosis and fever.
There was also a gap acidosis in setting of elevated lactate, which resolved prior to his arrival on the floor.
In the ICU, both were held for tachycardia of unknown etiology and proposed intravascular volume depletion, respectively.
Lasix was used to diurese and likely had little effect on BP.
Psychiatry- The patient has a history of depression and anxiety.
Pt had been on medication long-term, however, he may have had increased serotonin in system if carcinoid has progressed.
Pt was also having continued paranoid ideations.
However, was much improved and became cooperative and less anxious appearing.
Carcinoid cancer- The patient had known metastasis to the liver with evidence of carcinoid heart on catheterization.
The patient died after unsuccessful resuscitation for ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation.
