POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Small bowel and pelvic adhesions with acute angulation.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, intraoperative enteroscopy of the entire small bowel through jejunal enterotomy and small bowel resection x1.
Peritoneal fibrous adhesions with focal foreign body reaction.
There is a transmural tear without hemorrhage or inflammation which is probably post-surgical.
COMPARISON: No prior studies are available for comparison.
No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Enterocutaneous fistula with wound abscess due to suture erosion.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, abdominal wash-out and wound closure.
New enterocutaneous fistula, most likely arising from the small bowel anastomosis.
Bibasilar pulmonary opacities probably representing a combination of atelectasis, aspiration, and pneumonia, grossly unchanged since [**2116-12-23**].
New small bilateral pleural effusions.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2116-12-28**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 69005**] had no intra-operative complications, post-operatively he was NPO with a Dilaudid PCA, a subcutaneous pain pump, intravenous hydration, telemetry monitoring, foley catheter, and nasogastric tube.
He experienced confusion and agitation post-operatively which was treated with restraints and Haldol, an EKG was negative for ischemia, he was afebrile, and hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 29.8, the confusion had resolved by POD 1.
On POD 2 he had hypovolemia with decreased urine output which responded well to intravenous bolussing.
On POD 2 he had intermittent confusion with desaturation which improved on nasal cannula; chest x-ray and chest CT scan were negative for an embolus, he had a small right pleural effusion without evidence of aspiration.
On POD 4 he had +flatus and a bowel movement, his diet was advanced which he tolerated well, he had improvement in his mental status with orientation to person, time, and place.
On POD 8, he had an episode of emesis with desaturation, was transferred to the ICU for furher management of aspiration pneumonia confirmed by CT and X-ray, broad spectrum antibiotics were started, he was maintained on oxygen therapy, a nasogastric tube was placed, and he was NPO with initiation of TPN.
His incision was noted to have bilious drainage, he was taken back to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, abdominal wash-out and wound closure, with findings of an enterocutaneous fistula with wound abscess due to suture erosion.
The skin was not closed, and the wound was packed with gauze.
The following day, he became hypertensive with SBP up to 200, ekg showed inverted T waves, and cardiac enzymes were cycled which were negative for myocardial infarction.
He had a swallow evaluation which showed aspiration of thin liquids.
Tube feeds were started via a Dobhoff tube, but was stopped because the patient had increased drainage from his wound.
On [**2117-1-1**], a CT scan was obtained for leukocytosis and abnormal drainage from the abdominal wound, which revealed an enterocutaneous fistula, most likely arising from the small bowel anastomosis.
There was also extraluminal contrast with a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid.
The patient developed hypernatremia and a Renal consult was obtained.
It was determined that the patient likely was having post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis with an element of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
TPN without sodium as well as D5W were infused to keep his sodium level less than 147.
The patient continued to have poor PO intake.
The patient continued to have poor PO intake despite the new diet.
On the day of discharge, the patient had cloudy urine in his foley bag and was having liquidy stools.
A UA was positive for UTI and the patient was started on a 7 day course of Cipro.
