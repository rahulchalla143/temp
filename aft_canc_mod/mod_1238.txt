Admission Date:  [**2159-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-9-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: s/p Cardiac Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line placement Intubation  History of Present Illness: 65 yo M with history of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**1-/2159**], Afib, CHF with LVEF 25-30%, and Type II DM who present s/p cardiac arrest today.
He originally presented to hospital as outpatient for planned [**Year (4 digits) **], which was cancelled due to tachycardia, relative hypotension, and inability to find oxygen sat.
Patient then left the hospital to go home and had a witnessed Vfib arrest with intubation in field and epi down ETT.
*per phone conversation with patient's wife* In last few weeks patient had been complaining to his wife that he was more short of breath with exertion.
Patient had multiple impaging procedures including negative CT head, CT abd/pelvis showing large simple ascites, CTA chest without PE but did show multiple right rib fractures and sternal fracture.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - Type II DM - CHF with an EF of 30% - CAD s/p MI - h/o atrial fibrillation on Coumadin - Chronic Renal Insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.3) - Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas s/p Whipple in [**Month (only) **]/[**2158**] with positive margins, currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (about three cycles in); most recent chemotherapy (Gemcitabine) was two weeks ago, per patient .
Past Surgical History: - sinus surgery - (L)LE bypass for nonhealing toe ulcer - ERCP with stent placement - Whipple procedure as above  Social History: Lives in [**Location 13360**] with wife.
Family History: Mother h/o Breast Ca at early age.
Physical Exam: VS: T 33 C, HR 99, BP 100/59, RR 22, O2Sat 100% VENT: AC with Vt 560, f 22, PEEP 5, FiO2 100% GEN: Intubated and sedated, appears cachectic HEENT: Scleral edema, PERRL 3->2 mm NECK: EJ IV catheter at right neck PULM: Anterior chest bruising CARD: Tachycardic, nl S1, nl S2, no M/R/G ABD: Largely obscured by placement of Artic Sun pads, though BS+, soft, no grimace with palpation EXT: Stage III ulcer on right heel, BLE with woody edema, BUE [**11-25**]+ pitting edema NEURO: Sedated, no rigidity of muscular tone .
The right bundle-branch block pattern persists with a QRS duration which has widened to 158 milliseconds.
There is poor R wave progression laterally and low voltage in all leads.
There are small Q waves in leads II, III and aVF with ST segment elevation in those leads.
Consider acute inferior myocardial infarction.
[**9-27**] CT head w/o Contrast IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No central PE or dissection.
Suboptimal evaluation of the posterior pulmonary circulation secondary to large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Focal small foci of gas in the anterior upper abdomen on the last image of non-contrast sequence.
Large amount of abdominal ascites.
Multiple right and left rib fractures and a sternal fracture.
These may be related to recent resuscitative efforts.
Ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe may be a pulmonary contusion versus infection versus aspiration.
CT abdomen Large volume ascites with no evidence of free air.. .
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**9-29**] CXR Cardiomegaly, large bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right side with associated atelectases are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with history of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**1-/2159**], Afib, CHF with LVEF 25-30%, and Type II DM who present s/p cardiac arrest today.
Vfib cardiac arrest: Most likely etiology was either new ischemia or automaticity from old scar in setting of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25-30%.
Patient's exam and history was consistent with decompensated heart failure of at least several week duration.
Less likely cause of cardiac arrest would be digoxin toxicity given patient recently started that medication and has history of renal insufficiency.
CTA chest was overall a poor study given large pleural effusions, though no apparent PE or aortic dissection.
Patient fortunately had relatively rapid defibrillation and [**Name (NI) **] during code.
He was being cooled followed by warmed on Artic Sun for neuro protection and has reached temperature goal of 33 C.  48hr EEG showed possible seizure activity consistent with ischemic injury; consult neuro to evaluate EEG Family meeting once warmed and off sedation to discuss goals of care and prognosis, and it was decided to enact comfort care measures.
#Hypotension: likely secondary to worsening heart failure in the setting of fluid overload.
N.epi and vasopressin as needed for MAP > 60; phenylephrine PRN for additional pressure support .
Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury:Most likely due to ATN in setting of arrest    Mr [**Known lastname 4017**] wife and son decided they wanted to fully withdraw care.
Placed on Morphine for comfort.
[**2159-9-30**] I examined the patient and he was not responsive to auditory or tactile stimuli.
I observed 1 minute of no breaths or respiratory effort.
The patient did not have a corneal reflex or pupilllary reaction to direct light bilaterally.
