Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Occuloplasty: Right Eye Lid approximation   History of Present Illness: 40 yo homeless [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] admitted for workup of acromegaly, found to have laboratory abnormalities consistent with tumor lysis syndrome, also with respiratory distress.
He was admitted on [**2144-7-11**] as OSH transfer for multiple concerns including bell's palsy, urinary retention, pituitary macroadenoma, acromegaly, persistent sinus tachycardia, scrotal pain and swelling, bilateral LE weakness, thecal/ epidural enhancement in thoracic region, and tumor lysis syndrome concerning for underlying malignancy.
Patient received 150cc NS/hr for rising tumor lysis labs and became progressively more dyspnic with increasing oxygen requirement.
Cardiology was consulted for persistent sinus tachycardia non-responsive to IV fluids and he was started on po metoprolol 50mg TID.
He was being treated w/ acyclovir and prednisone for question of viral-induced Bell's Palsy.
Endocrine and neurosurgery were following and work-up ongoing for pituitary macroadenoma and acromegaly.
MR of T spine was performed to evaluate LE weakness, without evidence of cord compression.
Heme/onc on the day prior to transfer attempted bone marrow biopsy but could not obtain due to respiratory distress induced with prone positioning.
UOP had been good but oxygen requirement had increased to 5L.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, in respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, frontal bossing, maxillary protrusion Neck: supple, JVP elevated, no LAD Lungs: gurgle apparent from door, diffuse b/l rales, using accessory muscles CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: exam limited [**2-17**] acute respiratory distress, + right facial droop .
Interval decrease of left lower lobe atelectasis.
Unchanged picture of severe constipation.
Sacral decubitus ulcer defect decreased in size with apparent vacuum dressing in place.
No definite evidence for sacral destructive process.
Filling defects in the left and possibly right common femoral veins.
Mild splenomegaly unchanged.
[**9-12**] U/S LE: IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus in the left common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins.
No thrombus in the right lower extremity.
There is no cauda equina compression, though evaluation for intradural disease is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Striking signal abnormality and probable atrophy within paraspinal musculature and psoas muscles which should be correlated with the patient's history.
[**8-15**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia in an atrial bigeminal pattern.
RSR' pattern in lead V1 with early transition suggests an incomplete right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-8-12**] atrial bigeminy is present.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Enlarged pituitary gland, mostly the left lobe, without evidence of hyperenhancement to suggest lymphomatous infiltration.
No other evidence of intracranial lymphoma.
Fluid in the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Large ulceration mainly containing air and no discrete fluid just superficial to the sacrum, without evidence of osteomyelitis.
No evidence of inflammatory change in the abdomen to explain constipation; large amount of stool in the rectum.
Small amount of air around the right chest port device.
New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS, and diffuse malignant infiltration.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated on [**7-12**] in the setting of LLL PNA, lactic acidosis, and significant evidence of infiltrative malignant process on CT with peribronchial thickening.
Two failed extubations on [**7-15**] and [**7-25**] secondary to copious secretions and work of breathing, respectively.
Throughout stay he maintained large tidal volumes (700-800cc) and large minute ventilations (10-15L/min).
On [**7-18**] patient had increasing evidence of infection and met criteria for ARDS, although compliance remained normal and large tidal volumes were tolerated.
Later CXRs showed a persistent infiltrate at the R base.
BAL grew mycoplasma hominis on [**7-19**] and sputum grew coag+ staph on [**7-23**].
Starting [**7-22**], patient was neutropenic and put on prophylactic fluconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone.
HIV, HBV, HCV, galactomannan, and B-glucan were negative as was evidence for acute CMV or HHV-6 infection.
Treatment with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin was also continued for mycoplasma hominis pneumonia.
On discharge, patient breathing comfortably on room air, afebrile, without sign of infeciton.
TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME: Labs at admission were significant for elevated LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved to baseline after 1 week admission after 2 doses rasburicase.
Laboratory values without evidence of tumor lysis on discharge.
BURKITT-LIKE HIGH GRADE LYMPHOMA: CT showed diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters, peribronchial.
MRI showed epidural enhancement in T-spine.
Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt/high grade lymphoma on [**7-19**].
Hyper-CVAD started on [**7-21**] and intrathecal chemo given 2x/wk alternating methotrexate and cytarabine for + malignant cells on LP.
Future imaging should include gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the head to pursue possible radiation (pt's original complaints of CN V and VII palsies possibly related to lymphoma vs acromegaly).
Patient developed lower extremity weakness and severe polyneuropathy (followed by neurology), either from oncovorin therapy or presumed leptomeningeal disease.
Patient received his last treatment with HD methotrexate on [**11-6**] and is day 7 at discharge with evidence of his counts approaching nadir.
He will be continued on leucovorin for 2 more days given that he had significant mucositis in the past from MTX.
Precipitous drop in WBC and platelets on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout most of admission.
This was felt to be initially secondary to his lymphoma and then later his chemotherapy.
TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart failure.
Repeat EKGs showed frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.
Thought to be physiologic tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
Tachycardia improved with increased comfort on ventilator, reduced sedation.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Bump in creatinine from baseline 0.6 to 1.6 early in admission, thought to be ATN secondary to tumor lysis with contributions from one episode of hypotension just after intubation and IV contrast.
ABDOMINAL DISTENTION: Developed on [**7-19**] with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Pain improved as hospital course.
ACROMEGALY: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features: large hands, feet, digits, frontal bossing, coarse facial features, large jaw, large chest.
[**Hospital1 **] was high, IGF-1 was normal although this can be depressed in acute illness.
Cultures grew coag negative staph and mycelia sterilia.
TENDER SCROTAL SWELLING: Noted on admission, scrotal US suggested epididymitis/orchitis.
No clear masses.
Exam starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly on the left.
Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and generalized edema.
?s palsy, loss of R facial sensation, urinary retention, and weakness/decreased sensation of lower extremities.
MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
Initial concern was for cord compression but neurosurgery had low suspicion and MRI was not initially repeated.
Repeat MRI of pituitary needed eventually for acromegaly work-up.
It was decided that his neurological deficits and neuropathic pain likely arose from two etiologies: Infiltration of roots by disease, producing some impairments prior to admission.
Neuropathy pain improved through medications (nortriptyline and pregabalin).
JOINT PAIN: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
At discharge patient stabilized on Methadone, Dilaudid PRN Pain (ie when working with PT, Sacral Decubitus dressing change).
Patient ambulated with assistance up to 10 feet, with pain controlled.
