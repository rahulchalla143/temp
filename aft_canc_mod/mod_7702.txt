[**Last Name (STitle) 13670**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**2112-12-19**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 90989**] is a 70yoM recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2112-11-11**] to [**2112-11-23**] for bilateral subdural hematoma s/p cranio who now presents from OSH after a complicated course for CVA, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure.
He was previously very healthy until his presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 359**] when he was found to have bilateral SDH after a mechanical fall.
He had bilateral craniotomy on [**11-13**] and initially did well post-operatively, but then became hypoxic, tachycardic, febrile, tachypneic, and hypertensive with b/l pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.
Of note, a CXR prior to discharge to evaluate interval changes was formally read as possible infiltrate vs septic emboli.
Given he was afebrile and had no supplemental O2 requirement by time of discharge, this finding was felt to be inconsistent with his clinical picture and he was discharged with plans to repeat CXR as outpatient for f/u.
Two days after discharge, he developed SOB and fatigue.
He presented to OSH ED where he was febrile and had CXR with bilateral interstitial infiltrates.
He was admitted for treatment of pneumonia and treated with Vanc/Zosyn/Azithromycin.
Sputum cultures had no growth.
He was also noted to have new dysphagia and he was made NPO and started on TPN.
CXR showed b/l intersitial vs intra-alveolar infiltrates.
He also had periods of significant hypertension with SBP > 200.
He became progressively SOB and was started on BiPap but then developed respiratory arrest.
By [**12-11**] he continued to be unresponsive and spike fevers.
He had a CT head/chest/abdomen/pelvis, and head CT showed left cerebellar nonhemomrrhagic stroke, with ?brainstem involvement.
He also developed acute renal failure with creat increasing from 1.6 to 4.1 on [**2112-12-8**].
His Na level also increased with dilute urine, suggesting diabetes insipidus.
He was also noted to have mildly elevated serum ammonia of unknown etiology and was treated with lactulose.

Past Medical History: - Bilateral subdural hematomas with midline shift, admitted to NSurg for bilateral mini-craniotomies and burr holes in [**11/2112**];  course complicated by hypoxia (thought to be aspiration + flash edema), difficult to control supraventricular tachycardia (started on Amiodarone, Labetalol, and Metoprolol), severe hypertension, and thrombocytosis - Essential thrombocytosis on Anagrelide for past 20 yrs and Aspirin, per family he failed Hydroxyurea.
Denies episodes of hemorrhage in the past - HTN - HLD - Bilateral cataract ops - Fractured left 3 ribs c/b pneumthroax following fall 3 years ago   Social History: Prior to the events described in HPI, pt lived with wife, worked for restaurant (>60 hours/week per family).
2 glasses of wine per night, no illicits.
Gen: Intubated, awake but not interactive HEENT: PERRL, MMM, no oropharyngeal lesions Cardiac: Irregular, no m/r/g Lungs: Rhonchi in upper lobes bilat, lower lungs with decreased breath sounds Abdomen: soft, NTND NABS no hepatomegaly Extremities: WWP, no c/c/e Neuro: Awake but not interactive, does not track or follow commands.
Does not withdraw to noxious stimuli.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2112-12-17**]):    NO GROWTH.
No pneumothorax.
Pleural effusion is small on the right if any.
Lung volumes are quite low and lungs are generally opacified and in a heterogeneous fashion, more so inferiorly.
Process is either diffuse pneumonia or pulmonary edema, even though heart is normal in size.
TTE [**2112-12-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-11-16**], no change.
FINDINGS: An infarct is visualized in the left cerebellum with a small hyperintensity in the right cerebellum indicative of bilateral cerebellar infarcts.
There infarcts are slightly hyperintense on diffusion images and ADC map indicative of subacute to early chronic infarcts.
A small area of diffusion abnormality in the anterior right pons also does not have corresponding ADC abnormality and could be due to a subacute infarct.
There is a small area of restricted diffusion seen in the frontal lobe which appears to have corresponding low signal intensity on ADC map indicative of an acute infarct.
A small left-sided subdural hematoma is identified which measures approximately 3 mm without mass effect.
A craniectomy defect in the right frontal region is also identified.
IMPRESSION: Subacute infarcts in the cerebellum and pons.
A small subcortical infarct in the right frontal lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o previously healthy male until recent complicated medical course with SDH s/p cranio, transferred from OSH for new cerebellar CVA, [**Last Name (un) **], respiratory failure and altered mental status/encephalopathy.
# AMS: Pt's mental status waxed/waned but overall improved gradually during hospitalization.
He was evaluated by the neurology service, who felt that his mental status was unlikely to be due to his recent CVAs, and more likely encephalopathy due to multiple medical problems.
# CVA: OSH records noted cerebellar infarcts detected on non-contrast head CT.  MRI of the brain showed subacute small infarcts in the cerebellum and pons.
Per the neurology team, these infarcts were likely cardioembolic given their size and location and pt's known atrial fibrillation.
# Respiratory failure: On transfer from OSH pt was intubated on CMV.
He was extubated, however over several hours he had difficulty clearing airway secretions and developed a respiratory alkalosis and his mental status worsened, requiring re-intubation.
He had tracheostomy placed on HD#5, although the neurology team felt that this respiratory failure was more related to his mental status and pneumonia than to his CVAs and was hopeful that as his toxic/metabolic encephalopathy improves he may ultimately be able to have the trach removed.
Blood and urine cx showed no growth.
CXR showed diffuse pneumonia vs pulmonary edema.
Given he had been intubated for several days prior to transfer, he was treated empirically for ventilator associated pneumonia with IV vancomycin/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.
Sputum cx grew fungus and rare GNRs, and his antiobiotics were narrowed to IV cefepime.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Per OSH records, pt's creatinine had increased from 1.0 to 4.0 following episode of respiratory arrest.
He was evaluated by the renal service who felt his renal failure was likely due to ATN given his bland urine sediment.
# Afib: Patient was in atrial fibrillation on admission, and had occasional episodes of bradycardia (HR to 30s) as well as episodes of atrial tachycardia with HR 150s.
Initially presented with high serum Na with low urine osm suggest diabetes inspidius, likely central DI given SDH, CVA and improved with DDAVP.
# Anemia ??????
Hemolysis labs reassuring.
# Essential thrombocytosis: Plt count rising on home anegrilide, dose increased yesterday.
Speech and Swallow held off on swallow eval and passey muir valve placement until MS improves and secretions decreased.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Developed at OSH.
# Rehabilitation:  Will likely require PT/OT at discharge facility.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke Respiratory failure Acute kidney injury Hypernatremia Essential thrombocytosis Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital because you had a stroke, and for management of several medical problems including kidney failure, fevers, and high sodium levels.
Based on your MRI, you had several small strokes, likely due to your atrial fibrillation.
We started aspirin and coumadin, which you should continue indefinitely to prevent future strokes.
Your kidney failure was likely due to the episode of respiratory arrrest you experienced at Addison-[**Doctor Last Name **].
We spoke with your outpatient hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45462**], who recommended that you have your platelet count checked at your rehab facility and faxed to her office.
Please note the following changes to your medications: -START coumadin 5mg daily, and have your coumadin levels monitored by your rehab facility -START diltiazem 30 mg four times a day for improved heart rate control.
