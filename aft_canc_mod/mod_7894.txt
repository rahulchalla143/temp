Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion.
There is interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, as well as in perihilar and bibasilar air space opacity compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient presented with evidence of marked volume overload with elevated JVP, anasarca, and elevation of LFTs concerning for RV overload and CXR indicating pulmonary edema and enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Given known EF of 20%, likely cause of respiratory failure was pulmonary edema.
# Hypotension:  Appeared to be in cardiogenic shock as extremities cool and cyanotic.
