The patient had no immediate postoperative transplant complications there, but prior to admission here, the patient had been diagnosed with PTLD (post- transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
The patient is currently off Immuno-suppressant medications except for Prednisone.
Following the cessation of immunosuppressant medications, the patient developed acute rejection.
The patient's initial fever associated with the rejection subsided when she received treatments for the acute rejection with Solu- Medrol 500 times four and then her baseline Prednisone dose increased to 20 mg per day from 10 mg.
Just prior to admission, the patient developed abdominal pain which was predominantly in the lower back and described as continuous pain in the moderate to severe range.
The patient also had some nausea but denied urinary symptoms or diarrhea.
The patient also complained of chills and rigor.
Bipolar disorder.
End-stage renal disease secondary to Lithium toxicity.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband and denies the use of alcohol, tobacco or intravenous drug abuse.
Abdomen: Initially there was tenderness localized over the kidney allograft .
Central nervous system: No neurological deficits.
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia.
On [**12-9**], Psychiatry was consulted due to the patient's depressed mood and history of psychiatric disorders.
On [**12-12**], the patient continued to have pancytopenia with a white cell count of 1.2 and a hematocrit of 21.
The patient also continued to show some signs and symptoms of acute rejection of the graft and on the [**12-12**], the patient had a BUN of 11 and a creatinine of 1.6.
The patient's signs and symptoms were consistent with acute renal failure secondary to rejection.
On [**12-20**], it was concluded that the patient was in acute rejection with renal failure.
On [**12-25**]; however, the patient suffered severe acute abdominal pain with generalized tenderness and the patient was brought to the Operating Room.
The patient had an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the mid-jejunum with primary anastomosis and an allograft nephrectomy.
The wound was also left open and packed due to the bowel perforation.
Discussion was then had with the family of the high likelihood for serious complications including infection prolonged hospitalization and even death.
On [**12-28**], the patient showed signs of peritonitis and sepsis.
The patient was brought back to the Operating Room with the initial diagnosis of perforated small bowel and exploratory laparotomy procedure was performed with primary repair of the small bowel perforation.
The previous repair of the intestine was completely intact and a new 1 cm small bowel perforation distal to the previous anastomosis was noted.
There was an abundant enteric content in the abdomen and the small bowel perforation was repaired.
The patient continued with low platelets and increased INR.
The wound continued to heal by secondary intention with regular dressing changes.
Throughout until the end of the time, the patient continued to spike fevers intermittently for which she continued to have multiple cultures and scans.
The patient also continued to remain with pancytopenia which was followed by Hematology/Oncology regarding her diagnosis of lymphoma and the patient continued on hemodialysis.
The wound continued to granulate and during that time, did not show signs of infection.
During the hospitalization, the patient did have a wound culture which was positive for VRE and also urinary cultures which were positive for VRE which were treated with the appropriate antibiotics.
The patient also had a catheter infection of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus which was treated with Vancomycin for 14 days.
In the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], the patient had a repeat CMV PCR and [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Location (un) **] virus PCR to evaluate for possible viral infections.
The patient, in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], had a CT scan which showed marked improvement of abscesses in the abdomen.
On the 5th the patient continued to spike and at that point had a full work-up for febrile origins in anticipation of discharging the patient to Rehabilitation Services.
The patient's wound was healing nicely with granulation tissue and no signs of frank pus.
An ultrasound was performed of the Porta-Cath which showed no abnormalities or fluid collections.
On [**1-26**], it was decided through the Transplant Service with the Renal, Hematology/Oncology and Infectious Disease Services that most likely the cause of the intermittent temperature spikes were due to resolving lymphoproliferative disorder.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Included a temperature maximum of 100.1 F., temperature current of 97.2 F.; pulse of 88; blood pressure 110/70; respiratory rate 20; O2 94%, p.o.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, incision healing with secondary intention; good granulation tissue and no signs of infection.
Extremities:  No peripheral edema with mild swelling.
Bowel resection for perforation secondary to     lymphoproliferative disorder.
Bipolar disorder.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
The patient's wound should be changed three times a day     with wet-to-dry's.
