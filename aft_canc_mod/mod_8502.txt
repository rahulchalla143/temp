Admission Date:  [**2193-12-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-12-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-6-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid Bronchoscopy with tumor ablation and bleeding coagulation.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58 female with a h/o met breast CA to lung (RUL), retroperitoneum, and right ureter s/p stent with recurrent episodes of hemoptysis x 1 week who presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital.
She was transferred from [**Hospital **]for further assessment of her hemoptysis.
Past Medical History: R breast CA dx [**2175**] s/p mesectomy L breast CA dx [**2190**] s/p lumpectomy + chemo Ovarian CA dx [**2191**] s/p TAH+BSO + chemo Osteoporosis Asthma   Social History: Lives with her husband and has a son and daughter.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2193-12-3**] 5:05 PM REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o ptx and pneumomediatinum INDICATION: Status post rigid bronchoscopy for tumor destruction - tumor ablation.
Evaluate for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
There are extensive central pulmonary infiltrates on the right side, a lesser degree also in the central portion of the left lung.
In addition, multiple round densities are disseminated in both lungs and suggest the possibility of secondary metastatic deposits.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum on this single AP view chest examination.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2193-12-3**] 12:36 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 58 year old woman with questionable RUL mass with h/o hemoptysis  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval RUL mass INDICATION: Hemoptysis.
Questionable right upper lobe mass.
No prior chest radiographs or chest CT scans are available for comparison.
Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are present involving all lobes of both lungs.
Though most of the lesions measure less than 3 cm in diameter, a dominant mass in the lateral segment right middle lobe measures 3.1 cm x 2.4 cm (image 139, series 102).
In addition to the multiple nodules and mass, there are multilobar areas of ground-glass attenuation within the lungs as well as geographically marginated areas of consolidation in the perihilar and paramediastinal portions of the lungs, worse on the right than the left.
Additional findings include smooth septal thickening with diffuse distribution but most pronounced in the lower lobes and lung apices, right greater than left.
Thickening is present along the walls of the central airways, particularly the bronchus intermedius and right upper lobe bronchi posteriorly.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is present.
Additionally, there are several prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes measuring less than 1 cm in greatest short axis dimension, which do not meet strict criteria for enlargement.
A small pericardial effusion is present.
Small right pleural effusion is present as well.
Adrenal glands are stable in appearance compared to the prior CT abdomen study with no evidence of suspicious lesions to suggest adrenal metastases.
Skeletal structures demonstrate several healed right rib fractures with marked callus formation.
Healing or healed lower left rib fractures are also noted.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with spiculated and lobulated margins.
Dominant 3.1 cm mass in right middle lobe with similar morphology to other lesions.
In a patient with history of breast cancer, this may be due to widespread metastatic disease.
Primary lung cancer with metastatic lesions and diffuse fungal infection are considered less likely.
Extensive areas of consolidation with geographic margins in the perihilar and paramediastinal portions of both lungs.
Some of these traverse the fissure and could potentially reflect radiation pneumonitis, but coexisting infection, hemorrhage, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is also possible.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities and septal thickening.
Differential diagnosis includes interstitial pulmonary edema, drug toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Small pericardial effusion.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and borderline right paratracheal lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 female with a h/o met breast CA to lung (RUL), retroperitoneum, and right ureter s/p stent with recurrent episodes of hemoptysis x 1 week who presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital.
She was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] [**Name (STitle) 1092**] Surgery Service at the [**Hospital1 1170**] from [**Hospital3 7571**]for further assessment of her hemoptysis on [**2193-12-2**].
She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy on HD 2 ([**2193-12-3**]) which demonstrated friable mucosa and RUL and RLL bleeding which was coagulated.
On POD 1, she was afebrile and stable.
She has had no episodes of hemoptysis since admission to the [**Hospital1 827**].
She continued to tolerate a regular diet and has intermittently had coughing episodes for which she has been given codeine for.
Codeine Phosphate 30 mg Tablet, Soluble Sig: One (1) Tablet, Soluble PO every six (6) hours as needed for cough.
