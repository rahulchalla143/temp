Admission Date:  [**2177-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-8-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Tetanus Toxoid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatic mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pylorus sparing Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure)   History of Present Illness: This 73-year-old woman has multiple medical problems including polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takes steroids.
She has recently had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis seven months ago and suffered a postoperative pulmonary embolism from this.
She comes for treatment of an incidentally found cystic lesion of the head of the pancreas consistent with IPMT.
Past Medical History: Pulmonary embolus Pancreatic Mass Diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection hypertension Hypercholesterolemia polymyalgia rheumatica osteoparthirtis back pain/radiculopathy s/p left breats biopsy C-section x2 Cholecystectomy  Social History: The patient lives alone, in an a bulding with elevators.
Patient had a homemaker who assists with shopping and laundry  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: General: No apparent distress Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended.
O Extremities: no clubbing cyanosis or edema Neuro: alert and oriented.
On discharge the patient had a well healing abdominal wound that was clean dry and intact.
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, with low grade dysplasia.
Foci of heterotopic stomach and pancreas, in the proximal part of the  duodenal segment.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient had an uneventful operative procedure, with approximate blood loss of 500cc and the patient received 8400 cc of crystalloid resuscitaiton and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
Post operatively the patien was comfortable with an epidural in place for pain control, and the patient had adequate urine output.
She recieved stress steroids and received a rapid taper given her history of taking chronic steroids.
ON post operative day 1 the epidural was removed and the patients pain was adequately controlled with a PCA.
She had some uncontrolled hypertension that required a nitrogycerine drip postoperatively.
Furthermore, she had a positive troponin from the night before following some epigastric pain and  chest discomfort.
A CTA of the chest ruled out a pulmonary embolism at that time.
Given these findings, we were concerned for a postoperative bleed especially given her steroid dependence.
On postoperative days [**8-9**] it was noted that the patient had evidence of blood in her Nasogastric tube.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative with this event since the patient did not "feel well".
TPN was started given her poor nutritional status and the aforementioned events.
She did have increased dark blood output from her NG tube opn this day, and given her ongoing upper GI bleed, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring on [**1-1**] (POD [**10-12**]).
She had a contined transfusion requirement.
She had a couple of episodes of self limited bowel movement positive for blood, but her hematocrit and hemodynamic monitors remained stable.
