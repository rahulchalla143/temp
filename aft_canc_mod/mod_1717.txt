The patient is unable to relate history due to cognitive impairment so the following comes from the wife and reports of others.
Apparently, the patient has been complaining to his wife of abdominal pain for approximately one week and then yesterday complained of nausea and had a large amount of hematemesis.
Today he had more hematemesis and complained of persistent nausea and pain so he was brought to the ED for further evaluation.
He had an episode of hematemesis in front of the ED staff.
GI evaluated the patient and felt very high bar for endoscopy given no signs of active bleeding and precarious respiratory status.
Review of systems is similarly unobtainable due to his inability to provide any history.

Patient was discovered to have metastatic adenocarcinoma/recurrent lung cancer with lymphangitic spread.
He has progression of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, right upper lobe and left lower lobe lung nodules, prominent periaortic lymphadenopathy.
- bedbound at baseline with history of decubitus ulcer - diverticulosis - G-tube dependent - depression - anemia of chronic disease - diabetes mellitus - history of recurrent pneumonia - right inguinal hernia repair.

His father is deceased with a question of leukemia but never diagnosed.
He has three children  Physical Exam: VS: 100.2, 118, 145/51, 22, 95% on 100% NRB GEN: Chronically ill appearing male appearing older than stated age, intermittently moaning HEENT: anicteric, MM dry appearing, op without lesions, no jvd appreciated RESP: Diffuse wet crackles bilaterally with audible gurgling from the upper airway CV: tachycardic, no obvious murmurs though difficult to appreciate due to prominent upper airway sounds.

Findings could represent underlying chronic interstitial abnormality, but superimposed infection or pulmonary edema is not excluded.
While there are no specific signs to suggest acute cholecystitis on this exam, if there is continued clinical concern, further evaluation with a hepatobiliary nuclear medicine scan can be performed.
Multiple well-circumscribed echogenic lesions within the liver, which correspond with findings on previous CT scan and are compatible with hemangiomas.
male with multiple chronic medical problems including stage IV NSCLC, cognitive impairment, chronic foley, and very poor functional status presenting with abdominal pain and likely hematemesis.
UGIB: Present with episode of hematemesis, guiac + brown stool, and abdominal pain most suggestive of UGIB.
Reportedly had esophagitis in [**10/2175**] at OSH EGD but none since then despite multiple episodes of hematemesis/ hemoptysis.
Given abdominal pain would be most concerned about ulcer or gastritis.
Esophagitis would be less likely though hard to assess given no real way to establish dysphagia.
Finally, metastatic disease could also be responsible for presentation.
For management, given malignancy and multiple comorbidities as well as fact this developed while on PPI, odds of endoscopy fixable bleeding source likely low and would need to be intubated in order for safe endoscopy.
Serial Hct stabilized with no intervention and patient was switched to protonix [**Hospital1 **] with no further evidence of hemorrhage.
Fever: Multifactorial from chronic multidrug resistent UTI and aspiration PNA in setting of hemetemesis.
Urine cx showed pseudomonas with resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefepime.
1 of 2 blood cx from the ED did grow coagulase negative staph but this was felt to be a contaminant and subsequent blood cx were negatives.
Later in hospital course, developped recurrent fever and septic like physiology with low blood pressure.
Antibiotics were switched to vancomycin/ meropenem for better coverage of pseudomonas species.
Repeat urine cx showed persistent GNR and CXR showed worsening infiltrates.
Initially, patient improved with antibiotic course; however, he continued to have copius secretions, high oxygen requirements and relative tachypnea.
Altered MS: Baseline dementia with prominent sundowning at baseline.
Likely component of delerium from hospitalization and infection.
Initially, due to concerns of severe infection and sepsis, methadone was held.
Over course of hospitalization, mental status declined and patient became nonverbal and inattentive.
With decline in mental status, worsening pulmonary status with continued copious secretions and increasing oxygen requirements; goals of care evolved to a focus on comfort measures alone.
