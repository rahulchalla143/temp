Admission Date:  [**2143-2-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-2-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: SAH/pancytopenia REASON FOR MICU ADMISSION: intubated, elevated ICP s/p drain placement   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: extraventricular drain placement central line placement arterial line placement intubation  History of Present Illness: 33 yo female with no significant [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] for MS changes, seizures, found to have large intraparenchymal hemorrhage and midline shift/impending herniation now s/p intrcranial drain placement for elevated ICP.
Five days ago, patient fell at home, and was evaluted at an OSH with head CT without any acute bleed noted.
She then presented again to an OSH, with repeat HCT due to persistent HA, but still no bleed seen.
Patient then presented today to an OSH with HA, weakness on her left, and possible seizure activity, and while at OSH found to have large intraparenchymal bleed.
She had a CT head which showed a 3 cm IPH above thalamus with extension into third ventricle, and evidence of likely impending herniation.
She was evaluted by NSGY, and had an emergent external ventricular drain placed for elevated ICP (initially 45 in ED, on repeat prior to transfer 32).
denies tobacco/etoh/drugs  Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: BP: 110/73 HR: 72 R 17 O2Sats 100% intubated; intracranial pressure 27 Gen: intubated; unresponsive to verbal stimuli HEENT: 4 mm nonreactive pupils; intubated CV: RRR Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abd: soft, normal BS Ext: no edema Neuro: no response to verbal stimuli.
MODERATE GROWTH.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, largely centered over the right thalamus, with intraventricular extension and associated hydrocephalus.
Small extra-axial hematoma overlying the left cerebral convexity, likely subdural in location.
Diffuse cerebral edema.
Effacement of the basal cisterns, suggestive of early or impending central herniation.
Small low-attenuation subdural collection overlying the left frontal lobe is not significantly changed.
Abnormal contrast enhancement within the midbrain at the inferior margin of the hematoma could represent small foci of active extravasation, though the unusual curvilinear structure, more dorsally, may represent abnormal intravascular enhancement, either in a congested and distorted normal vein, or related to an underlying vascular abnormality such as an AVM.
Persistent moderate cerebral edema with effacement of the basal cisterns, indicative of central and downward transtentorial herniation.
While the major intracranial arteries are patent, the mild irregularity of the basilar artery suggests mild vasospasm.
[**2143-2-3**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: Large right thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, and the overall volume of hemorrhage appears increased from the previous studies.
There is also moderate associated vasogenic edema.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: In addition to the persistent large amount of hemorrhage and unchanged ventricular dilatation, despite the recently-inserted ventriculostomy, there is also persistent effacement of all basal cisterns, suggestive of central uncal and downward transtentorial herniation.
There is no evidence of tonsillar herniation, either on this study or the sagittal reformations of the preceding CTA.
[**2143-2-3**] PERIPHERAL BLOOD FLOW CYTOMETRY: INTERPRETATION: Ommunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 33 yo female s/p fall presenting with HA, left sided weakness, seizure activity now with 3 cm IPH with likely herniation s/p EVD placement by NSGY with elevated ICP (45 initially), also found to have pancytopenia and DIC labs consistent with likely early DIC  # IPH/Elevated ICP: Patient was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] once noted to have 3 cm IPH on OSH head CT.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) evaluated patient in the ED, and and EVD was placed with marked elevated pressures (45 initially).
Patient was at high risk for bleed given markedly low platelets, but without this procedure, she would have continued to herniate given the bleeding.
She had a central line placed, and arterial line placed, and was closely monitored for ICP elevation as well as sodium and osmolarity.
Neurosurgery was at the bedside to evaluate the patient, and it seemed the drain was likely clotting off, most likely due to further bleeding.
She was sent for a stat repeat head CT which showed worsening of the bleeding within the ventricles.
# Pancytopenia: Patient initially presented with all depressed cell lines.
Given her poor prognosis with the intracranial hemorrhage, as above, the patient was made CMO.
