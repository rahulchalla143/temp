History of Present Illness: 69 year-old gentleman with Bladder cancer (dx in [**10-20**], s/p radical cystectomy, left nephrectomy, currently with right urostomy tube), who was scheduled to receive a nephrostomy tube placed at IR yesterday as an outpatient for worsening obstructive uropathy and renal failure, but was found to be too anemic (22) and instead was sent for an elective transfusion today at IR daycare unit.
Today, about 15 minutes into the transfusion, he felt nauseated and experienced chest discomfort , and so was referred to the ED.
Also c/o RLQ pain above urostomy site.
On exam found to have a palpable mass in that area.
EKG showed sinus brady at 55bpm with no ischemic changes with possible peaked T waves.
Labs were significant for acute on chronic renal failure (cr 5.2), hyperkalemia to 5.6, and bicarb of 14, with AG of 15.
There was no hernia or evidence of SBO.
He has not had any nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills, but has noted a decreased appetite over the past four to six weeks.
He has noted some intermittent right flank discomfort this prompted an outpatient workup where he was diagnosed with a soft tissue obstruction of his mid ureter consistent with possible ureteral mass or TCC, with his baseline creatinine 1.2 becoming elevated to 3.3 as of last week.
He has also noted a cough for the past month, which has been nonproductive and a chest x-ray last week by history was negative.
Has T4 N1 M1 disease with left humerus and pelvic mets found in [**3-23**].
Right hydro, progressive renal failure, creatinine 1.2-->3.2 in [**11-20**], CT scan [**10-21**]; 8 mm soft tissue obstruction in the mid right ureter.

Multiple foci of increased radiotracer uptake is demonstrated with the largest region at the pubic symphysis right greater than left and right inferior pubic ramus.
Increased radiotracer uptake is present in a left anterior rib, probably 5th, uncertain if post traumatic or metastatic in nature.
Increased tracer uptake also projecting over the medial right scapula and lateral upper thoracic ribs which is indeterminant.
Increased tracer activity is noted midline in the L2-L3 region concerning for metastatic involvement.
Multiple regions of increased radiotracer uptake as described above some indeterminant and others consistent with metastatic disease.
Small-bowel obstruction secondary to parastomal small-bowel herniation within the right lower quadrant.
The dilated ileal conduit has been decompressed seconary to Fioley catheter.
Sclerotic changes of the right pubic symphysis, right ischium and right ischial tuberosity concerning for metastatic disease.
Additional sclerotic densities within the spine.
CT Chest ([**2167-12-22**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of lung metastasis.
No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Given that the patient had many complex issues that were all interrelated, this discharge summary is written in a narrative form as opposed to a list form by problem.
In [**2167-3-15**], mets were found in his left humerous and left pelvis; patient then underwent chemotherapy through [**2167-6-12**] and also had radiation therapy.
Since [**7-21**], ~ once per month, the patient noticed urostomy wouldn't put out urine for an hour or so.
In [**2167-10-13**], he told his urologist about this decrease in output; his urologist then sent him for IVP and loopogram, which demonstrated an obstruction at the right mid-ureter.
At the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] as an outpatient, who recommended that given the above imaging, the patient should undergo restaging of his disease with Bone Scan and CT Chest.
He underwent a PRBC tranfusion and then developed chest pain.
He was ruled out for MI (CE negative X 3, normal EKG); however, he was noted to have creatinine of 5.2 during this event and consequently extended his stay in the ICU for management of ARF.
A CT without contrast of abdomen suggested that his ileal conduit was dilated and also contributing to a peristomal hernia (thought to be contributing to the cause of the ARF); hydronephrosis of right kidney was also noted.
Thus, his ARF was felt to be secondary to obstruction.
The same day of his nephrostomy tube placement ([**2167-12-16**]), the patient noted some vague periumbilical abdominal pain.
He also vomited and noted that he hadn't passed stool or flatus in 4 days.
A KUB and subsequent CT scan with contrast on [**2167-12-18**] demonstrated a true small-bowel obstruction secondary to a peristomal hernia (with the consequent inference that the original CT on [**12-15**] was demonstrating a true SBO as opposed to the ileal conduit contributing to the parastomal hernia).
Surgery also placed an NG tube which put out 800 cc of bilious fluid.
The patient's ileal conduit  was felt to be obstructed (and consequently, the urine ostomy output was obstructed) by proximal dilated loops of small bowel.
After these maneuvers, the patient's creatinine paradoxically bumped to 4.9 from 4.2 on [**12-18**]; this was subsequently found to be secondary to obstruction of percutaneous nephrostomy.
The patient's abdominal distension and pain markedly improved, and the patient began to pass flatus and bowel movements.
On the day of discharge, the patient's exam had markedly improved, he was tolerating a regular diet, and the patient was passing stool and without abdominal pain.
Concerning the patient's metastatic disease, a bone scan on [**2167-12-17**] noted radiotracer uptake was concerning for new metastases.
Calcium  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Community health and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Small Bowel Obstruction Secondary: 1) Acute Renal Failure 2) Atypical Chest Pain 3) Prior PE s/p IVF placement, on anticoagulation 4) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good.
Patient was tolerating POs, passing flatus, without abdominal pain, with stable vital signs, stable creatinine, and without chest pain.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain during a blood transfusion; we ruled out the possibility you were having a heart attack.
However, we also discovered that you had kidney failure due to a blockage between your kidney and new bladder.
It was determined that your small intestine had bulged into your ostomy and formed a hernia; this caused a small-bowel obstruction which blocked your ostomy output.
We then treated you for small-bowel obstruction with decompression of your GI system through a tube in your nose.
It is important you continue to take it easy with your diet avoiding high fiber foods, and focus on soft foods and small amounts at a time.
If you experience severe abdominal pain, inability to pass stool or gas, severe nausea/vomiting, fever > 102, chest pain, shortness of breath, no urine output from your ostomy, or any other concerning symptoms, then please contact your PCP or report to the closest ED.
