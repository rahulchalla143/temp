Admission Date: [**2133-8-17**]      Discharge Date: [**2133-8-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2059-5-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old man with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unclear primary, presumably lung.
This was diagnosed in [**2124**], after biopsy of supraclavicular lymph node.
Recently, he was diagnosed with microscopic hematuria.
Urologic evaluation revealed a duplicated right ureter with filling defect and wall thickening in the duplicated ureter at the level of the iliac crest with right hydronephrosis.
A right ureteronephrectomy was planned with suspicion for a transitional cell carcinoma.
The patient was extubated post surgery but subsequently developed respiratory distress and wheezing.
Chest x-ray was done and was suggestive of pulmonary edema.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history of adenocarcinoma, metastatic to the right supraclavicular node, unclear primary, diagnosed in [**2124**]; status post XRT.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary to emphysema.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40% in [**2130**].
Alert, oriented, somewhat forgetful of recent medical events.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm, no murmurs, no rubs.
No distention, no masses.
Skin:  No skin rashes, no edema.
CK triple was 83, 70 and 60, ruled out for myocardial infarction.
[**8-18**] revealed substantial clearing of pulmonary edema.
Cardiovascular:  On telemetry, the patient was noted to have multiple premature ventricular contractions.
This is felt to be due to just progressive left ventricular dysfunction, in the setting of hypertension and most likely the primary cause for the pulmonary edema.
He was placed on Digoxin 0.125 mg and started on Coumadin as well as put on Lasix 40 mg twice a day, in order to prevent further episodes of pulmonary edema.
Over the course of the admission, he did not have any further episodes of pulmonary edema.
There was no evidence of any pneumonia or infectious pulmonary process throughout the course of dissection.
Additionally, the patient had three unwitnessed episodes of hemoptysis, in which he coughed up small amount of clear mucus laced with red blood.
This was thought to be secondary to trauma on intubation which bled slightly on the starting of heparin for anticoagulation.
Neurologic:  Prior to starting anticoagulation, it was thought prudent to assess for risk of intracranial metastases which would be an absolute contraindication for any sort of anticoagulation.
He will be followed up by his primary care physician and by his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the near future for possible treatment and evaluation of his cancer and other health problems.
Congestive heart failure.
Metastatic carcinoma.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
