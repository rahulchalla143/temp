Continued debridement of abdominal musculofascial wall.
[**2138-5-25**] Exploratory laparotomy, adhesiolysis, resection of necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall.
History of Present Illness: 89 year old G7P7 who initially presented to OSH s/p fall with lower abdominal discomfort and pain who was subsequently found to have large pelvic mass.
The patient has been  having lower abdominal pain for 2 weeks now that fluctuates in intensity and is sharp and crampy and nonradiating.
She also reports scant vaginal bleeding over the last few weeks but is unclear on the time frame.
On presentation she had a CT scan done which revealed a large 15cm pelvic mass concerning for malignancy versus abscess.
She was started on levo/flagyl given concern for infection.
The patient's family reports that she had a fever while hospitalized but the fever is not documented in the records sent.
While the patient was hospitalized she received 2U PRBC, presumably for decreased HCT from 34.6 on [**5-10**] to 27.3 on [**5-16**], however this was not clearly documented.
She notes dysuria and small amount of vaginal bleeding.
She did have decreased appetite but denies any abdominal bloating.

It was unclear what the primary source of her pelvic mass was.
Her tumor markers came back with a very elevated CEA of 206.
They recommended a sigmoidoscopy, which revealed no explanation for the pelvic mass.
She was noted to have diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.
She therefore underwent a colonoscopy, which also demonstrated no explanation for the lasrge pelvic mass seen on CT scan.
She was therefore consented for a laparascopy, possible laparatomy and possible staging for large pelvic mass.
On [**5-22**], she underwent a laparascopy, which was converted to an open laparatomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bowel resection x 2 with reanastomosis and repair of anterior bladder wall defect.
The case was complicated by large intra-operative blood loss requiring transfusion of 4 units of packed red cells and 750cc of albumin.
She was continued on vanco/Cefepime/flagyl, but was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] SICU for further surgical mgmt, returned to the OR on [**5-25**] for a washout and noted to have extensive necrosis of the abdominal wall; this fascia was debrided.
She returned to the OR again on [**5-27**] for repeat exploration, washout, debridement and closure of the abdominal wall.
Over the coming days, her fluid status was managed with lasix and albumin, she received blood transfusions, she spiked fevers and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with antifungal coverage, and she received numerous blood transfusions for anemia and tachycardia.
Her wound looked progressively more necrotic and eventually was noted to have frank stool coming through the wound.
