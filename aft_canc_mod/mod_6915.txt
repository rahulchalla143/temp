Patient with history of chronic hypoventilation.
CXR concerning for new left sided PNA vs atelectatic changes vs positional.
During her ICU course, she continued to have episodes of hypoxia and required noninvasive ventilation.
As discussed with her daughter and health care proxy, she was DNR/DNI, no pressors.
She was placed on BiPap intermittently which became very uncomfortable.
In light of her worsening respiratory status, renal failure, unrelieved on Bipap, the decision was made on [**4-10**] to stop noninvasive ventilation.
Some concern for hypovolemia (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing) Concern for possible infectious sepsis.
She was started on broad spectrym antibiotics with good coverage of skin flora due to the fact that she had multiple wounds.
Her hypotension improved initially, however ultimately worsened.
Despite fluid and blood as needed, she continued to have respiratory compromise.
# Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg.
# AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is being untreated.
As above, she was treated with antibiotics and noninvasive ventilation.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.8 today.
Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.
her medications were renally dosed and despite efforts to treat her multiple medical problems, her renal failure worsened.
Was on lovenox at home, but now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and fractures.
On exam, her pupils were fixed and no breath sounds or heart rhythm could be auscultated, no pulses palpable.
