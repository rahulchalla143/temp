**FINAL REPORT [**2118-2-18**]**     C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2118-2-18**]):       Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA       amplification assay.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2118-2-20**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..  [**2118-2-23**] 6:02 am URINE      Source: CVS.
**FINAL REPORT [**2118-2-23**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2118-2-23**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
CXR PA&LAT [**2118-2-15**] (Atrius): There is patchy airspace disease seen scattered in the bilateral mid and lower zones.
No lytic lesion noted in the bones.
Daily Chest xrays were performed, most recently: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2118-2-19**] 7:42 AM FINDINGS: Multifocal areas of consolidation are again demonstrated bilaterally, affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left.
Findings are consistent with history of multifocal pneumonia.
Persistent small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Patchy airspace disease in bilateral mid and lower zones, right more than left.
These findings could represent pneumonic process.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is no aortic valve stenosis by doppler.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild RV dilation with preserved RV systolic function.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Severe multifocal pneumonia, which can be monitore on conventional chest radiographs.
No pulmonary embolism.
Mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymphadenopathy most likely due to CLL.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73yoF with a h/o CLL treated with one dose of rituximab 3 weeks ago, admitted for pneumonia with course c/b hypoxia requiring transfer to ICU.
Active Issues:  # Community-acquired pneumonia/Hypoxia: Pt presented with fever, hypoxia, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates c/w pneumonia.
She had no recent hospitalizations to suggest HCAP.
Of note, she had recently started rituximab for progressing CLL (received 1st dose 3 weeks prior to admission).
However, she became increasingly tachypneic with increasing O2 requirement over the first few hours.
In the ICU she had a CTA which showed severe multifocal pneumonia and mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymphadenopathy (no e/o PE).
Her antibiotics were broadened to vanc/zosyn/azithro on [**2118-2-15**], and on [**2-17**] she was started on IV Bactrim 300mg Q8H and IV Methylpred 20mg Q8H due to clinical concern for PCP given her immunocompromised state and rapid clinical deterioration.
Three sputums were sent on [**2-16**] and [**2-17**] but were contaminated with upper respiratory flora.
On [**2-19**] a contaminated induced sputum was sent that was negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii.
LDH was not elevated at 233, however B glucan was elevated at 327.
# L breast ca: Stage I ER/PR+ Her2-, s/p lumpectomy and radiation.
