[**2130-3-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2130-3-24**] Head CT w/o contrast: FINDINGS: In the high left frontal lobe, there is a focal area of vasogenic edema (Se2:Im 21-26).
A possible 1 cm slightly hyperdense lesion is seen at the left frontal vertex (Se2;27), but this is difficult to discern.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration with possibly mild sulcal effacement at the left vertex.
IMPRESSION: High left frontal vasogenic edema, highly worrisome for metastatic disease given history vs primary neoplasm.
1 cm rounded hyperdense focus at the left frontal vertex could represent an underlying lesion, although this is difficult to discern.
Progression of disease with interval increase in size of porta hepatis nodal masses and mediastinal nodal masses/lymphadenopathy; subtle hyperdensity of the hepatic masses is noted and internal hemorrhage is not excluded.
Porta hepatis masses may be causing mass effect on the portal vein and possibly distal common bile duct.
Distended gallbladder and dilated common bile duct.
Non-obstructing 4-mm left renal stone.
Degenerative change with grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1, and disk bulges at multiple levels.
Periapical lucency is identified at the left lateral incisor [**Doctor First Name **] # 23(image 14, series 8).
A contour irregularity of the left lamina papyracea could be congenital in etiology or may represent old trauma.
Widespread malignancy, primarily nodal involving the thoracic inlet and mediastinum, particularly the subcarinal station, and the celiac region in the abdomen.
No definite lung metastases, but it is difficult to separate inflammatory centrilobular bronchiolar nodulation from early metastases.
There is a 1.6-cm enhancing mass with likely central necrosis within the posterior left frontal lobe at the vertex in the region of the precentral gyrus with extensive surrounding white matter edema involving the frontal and parietal lobes.
No other definite lesions are identified although given significant motion artifact, small enhancing lesions will be missed.
Differential includes metastatic disease as well as primary brain malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo man with recent diagnosis of metastatic HCC admitted with acute on chronic renal failure and new right lower extremity weakness and likely new brain met.
CT showed a possible left frontal lobe lesion with vasogenic edema, so he was started on dexamethasone.
The acute renal failure resolved with IV fluids.
Brain MRI was delayed because of an old work-related injury that left shrapnel in his left cheek.
Then he had an MRI which showed a 1.6cm mass in the left frontal lobe.
No other lesions were seen, however the quality of imaging was poor.
Because hepatocellular carcinoma rarely metastasizes to the brain, he had a chest CT, which showed a mediastinal mass.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Due to hypovolemia with hypotension.
# Oncology: CT and MRI consistent with new brain met, the cause of the new right lower extremity weakness.
He is a smoker and has a history of melanoma in-situ.
However, if he has a 2nd primary, that will likely take priority considering its rapid progression in chest and brain.
# RLE weakness: Due to left frontal edema/lesion.
# Pain: Increased MSContin from 15mg [**Hospital1 **] to TID and changed prn to oxycodone to avoid acetaminophen overdose.
# Bipolar d/o/PTSD/depression: Continued citalopram and quetiapine.
# DM: Continued ISS.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine and checking TSH.
Repleted hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.
# DVT Prophylasix: Heparin SC.
# Precautions: Fall.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Acute kidney failure.
Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for acute kidney failure and right leg weakness.
The kidney failure improved with IV fluids.
The right leg weakness however has not improved with steroids.
You will need urgent additional therapy, either surgery or radiation or both.
The lisinopril and HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide) were not restarted because of the kidney failure.
However, you refused despite understanding the risks, especially the high risk of falling and not being able to manage at home.
Oxycodone 5-10mg for breakthrough pain.
