MICROBIOLOGY Urine culture [**2195-1-14**]- negative Blood culture [**2195-1-15**]- pending   Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 56 year old gentleman with DLBCL on R-CHOP and HD MTX, here for 3rd cycle of HD MTX, with course complicated by hypotension, Afib with RVR following MTX infusion.
Afib with RVR - Patient has developed Afib with RVR in setting of HD MTX in the past, likely because of stress of high rate infusion of meds and fluids.
Unfortunately, fluid infusion could not be stopped as kidneys need to be continuously perfused in order to prevent MTX crystallizing in renal tubules.
Patient was asymptomatic during this time.
Per outpatient cardiology notes, plan is for patient to have stress test and then to initiation propafenone.
Patient was also started on lovenox when he had his first episode of atrial fibrillation, and was continued on this during admission.
Of note, patient was ruled out for acute coronary syndrome with cardiac enzymes negative x 3.
He was back in sinus rhythm after discontinuation of requisite IVF for methotrexate.
Hypotension - Most likely due to arrhythmia causing decreased cardiac output.
No signs of infection as patient afebrile with normal white count.
Blood cultures were sent on transfer to ICU and were negative or pending.
Also may consider cardiogenic etiology, as patient is at risk for cardiomyopathy given recent chemotherapy, he was ruled out on for an MI.
Hypotension resolved with rate control.
Chronic Peripheral neuropathy - Symptoms ongoing, suspected to be [**3-5**] prior chemotherapy.
Hx PE, DVT - History of multiple DVTs in the past, found to have extensive right-sided tri-lobar PE on [**2194-10-20**] while on fondaparinux.
Patient had no complaints of shortness of breath or pleuritic chest pain during admission and was continued on outpatient dose of enoxaparin.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate Secondary: Diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma Trilobar Pulmonary Embolisms/History of Deep Vein Thromboses Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your course was complicated with the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and low blood pressure.
As your atrial fibrillation occurred in the setting of your methotrexate administration, cardiology felt you could continue to take your metoprolol at 25 mg two times a day while at home.
If you develop any symptoms of atrial fibrillation, specifically rapid heart rate, you may increase your metoprolol to 50 mg two times a day per the cardiology team, and please contact your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] immediately.
If any other symptoms develop, including light headedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any symptoms that concern you, please report to the emergency room.
