ANTENATAL HISTORY:  Intrauterine insemination (IUI), monochorionic diamnionic IUI twin gestation with [**Last Name (un) **] [**2182-11-13**], for EGA of 32-2/7 weeks gestation at delivery.
Pregnancy was complicated by IUGR with estimated fetal weight at 80th percentile in both twins.
There was no labor and no fever or other evidence of chorioamnionitis.
Subsequently, she was pink and in no distress in room air.
On admission, she was noted to have mild retractions and low-grade oxygen requirement.
No nasal flaring.
Chest:  No retractions, good breath sounds bilaterally, no adventitious sounds.
CVS:  Well perfused, rate and rhythm regular, femoral pulses normal, S1/S2 normal, no murmurs.
Normal S1 and S2 with a small, short systolic murmur of [**2-9**] at the left sternal border with no radiation.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, no mass, no visceromegaly, bowel sounds present, diaper rash noted in the perianal area getting better.
Respiratory system:  She was initially placed on nasal     cannula oxygen for initial drift in the oxygen     saturation to the mid 80s, and a chest x-ray was     consistent with mild TTN with no evidence of RDS.
She was noted to have some bradycardia and apnea     episodes, some related to feeds, but thought to be     immaturity of the central nervous system.
She continued to have     occasional apnea and bradycardia episodes until day-of-     life 27, and after day-of-life 27, she had no further     such episodes.
CVS:  Soft systolic murmur was noted on day-of-life 1     which persisted until day-of-life 4, and the murmur was     again noted to reappear on day-of-life 6 until the day     of discharge.
It is very soft, [**2-9**], and is probably     related to the mild anemia, and pediatrician is     recommended to follow up on the murmur.
She was switched to Enfamil 24 kilocalories     per ounce on day-of-life 19 due to availability of this     formula at the time of discharge.
She continued to have a     small diaper rash which is improving and is on Desitin     topical.
On     day-of-life 24, she was noted to have a small left arm     abscess and incision and drainage (I and D) was     performed on this abscess and was noted to have frank     pus which was sent for culture and analysis.
Her blood     culture remained negative, and the abscess site has     healed well.
Neurology:  Given the gestational age more than 32 weeks     and stable NICU course, does not qualify for a screening     head ultrasound examination.
Chronic lungs disease.
Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life, immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out-of-home     caregivers.
Intrauterine growth retardation.
Anemia of prematurity.
Left arm abscess, status post incision and drainage.
