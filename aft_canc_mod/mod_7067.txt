[**Name (NI) **] denies loss-of-consciousness, fall, or head trauma but does not clearly recall all the events that led up to the arrival at [**Hospital1 **].
He was noted to be tachycardic to 160s, which was felt to be more due to his SVT rather than withdrawal.
Given this degree of tachycardia and potential need for respiratory monitoring with benzodiazepine requirement, patient was admitted to MICU.
No siblings or other family.
Family History: Mother with depression and CAD.

No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
Similar appearance of 2-cm hypodense lesion in the right parietal lobe.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious etiologies assessed as cysticercosis, metastasis, and occult vascular malformation.
MRI head-Findings consistent with the presence of two intracranial mass lesions, one redemonstrated compared with the prior CT scan, but the other lesion, involving the glomus of the choroid plexus on the left side, more clearly differentiated on the present study.
If, indeed, the patient has neurofibromatosis 1, astrocytoma could be considered as a cause of these lesions, although the presence of apparent blood products in the right-sided lesion would be atypical for such a diagnosis.
MRI C/T/L spineFINDINGS: Within the cervical region, there is no spinal cord compression seen.
The fat-saturated images show no sign of pathological contrast enhancement either within the cord, or within the limitations of the artifact- degraded parasagittal scans, within the paraspinal regions, either.No definite area of spinal cord compression is seen within the thoracic region nor are there visible areas of pathological enhancement.
Similarly, within the lumbar spine, there is no definite sign for a mass lesion within the spinal canal causing cauda equina compression.
However, in that regard, there is no evidence for dural ectasia, a finding frequently noted in this disorder.
There is a moderately prominent right-sided L5-S1 disc herniation effacing the ventral thecal sac margin along its right side, as well as totally effacing the right S1 nerve root sleeve within its lateral recess.
male with history of EtOH abuse, SVT, CAD who presents for management of EtOH withdrawal.
# EtOH withdrawal - Pt received Diazepam 5mg PO q4H PRN CIWA > 8 in addition to Thiamine, Folate, and MVI daily.
Pt found to have hypodense lesions concerning for Neurofibromatosis.
# Tachycardia - alcohol withdrawal vs. SVT.
Pt well controlled on Metoprolol but Pt had an episode of tachycardia to 140s found to be MAT on EKG, treated with 2.5mg  Metoprolol with good response while in the MICU.
# CT Lesion- Found on Head CT done [**2168-7-25**] showing 2cm hypodense lesion in right parietal lobe.
A neuro and derm consults were called and pt was given a clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis (neurofibromas, axillary freckling, cafe [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 28584**] spots).
#dizziness: Pt complained of generalized weakness and dizziness after the brain biopsy.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient and found no acute physical therapy needs.
You were also found to have a condition called neurofibromatosis and a new mass in your brain that was biopsied.
