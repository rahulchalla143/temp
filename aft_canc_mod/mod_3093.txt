This required the assistance of both anesthesia and interventional pulmonary (IP) due to his high grade tracheal stenosis secondary to his paratracheal mass and his vocal cord paralysis.
The initial plan was for him to have a tracheal stent placed by IP to relieve his tracheal stenosis as well as a J tube placement by thoracics surgery to provide him with nutrition.
In addition, he developed hypotension requring two pressor agents which also prevented him being transferred to the operating room.
At best, a tracheal stent would have provided a temporizing solution to his tracheal stenosis and after multiple discusssions with his family and his oncology team, the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.
Metastatic esophageal cancer.
