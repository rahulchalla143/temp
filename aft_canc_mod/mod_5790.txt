Upper endoscopy [**2172-3-25**]: Erythema, edema, friability in the stomach body, antrum and pylorus compatible with Severe gastritis Erosions in the stomach body Small hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .

# GI BLEED: Patient initially admitted to MICU due to dramatic hematocrit drop.
EGD showed severe gastritis and colonoscopy showed numerous diverticuli and adenomatous polyps.
Likely multifactorial bleed due to above 3 causes, with diverticular bleed probably greatest contributor.
# C. DIFF: Patient developed diarrhea on hospital day 5.
It was thought that the diarrhea was likely secondary to C. diff and he was emperically started on metronidazole on [**2169-3-29**].
# HYPOTENSION: Patient was initially hemodynamically stable on presentation, and in fact, became hypertensive later in MICU course.
On hospital day 5 the patient had hypotensive episode with systolic BP between 80-90.
It was thought that the hypotensive episode was due to hypovolemia secondary to 1.6 kg fluid removed during hemodialysis earlier that day, as well as significant volume depletion secondary to his diarrhea from C. Diff.
No further hypotensive episodes were noted after fluid resuscitation.
# FEVER: On hospital day 5, patient had fever of 101.
His fever was thought to be secondary to C. diff infection, as diarrhea was present at that time (see above).
