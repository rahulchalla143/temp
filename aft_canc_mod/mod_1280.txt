Reason for MICU transfer: For possible bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy on [**2189-5-14**]  History of Present Illness: 75 year-old with history of aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2), CAD with DES [**5-/2188**] on Plavix, PPM for AVB in [**2184**], breast cancer in [**2153**], chronic hepatitis C and recent admission for SVC syndrome s/p Y stent placement by IP now BIBA from home with [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] cough and dyspnea.
Patient initially presented to PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 547**] complaining of neck and facial swelling.
She was ultimately referred to allergy and ENT with a neck CT ordered revealing SVC syndrome from extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and chest CT showing a right supraclavicular mass displacing the trachea and massive mediastinal lympadenopathy.
Patient reports her breathing worsened throughout the day and she "felt like she was drowning."
Cough is productive of mucous and occassional small amount of blood.
No fevers, or chills.
No abdominal pain.
Exam was significant for diffuse crackles and rhonchi in both lung fields.
Patient had CXR showing slighly worsened pulmonary edema and RML collapse.
She was also ordered for vancomycin and cefepime given crackles on exam (although she has not been febrile and no leukocytosis).
Patient was admitted to ICU given high risk of respiratory decompensation.
On arrival to the MICU, patient continues to complain of cough and some mild dyspnea.

Right middle lobe collapse.
Mild CHF, with interstitial fluid and slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
The tracheal Y-stent has been placed in the interim, and remains widely patent, without extrinsic compression.
Interval increase in now moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis.
Multiple foci of irregular pleural thickening are noted, concerning for lymphomatous implants.
Renal US [**2189-5-19**] IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Persistent soft tissue encasement of the mediastinum with unchanged severe narrowing of the SVC.
Overall, soft tissue density within the mediastinum appears unchanged compared to recent prior examination.
Widely patent Y-stent within the distal trachea and main stem bronchi.
No extrinsic compression or narrowing.
Persistent small left pleural effusion with resolution of prior right pleural effusion.
Decreased density of prior ground glass opacities seen within the right upper lobe suggesting interval improvement of probable prior infectious or inflammatory process.
Resolution of prior 8-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule, likely related to focal atelectasis or inflammation.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2189-5-18**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Pleural Fluid ([**2189-5-20**]): The cytology specimen shows rare atypical epithelioid cells in a background of reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and scattered predominantly small lymphocytes.
Please correlate with cytogenetics/FISH, cytology and clinical findings.
Pleural Fluid Cell Block ([**2189-5-20**]): Immunohistochemical stains confirm the presence of many CD68+ histiocytes and mesothelial cells (Calretinin+, WT-1+).
CD45 highlights background small lymphocytes which are predominantly CD3+ T cells; CD20 stains rare B cells.
Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings support the above diagnosis.
A normal MYC FISH finding can result from absence of a MYC rearrangement, from an atypical MYC rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: 74 year old woman with a h/o breast cancer, right clavicular squamous cell carcinoma, chronic HCV, and GERD with known large right infraclavicular mass impinging on her esophagus, trachea, and SVC syndrome, s/p XRT, recent transbronchial biopsy and Y-stent placement by IP, now with [**Year (2 digits) 9140**] dyspnea.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# B Cell Lymphoma: Patient with mediastinal mass causing SVC syndrome and tracheal compression.
# Dyspnea: Likely [**1-22**] mediastinal mass and Y-stent, along with mild volume overload.
Suspected lymphoma was causing tracheal compression as well as SVC syndrome.
She has associated RML collapse suspect secondary to proximal obstruction.
On HD 2 patient had increasing air hunger and work of breathing which nearly prompted intubation, but was avoided with frequent nebulizers, morphine and lasix.
She continued to have difficulty clearing secretions which was likely due to the tracheal stent.
She has underlying CHF due to her AS with evidence of [**Month/Day (2) 9140**] pleural effusions on CXR, and likely has underlying COPD due to smoking history.
No fever or leukocytosis to suggest development of pneumonia and sputum culture was unremarkable.
However on HD 5 she became acutely short of breath after receiving fluids.
CT chest was repeated and showed a patent Y stent.
# Hematuria: The patient was noted to develop hematuria concerning for hemorraghic cystitis.
Renal US was without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Urine cytology demonstrated few atypical urothelial cells, present singly and in rare clusters.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# Critical Aortic Stenosis with AI/MR:  Mild acute on chronic exacerbation given increased edema/effusions on CXR.
Plavix had been recently discontinued (in consultation with patient's cardiologist) as it had been nearly one year since stent placement.
# Chronic HCV with transaminitis: No liver masses on abdominal CT scan.
