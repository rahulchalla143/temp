History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 7363**] is an 84F with CAD s/p PCI, PAF on coumadin, SSS s/p [**Hospital 78816**] transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] after presenting with vomiting and diarrhea since starting bactrim for UTI 4 days PTA.
According to patient, her symptoms began as increased frequency/urgency in urination 1 week PTA.
Upon starting Bactrim, she stated that she was felt nauseous and began vomiting.
She had few BM during this time but endorsed small amounts of loose stool (non-bloody) when she had them.
Of note urinary symptoms resolved with antibiotic use.
Given insulin/D50 for hyperkalemia but became unresponsive in the setting of hypoglycemia (FSG 30s) - mental status and FSG improved with D50.
Head CT showed 2 cm lesion meningioma vs ICH so transferred here for neurosurg eval.
Of note, patient denies any dizziness, focal weakness/numbness/tingling, headache, or confusion.
Seen by neurosurg who felt CT finding was most consistent with meningioma, no acute intervention necessary.
Pt was initially admitted to the floor, but became hypotensive in the ED.
Stated she was mildly nauseous.
Denied any CP/SOB/LH/dizziness or abdominal pain/cramps.
Endorsed recent weight loss over last 6 days from poor PO intake.
Her SBPs remained in the 80s  Past Medical History: CAD s/p PCI PAF SSS s/p PPM [**2-7**] DM Chronic diastolic CHF HTN COPD Breast cancer s/p mastectomy Anemia - on iron supplements  Social History: Resident of [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare.

No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7363**] is an 84F with CAD s/p PCI, PAF on coumadin, SSS s/p PPM admitted with [**Last Name (un) **], hyperkalemia, hypotension.
Hypotension: Pt was admitted with SBP in 80s - likely [**3-2**] to hypovolemia and also persistent effects of anti-hypertensive medications that she had taken prior to admission.
No e/o septic physiology.
Acute renal failure: Pt admitted with Cr 4.1 - likely [**3-2**] to Bactrim use (added to allergy list) and compounded by prerenal etiology given vomiting/poor PO intake and antihypertensive regimen.
There were no EKG changes noted.
Presumed meningioma: Pt had CT head at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] after being lethargic (although FS 30 at the time due to treatment of hyperkalemia with insulin/D50).
She was noted to have an incidental finding of a 2cm hypervascular mass - most consistent with meningioma.
However, should be ruled out for other vascular lesions.
No immediate surgical intervention has been planned.
Received Vitamin K 10mg IV at the OSH for reversal, given concern for possible head bleed.
Type 2 DM uncontrolled with complications: Glyburide was held given elevated Cr while inpatient.
Given good glycemic control off glyburide and high risk of adverse event from hypoglycemia in elderly, would strongly consider not restarting.
Bilateral right upper extremity swelling:  Likely due to aggressive fluid repletion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Rehabilitation and Nursing Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute kidney injury Hyperkalemia Hypotension Head mass, likely meningioma  Secondary diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids and holding of your blood pressure medications.
Lastly, you were found to have a brain mass which is likely a meningioma but will need to be followed up by Neurosurgery.
