Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy intubation   History of Present Illness: HPI: 76 yo M with Afib, pacer, CAD s/p CABG, Ischemic CHF EF <40% w/2+MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34514**] dx RUL mass admitted to MICU after failing extubation from an outpatient bronchoscopy.
On [**2179-1-26**], the patient had an elective bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lung mass by interventional pulmonolgy.
1-2 minutes post procedure the patient became hypertensive (SBP 170's to 200's), tachycardic (130's), and hypoxic to the 70's on NRB.
Possible etiologies of flash edema vs COPD exacerbation were considered and he has been on a 2 month slow taper of Prednisone 5mg daily.
Of note, he also recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 34515**]/05 for symptomatic bradycardia.
He presented again with SOB and found to have a mass consistent with lung cancer on CT.
He currently reports no sob and is sitting on the edge of his bed without oxygen.
C/o discomfort in his right chest wall since the biopsy that has been alleviated with acetominophen.
Past Medical History: 1) COPD/chronic bronchitis, on chronic prednisone, [**2161**] fev 1.0/fvc 52% no recent PFTs on file 2) Afib - started coumadin [**2172**] currently off anti coagulation for bronch 3) s/p [**Company 1543**] V/V/I [**Company 4448**] placement [**2178-12-23**] for symptomatic bradycardia with prolonged QT leading to torsades and VT 4) CAD - s/p CABG in [**2168**] in non-Q wave MI.
LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA and PVA, recent normal stress nuclear study [**12-28**] 5) h/o small cerebellar bleed w/supratherapeutic INR [**12-28**] 6) Ischemic cardiomyopathy systolic dysfunction 7) hypercholesterolemia 8) RUL mass 9) Negative PPD [**2179-1-14**] (while on steroids) 10) recent 30lb unintentional wt loss [**12-28**] 11) syncope 12) hearing loss 13) h/o ETOH abuse/dependence 14) iron deficiency anemia since [**9-28**], pt previously refused c-scope or iron replacement  Social History: h/o ETOH dependence, no illicits, former smoker quit in his 50s retired, ambulates with walker at home  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: After call out from ICU: VS:  97.4 115/70  80  18  97% on 2L tele: AF Gen: pleasant, cachectic man, well-appearing, conversant HEENT: anicteric, mmm Neck:  supple, jvp at 10 cm CV: irreg, nl s1, loud s2, no split, 2/6 systolic m, no r/g Resp: poor air movement, decreased bs and dullness on right, exp wheezes on left Abd: s/nt/nd/nabs Back: no cva or spinal tenderness Ext: warm, trace edema, cap refill <2sec Neuro: A&Ox3, appropriate, CN grossly intact, MAE, gait not assessed  Pertinent Results: [**2179-1-26**] CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Perihilar mass and prominent perihilar lymph nodes, as seen previously.
Nodular opacities in the right upper lobe as seen previously.
New vaguely defined bibasilar nodular densities as well.
Severe emphysema.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Head CT: There is stable widening of the extra-axial spaces, prominence in the sulci and ventricles, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
The previously noted focus of hyperdensity in the lateral right cerebellum is not appreciated on this study.
There are cerebellar calcifications, which are unchanged, as well as basal ganglia calcifications.
Some relative hypodensity in the left temporal lobe is unchanged.
There is a small calcified extra-axial mass in right frontal region suggestive of calcified meningioma, unchanged.
With the administration of contrast, there are no metastases evident.
There is an opacity in the right maxillary sinus, probably a retention cyst.
There is sclerosis in the right mastoid air cells, which is unchanged, and to a lesser degree on the left.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression/Plan: Pt is a 76 yo M with CHF/systolic dysfunction 2+MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] failure in setting of hypertensive/tachycardic stress leading to flash pulmonary edema.
# Hypoxia: It was felt that this was likely [**2-25**] to CHF and chronic COPD.
After the flash pulmonary edema he improved greatly with lasix diuresis and when called out the floor was sat'ing in the mid 90's on room air.
# CHF: as above, his symptoms improved with diuresis.
Echo showed new global HK and depression in EF <20%, and this was felt potentially from stunning and demand ischemia.
# Lung Mass: Bronchoscopic biopsy showed squamous cell lung cancer.
# AF s/p pacer: HR was initially high, but then was controlled with diltiazem.
He underwent a head CT to rule out metastases, and when no mets were seen, he was restarted on coumadin at his previous dose.
# Metabolic alkalosis: it was felt that the pt had a mild volume contraction given aggressive diuresis in setting of CO2 retention and baseline HCO3 of 30s when outpt.
# h/o CAD: presumed stable, ruled out for MI in setting of stress, recent nuclear study within normal limits.
# Microcytic anemia: stable.
# Wt loss 30lb: stable.
Likely due to malignancy.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
[**Hospital1 19188**] 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Please discuss with him if he has a recommendation for a thoracic surgeon.
