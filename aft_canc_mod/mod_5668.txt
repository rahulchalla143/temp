Generally denies physical complaints besides general weakness and mild chronic dyspnea.
Denies loss of consciousness, fevers, chills, sweats, pain anywhere in her body, dysuria, hematuria, abdominal or flank pain.
ECG revealed AFib, RSR' RBBB no change from prior.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized on [**4-22**] for new LE edema.
Chronic dyspnea was stable.
Hypercalcemia, secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism with right lower pole parathyroid adenoma.
Unclear systemic, rheumatologic, neurologic, hematologic disorder, previously diagnosed as possible inclusion body myositis.
Pulmonary embolus, recurrent thrombosis with recent event [**2183-12-12**].
Cardiomyopathy with inferior wall hypokinesis by echo and possible old myocardial infarction.
Peripheral vascular disease with left femoral artery stenosis status post bypass in [**2168**].
History of pulmonary edema.
History of keloid scar formation.
History of seizure disorder of unknown etiology.
Gastroesophageal reflux syndrome.
Gastrointestinal bleeding on Coumadin.
Moderate to severe restrictive lung disease with possible neuromuscular origin.
Father died at 99 and did not have any known medical problems.
No chvostek sign.
OP clear, no hyperemia or tonsillar exudate.
No cervical LAD or appreciable JVD CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular.
No wheeze or crackles.
No organomegaly or pulsatile masses.
No rebound tenderness or guarding.
No cyanosis or edema.
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block.
There are non-diagnostic Q waves in the lateral leads.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No overt failure or infiltrate identified.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe consolidation which might represent atelectasis or pneumonia.Post-operative aspiration pneumonia is possible and folow-up chest x-ray with short interval is recommended.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild-to-moderatepulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
This was mutlifactorial, initially due to hypercalcemia, with components related to deconditioning and then post-operative state as discussed below.
At time of discharge, she reported that her weakness had improved.
Throughout her stay, she had no focal complaints or deficits.
Given her symptoms and social concerns, she remained monitored in the hospital and underwent parathyroidectomy on [**2187-5-16**] (details in operative report).
She was discharged on 1500 mg of calcium carbonate TID, 0.25 mg of calcitriol, and 800 units of vitamin D daily, as well as her home dose of furosemide.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of a pulmonary embolism in [**12/2183**] as well as atrial fibrillation for which she was on warfarin.
Her carvedilol was titrated up to 12.5 mg twice a day with improvement in her heart rate; improved conditioning also reduced the degree of rapid ventricular response that was observed.
She was given intravenous fluids, and after a chest x-ray was completed that was concerning for pulmonary edema, was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing, and cortisol level was not consistent with adrenal insufficiency.
It was felt that her hypotension was likely due to poor PO intake surrounding her surgery, in addition to receiving her usual home medications.
Her hypercapnia was felt to be a combination of her baseline restrictive lung disease, as well as some worsening secondary to pain medications.
At time of discharge, she actually remained mildly hypertensive with systolic blood pressure of 140-150. .
# Systolic congestive heart failure: Repeat echocardiogram as noted above, overall unchanged.
She appeared euvolemic at time of discharge with clear lung exam and no oxygen requirement.
# Osteoporosis: Continued calcium carbonate, vitamin D as above.
Outpatient Lab Work - Please have INR/PT/PTT checked on [**5-24**] or [**5-25**] as directed by and results sent to [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Hypercalcemia Secondary diagnoses: - Parathyroid adenoma - Systolic congestive heart failure - Atrial fibrillation - Multinodular goiter - Osteoporosis - Peripheral vascular disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital when you were found to be more short of breath and weak, by your visiting nurse.
It was discovered that you had a high calcium level.
After your surgery, you transiently had low blood pressure, however no serious reason for this was discovered, and your blood pressure returned to normal after getting intravenous fluids.
