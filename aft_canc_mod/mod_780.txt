Left iliofemoral bypass graft.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 44-year-old gentleman who presented with a left groin mass this past [**Month (only) 547**] and was diagnosed with a large intermediate grade synovial sarcoma of the left pelvis extending through the femoral canal into the left groin.
Given the size, grade and vascular encasement of the tumor, I advised up-front neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy to a total radiation dose of 5000 Gy with low-dose Adriamycin as a radiosensitizer.
He had no evidence of metastatic disease on cross sectional imaging.
He completed his treatment in early [**Month (only) **] and follow-up staging scans showed a decrease in size of the mass, but continued short-segment encasement of the external iliac artery and vein.
I advised radical resection of the mass and asked Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery to assist with possible resection of the left external iliac and common femoral artery and vein.
Past Medical History: Synovial sarcoma: Approximately six months ago when he noted the development of increase in left leg swelling and a lump in his left groin.
These symptoms have been intermittent but evolving over that time, with associated numbness on the lateral left thigh, mild weakness in hip flexion.
He had significant left leg swelling at that time, and ultrasound revealed no clot.
He underwent MRI of the lumbar spine on [**2139-4-30**], which revealed a complex pelvic mass within the left side of the pelvis, partially visualized on the umbar spine study measuring approximately 8 cm.
He underwent a pelvic ultrasound on [**2139-4-30**], which revealed an extraperitoneal 15.6 cm x 8 cm x 12.8 cm complex cystic and solid mass, which demonstrates internal vascularity in the pelvis.
Pathology revealed a malignant spindle cell neoplasm, intermediate grade, most consistent with synovial sarcoma, predominantly monophasic type.
CT of the head on [**2139-5-19**] revealed no evidence for metastatic disease.
CT of the torso on [**2139-5-19**] revealed a large psoas mass extending in the upper mid to lower pelvis to the femoral triangle measuring approximately 10 x 17 cm and encasing the external iliac artery and vein, but with no other direct bone or organ invasion, local pelvic or distal metastasis.
Given the [**Hospital1 **] day holiday he underwent 4 sessions of XRT and a cycle of low-dose adriamycin on [**6-30**] - [**7-3**].

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19161**] surgical procedure was prolonged due to complexity of pelvic mass.
He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring due to his past history of cardiomyopathy, need for aggressive pain control, and extensive surgery.
