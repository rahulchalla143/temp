Admission Date:  [**2165-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: rectal bleeding, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R femoral arterial sheath L femoral central venous line  History of Present Illness: 58F w/ metastatic non-small lung cancer recent d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-7**] following cervical/thoracic decompression (for presumed mets) complicated by LGIB now returning for bleeding per rectum and hypotension.
Did have a bleeding scan that was unrevealing on [**3-3**] and underwent colonscopy on [**3-6**] which demonstrated small internal hemorrhoids and multiple diverticuli w/ mixed openings in sigmoid and descending colon.
Also worked up for hyponatremia and found to have SIADH.
Reported no abdominal pain.
Had 3 large peripheral IV's placed and has received total of 6L IVF and 4 units PRBC.
Surgery consulted, suggested potential colectomy if bleeding persisted and pt hemodynmically unstable.
Angio failed to demonstrate evidence of active bleeding within the SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] system.
Apparently, clinical bleeding had also stopped.
Past Medical History: -metastatic non-small lung cancer w/ known spinal mets (based upon pathology from surgery) s/p cervical/thoracic decompression [**2-26**] -s/p RUL lobectomy of Pancoast tumor w/ xrt, chemo in '[**51**] c/b bronchopleural fistula -s/p recurrent/?new non-small LUL cancer in '[**62**] for which received chemo and xrt (etoposide/cisplatin in '[**63**] via Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] -s/p scapular osteomylitis -hyponatremia thought secondary to siadh -lower gi bleed as above (thought diverticular)  Social History: former tobacco history (40 pack years), no etoh, ivda  Family History: Mother died from ovarian cancer.
Physical Exam: 152/72 92 16 96%ra gen: chronically ill appearing female lying in bed flat, somewhat anxious heent: dry mm, mild scleral icterus cv: s1, s2 regular w/ no mrg appreciated pulm: ctab abd: positive bs, soft, mild diffuse tender, worse on the ruq, pool of bright red blood in rectum extr: no edema, right groin w/ femoral arterial sheath, palpable dp pulses in both le   Pertinent Results: EKG SR at 92, nl axis/interval, borderline low limb voltage, no definite ischemic changes .
There is an indentation of the superior bladder contour that may be secondary to the adjacent uterus.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of slow bleeding of the sigmoid colon.
[**3-9**] Arteriogram- Selective arteriograms of the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries and superselective arteriograms of the superior hemorrhoidal and sigmoidal arteries did not demonstrate any active contrast extravasation, focal vascular lesion or other potential source of bleeding.
Brief Hospital Course: 58F w/ recurrent metastatic non-small lung cancer and recent lower gi bleed who was admitted to MICU for recurrent large volume GI bleed.
She underwent washout of her R shoulder and cervical spine with post-op course requiring monitoring in the ICU for hypotension and persistent hypoxia (secondary to volume overload) requiring venitlatory support.
She did not wish to be intubated or kept on bipap, and she did not want to continue with any further aggressive measures.
Discussion with patient, family (husband, [**Name (NI) 61443**]), [**Name (NI) 2270**] [**Name (NI) 11835**] with palliative care, and social work on [**3-14**] with plan made to transition care to DNR/DNI with goals geared towards comfort.
# Respiratory Distress: Required intubation initially in setting of volume overload and then again post-operatively.
Transported to angiography from ED where pt had stopped bleeding and engagement of [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and SMA territory failed to reveal site of bleeding.
Nuclear bleeding scan on [**3-9**] suggestive of potential localized bleed in region of sigmoid colon.
Surgery was consulted and given 2 recent life-threatening bleeds, had low threshold for OR for ?partial or total colectomy.
She was not taken for surgery however since she had no clinical evidence of bleeding per rectum.
Hypotension: Pt initially presented to ED hypotensive to systolic 60's in the setting of massive lower gi bleed.
High suspicion was for recurrent bleed but crit did remain fairly stable.
MSSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**3-9**] have grown Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus in 4 out of 4 bottles.
She did present with elevated wbc to 35K as mentioned above.
In order to evaluates source, TTE was performed, which was negative for vegetations.
CT of T&C spine was negative for epidural abscess.
However, there was evidence of local infection at spinal surgery site.
Metastatic lung cancer: She has long history of non-small lung cancer dating to early 90's at which point she underwent RUL resection followed by XRT, chemo for Pancoast's tumor.
Apparently, she had recurrence vs. ?new cancer in left lung.
She does have metastatic dz (for which recent spinal surgery performed) but felt that would be reasonable to proceed with aggressive therapy for GIB and sepsis since condition not believed to be immenintly terminal.
