Admission Date:  [**2166-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2166-1-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-1-9**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension with mental status changes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, status post bilateral nephrectomies, on hemodialysis with metastatic disease to the lung, eye, penis, also with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, status post AICD pacer for V-fib arrest and congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%, diabetes, hypertension, history of upper gastrointestinal bleed who was in his usual state of health until yesterday at hemodialysis when his blood pressures were noted to the in the 60's but resolved reportedly.
Last night when getting up from the toilet after a bowel movement he fell without loss of consciousness but hit his head on the sink and was dizzy.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16858**] the morning of admission, was somnolent with blood pressures 50/palp with a weak pulse.
Per his wife his mental status changes since he hit his head last night but has been weak for several days.
No elevated white blood count but a left shift without bands.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies chest pain, diarrhea, headache, rashes, has felt short of breath (sometimes).
Renal cell carcinoma, status post bilateral nephrectomies - the right one in [**2164**] and the left in [**2153**].
Status post [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-2, Thalidomide with metastases to the lung, status post a left lower lobe resection in [**2165-5-29**], metastases to the right orbit status post [**Year (4 digits) 16859**] in [**2165**], metastases to the penis status post penectomy in [**2158**] with recurrent metastases to the lung.
Hemodialysis in [**Location 9583**].
Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2164-11-29**], status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2165-3-29**].
SVG to left anterior descending, SVG to Patent ductus arteriosus, SVG to diagonal, status post VF arrest with a AICD placement.
Congestive heart failure with an EF on [**2166-1-7**] of 30% with mild Aortic regurgitation and MR.  5.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Type 2.
Stage I colon cancer status post left hemi-colectomy in [**2165-9-29**].
Arteriovenous fistula four weeks ago.
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes gastrointestinal upset, Intravenous contrast causes question of rash, also question of allergies to Venofere and Iodine.
Knows place and name, anxious male.
CV: Tachycardiac, regular with occasional premature ventricular contractions, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Respirations, bronchial breath sounds at base with decreased bowel sounds.
No erythema or hematoma.
Positive cyanosis to fingertips bilateral.
Cool extremities.
1+ radial pulse bilaterally.
No clubbing or edema in the lower extremities, however, 1+ edema in the upper extremities bilaterally only.
Chest x-ray:  Increased consolidation of the left lower lobe atelectasis verses pneumonia, atelectasis of left upper lobe is new, moderate left pleural effusion with extension to the left apex, increase in evidence of congestive heart failure.
Head CT without contrast, no intracranial or acute process.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right associated with atelectasis of basis, nodular densities in the lung, the right lower lobe.
Vertebral lesions - lytic osseous lesions.
No Triple A or retroperitoneal bleed.
Liver, bowel, gallbladder, pancreas within normal limits and an enlarged spleen.
ASSESSMENT:  74-year-old male with hypotension in the setting of metastatic renal carcinoma.
Status post nephrectomy, is on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure with an EF of 30% and coronary artery disease.
Differential diagnosis includes sepsis however, there is no clear source at this time.
Hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency and question of an myocardial infarction but the electrocardiogram was without changes and the first enzymes were flat.
Had a Head CT and Abdominal CT without contrast showing no head bleed, a large left greater than right pleural effusion, metastases to the right lower lobe and an 8x5 cm large renal mass.
So it was decided to perhaps to have a bedside echo done to rule out tamponade as he did have upper extremity edema with lower extremity edema and this echo showed a right ventricular mass/tumor, 35% EF with wall motion abnormalities.
We were hesitant to start anti-coagulation without thoroughly ruling out brain metastases with a contrast study.
It was decided that we would pre-medicate him for this supposed allergy to intravenous contrast and go ahead with getting a head CT to rule out a bleed or metastatic disease as well as we were interested in looking at the test in order to rule out inferior vena cava syndrome.
He did have his upper extremity edema and when we tried to place a central line into the right IJ the tip ended up being diverted into the right subclavian and it was questioned whether he had elevated pressures or blockage or clot in the SVC.
However, he did undergo the CT which was consistent with a SVC syndrome with collateral flow.
The left mainstem bronchus was collapsed secondary to extreme compression of the lymph nodes.
He also had multiple lung and now new liver metastasis.
At first the plan was for him to be DNR/DNI however, when the results of the CT showed the rapid progression of metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy compressing the SVC and the right mainstem bronchus it was unable to be treated.
The family was in agreement that he would be unable to recover from the progression of his cancer and a Morphine drip was started in order to ease his pain.
