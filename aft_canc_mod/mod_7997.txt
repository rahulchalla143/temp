A second event was seen by the pstient's fiancee and described as jerking/shaking movements of all foru extremities and foaming at the mouth.
EMS was called ant the patient taken to an OSH where he had a third GTC and was treated with IV ativan and dilantin.
CT of the head was done showing extensive left frontal white matter edema.
The patient reports that he has had no symptoms prior to the seizure, and has been well until today.
Past Medical History: none  Social History: no smoking history, occ ETOH, has a fiancee  Family History: nc  Physical Exam: Awakes, alerts, cooperative with exam Speech fluent with good comprehension Pupils equally round and reactive to light Visual fields are full to confrontation Extraocular movements intact bilaterally Facial strength and sensation intact and symmetric.
Palatal elevation symmetrical.
Discharge Exam: Stable, nno detectable pronator drift  Pertinent Results: Brain MRI with and without contrast [**2165-8-20**]: IMPRESSION: Right frontal intra-axial, non-enhancing mass, solid with a small cystic component, with some features suggesting hypercellularity.
The lack of contrast enhancement suggests a low grade glial or neuroepithelial neoplasm.
There is no pathologic supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.
The lungs are clear without focal opacity or pleural effusion.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver is normal without focal lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no free air or fluid in the abdomen.
There is no pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
The aorta and major branches appear patent with scattered foci of atherosclerotic calcification noted.
No free pelvic fluid.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion concerning for osseous malignant process.
Focus of air seen in the right anterior soft tissues is likely due to subcutaneous injection.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for primary malignancy.
Unchanged right frontal intra-axial mass lesion with significant associated vasogenic edema.
Few areas of activation are demonstrated adjacent to the right frontal mass lesion during the movement of the left foot, left hand and during the movement of the tongue, apparently at more than 1 cm from the lesion.
No significant change in the overall appearance of the nonenhancing but apparently hypercellular intra-axial mass, superficially located in the right paramedian frontovertex with associated vasogenic edema, mass effect, and slight leftward shift of the septum pellucidum.
Unremarkable CTA and CTV with no tumoral enhancement, neovascularity or AV shunting and no finding to suggest superior sagittal or other dural venous sinus invasion, obstruction or thrombosis.
There is a small volume of pneumocephalus, both within the resection site in the brain, anterior to both frontal lobes, as well as a small amount of subcutaneous gas overlying the craniotomy site.
There is a probable punctate region of hemorrhage within the resection bed.
A large area of vasogenic edema in the right frontal and parietal lobes, with partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle is redemonstrated.
There is mild mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical changes  [**2165-8-27**] MRI Brain with and without contrast: Impression: Expected postop changes with nonenhancing residual tumor along the inferior aspect of the resection cavity.
[**2165-8-27**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Venous Dopplers IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.
A brain MRI with contrast was obtained which demonstrated a nonenhacing right frontal lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema.
He continued to be stable with dilantin and dexamethasone with no seizures of since of adverse neurologic deficits.
His MRI was reviewed and showed expected postop changes with residual tumor.
Routine screening lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT bilaterally.
At the time of discharge he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital signs.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal mass Seizures - simple and complex partial   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
You have dissolvable sutures.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
