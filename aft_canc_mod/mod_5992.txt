The patient was recently discharged on [**2190-12-16**] with the new diagnosis of her nonsmall cell lung cancer and was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for conditioning while receiving her chemotherapy.
Later on, the patient became very hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, and started experiencing lethargy along with increased confusion.
The patient also had decreased urine output, and her blood pressure on arrival to the ED was 100/60, with a pulse of 110, and a respiratory rate of 30.
The patient also started to experience some diaphoresis along with accessory muscle use, and was sent to the ED of [**Hospital6 2018**].
The patient was started on Zosyn and transferred to the Kenard-ICU on the MUS ....... protocol for a working diagnosis of septic shock secondary to pneumonia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  Pleasant, elderly female who appeared to be in no acute distress on admission.
No paradoxical breathing.
RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGES:  Chest x-ray showed a large spiculated density in the right hilum, 7.0 x 5.2 cm, along with adenopathy.
Improved bilateral pleural effusions as compared to prior x-rays.
EKG:  Showed 100 beats per minute, rate sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, delayed R wave progression, and there was some T wave inversions in V2-V4.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SEPSIS/ID:  The patient presented to the hospital with hypotension, fever, lethargy, and had a white count of 0.2 most likely secondary to her most recent chemotherapy.
Although initially there were no clear presenting symptoms, or signs of patient infection, the patient was started on broad coverage of Zosyn, Zithromax and vancomycin.
A surveillance set of blood cultures was sent on [**1-12**], and another one on [**1-17**] which showed no further growth in the blood.
However, throughout the hospital course a CAT scan was obtained that showed significant right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia, although the patient not producing much sputum.
The patient was continued on the ceftriaxone, and on [**1-16**] the patient was intubated secondary to respiratory failure.
The patient began to retain carbon dioxide and became confused and less responsive.
3) CARDIOLOGY:  The patient has no known coronary artery disease, and throughout the hospital course the patient was in sinus rhythm with occasional PACs and ectopy.
The patient was tachycardic which was thought to be a combination from her being in sepsis, volume overload due to resuscitation, respiratory distress.
In addition, after intubating, the patient became very hypotensive and had decreased urine output, and so required a significant amount of fluid resuscitation along with Levophed to help maintain her blood pressure.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who is her primary oncologist was involved during the care of this patient in the ICU who recommended that there was no need for Neupogen, as her white count would slowly increase.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also had an extensive discussion with the family that despite her aggressive treatment, her prognosis is very poor, and so at that time it was decided that she would be extubated for goals of comfort measures only.
