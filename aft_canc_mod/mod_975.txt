HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, and AML who was transferred from [**Hospital3 537**] for fever and respiratory distress.
She had a history of myelodysplasia which was found to have converted to AML.
She is status post three courses of low-dose Ara-C and one does of high-dose Ara-C up to [**2149-7-10**].
During the course of her hospitalization she became unresponsive and nonverbal.
Over one week later she was diagnosed with nonconvulsive status epilepticus and was transferred to the ICU for intubation and treatment.
Her family for unknown reasons refused a phenobarbital coma.
She was loaded initially with Dilantin which was discontinued when it caused leukopenia and then later with Depakote and Keppra.
She never remained responsiveness and remained nonverbal throughout the course of her hospitalization up until [**2149-12-26**].
During this long hospitalization, she also was readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit and intubated for an MRSA pneumonia which was treated with linazolid.
In [**Month (only) 404**], while hospitalized at [**Hospital1 336**], a family meeting was held in which the neurologist stated to the family that the patient had no hope of functional recovery.
They refused to make her DNR/DNI or CMO and insisted that she remain full code.
On the morning of [**2149-12-28**], she was noted to be in respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air and a temperature of 103.4.
A chest x-ray demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia and a white cell count was 20.2 with a left shift.
It was felt that she was in septic shock and dopamine was switched to Neo-Synephrine at 60 micrograms per minute.
Status post intubation, she had suction of copious amounts of yellow sputum.
In the Emergency Department, she was also noted to have poor urine output and received 6 liters of IV fluids with 600 cc of urine output over the next two hours.
Breast cancer times two, right breast DCIS, status post mastectomy and lymph node dissection in [**2138**]; left breast intraductal cancer, status post mastectomy and adjunctive chemotherapy with four cycles of Cytoxan and Adriamycin in [**2145-9-9**].
Myelodysplasia converted to AML diagnosed in [**2148-9-9**], status post autologous bone marrow transplant at the [**Hospital 4415**] in [**2149-7-10**], status post four courses of Ara-C. 5.
Diabetes mellitus times nine years.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for a mother with hypertension and breast cancer, father with diabetes.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco.
Neck:  Without thyromegaly.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, and II/VI diastolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.
The urinalysis was notable for [**5-19**] white blood cells and occasional bacteria.
Chest x-ray demonstrated ETT 6 cm above carina, left subclavian and left atrium, no effusions or infiltrate were read on initial x-ray.
EKG was notably tachycardiac with ST depressions in V2 and V3, mild left axis deviation and question of U wave.
CARDIAC:  The patient was initially felt to be in septic shock secondary to her left shift, fever, and hypotension not responding to fluids; however, on [**2149-12-30**], a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which demonstrated a cardiac index of 1.5, SVR 1,200, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20.
It was then felt that she suffered a cardiac insult and was in cardiogenic shock.
Cardiology felt that she was significantly fluid overloaded and recommended not only diuresis but Captopril for afterload reduction.
An echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated global decrease in LV and RV function and no significant valve abnormalities.
It is likely that the patient suffered a cardiac insult causing her decreased EF at this point.
NEUROLOGY:  The patient continued to be unresponsive and nonverbal.
She was also noted to be having upper extremity clonic motions and clonus upon movement that would generalize.
Continuous EEG from [**2150-1-1**] to [**2150-1-5**] demonstrated no further seizure activity, although the patient had severe diffuse slowing.
Neurology interpreted this as severe toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
PULMONARY:  The patient's ventilator dependency has continued but she has remained on pressure support weaned down on [**2150-1-5**] to 5 of pressure support and 5 of PEEP, tolerating this well and with saturations in the high 90s.
However, she continues to have large periods of apneic events.
Pneumonia:  The patient grew out MRSA from sputum.
She was continued on an eight day course of linazolid until [**2150-1-5**] when it was discontinued as the patient has been afebrile without worsening of her pneumonia, also with thrombocytopenia and felt maybe contributed to linazolid.
Tube feeds initially held secondary to sepsis, on pressors, and then started Criticare at 10 cc per hour for trophic feeds.
TPN was initiated on [**2149-12-29**] with insulin to cover for elevated blood sugars.
SKIN:  The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and calf decubitus ulcers, heel decubitus ulcers being treated with wet-to-dry dressing changes.
ENDOCRINE:  Apparent history of diabetes mellitus treated with regular insulin sliding scale here.
C.  TSH elevated at 8.9 but T4 within normal limits and T3 slightly low demonstrating subclinical hypothyroidism.
No further issues with urine output or creatinine.
HIT antibody pending.
A family meeting was held on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2150-1-3**], at which the son and daughter were told by Neurology that the patient likely has no hope of functional recovery; however, that there have been patients who have had similar periods of nonconvulsive status epilepticus in the past that have had some functional recovery.
