Admission Date:  [**2112-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-10-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-5-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Benadryl / Lipitor / Codeine / Enablex / Latex / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis with drain placement pericarical drain removal pericardial window placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 71 year old female with a PMH significant for recently diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain and C2 vertebrae, HTN, and Grave's disease s/p ablation on replacement therapy that presents with a 2 day history of dyspnea on exertion.
She has noticed new onset shortness of breath over the past two days walking around her apartment.
In the past she had become short of breath with walking up the stairs, but now the onset is with much less effort.
She denies any accompanying lightheadedness, dizziness, or chest pain.
She does describe associated tightness in her lower chest/epigastric area.
Denies any fever or chills, though notes she was recently treated with an antibiotic for diarrhea.
Of note, this [**Month (only) 205**] she presented to her PCP with complaints of neck pain, double vision, and was found to have an elevated ESR.
She was started on prednisone for suspected PMR and sent for a temporal artery biopsy to rule out temporal arteritis.
Her symptoms improved on prednisone, but she had a recurrence of blurry vision.
She presented to the ED and had a head CT that showed 2 lesions in the brain.
She was admitted and found to have metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
The inferior images on the CTA neck also revealed a large lung mass with concern for invasion into the aortic arch.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
She was given aspirin 325mg x 1 and levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 for CXR showing new retrocardiac opacity and lactate of 3.5.
She had a CTA to rule out PE that showed left pulmonary arterial invasion by the left upper lobe/hilar mass with associated occlusion with tumor thrombus of left lower lobe pulmonary artery branches as well as a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
Wet Read  There was question of tumor invasion into the aorta of pericardium.
She was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring and possible pericardial effusion tap.
On the floor, a bedside echo was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion with RV and RA collapse during diastole.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: mild upper extremity clubbing.
SKIN: Warm dry, no lesions.
Blood culture [**2112-9-24**] and [**2112-9-25**]: No growth Urine culture [**2112-9-25**]: No growth .
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Resting hemodynamics revealed evidence of pericardial tamponade as evident from the equalization of diastolic pressures in the RA, RV and PA.  Left and right sided filling pressures were elevated with RVEDP of 16mmHg and PCWP of 18.
There was moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension with an PASP of 41 mm Hg.
Using standard technique and ECHO guidance, the blunt tipped  pericardial needle was used to the access the pericardial space via a subxiphoid approach.
60 cc of serous fluid was rapidly removed.
An 8 French drainage catheter was then placed over the wire and an additional 350 cc of serous and mildly bloody fluid was removed and sent for analysis.
Final hemodynamics after removal showed pericardial pressure to be subatmospheric, RA pressure decreased to 5 mm Hg with return of the y Descent.
Post  procedure ECHO confirmed placement of the catheter in the pericardial space as well as well as complete resolution of the pericardial effusion.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2112-9-26**]): NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2112-9-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2112-9-26**]): NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Pathology: [**2112-9-25**]: Pericardial fluid:   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, .
CXR [**2112-9-28**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of both right and left pleural effusion.
Unchanged large left-sided paramediastinal mass.
Well-defined lucency at the left lung base, potentially reflecting a small left basal intrapleural air collection.
No evidence of tension.
Left lower lobe pulmonary artery tumor thrombus extending to the left lower lobe artery branches with possible invasion by the left upper lobe/hilar mass, as described above.
New moderate to large pericardial effusion, possibly malignant, with findings above suggesting pericardial tamponade including mild right heart strain.
The upper lobe/perihilar mass with abutment and partial encasement of branches of the left upper lobe artery is not significantly changed.
No significant change in metastatic lymphadenopathy.
New bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, worse on the right side.

On arrival, she had CXR showing new retrocardiac opacity and lactate of 3.5.
CTA to rule out PE showed left pulmonary arterial invasion with tumor thrombus of as well as a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
She was transferred to the CCU, and a bedside echo was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion with RV and RA collapse during diastole.
She was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, but with pulsus paradoxis on exam.
Patient went for right heart catheterization, with placement of right-sided pericardial drainage catheter, which showed large bloody pericardial effusion.
Cytology demonstrated adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid.
Due to persistent output through the pericardial drain, a surgical pericardial window was placed along with a temporary pericardial chest tube (removed after 24 hours).
#Paroxysmal Afib: S/p pericardial drain placement, patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
# Shortness of Breath: Likely secondary to pleural effusions (secondary to leakage from pericardial window) and atelectasis and possibly anemia.
She takes shallow breaths due to chest discomfort and coughing which has resulted in a mild respiratory alkalosis.
She responded well to furosemide, which was given to help decrease her pleural effusions.
She can continue on furosemide as needed while on the OMED service (and possibly on discharge) if short of breath or if effusions grow in size.
Incentive spirometry, coughing and activity (out of bed daily) was encouraged.
# Hypertension: Recently diagnosed with hypertension and started on amlodipine 5mg daily.
# Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Metastases to brain and spine, s/p total brain irradiation, scheduled to start chemo week of [**2112-10-2**].
# Anemia: Normocytic, HCT trending down now to 26.8, slow drop may be due to blood loss through pericardial drain.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have anemia of chronic disease (admission Hct 30).
No signs of GI bleed.
# Leukocytosis: The patient has a leukocytosis without evidence of infection, no fevers, cultures were negative and there was no evidence for an infiltrate on CXR.
Her leukocytosis was resolving upon discharge from the CCU.
# Hypothyroidism: She has a history of Grave's disease s/p ablative therapy.
She was continued on her home dose of levothyroxine without complications.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**] Skilled Nursing Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion with tamponade  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath.
You subsequently developed an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation) that resolved with a medication.
Of note, cardiology recommends that you follow up with your primary care doctor (or cardiologist, if you currently have one) to discuss whether or not to pursue further testing for the episode of the irregular heart beat that you had while in the hospital.
