A CT torso was performed which showed a worsening pleural effusion, new pericardial effusion, and no abdominal process seen.
She initially had stable vitals, was at her baseline SBP's in the 90's with a small O2 requirement and was to be sent to the floor, but became hypotensive to the 70's this morning with hr's to 120's.
She was asymptomatic and was responsive to 1L fluid, with BP's coming back up to 90/60.
The concern was for tamponade from the enlarging pericardial effusion and they did a bedside echo which they thought might have shown ?
Cardiology was called, and their stat echo showed small to moderate effusion with no evidence of tamponade per cards fellow.
ROS: The patient denies any weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Completed  6 cycles of low-dose weekly Taxol with gradual response to therapy complicated by severe colitis and C. difficile infection.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.5 BP: 95/71 HR: 94 RR: 16 O2Sat: 98% 2L NC GEN: Chronically ill-appearing, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, +rub no M/G, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Decreased breath sounds half way up on left, basilar crackles on the right.
ABD: Soft, NT, mild distention, +BS, no HSM, +fluid wave and shifting dullness.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2125-6-19**] Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
New moderate pericardial effusions.
Worsening left pleural effusion.
No pulmonary embolism.
New right upper lobe 9-mm spiculated mass concerning for metastasis.
Stable liver and peritoneal lesions.
Multiple new bony hyperdense foci concerning for spinal and sternal metastasis.
Large volume abdominal and pelvic ascites, which somewhat limits assessment.
No evidence of an acute bowel process.
Large volume of dense colonic and rectal stool.
CT Cervical Spine [**2125-6-19**] IMPRESSION: A tiny sclerotic focus in the medial aspect of the left first rib, but otherwise no evidence of osseous metastatic disease within the cervical spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 53 year-old female with a history of Stage III peritoneal serous CA who presents to the ED 5 days s/p third cycle of Alimta, with mild fever and malaise and transient hypotension.
There was initial concern re: sepsis physiology but the patient's BP stabilize with minimal IVF and the fevers resolved after 24 hours.
A pericardial effusion was noted on CT scan.
An echocardiogram showed that the effusion was too small to drain and there was no evidence of tamponade physiology.
A paracentesis was done for therapeutic and diagnostic reasons.
There was concern regarding spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but the patient's peritoneal fluid analysis was negative for such a process.
No clear source of fevers was found.
# Hypoxia: Patient denied SOB but had low O2 sats (to 90%) and an increased pleural effusion on the left with a new small RUL mass on CT chest.
The hypoxia was felt to be more consistent with patient's effusion.
# Stage III peritoneal serous CA: patient just completed her 3rd round of Alimta.
She had a mild transaminitis which was being attributed to the chemo.
Initially seemed to be having good response with reduction in CA-125 levels, but now has mets in the spine which are new and a possible new met in the RUL of the lung.
A CT of the cervical spine was done to evaluate neck pain for bony mets and the cervical spine was negative for mets.
restarts Coumadin after discharge given her high risk.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Fever Pleural effusion Ascites Peritoneal Serous Cancer   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You presented with Fevers of unclear cause.
You were also found to have worsening fluid collections around your lung and in your belly.
If you develop fevers, chills, cough, worsening shortness of breath, or chest pain, abdominal pain or pain with urination or other symptoms, please call your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room.
We recommend that you discuss restarting coumadin for recurrent DVT/PE with your PCP.
