This pregnancy was complicated by a diagnosis at 25 weeks gestation during an ultrasound of a pelvic mass in the fetus.
Further assessment at [**Hospital1 18**] with ultrasound and fetal MRI revealed pelvic lesions most consistent with sacrococcygeal teratoma, that was most pelvic in location with a combination of solid and mostly cystic components.
No hydronephrosis or other evidence of urinary obstruction was noted at the time of imaging.
Abdomen soft and full in appearance with a firm mass palpable in the lower abdomen.
Anus normal with a positive anal wink.
The mass was soft and completely covered with skin with a small tuft of hair present.
The hips were noted to have increased laxity and range of motion with abduction, not clearly dislocatable.
The right foot had a mild metatarsal adductus.
Gastrointestinal:  Due to the diagnosis of sacrococcygeal     teratoma, an abdominal ultrasound was done on [**2163-4-9**]     which showed bilateral hydronephrosis with more     hydronephrosis on the right versus the left and a     probable hydroureter.
The mass was measured to be     approximately 5.2 cm by 2.4 cm in the abdomen and felt to     be mostly cystic in nature with little mass to the     teratoma.
Hematology:  No blood typing has been done on this     infant.
She has     remained free of signs of infection.
