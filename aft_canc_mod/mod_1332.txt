Admission Date:  [**2144-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-2-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-4-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info 23015**]   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness:  66 yo M with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma, known mets to lungs, brain, back, heart came into the ED today with [**2-16**] d h/o weakness, dizziness, fatigue.
He has h/o RV mass and "abnormal EKG" in the past.
He had [**1-15**] syncopal episodes in that time and fell on back yest with residual L lower back pain.
Seen at [**Hospital6 33**] yest with EKG showing A-fib, rapid ventricular response, RBBB, T wave abnormality.
Regarding his cancer history, developed left lower back pain towards the end of 7/[**2142**].
Workup included a CT scan of his abdomen dated [**2142-8-5**], which showed a 10.1 x 8.2 cm lobulated enhancing soft tissue mass causing distortion of the underlying renal architecture of the left kidney.
He was concurrently diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and eventually underwent a left radical nephrectomy with inferior venacavotomy and complete excision of the renal vein with inferior vena caval reconstruction and removal of tumor thrombus.
The pathology from the nephrectomy showed renal cell carcinoma of papillary subtype, which was 11.5 cm in greatest dimension.
He was followed clinically following this period but developed metastatic disease in the lumbar spine, which was symptomatic as well as enlarging pulmonary nodules.
He has receveid 4 cycles of temsirolimus with compllication of pneumonitis.
On [**1-15**], Mr, [**Known lastname 22956**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with right hand numbness which perisisted.
HIS head CT revealed a left parietal hemorrhage with some mild mass effect.
His head MRI revealed at least one metastatic focus that was hemorrhagic in the left posterior frontal lobe, precentral in location.
MRI imaging on [**2-17**], according to Dr. [**Name (NI) 23016**] note, revealed, "a good resolution of the blood in the left posterior frontal metastasis; however, now, the right temporal FLAIR signal abnormality appears to have bled and is now approximately about 1.5 cm with some mild surrounding edema".
Of note, he has a history of PE that was diagnosed incidentally along with RCC ([**7-19**]), with no sx at that time.
EKG showed NSR at 93 bpm, 1 AVB, RBBB, no acute ischemic changes.
He subsequently underwent a V/Q scan yielding a large area of mismatched hypoperfusion in the right upper lobe with a moderately high risk ratio for pulmonary embolism.
In the meantime, they recommended Mucomyst and Bicarb O/N pre-procedure as he has a chronic renal insufficiency.
ROS: He reports fatigue requiring him to sleep approximately 10-12 hours a day.
He has occasional shortness of breath and dyspnea on exhertion.
He denies any epistaxis.
Known RV tumor thrombus since [**8-20**].
# Pulmonary embolism- diagnosed incidentally along with RCC ([**7-19**]), no sx at that time; started on coumadin which was continued until [**2143-8-8**] then changed to Lovenox # Hypertension- on beta blocker # Hypercholesterolemia- on statin # Chronic renal insuffiency- initial creat 1.2-1.5, up to 3.5 s/p surgery and complicated by ATN, most recently 2.1-2.3.
# Type 2 diabetes- on insulin # Peripheral vascular disease # Depression- on mirtazipine and buproprion # Chronic normocytic anemia # h/o colonic polyps # h/o pancreatitis # s/p CCY   Social History: Patient is married, retired manager for [**Company 22957**] Phone Company.
Father died at the age of 51 from myocardial infarction.
He had a sister with type 2 diabetes who died from complications.
Physical Exam: Physical exam: VS 98.4 142/74 9 16 O2Sat 96% RA Gen: NAD, AAOx3 HEENT: PERRLA, dry mm NECK: no LAD, no JVD, no carotid bruit COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, no m/r/g, normal PMI, no hives PULM: CTA b/l, no wheezing or rhonchi ABD: Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt, well healed scar under diaphragms Skin: warm extremities, no rash, no swelling EXT: 1+ DP, no edema/c/c, negative [**Last Name (un) 4709**] sign MS: Mild CVA tenderness mid back and limited movement to [**5-23**] pain NEURO: A and O x 3 and CN II-XII intact.
No decreased sensation of extremities.
There is a patchy airspace process at the right lung base, likely in the middle lobe, not much changed.
There are also number of small nodular opacities elsewhere, likely corresponding to known pulmonary metastases.
However, no new focal airspace process is identified to suggest acute consolidation.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged, with no pleural effusion or other evidence of CHF.
Large area of mismatched hypoperfusion in the right upper lobe with a moderately high risk ratio for pulmonary embolism.
New hemorrhagic lesion, presumably a metastasis in the right frontal lobe, with the multiple hyperintense lesions in the frontal and parietal lobes now more likely representing tumor.
Left-sided arachnoid cyst is unchanged.

Now with new PE per V/Q scan.
Not a candidate for anticoagulation given hemorrhagic mets to brain seen on recent MR .

# Back pain- With hx of known mets to L1 and L2 and now s/p fall.
# CRF: Creatinine has been ranging between 2.2 and 3.0 over the last month in the context of receiving temsirolimus.
Appears slightly dry on exam, no oliguria Hydrated, creatinine 1.8 on discahrge.

Spoke with wife this pm who would appreciate a palliative care consult and discussion of hospice options, maybe for future initiation.
Family and patient aware that given VT, multiple co morbidities including metastatic cancer to heart and brain, multiple VTE with CI to anti coagulation, very high risk to have life threatening event at home.
Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer metastatic to lung, brain, back, heart 2.
Atrial Fibrillation 4.
Ventricular Tachycardia 5.
Hypertension 6.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
Type II DM 8.
Depression   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, taking PO, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: Follow up as below.
As we discussed, if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, change in mental status, fevers, chills or any other new concerning symptoms, call 911.
As we discussed, you are at very high risk of recurrent life threatening arrythmia known as ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation.
The amiodorone is to help decrease the risk of you going into these abnormal rhythms.
