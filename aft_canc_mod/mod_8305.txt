On [**2177-4-16**] he underwent a CT guided biopsy of lung mass and pathology showed squamous cell carcinoma.
He had a brain MRI on [**2177-4-26**] which showed a contrast enhancing left occipital mass.
He denies any seizures, headaches, weakness, numbness or tingling.
The risks and benefits of undergoing surgical intervention were discussed with the patient who now electively presents for a craniotomy.
He is currently unemployed  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Admission physical exam: no focal neuro deficits  Discharge physical exam: -General: AAOx3, pleasant and conversant, NAD -HEENT: occipital sutures C/D/I -Neuro: AAOx3, CN II-XII grossly intact, strength 5/5 all extrem, sensation intact   Pertinent Results: [**2177-5-29**] Head CT without Contrast:  Expected post-surgical changes after resection of left occipital lesion.
[**2177-5-29**] Brain MRI (pre-op): 2.1 x 1.6 x 1.7-cm lesion with broad-based dural enhancing lesion with broad-based dural tail within the left occipital lobe appears most consistent with meningioma.
Post-surgical changes after resection of left occipital lesion with blood prodcuts noted within the surgical bed as well as adjacent extra-axial hematoma and mild adjacent soft tissue hematoma.
Pneumocephalus layering along the left frontal lobe similar to the prior examination.
Slow diffusion along the periphery of the surgical bed may suggest post-op cytotoxic edema versus infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient electively presented and underwent a left occipital craniotomy and resection of mass on [**2177-5-29**].
Surgery was without complication and he tolerated it well.
Post op Head CT on [**2177-5-29**] revealed expected post-operative changes with no evidence of hemorrhage.
Head MRI on [**2177-5-30**] demonstrated post-operative changes with pneumocephalus of left frontal lobe, mild enhancement in upper surgical bed which could represent residual tumor, and post-op cytotoxic edema vs. infarct.
Patient will follow up in brain tumor clinic on [**2177-6-9**] for re-evaluation, particularly given possible residual tumor post-operatively.
