Admission Date:  [**2146-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-12-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: abd pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, [**2146-8-13**]  History of Present Illness: 81 yo male with presumed COPD and recently diagnosed metastatic bladder CA with known left hydronephrosis presents from OSH ED after complaining of abd pain.
At that point, he noted the onset of RLQ abd pain that was non-radiating and intermittently sharp and dull.
He presented to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] where he was afebrile but noted to appear unwell and have an SBP in the 90s with associcated sinus tachycardia.
A CT scan there demonstrated left hydronephrosis and a question of gallbladder distention.
This study did not show gall bladder abdnormalities but did demonstrate extensive hepatic mets.
There was a concern for left sided upper urinary tract infection and urgent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement was advised; this was performed by IR immediately after the pt's arrival to the MICU.
The pt endorsed intermittent hemature but denied recent unintended weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches, dizziness or vertigo.
No changes in hearing or vision, neck stiffness, lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, steatorrhea, melena, hematochezia, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, increasing lower extremity swelling, orthpnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg pain while walking, joint pain.
Past Medical History: multiple papillary bladder tumors --first dx in [**4-18**] --s/p BCG therapy --concern for mets to mid left femur, known extensive liver mets renal stones many years ago s/p left inguinal hernia repair lung nodule concerning for possible malignancy noted on CT scan  Social History: Retired clerical worker.
Family History: No FH of malignancy or other heritable disease.
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM, no lesions noted in OP.
Neck: Supple, no significant JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
Pulmonary: Few crackles at bases bilaterally, no wheezes or rhochi.
Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: Trace edema, 2+ radial and DP pulses b/l Skin: No rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor.
2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar reflexes and 2+ ankle jerks bilaterally.
There is linear platelike atelectasis at the left lung base.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of focal consolidation on this single view.
Innumerable hepatic metastases from bladder cancer.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
No evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation; normal size of CBD.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo male presenting with bladder cancer, found to have abd pain, tachycardia and borderline blood pressure, s/p perc nephrostomy tube drainage of left hydronephrosis, became persistently hypotensive and subjectively dyspneic with a refractory metabolic acidosis.
WBC slightly decreased.
Pt was agressively volume repleted.
#ARF: Pt's baseline somewhat unclear, however SCr was 1.7 at OSH approximately one week ago, further elevated on admission, still further increasing today.
Some baseline renal dysfunction expected given pt's obstruction; suspect that acuity of further obstruction resulting in additional failure.
Pt s/p perc drainage placement and volume repletion.
Developed a refractory metabolic acidosis with resultant tachypnea.
#SOB/question COPD: Pt with extensive smoking history and a question of COPD based on prior imaging.
No has crackles on exam after 5L volume resuscitation in MICU.
Patient became subjectively dyspneic and tachypneic during exams which was summarily relieved by morphine after CMO status.
#Abnormal LFTs/coagulopathy: Likely secondary to extensive hepatic mets.
Likely secondary to worsening hydronephrosis/UTI, although numerous other etiologies were certainly possible.
