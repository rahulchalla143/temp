Admission Date:  [**2174-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-5-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-3-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thorocentesis IR guided permatcath [**5-13**]   History of Present Illness: 72yo M with metastatic squamous cell lung CA s/p chemo, XRT, photodynamic therapy and tumor debulking to obstructing LLL tumor and pleurodiesis for recurrent Left pleural effusion.
In addition, the patient has a history of AFib, HTN, DMII with diabetic nephropathy and emphysema.
The following night, he presented with orthopnea and PND associated with dry cough.
The patient admits to mild chest discomfort.
He was also given 1 SL nitro with resolution of chest discomfort.
Metastatic squamous cell lung CA s/p chemotherapy with [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol, photodynamic therapy for obstructing LLL tumor.
Recurrent L pleural effusion s/p thoracoscopy with talc pleurodiesis on [**2174-3-26**].
HTN 4.
Mild CHF - EF 50-55% by TTE [**9-/2172**], mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypo/akinesis of the basal inferior wall and inferior septum.
Nephrotic Syndrome by renal biopsy [**9-/2173**]   Social History: The patient lives with his wife.
Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: In the ED: VS: 96   119   119/109   20   92% on 5L Gen: elderly male sitting at 90 degress in no respiratory distress HEENT: mm dry, no JVD at 90 degrees, unable to tolerate lying at any lower angle Chest: [**Month (only) **].
[**2174-5-4**] CXR: - IMPRESSION: 1) Worsening asymmetrical alveolar pattern, most likely due to worsening pulmonary edema.
2) Moderate to large loculated left pleural effusion.
3) Stable abnormal appearance of left hilum and perihilar region, in keeping with history of lung cancer."
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal to mid inferior/inferolaterlal hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2172-9-29**], left ventricular systolic function appears similar and mitral regurgitation appears similar."
Left lower lobe consolidation, with air fluid levels concerning for an empyema vs recent procedure.
Moderate sized right-sided pleural effusion.
Loculated left pleural effusion at prior chest tube insertion site.
Diffuse paraseptal emphysematous change bilaterally.
Honeycombing and interstitial air space disease, predominantly within right upper lobe.
Given the acute increase, this most likely represents a pneumonic infiltrate.
Given the asymmetry, congestive heart failure is less likely.
Diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with the patient's history of lung cancer.
Atherosclerotic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 72yo M with squamous cell lung CA s/p chemo, XRT, and photodynamic therapy, recurrent left pleural effusion s/p pleurodiesis, CHF, HTN, Afib, Emphysema, who presents with progressively worsening DOE and hypoxia.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had evidence of both pulmonary edema as well as a primary pulmonary process.
Multiple CT scans noted evidence of PNA, and possible multilobar PNA.
He was admitted to CCU intially for diuresis, and then to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further w/u of his pulmonary process.
He was briefly intubated for hypoxia/respiratory distress s/p extubation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He thorough w/u for infectious etiology of his pulmonary process including right thoracentesis and brochoscopy which did not show etiology of these findings.
Attempts at aggressive diuresis with IV diuretics were unsuccessfull given his Cr in the 3's and known renal disease.
His creatinine began to rise with IV diuretics, and he begun on hemodialysis because of his volume overload and continued hypoxia.
His oxygen requirement continued to decrease to room air currently.
CARDIOVASCULAR:     Coronaries - the patient c/o some atypical chest discomfort on admission, and was noted to have flat CK's but positive Troponins as high as 0.5 in setting of ARF.
He had new EKG's with lat STD's and TWI's at low rates, which became more diffuse at higher heart rates.
He has likely CAD based on focal WMA's on previous and current TTE's.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management of CAD at this time.
Pt was thought to have a component of diastolic dysfunction in setting of CAD, as well as Afib when in RVR.
His Amiodarone was d/c's given his ongoing pulmonary infiltrates and continued Afib despite Amio.
ARF: The patient has very poor basline renal function, with significant renal damage by recent renal biopsy.
This is thought be secondary to nephrotic syndrome b/o diabetes.
After he was started on hemodialysis, it was felt that he would likely require long-term dialysis given his poor baseline.
He likely has local recurrence in the location of his previous treatments, but there is no evidence of current metastasis.
Since his has had an indolent course of tumor progression and since his mortality is unknown, it was decided that his lung cancer not preclude treatment of his other medical issues.
Glipizide was discontinued given his renal failure.
ANEMIA: anemia studies c/w anemia of chronic inflammation, with no evidence of GIB.
Attempts to remove foley were unsuccessful secondary to retention.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 4480**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pulmonary Edema CHF Metastatic Lung cancer Recurrent Pleural effusion DM SCC of skin Emphysema Nephrotic syndrome   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
