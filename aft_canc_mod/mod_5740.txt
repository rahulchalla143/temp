Admission Date:  [**2171-4-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-4-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2104-6-29**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 66 year old male with a history of metastatic parotid cancer, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension who presented to the Emergency Department with the complaint of seven days of fever, lethargy, myalgias and decreased p.o.
He also reported temperatures to 100.0 F., and a mild productive cough ([**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum).
In the Emergency Department, the patient complained of the above symptoms as well as two days of chest tightness which was intermittent that had been associated with diaphoresis.
Finally, the patient's blood pressure decreased to approximately 160/80 with a Nipride drip.
The patient developed agitation in the Emergency Department and was also noted to be febrile to 103.2 F., with rigors.
He also had a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and head in the Emergency Department.
Coronary artery disease with a history of inferior myocardial infarction treated with TPA in [**2162**].
Right adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid gland status post resection without clear margins in [**2159**]; status post XRT in [**2159**]; status post recurrence in the scalp treated with XRT in [**2162**] with a residual right facial nerve palsy; likely recurrence in the skull in [**2167**] with no further treatment due to the tumor being considered quite indolent.
Vitamin D.  ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.
There was a right facial droop which is chronic and a purulent discharge from the right ear.
Neck:  There was nuchal rigidity.
Extremities warm with no edema.
A head CT scan showed no evidence of mass or bleed but did show a defect in the calvarium consistent with a metastatic focus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for bacterial meningitis.
At the time of admission, the patient had marked hypertension and continued to require the Nipride drip.
Due to progressive hypoxia and tachypnea, the patient was intubated and placed on the mechanical ventilator.
His CK rose slightly and he had a troponin leak which peaked at 9.9.
As this was felt to be a demand event (and the patient had an unexplained hematocrit drop), the patient was not heparinized.
The following day, the patient underwent repeat head CT scan with contrast to evaluate for possible abscess or a sinus tract connecting with the cerebrospinal fluid (likely through the metastatic focus near the right ear).
This CT scan showed the developed of new hydrocephalus and possible impending herniation.
It also showed blood or pus in the posterior occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
On the morning of [**4-23**], the patient was noted to have a labile blood pressure, quickly cycling between systolics of 140 and 205.
Pupils were sluggishly reactive and he had an abnormal oculocephalic reflex.
The family decided that they wanted no further interventions and that they wanted further treatment to be focused on comfort measures only.
