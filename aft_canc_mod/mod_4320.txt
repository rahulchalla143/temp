HL, hypothyroidism presented initially at OSH w/ fatigue, insomnia found to be high grade lymphoma.
Admitted to the ICU for CVVH for possible tumour lysis syndrome.
Pt states that 4 weeks ago she noted some jaw pain as well as total body weakness, malaise, "body burning sensation".
4+ bacteria, [**11-28**] WBC were seen on a U/A that was notable for squamous cells.
As part of her work up she underwent a CT torso which showed Left Subclavian node, retroperitoneal adenopathy, L hydronephrosis.
Oncology were consulted given the suspicion for Lymphoma and obtained a BM bx, cytology was obtained from aspirate.
She denies any Etoh, tobacco or IVDU history.
lymphoma or other malignancies  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Fatigued appearing Caucasian Female lying down in bned in NARD HEENT: No scleral icterus, PERRL, EOMI.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema noted.
T cells comprise 72% of lymphoid gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.6.
No abnormal events are identified in the "blast gate."
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa restricted CD10 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
The immunophenotypic profile in concert with the morphologic features of the lymphoma on the bone marrow smear and core biopsy are consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma.
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:  HYPERCELLULAR MARROW ENTIRELY REPLACED BY A HIGH GRADE LYMPHOID TUMOR WITH MORPHOLOGIC AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPIC FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH BURKITT LYMPHOMA (SEE NOTE).
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Peripheral Blood Smear:  Erythrocytes appear decreased in number, and show mild anisocytosis.
There is absolute lymphocytosis.
About 50% of the lymphocytes are medium to large, with an irregular nucleus with prominent one or more nucleoli.
Occasional neutrophil shows hypogranular cytoplasm with unsegmented nuclei.
Differential shows: <1% Blasts, <1% Promyelocytes, <1% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, 4.2% Bands/Neutrophils, <!% Plasma cells, 2.6% Lymphocytes, 1.8% Erythroid, 90% medium size blasts with basophilic cytoplasm with numerous vacuoles.
Lymphoma cells exhibit nuclei with blastic chromatin with multiple nucleoli, and contain moderate amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm.
Special Stains:  Storage iron cannot be assessed due to absence of spicules and erythroblasts (marrow completely replaced by lymphoma  CYTOGENETICS PENDING AS OF [**2133-12-15**]  CXR- IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Low lung volumes  TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
As seen on recent outside hospital CT, several subcentimeter non- obstructing right renal calculi, and mild left hydronephrosis without left renal calculi.
Hydronephrosis is likely related to extensive retroperitoneal soft tissue density mass (likely nodes), seen on the outside hospital CT. 3.
Mild splenomegaly 3.
Incidentally noted, enlarged uterus  CSF ([**12-30**])-  	 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Flow Cytometry ([**1-3**])- Cell marker analysis demonstrates a T cell dominant lymphoid profile and diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
A small population of CD45 (moderate) positive cells is noted comprising 3% of total analyzed cells.
Review of corresponding blood smear showed occasional immature-appearing mononuclear cells, morphologically consistent with blasts.
BM Biopsy ([**1-5**])- - NORMOCELLULAR MYELOID DOMINANT MARROW WITH MYELOID LEFT-SHIFT, MEGAKARYOCYTIC HYPERPLASIA  AND ERYTHROID HYPOPLASIA.
- NO DIAGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF LYMPHOMA SEEN.
Cytogenetics ([**1-5**])- No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
CSF ([**1-15**])- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CSF ([**1-18**])- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Prelim read from Heme-Path suggesteded large cell lymphoma w/ vacuoles suggestive of possible Burkitt's Lymphoma.
The patient began spontaneous tumor lysis prior to induction of chemotherapy.
Pt received Rasburicase for uric acid converion with good response as well as allopurinol.
CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions (L>R).
Concern for methotraxate collecting in pleural fluid leading to persistent neutropenic and poor recovery of counts.
Interventional pulmonary team was consulted and drained 250cc of pleural fluid from left side on [**1-1**].
Repeat BM biopsy and CSF studies showed no disease.
Her symptoms improved daily after IVAC course was completed.
RUE THROMBOSIS: The patient noted right upper extremity swelling.
Ultrasound was obtained, which demonstrated thrombosis in the right brachial and basilic veins.
U/S repeated on [**12-30**] which showed no progression of clot.
PICC line was kept in right arm but was eventually pulled due to VRE-positive cultures (see below).
Diarrhea eventually resolved.
She then developed recurrent diarrhea on [**1-25**] and was empirically treated for C Diff.
She had 2 stool samples negative for C. diff at this time, but was treated with a course of oral vancomycin to be continued after discharge, at least until her next oncology appointment (scheduled for [**2-3**]).
## FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA: She was noted to have a fever in the setting of neutropenia.
She developed a diffuse rash shortly after initiation of antibiotics.
Derm was consulted- performed biopsy which showed "Intraepidermal vesicles and underlying linear track of ischemia with adjacent dermal inflammation with eosinophils".
Her rash was consistent with a drug eruption and cefepime was thought to be the culprit.
Antibiotics were discontinued as patient was afebrile and cultures remained negative.
She again developed fevers on [**1-6**].
Upon discharge, she was no longer neutropenic and afebrile.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Likely due to uric acid stones and urate nephropathy, in additon to hydronephrosis due to external compression by retroperitoneal tumor.
Hematuria: Patient began having hematuria after Foley placement that worsened with initiation of Cytoxan.
She was started on continuous bladder irrigation for concern of hemorrhagic cystitis.
Hematuria eventually resolved as did pain.
It seemed likely that patient passed uric acid stone.
Tachycardia: On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic, likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
She remained tachycardic (95-115) throughout her course here.
She denied chest pain, palpitations, dizziness or syncope.
No dysuria noted, urine appearance likely related to her [**Last Name (un) **].
Anxiety- Patient was quite anxious while here.
She was discharged on PRN clonazepam but if anxiety is a problem in the future for her, she may need to be changed back to standing clonazepam.
Weight was up to 210+ pounds with 3+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
Her weight on discharge was near 170 pounds with no signs of fluid overload on physical exam.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Burkitt's Lymphoma  Secondary Diagnosis: Diarrhea Acute renal failure (resolved)  Discharge Condition: Good.
Vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with altered mental status and confusion.
Start taking Clonazepam 0.5mg three times daily as needed for anxiety  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic.
