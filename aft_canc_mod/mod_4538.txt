She also had an NSTEMI with a peak trop of 0.22 [**2126-11-25**] most likely in the setting of demand ischemia.
She also developed BRBPR during this hospitalization, and was taken to colonoscopy on [**2126-12-3**] which showed a colonic mass which was sent for biopsy.
She returns from rebab with fevers/chills and altered mental status.
She denies having any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

Head CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:[**2126-12-12**] Minimal change with no intracranial hemorrhage and redemonstration of post-operative findings.
Extraluminal collection of fluid and oral contrast in the deep pelvis, concerning for anastomotic leak.
Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations, increased from the previous study.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, unchanged from the comparison studies.11 .
CXR: [**12-12**] New endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube, with the endotracheal tube at the carina and this tube should be retracted.
New mild pulmonary edema.
PUNC ASP ABS HEM BUL CYST Study Date of [**2126-12-12**] IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided drain placement in a left pelvic fluid collection.
Partial transection of the distal left ureter at the L4 level with associated large urinoma in the left flank.
Nondilated pelvicalyceal system secondary to free leakage of urine into the retroperitoneum.
CHANGE PERC TUBE OR CATH W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2126-12-16**] 1.Antegrade nephrostogram demonstrating a persistent leak involving the proximal third of the left ureter in the region of ureteral injury.
No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2126-12-19**] IMPRESSION: 1)New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left causing overlying compressive atelectasis, no consolidation.
2)Multiple calcified granulomas suggest prior granulomatous exposure.
3)Stable right thyroid nodule.
4)Mild enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5)Focal ectasia of the thoracic aortic arch with diffuse ulcerated plaque, unchanged.
Head CT [**2126-12-19**] Minimal change since most recent prior on [**2126-12-12**] with no intracranial hemorrhage or new infarction.
An MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of ischemic changes and is recommended if clinically indicated and if there are no contraindications to the use of MRI in this patient.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7749**] returned to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab secondary to fevers and general malaise.
She was intubated in the ED for hypoxia, ?
She was given Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, 2L IVF, and started on levophed for persistent hypotension.
Seen by Neurosurgery to eval new head CT in setting of altered MS initially.
Fever, elevated WBC and +U/A lead to concern for urosepsis, although other source cannot be ruled out.
No abdominal symtoms to lead to concern for anastomitic leak, although remains on differential.
Hypotension: Septic like picture with fever, elevated WBC, and positive U/A are concerning for urosepsis.
Other sources are adbominal leak (less likely given benign exam) vs. intracranial infection given recent craniotomy.
Hypoxic Respiratory failure: No clear infiltrate or pulmonary edema seen on CXR.
History of recent PE but INR therapeutic so less likely worsening or new embolism.
Possible flash pulmonary edema that is not visible on CXR.
Diuresis was held secondary to hypotenstion and serial abg's were obtained.
CT showed concern for anastamotic leak with extraluminal PO contrast.
The decision was made to hold-off on surgery because on review, the CT finding was c/w abscess from ?
a prior leak and not an active leak.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 7749**] appeared confused at times, a urine sample was sent and it was positive for a UTI.
A repeat head ct was obtained, showing no changes and neurology was called and belived that the cause of confusion was secondary to her UTI.
