On [**2197-4-14**], he underwent an upper endoscopy which demonstrated a pyloric channel ulcer with healed margins, which were biopsied.
At CT of the abdomen and pelvis was completed that demonstrated incomplete mixing of the oral contrast and gastric contents, with moderate gastric distension.
A soft tissue mass in the right inguinal canal was felt to be secondary to prior hernia repair.
He underwent a repeat upper endoscopy that again demonstrated no active bleeding.
Repeat colonoscopy demonstrated large amount of old blood, with difficulty getting beyond hepatic flexure due to view obscured by blood.
He underwent a bleeding scan yesterday ([**2197-4-17**]) that was completed today, which per discussion with [**Hospital1 392**] providers, was positive for distal dueodenal and proximal jejunal bleed.
There was a question of hypotension during colonoscopy and preparation, down to the 80'-90's systolic.
He was reported to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 80-110's.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient reported he was thirsty, but otherwise had no complaints.

No known history of alcohol withdrawal or seizures - Osteoarthritis - B12 Anemia - COPD - Right hip replacement - Status-post hernia repair - Colon polyp [**2191**] - Status-post tonsillectomy   Social History: Patient lives alone.
Family History: Father died at 70 with diabetes and mother at 89 with hypertension and stroke.
He has no brothers or sisters.
Physical Exam: General: Disheveled, in NAD, asking for a drink and internet access.

[**4-18**] Angiography IMPRESSION: No active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or angiodysplasia in the celiac, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territories.
[**4-20**] Colonoscopy Impression: Ulceration and erythema in the descending colon (thermal therapy) Polyp in the descending colon Diverticulum in the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
Continue PPI for ulceration seen on EGD.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema with granularity and erosions with three areas of clean-based ulcerations were seen in the prepyloric region of the lesser curve of the stomach.
No visible vessel or clot was seen.
Impression: Erythema and erosion in the pylorus (endoclip) Blood in the duodenum Blood in the jejunum Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid to distal jejunum Recommendations: Continue to monitor HCT and provide supportive measures with blood products and fluids as needed.
Would proceed to angiography to localize and embolize bleeding source.
Additional notes: The patient's bleeding source is likely distal to the mid-jejunum, as we do not believe the ulcerations in the stomach were the cause of his aggressive GIB given the nature of the lesions.
Multiple Angioectasia (nonbleeding) through the small bowel 2.
Multiple Angioectasia (nonbleeding) through the small bowel 2.
Complete evaluation of the entire small bowel could not be performed as the capsule did not reach the cecum.
URINE CULTURE (Pending):     Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI bleed.
