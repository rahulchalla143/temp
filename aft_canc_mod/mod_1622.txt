Admission Date:  [**2153-5-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-11-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: weakness/malaise, hypotensive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: a-line placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] is a 78 yo male with multiple myeloma who presented with worsening weakness and malaise.
He endorses lower extremity weakness for an extended period of time, however, it became acutely worsened prior to admission, prompting his wife to call his Oncologist on [**Name (NI) 1017**] to request a prescription for a wheelchair.
He spiked fevers as high as 100.7 on the evening of [**5-1**] and to 101.2 on [**5-2**].
On [**5-3**] blood cultures from [**5-2**] were reported to be growing gram-negative rods in [**3-16**] bottles and he was started on ciprofloxacin & metronidazole.
On the morning of [**5-4**], he became hypotensive to 90/doppler with HR 102-104 (previously SBP's 100-120, HR 60-80), and was transferred to the MICU for management of GNR sepsis.
ROS at time of transfer is significant for fatigue and generalized malaise that coincides with the intitiation of radiation and velcade.
He reports decreased appetite for several months and recent "projectile" diarrhea from his ostomy which he attributes to a recent dose of magnesium citrate.
He endorses recent indigestion but denies nausea or vomiting.
He states that his LLE edema is chronic since a LN dissection at age 28.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Multiple myeloma Hyperlipidema Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Chronic renal insufficiency Compression fractures Osteonecrosis of the jaw, [**1-13**] Zomeda Peripheral neuropathy Stoma prolapse Melanoma of left thigh s/p resection and LN dissection at age 28  h/o superior mesenteric vein thrombosis h/o cervical radiculopathy h/o hypercalcemia Insomnia Chronic infected rectosigmoid mesh, s/p removal .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Multiple myeloma, diagnosed in [**2143**], initially presented with a superior mesenteric vein thrombosis as well as a T12 cord compression fracture, acute renal failure, and hypercalcemia.
He continued thalidomide until [**10/2148**] when it was stopped due to debilitating symptoms of ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.
In [**4-/2151**], the Zometa was stopped for concern of right lower jaw osteonecrosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] was off all therapy for his myeloma since that time.
Bone marrow biopsy done on [**2152-10-30**] was notable for a marrow cellularity of 28-30%, interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly and in clusters.
After this first cycle of Decadron he developed an infection in his mouth and lower extremity weakness so he did not start his second cycle until after our last visit.
Family History: Brother died of a metastatic poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary.
Mother died of an MI at age 62.
Abnormal signal and enhancement of the L2 vertebral body is unchanged and again may represent a focus of myelomatous involvement.
Enhancing epidural tissue is again suggested posterior to the L2 vertebral body with extension into the right lateral recess but without apparent involvement of the neural foramina.
Multilevel degenerative changes are stable compared to the studies performed earlier this year.
In essence, no definite cause for recent right lower extremity weakness is seen.
MRI Head [**5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process, intracranial mass or obvious osseous destruction in the visualized calvarium.
Cholelithiasis with gallbladder distention and edema.
Findings are concerning for cholecystitis.
Right lower lobe atelectasis.
Calcified right-sided pleural plaques.
Numerous compression fractures.
Cholelithiasis with associated mild gallbladder wall edema, which could suggest acute cholecystitis.
If persistent clinical concern for pneumonia persists, then a followup PA and lateral radiograph if permissible by patient's clinical status may be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] is a 78 yo male with multiple myeloma who presented with generalized malaise and lower extremity weakness, requiring MICU transfer for E.coli septicemia.
1) E.coli septicemia: Differential for potential sources included GI/diarrheal illness vs. cholecystitis vs. intrabdominal abscess (patient has h/o chronically infected mesh) vs. GU vs. port infection.
A RUQ u/s showed gallbladder wall edema, cholelithiasis, CT abdomen showed gallbladder edema, suggestive of cholecystitis.
No intrabdominal abscess.
HIDA scan subsequently performed, showing evidence of chronic cholecystitis (wall thickening and delayed emptying).
Vanco again briefly added back when he was hypotensive once back on the medicine/BMT floor; this responded to fluids without new positive culture data.
FLagyl stopped at discharge given lack of evidence for its use.
2) Weakness: Patient does have past radiographic evidence of spinous involvement of his disease.
Concern now that weakness could be secondary to CNS involvement of his disease.
Per Neurology consult, his tendency to fall may be due to weakness combined with instability from his severe distal neuropathy +/- radiculopathies from his fractures.
His motor symptoms raise possibility of [**Known lastname **] anterior spinal infact.
Neurosurgery felt no intervention felt to be warranted at this time.
He had EMG showing complex abnormalities including moderate, chronic, generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy that is predominantly axonal with evidence for a superimposed moderate, chronic and ongoing, L2-4 polyradiculopathy on the right.
Both neurology and oncology teams felt that patient needs LP to evaluate for malignant cells in the CSF.
Further treatment deferred in the setting of acute illness.
4) Diarrhea: Patient reports that he historically suffers from constipation and was recenlty started on colace and maalox.
Since beginning this new regimen, he has developed projectile diarrhea from his ostomy.
Potential source of E.coli bacteremia as above.
5) Atrial fibrillation.
Initially supratherapeutic in setting of illness and antibiotic use.
Dx atrial fibrillation 427.31, long term use of anticoagulants V58.61   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 932**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: E.coli septicemia Gait instability .
Chronic cholecystitis Atrial fibrillation Multiple myeloma   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, on PO antibiotics   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with weakness.
We found that you have a bacterial infection of the blood and treated you with antibiotics.
