For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2484**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-10**], there again is evidence of old healed apical granulomatous disease as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
No acute pneumonia appreciated at this time.
PERFORATION, ORDERED WITH NO ORAL CONTRAST Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman with GI bleed and h/o pancreatitis, NPO, febrile REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o perforation of ulcer, no oral contrast CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with GI bleeding and history of pancreatitis and fever.
Dependent atelectatic changes are noted at both lung bases.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are visualized.
Small axial hiatal hernia is visualized.
The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal.
There is mild scarring in the upper pole of both kidneys which is unchanged compared to the prior study.
Both kidneys demonstrate multiple small hypodense lesions which are too small to characterize.
The pancreas contains multiple areas of coarse calcification with parenchymal atrophy and irregular pancreatic duct dilatation, all consistent with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
There is mild intrahepatic and moderate extrahepatic bile duct dilatation with the common bile duct measuring up to 15 mm.This appearnce is stable since mR of abdomen performed in [**2182-1-17**].
The patient is status post cholecystectomy with moderate dilatation of the cystic duct remnant.
The stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel and large bowel appear normal.
No free air is noted within the abdomen and pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric nodes are visualized.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, uterus and adnexa, rectum and sigmoid colon appear normal.
No free air is visualized.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted with grade 2 retrolisthesis of L5 over L4.
No pneumoperitoneum or other signs of bowel perforation is noted.
Unchanged chronic pancreatitis with moderate pancreatic duct dilatation.
Unchanged multiple hypodense kidney lesions and bilateral kidny scarring.
Moderate ascites.
Unchanged moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
Unchanged moderate extrahepatic and mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation since MR of abdomen performed in [**2182-1-17**].
Grade 2 retrolisthesis of L4 over L5 with a small disc bulge at the same level.
The apical fibronodular bilateral opacities are stable.
Interval development of bilateral small pleural effusion is demonstrated, especially between [**3-24**] and [**3-27**], with minimal progression between [**3-27**] and [**3-29**].
There are no focal consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2186-3-29**] 5:35 PM  UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  Reason: assess for thrombus associated with phlebitis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman with left UE phlebitis and GPc in blood REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for thrombus associated with phlebitis INDICATION: Please evaluate for thrombus or phlebitis in a 67-year-old female with left upper extremity swelling.
The left internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, axillary vein, and brachial veins and cephalic vein demonstrate normal compressibility, respiratory variation in venous flow and venous augmentation.
The basilic vein contains an occluding thrombus which starts in the antecubital fossa but does not extend into the deep venous system.
Thrombosis of the distal portion of the left basilic vein with no extension into the deep venous system.
This is consistent with a superficial thrombophlebitis.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-26**], no change.
The lungs are clear with the exception of mild blunting of the costophrenic angles, stable.
Again noted is mild fibronodular scarring or stranding at the lung apices.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erosions of the mucosa were noted in the antrum and stomach body.
The ulcer bed appeared necrotic with pigmented material suggestive of recent bleeding.
Because it was difficult to get a clear view of the ulcer base and vessel, we decided against intervening at present.
Other findings: Pictures could not be obtained due to technical difficulties with the computer.
Impression: Erosion in the antrum and stomach body Ulcer in the proximal bulb Pictures could not be obtained due to technical difficulties with the computer.
Will plan for re-scope on Monday in endoscopy unit after futher stabilization.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema and congestion of the mucosa were noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis.
Duodenum:  Excavated Lesions Two ulcers were seen in the first part of the duodenum.
The first ulcer measures 3cm in diameter with clean base and surrounding edema.
The second ulcer measures 2cm with clean base and surrounding erythema.There was no active bleeding noted.
Other A 1 X 2cm soft submucosal lesion suggestive of lipoma was seen in the second part of the duodenum.
This was not biopsied due to recent bleed.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis (biopsy) Ulcer in the first part of the duodenum (biopsy) A 1 X 2cm soft submucosal lesion suggestive of lipoma was seen in the second part of the duodenum.
This was not biopsied due to recent bleed.
Follow biopsy results and treat if positive for H. pylori.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old F with PMHx of chronic pancreatitis p/w 3 wks of melena, severe hct drop & necrotic duodenal ulcer seen on EGD.
Superficial thrombophlebitis: Septicemia, coagulase negative staphylococcus:  The patient developed Superficial thrombophlebitis at the left brachial IV cath site.
PICC placed after negative culture and after pt was afebrile to continuation of IV antibiotics.
The patient has COPD and CXR showed some changes as above.
Culture grew enterobacter sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
History of chronic pancreatitis - pt has chronic pain and was treated with oxycontin with prn oxycodone.
For depression - thioridazine, fluoxetine and trazodone were continued.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Academy Manor of [**Location (un) 7658**] - [**Location (un) 7658**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute blood loss anemia Gastrointestinal bleeding Hypotension - resolved Superficial thrombophlebitis Septicemia, coagulase negative staphylococcus urinary tract infection, catheter related, bacterial History of chronic pancreatitis History of COPD   Discharge Condition: Stable.
