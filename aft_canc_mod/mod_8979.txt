IMAGING:  Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2126-1-17**] 5:56 PM Final Report INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with fever and hypotension.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified, and there is no pulmonary embolus.
The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or acute abnormality.
Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch and coronary vessels.
The left common carotid artery and the right brachiocephalic artery arise from a common trunk off the aortic arch.
Small lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hila do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
A precarinal node measures 9 mm in short axis.
A right hilar lymph node measures 8 mm in short axis.
There are calcified right hilar and sub-carinal nodes consistent with granulomatous disease.
In the lungs, mild dependent atelectasis is noted bilaterally, without consolidation or pleural effusion.
The tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels There is posterior indentation of the proximal trachea, suggestive of teacheal-malacia..  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: In the caudate lobe of the liver, a 3.5 x 2.5 cm hypodense lesion abuts the IVC, and there is loss of the fat plane between the liver and IVC, concerning for vascular invasion.
The lesion is predominantly hypodense, with no peripheral enhancement, demonstrating somewhat irregular margins.
Additionally, there are tiny hypodense lesions in the upper left lobe and anterior right lobe, too small to characterize.
No other liver lesions are identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The pancreas demonstrates fatty replacement.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis, stones or worrisome renal masses.
There is mild atherosclerotic calcification.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
There is moderate diverticulosis involving the descending and sigmoid colon, without diverticulitis.
The remaining loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no fracture or worrisome bony lesion.
Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
Clear lungs aside from mild atelectasis.
3.5 cm irregular, hypodense lesion in the caudate lobe of the liver, concerning for metastasis.
Abscess is considered less likely, given the absence of gas within the lesion and the absence of peripheral enhancement.
No acute bowel abnormality, or intraperitoneal collection to suggest other source of infection.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
COMPARISON: No prior study available for comparison.
There is no acute fracture.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6, age indeterminate without prior study available for comparison.
At C2-C3, there is small disc-osteophyte complex without canal narrowing or deformity of the thecal sac.
At C4, there is heterotopic bone along the inner surface of the right lamina, which abuts the cord.
At C4-C5, there is mild central disc bulge without narrowing of the canal.
At C5, there is heterotopic bone along the right lamina, which narrows the canal but does not abut the cord.
At C6-C7, there is disc-osteophyte complex with mild narrowing of the canal but no compression of the thecal sac.
No acute fracture.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6, age indeterminate without prior study available for comparison.
Multilevel degenerative change as above may predispose the patient to cord injury in the setting of trauma.
If there is clinical concern and no contraindication, MRI may be obtained for further evaluation.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2115-10-7**], no definite change.
MRI abdomen: FINDINGS: There is a 4.9 x 3.2 cm mass within the caudate lobe which is hypointense on T1-weighted images and slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images.
There appears to be a small vessel running through this lesion (image 22 of series 8).
There are no other focal liver lesions, and there is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
There are bilateral renal parapelvic cysts.
The visualized portions of the gastrointestinal tract are unremarkable, and there is no concerning bone marrow abnormality.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
Enhancing mass within the caudate lobe, highly suspicious for malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of CAD, colectomy for colon CA in [**2115**], melanoma, HTN who presents with fever and relative hypotension.
# Sepsis: Patient admitted initially to MICU with fever and relative hypotension.
Regarding infectious workup: CXRx2 no evidence of PNA, DFA for flu was negative, U/A negative.
Cardiac etiology of hypotension less likely as patient ruled out for MI, and no signs of CHF, however at age [**Age over 90 **] could have AS and vasodilation in the setting of fever/pain could cause hypotension so echocardiogram was done (no AS, see above).
He remained afebrile with resolving leukocytosis on this regimen.
His blood cultures eventually revealed fusobacterium, and suspected source was necrosis within liver mass.
# Syncope: By history appears to have been vasovagal or micturition syncope, but more likely poor cerebral perfusion due to hypotension as it occurred after taking his BP meds in the setting of likely sepsis.
No acute intracranial process.
No acute fracture on spine.
# Liver Lesions: Identified on CT scan and confirmed on MRI, concerning for metestatic disease.
No biopsy or surgical intervention was performed given treatment goals of patient.
# Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 1.3 on admission, and trended down to 0.9 with IVF hydration.
Likely prerenal in the setting of poor PO intake/dehydration prior to hospitalization.
# Hypertension: Lisinopril uptitrated from 10mg to 20mg in the setting of persistent BP's of 150's-160's systolic and 100's diastolic.
Bacteremia, Sepsis 2.
Liver mass 3.
Syncope  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Hypertension 2.
Coronary artery disease 3. s/p Colon cancer 4. s/p Melanoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2126-1-16**] with low blood pressures and fevers.
We also did imaging and found a mass in your liver.
