States previously with only surgeries and mild GERD, but had developed severe, progressive fatigue and malaise for about one week.
He denies any other localizing symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, dyspnea, or chest pain.

PATHOLOGY  Pathology Examination SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: BONE MARROW (1 JAR) [**2135-2-17**] [**2135-2-18**] [**2135-2-23**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21496**]/ttl  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW FOR AGE WITH MILD DYSPOIESIS AND LEFT-SHIFTED MYELOPOIESIS, SEE NOTE.
Review of marrow core biopsy shows focal interstitial areas with left-shifted maturation and clusters of immature cells.
Of note, the patient's original blast phenotype was CD34-, CD117- precluding further immunohistochemical characterization of these immature cells.
The morphologic differential diagnosis includes residual disease versus recovering hematopoiesis.
A CD4 stain highlights scattered small lymphoid cells without definite staining in immature cells.
CD117 staining shows several interstitial clusters of immature myeloid precursors, overall comprising 20% of marrow cellularity.
Erythrocytes are decreased in number, are normochromic, with anisopoikilocytosis including echinocytes, acanthocytes, microcytes, and dacryocytes.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of several cellular spicules.
Erythroid precursors are normal in number and show overall normoblastic maturation; rare erythroid precursor with asymmetric nuclear budding is seen.
Megakaryocytes are present in normal number; occasional abnormal megakaryocytes with disjointed nuclei are seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 1.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone.
Erythroid precursors are normal in number and exhibit mildly megaloblastic maturation.
However, focally maturation is markedly left-shifted with interstitial clusters of immature mononuclear cells noted.
Small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old gentleman with minimal PMH admitted as a transfer from an outside hospital with new diagnosis of AML and concern for tumor lysis and evolving DIC.
# AML: Newly diagnosed with complications of DIC, tumor lysis syndrome and acute renal failure on admission.
Initially treated with leukopheresis, hydration, hydroxyurea and rasburicase, then developed worsening renal failure and was transferred to the ICU for CVVH as discussed below.
# CNS/Leptomeningeal Involvement of CML: During the patient's course he complained of back and leg pain that were thought to be due to neurologic involvement of his AML.
He had a MRI head which revealed leptomeningeal involvement.
# Neutropenic Fevers: His neutropenic course was complicated by persistent fevers due to pneumonia.
He became afebrile ~7 days prior to his counts returning to normal levels.
After resolution of his neutropenia the patient was afebrile for several weeks.
He developed low grade fevers again shortly before discharge and a repeat CXR showed possible ongoing vs slowly resolving PNA.
# Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Patient presented with elevated uric acid, LDH and acute renal failure.
WBC initially improved but DIC & tumor lysis were noted to be worsening.
He also had increased O2 requirement which was thought to be likely multifactorial related to leukemic infiltrate, volume overload, and question of a LLL pneumonia for which patient has been receving vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient had been having relative hypotension on the floor with blood pressures in the 80s to 90s for which patient was triggered twice on floor yesterday, though these have responded well to small (250 mL) fluid bolus x 2.
# Acute Renal Failure: likely due to leukostasis effects from elevated WBC and TLS.
Renal u/s with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
3-mm non-obstructing left renal stone and left parapelvic cyst.
After CVVH his renal function returned to [**Location 213**] and he had no further issues with renal failure.
# Hyperphosphatemia: On [**1-8**] the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] when it was noted that his phosphate level was 11.9 and nephrology thought that urgent dialysis was appropriate.
Patient was also noted to have hypocalcemia as discussed below.
# Hypocalcemia: with hyperphosphatemia as above.
Transient numbness as noted during episode of hypocalcemia.
During his course patient was found to be in mild respiratory distress with a RR in the 30s.
A CTA was done which again revealed pneumonia but no PE.
A TTE was done to evaluate for tamponade and the patient was found to have developed a moderate loculated pericardial effusion but had no signs of tamponade.
His respiratory distress subsequently resolved without new interventions.
A repeat TTE was done to evaluate his pericardial effusion and this was found to be stable, but his EF was now 30%.
Cardioglogy was consulted and it was decided to treat with maximal medical therapy for new heart failure.
- a repeat echo was performed on [**2135-3-1**], results of which were pending at the time of discharge  # Hypoactive Delirium: During his hospital course the patient was found to less interactive and shuttered.
This was initially thought to be due to depression.
A psychiatry consult was obtained and they concluded that the patient had developed a hypoactive delirium.
# Transient Numbness: During hospitalization patient was noted to have perioral numbness, numbness of left face and left hand, and some concern for left facial droop.
Head CT showed no acute abnormality.
# Coagulopathy: This was [**2-22**] underlying DIC secondary to acute leukemia and tumor lysis syndrome.
He had no issues with bleeding and his DIC resolved.
# Transaminitis: Mild, likely due to leukemia, leukostatic effects.
No h/o infectious exposure or mediation effect (Tylenol, etc).
