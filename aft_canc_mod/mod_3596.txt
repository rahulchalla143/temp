Admission Date:  [**2165-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-9-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-8-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: mental status changes, jaundice  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 9973**] is a 64 year old male with metastatic prostate CA (mets to liver, skull), DVT/PE in past now on coumadin, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with weakness and jaundice x 2 days.
He refused food and drink, complaining that he had difficulty swallowing.
He continued to have poor UOP (1x/day) over the next week, developed dizziness and confusion.
He denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
While there he was given Vitamin K x1 for INR 10, lactulose x1 for ammonia 60s.
CT Abd/Pelvis showed hepatomegaly, suggestive of multiple metastatic deposits, patchy sclerotic deposits throughout visualized bony structures c/w metastatic disease.
Moderate ascites.
Physical exam was notable for guaiac positive.
Labs were notable for elevated AST>ALT, t. bili, alk phos, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure.
RUQ US showed no flow seen within the portal vein, suggesting thrombosis.
CV: Tachycardic, nl s1 s2, no m/r/g Lung: Clear bilaterally Abd: Distended, diffusely tender to palpation, no ascites, liver edge palpable 2-3 cm below costal margin Ext: cool to touch b/l upper and lower extremities, trace edema b/l.
Skin: scattered petechiae, ecchymoses along b/l LE.
Nodular, heterogeneous liver consistent with provided history of liver metastases.
2. no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation or cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 64 year old male with history of metastatic prostate CA with hepatic mets, DVT/PE on coumadin presents with acute renal failure, hepatic failure resulting in encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
Clinical picture is likely chronic liver dysfunction due to alcohol (?
alcoholic cirrhosis) and with chronic/subacute portal vein thrombosis resulting in current liver failure and encephalopathy.
EGD on [**9-18**] showed portal gastropathy and AVM which was clipped.
pt continued to have melena, no blood via NG tube.
# Hepatitis/Hepatic failure/mental status: pt remained confused throughout hospital course, felt [**2-1**] encephalopathy.
Mixed picture related to portal vein thrombosis in setting of underlying liver disease (alcoholic hepatitis vs mets?).
No evidence of cholecystitis on initial RUQ US, however now with increasing LFTs and t. bili.
Hepatitis serologies negative.
[**Name2 (NI) **] documented evidence of liver metastases.
Given initial improvement followed by worsening of LFTs and bilirubin, repeated RUQ US to ensure there is now no acalculous cholecystitis.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine from labs on [**9-3**] is 1.4.
Creatinine on admission 1.9.  pt felt likely pre-renal due to dehydration and relative hypovolemia from hepatic failure.
Mild left sided grade 1 hydronephrosis.
no initial concern for HRS, and creatinine stable.
# pulmonary - Right pleural effusion: Noted on CXR on admission.
Likely hepatic hydrothorax.
pt ultimately intubated [**2-1**] worsening mental status for airway protection, though some increasing difficulty maintaining oxygenation, felt [**2-1**] volume overload and abdominal fluid.
# NSVT: Has increasing frequency of ectopy.
# Ascites: Noted on RUQ ultrasound.
# Portal vein thrombosis: Can cause elevated ALT and jaundice in patients with underlying liver disease (in this case mets and EtOH).
Due to metastatic CA.
No anticoagulation due to GI bleed.
On [**9-19**] had tachycardia and agitiation - concern that these were symptoms of withdrawal.
# Metastatic prostate CA: Mets to bone, unclear if mets to liver.
plan was to call OSH to get imaging of metastatic disease.
# Cardiac ## Ischemia: No active issues.
No enzyme bump.
## Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia likely from vasodilation with increasing frequency of ectopy.
## Pump: pt initialy Euvolemic on exam, but noted to have right pleural effusion on CXR.
he became progressively more volume overloaded after intubation [**2-1**] poor mental status.
# Elevated white blood cell count: On admission was slightly elevated with 86% neutrophils with 4% bands.
+lactate, though no evidence of compartment syndrome (bladder pressure 23, but belly soft).
# Hyponatremia: Na on admission 120, resolved with fluid restriction and maintenance fluid.
- Transfuse platelets for <30 as patient is acutely bleeding.
# PPx: Holding anticoagulants at this time due to GIB but ok for pneumoboots, protonix [**Hospital1 **], lactulose as bowel regimen .
No CVL due to agitation.
# Code: initially Full.
