That [**Month (only) 404**], he began to notice difficulty with his L leg and in [**Month (only) 116**] had a lesion of the L femur.
This was resected by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 112**] and pathology was significant for metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma.
He therefore had a head CT on [**2109-2-20**] that showed a 1.3 cm mid brain lesion and he was sent by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29267**] for consult.

Physical Exam: VS: 95.7 90/57 92 23 98% 2L NC GEN: NAD in bed HEENT: sclerae anicteric, EOMI.
Marked increase in the size of the right adrenal lesion, multiple new pulmonary nodules, multiple new regions of nodularity within the omentum and peritoneum are all suggestive of marked disease progression.
New ascites in the abdomen likely relates to new ventriculoperitoneal shunt which is in place.
New small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 M with metastatic RCC presenting with w/ CP/FTT/abdominal pain, found to have hypoNa, hyperK, low bicarb.
# hypoNa, hyperK, NG acidosis - originally concerned that this was [**2-22**] rapid withdrawal of prednisone resulting in adrenal insufficiency, pt not frankly hypotensive on admission, and was treated with dexamethasone in the ICU.
After arriving on the medical service, pt noted to have SBPs 90s/60s, but responded well to 500cc fluid bolus.
recurrent hypotension again [**5-1**] and [**5-2**], responds to 500cc fluid boluses.
a renal consult was obtained [**5-1**], and per recs, pt's labs were felt suggestive of SIADH [**2-22**] brain mets vs RTA.
# mental status - pt a&ox3, though frequently lethargic.
# abd pain/oncology - CT TORSO obtained in light of RUQ pain on admission to medical floor which revealed substantial disease progression as detailed in report above, including enlargement of adrenal mass.
# Diarrhea- resolved upon arrival to medical service, culture data unremarkable.
# Ronchi- ?bronchitis on initial presentation, though no evidence of pneumonia on CT scan, pt with stable O2 sats, started on MDI inhaler prn for SOB or wheezing.
