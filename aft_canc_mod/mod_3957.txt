Admission Date:  [**2197-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2148-7-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Acute mental status change  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VP shunt placement   History of Present Illness: 48 yo woman who has hx oligodendroglioma, thyroid dz, GERD, HTN, depression, urinary incontinence, who initially presented to the ED with altered mental status on [**5-2**].
Per ONC H and P, patient had  had worsening new tremor for the past few weeks along with weakness in her legs.
MRI of head done day of admission showed multiple intraparencymal masses in the right frontal/temporal lobes with vasculogenic edema, increased in size compared to [**4-10**]; with increased mass effect and shift; new hydrocephalus.
There was also findings of leptomeningeal spread and new enchancing tumor in the (R) hypothalamus.
Neurology also saw patient, agreed with poor prognosis, and concurred that the hydrocephalus was from the tumor entering the ventricles.
They also noted (B) mild papilledema.
On [**5-7**] had 2 Head CTs; the second showed a 4.1 x 3.3 cm right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated slight worsening in regional mass effect with shift of the falx approximately 6 mm to the left and effacement of the adjacent portion of the suprasellar cistern.
This was thought to represent bleeding into the tumor.
Had urgent repeat Head CT [**5-8**] showed large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring approximately 3.8 x 3.2 cm,  unchanged in size compared to [**2197-5-7**]; however, the overall density of this region has increased suggesting ongoing hemorrhage.
The amount of intraventricular blood in the right lateral ventricle has increased.
Dilatation of the supratentorial ventricular system has increased.
Currently the patient denies HA, N, V, or blurry vision but intermittently non-sensical speech.
She had new edema at that point in the right frontotemporal area and area of new enhancement ant/sup temporal lobe, R frontal.
Family History: n/c  Physical Exam: T 98.4 HR 78 BP 143/84 RR21 93-95 RA General: laying in bed, (B) upper extremity tremor, confused HEENT: pupils equal in size but pt will not cooperate with penlight exam, EOM grossly intact Heart: RRR s MRG Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: 3-4 cm well-healed scar in RUQ; soft, NABS, NT/ND Ext: no edema Neuro: CN as above, Motor strength grossly intact, Alert to person, place (knows its [**Hospital1 18**]), year?
Multiple intraparenchymal masses in right frontal and temporal lobes with vasculogenic edema, overall increased in size compared to the prior study, with increased mass effect and shift of normally midline structures.
New enhancing tumor in the right hypothalamus.
No pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
CT Head [**5-2**]: Overall, stable appearance of the tumor and edema in the right frontal lobe as compared to [**2197-4-10**].
Small amount of mass effect on the suprasellar cistern is also unchanged.
Head CT [**5-7**]: Interval placement of a VP shunt through a new craniotomy in the right frontal skull with tip terminating in the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Again seen are some foci of hyperdensity in the inferior aspect of right frontal lobe, possibly representing hemorrhage.
Head CT [**5-7**]: 4.1 x 3.3 cm right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated slight worsening in regional mass effect with shift of the falx approximately 6 mm to the left and effacement of the adjacent portion of the suprasellar cistern.
KUB [**5-7**]: Supine frontal views of the chest and abdomen and lateral view of the abdomen are submitted.
There is no evidence of intestinal obstruction or mass effect.
Head CT [**5-8**]:  Increased dilatation of the supratentorial ventricular system and increased intraventricular blood compared to [**2197-5-7**].
The overall size and configuration of a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage associated mass effect are unchanged; however, the increased density of this right frontal hematoma suggests continued hemorrhage.
A PICC line was placed by Interventional radiology because patient has very difficult access and requires multiple IV medications for her comfort.
She was left on her antiseizure medications and Decadron per the family's request to prevent ongoing seizures, but otherwise all other medications except those intended to maximize the patient's comfort were discontinued.
