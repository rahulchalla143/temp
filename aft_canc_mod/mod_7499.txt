She also reports cough productive of brown sputum over this period of time.
She denies any fevers, chills or night sweats.
She had no chest pain, diaphoresis, or headache.
She also had decreased PO intake over the past week.
She had been using her inhalers at home with only minimal relief.
The shortness of breath has been progressive and worsened with any exertion to the point where she became dyspneic while eating her cereal this morning.
She was given 500cc NS for low blood pressure with good response to systolic 100-110.
She was given albuterol and ipratroprium nebulizers with symptomatic improvement in shortness of breath.
CXR showed new LLL opacity concerning for PNA with adjacent parapneumonic effusion.
Consideration was given to CTA to rule out PE, however given patient's acute renal failure and low suspicion for PE the study was deferred for now.
She has no chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness.
She is speaking in full sentences without difficulty.

CV: Regular rate and rhythm, soft [**1-23**] holosystolic murmur at the apex without radiation.
Pulm: Scattered rhonchi diffusely with decreased breath sounds at the LLL.
Microbiology: ============= Blood culture ([**2154-6-11**]): No growth Pleural fluid ([**2154-6-11**]): No growth [**2154-6-11**]  PLEURAL FLUID GRAM STAIN (Final [**2154-6-11**]): 1+ (<1 per 1000X FIELD): POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Imaging: ========  CXR ([**2154-6-11**]): New left lower lung opacity concerning for pneumonia with adjacent parapneumonic effusion.
CXR ([**2154-6-12**]): In comparison with the study of [**6-11**], there is little change.
The degree of left effusion cannot be evaluated since the outer aspect of the image on this side has been excluded.
Right basilar opacification persists.
CXR ([**2154-6-23**]):  As compared to the previous examination, there is no major change.
The pre-existing areas of parenchymal consolidation that presumably represent pneumonia are unchanged in extent and distribution.
Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion as described above.
However, there is a patch of consolidation/atelectasis within the left upper lobe, which cannot be further characterized for underlying neoplasm given the collapse and inability to administer IV contrast.
Emphysema with interstitial lung disease and calcified pleural plaques, probably asbestos related.
CT Head ([**2154-6-24**]):  No definite intracranial metastatic lesions.
Please note that the non-contrast technique of this head CT is significantly limited for assessment of intracranial metastatic disease.
If the patient cannot tolerate MR imaging with gadolinium due to implanted pacemaker/defibrillator or for other reasons, further evaluation with contrast-enhanced head CT is suggested as this is a more sensitive means of evaluation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

ICU Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with hypoxia and a new infiltrate on CXR.
She was admitted to the ICU due to fluid-responsive hypotension while in the ED.
Cultures of the blood and pleural fluid were without growth at the time of transfer to the floor, but as per below the cytology was later found to be positive for malignant cells.
LLL Pneumonia (community acquired and likely obstructive) with effusion and hypoxia.
She was started on Zosyn on [**2154-6-20**] after CXR showed a new R base pulmonary infiltrate.
She continued to receive nebulizers with albuterol and atrovent q 6 hours and frequent incentive spirometry.
As the patient remained afebrile and WBC was trending down, antibiotics were stopped on [**2154-6-25**] (for a total of 5 days of Zosyn).
Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT ordered for further evaluation of showed no metastases outside the lungs.
Head CT without contrast also showed no metastases.
No endobronchial lesions were noted, but a large amount of mucus was removed from the L bronchus.
Seen by oncology who felt it was stage IIIB vs IV.
No surgical intervention as no clear mass.
No xrt at this time as no symptoms to improve.
Her weight continued to creep up even with multiple pleural taps and she had early satiety so her furosemide was restarted at 20mg.
Hypotension on admission: Treated by holding Imdur and Valsartan.
COPD - Wheezing was prominent for several days.
CHF - lasix was on hold for hypotension & inc creat after lasix 20 mg IVP x's 1 on [**6-15**].
Lasix 10 mg IV was given on [**6-19**] and [**6-20**] for increased congestion with moderate output and subsequent rise in BUN/Cr.
CAD, s/p MIs & CABG, chronic Troponin elevation (~0.04), has ICD : The pt was continued on ASA, beta blocker dose was decreased due to hypotension.
Had one episode of SBP to 160 on day of discharge.
Nausea and vomiting, long-standing (years)in AM without weight loss:  Has worsened with constipation.
Had severe cramping after lactulose and dulcolax po.
CT abdomen with diffuse stool but no obstruction.
Her symptoms improved after several bowel movements.
No further nausea after relief of constipation.
Osteoarthritis - followed by pain clinic and had injections, currently minimal pain at rest (L knee), some L knee pain with ambulation.
Stopped any meds contributing to constipation including calcium.
Hyperlipidemia: Her Statin was stopped as inpatient in setting of persistent nausea and new NSCLC.
Anemia -  baseline Hct ~33%, has been as low as 28 on [**6-23**] after IVF.
Anemia profile not consistent with either chronic disease or iron deficiency.
She was not prepared to discuss as she was dealing with the new diagnosis of NSCLC.
PO daily prn as needed for constipation.
