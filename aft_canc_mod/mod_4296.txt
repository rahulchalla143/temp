Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transfered from an Outside Hopsital and admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2177-3-12**] for further evaluation and treatment of a newly discovered ulcerating ampullary mass on ERCP at the OSH.
Given his history of BPH and urethral stricture, Urology was consulted to place a foley catheter.
On [**2177-3-13**], the patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which showed massively dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts.
There was complete obstruction at the distal CBD level with no contrast flow noted into the duodenum.
Cardiology was consulted for pre-operative clearance.
On [**2177-3-14**], a CTA pancreas protocol was completed, which confirmed the ampullary mass with adluscent duodenal involvement.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes or vascular involvement.
Marked dilated pancreatic and common bile ducts.
On [**2177-3-19**], the patient underwent open cholecystectomy, pylorus-preserving Whipple resection, jejunostomy tube placement, and reduction of left inguinal hernia, which went well without complication (see Operative Note).
He was NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, J-tube to gravity, JP drain to bulb suction, and capped PTC in place, and he received a dose of intra-thecal Morphine for pain with good effect.
On POD#2, the patient was transferred to the inpatient floor, but was returned to the SICU that same day for an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension, which did not respond to Metoprolol IV alone.
Neuro: Once the intra-thecal Morphine timed out, the patient received Dilaudid IV PRN for post-operative pain with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV: History of HTN and valvular heart disease secondary to mild aortic stenosis.
Post-operatively, expereinced recurrent episodes atrial fibrillation, requiring transfer to the SICU twice for management of atrial fibrillation on [**2177-3-21**] and [**2177-3-26**].
At discharge, atrial fibrillation and HTN were controlled on Amiodarone 400mg PO BID.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The NG Tube was initially discontinued on POD#3, but replaced on POD#5 and POD#8 due to recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.
Tubefeeds were temporarily held when patient experienced nausea and vomiting, otherwise the Fibersource [**2-27**] strenth continuous tubefeed was advanced to a goal of 80mL/Hr with good tolerability.
The percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter, which had been placed in the dilated common bile duct on [**2177-3-13**], remained capped.
An abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast performed on [**2177-4-2**] showed a number of small fluid collections extending from the porta hepatis and near the ruox limb, but was otherwsie unremarkable.
The foley catheter, placed by Urology due to his history of BPH and urethral stricture, remained in place at discharge.
ID/INTEG: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care: Middle apsect of the subcostal transverse incision was opened, and saline wet-to-dry dressings started on POD#11.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating clears for comfort and continuous tubefeeds via the J-tube, ambulating with 2 person assist, voiding via foley catheter, the JP to bulb suction, and pain was well controlled.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Obstructive jaundice.
Atrial fibrillation.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Incision Care:  *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
J-Tube Care:  *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
