She is s/p a laproscopic right nephrectomy on [**2192-1-2**] due to a right renal mass noted on MRI.
On [**1-4**], she became acutely hypotensive, vitals at the time were: T 99.4, BP 72/48, HR 95, 02sat 90 on 2L with low UOP 5-10cc/hr.
She then became hypoxic with escalating 02 req (95% on 5L).
She was given lasix 80mg IV, po mucomyst, placed on a non-rebreather and had a PE protocol CT. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was managed temporarily on BiPap, but never required intubation, and was started empirically on vancomycin and zosyn for likely aspiration pneumonia.
Her O2 requirements were weaned, and she remained afebrile with stable blood pressures.
Surgical pathology from nephrectomy consistent with oncocytoma with atypical features (extensive invasion into fat).
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: CKD stage VI [**2-25**] LI toxicity w secondary hyperPTH right renal mass x 2 gout HTN asthma GERD Bipolar D/O .
PSH: ureteroscopy, removal of tumor on back of knee, CCY, cone bx   Social History: no smoking, no etoh, no IVDU  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 97.1 BP:76 /43 HR:102 RR:18 O2sat 95 on NRB GEN: appears tired, mildly confused.
CV: tachycardic, reg rhythm, no murmurs ABD: 3 post-surgical scars, stapled, dry, intact.
Limited study but no main or lobar pulmonary embolus.
Partial right lower lobe atelectasis and left basilar atelectasis.
Given the history of malignancy this is concerning for metastasis and further evaluation with PET-CT can be performed.
Nodular right apical opacity with surrounding ground-glass halo.
In the absence of infectious symptoms, considerations would include bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma and hemorrhagic metastasis.
If there is a history of immunocompromised or infectious symptoms fungal infection such as aspergillosis should be considered.
EKG - [**1-4**] - Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Presence of ST-T wave abnormalities cannot be ruled out.
No enhancing brain lesions or acute infarcts seen.
Although no obvious bony or soft parenchymal metastatic disease is identified, direct correlation with PET scan would help for better assessment if clinically indicated.

Renal mass: Pathology returned as oncocytoma with atypical features.
OSH PET scan reportedly showed some brain enhancement.
Also, CTA demonstrated R apical nodular apical opacity concerning for metastatic disease.
An MRI was obtained of the head to eval for previously mentioned PET lesions however no focal lesions were seen on our study here.
In regards to the patient's oncocytoma, these lesions are generally considered benign however she will need close follow up in the future with urology.
PNA:  The patient developed a likely left retrocardiac pna while in the ICU that was initially treated with vanc and zosyn and subsequently switched to levaquin, renally dosed.
She was afebrile at the time of discharge and will continue on levaquin for 10 days.
Bipolar d/o-patient had no evidence of mania during the hospitalization and was continued on her prior regimen.
Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for anxiety.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: oncocytoma s/p nephrectomy ARF on HD pneumonia bipolar disorder   Discharge Condition: stable, no oxygen requirement, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with ARF and found to have an oncocytoma which was removed with your right kidney.
You were found to have nodules on your chest CT scan and will require a follow up CT in [**2-26**] months.
