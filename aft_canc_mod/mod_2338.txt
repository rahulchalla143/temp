Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 77 yo woman w/ h/o CAD, s/p CABGx4, PVD s/p stent, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia presents with chest pain and SOB x2 days, off and on.
Also feeling "exhaustion" with minimal exertion.
Similar to her anginal type pain.
She says the pain has been coming and going intermittently during the last two days, sometimes occurring at rest.
Typically her pain is relieved with nitroglycerin.
She presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital night of [**8-20**] because the pain had worsened and was not resolving with 3 SL nitro and an ASA.
Her EKG showed ST depressions in the lateral leads (I, aVL, and V4-V6).
There was ST elevation in lead aVR.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management.
At time of arrival to CCU, she is CP free.
Of note, she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with an NSTEMI in [**2157-4-24**] and underwent catheterization with BMS placed to a 90% stenotic but protected LM.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi3 flow.
She says that after this procedure she was CP free for several weeks, but believes that her anginal symptoms have worsened progressively since.
Endorses lower extremity edema; sleeps on one pillow at night; denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
No new cough.
No melena or hematochezia.
No fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss of which she is aware.

Physical Exam: VS: T97.6, HR 68, BP 153/46, O2 98% 2L NC GENERAL: elderly woman, hearing impaired, NAD HEENT: NCAT, pupils constricted, mildly dysconjugate gaze, NECK: JVD 2-3cm above clavicle at 45 degrees CARDIAC: RRR, no M/R/G LUNGS: Bibasilar rales, otherwise clear breath sounds ABDOMEN: softly distended, no masses, no rebound no guarding.
CT Head: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema mass, or recent infarction.
If acute infarct is a consideration, MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4639**]n-weighted imaging is the most sensitive modality.
ECHO [**2157-8-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2157-8-21**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided pleural effusion has almost completely resolved.
A small right-sided pleural effusion has newly occurred.
There is unchanged cardiomegaly with signs of mild overhydration.
Focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of recent pneumonia are not seen.
The sternal wires and clips after bypass surgery are unchanged.
Cardiac Cath (logged only, not official): LMCA - patent stent LAD - total occlusion ostial.
Mild luminal irregularity.
LCx - total occlusion mid vessel.
SVG - RCA patent with serial 50-60% lesions LIMA 0 LAD - widely patent   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo woman h/o CAD, s/p CABGx4, PVD s/p stent, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia presents with chest pain and SOB x 2 days concerning for unstable angina.
EKG shows ST-segment depressions in the lateral leads concern of stent re-stenosis.
Continue CAD prevention.
Chest pain could be secondary to demand ischemia related to anemia.
Consider increasing hematocrit with procrit as outpatient.
Consider increasing hematocrit using procrit.
# PUMP: Mildly elevated JVD, bibasilar rales, and elevated BNP.
No echo in system.
# Hypertension: Poorly controlled, SBP ranged from 137-161.
# Anemia: Normocytic, elevated Ferritin, most likely anemia of chronic disease.
Continue outpatient procrit injections q-weekly, try to increase baseline HCT due to demand ischemia.
