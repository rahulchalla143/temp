Admission Date:  [**2169-1-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-1-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-6-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP [**2169-1-6**] PICC line placement [**2169-1-9**]   History of Present Illness: 83 year old female with a history of biliary obstruction due to tumor with metal stents presenting to an OSH on [**1-3**] with an episode of weakness/incontinence found to have polymicrobial bacteremia/sepsis.
On [**2169-1-2**] she was being assisted to the bathroom by her husband and became acutely weak and incontinent of urine.
A CT of the abdomen demonstrated persistent biliary dilatation concerning for stent obstruction.
There were also questionable liver lesions with decreased enhancement surrounded by increased enhancement concerning for abscess.
She is afebrile and clinically stable on transfer.
Currently, she complains of irritation by the Foley, but denies headache, blurry vision, dry mouth, thirst, difficulty/pain with swallowing, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, heartburn, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation (though notes no BM in 1 week), new weakness, numbness or tingling.
-Diabetes mellitus, type 2 -Hypertension -Coronary artery disease -Parkinson's disease -diastolic CHF -Vaginal Carcinoma -s/p Cholecystectomy -Urosepsis d/t E. coli and Proteus -Bacteremia due to VRE in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of Linezolid -Bacteremia due to E. coli in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of Ceftriaxone.
-Atrial fibrillation -Hyperlipidemia  Social History: lives with husband in [**Name (NI) 3320**] no children.
Dependent for ADLs--has VNA and husband cares for her, no tobacco or drugs, occassional alcohol.
Resp: CTA-ant/lat Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended + BS Ext: [**1-6**]+ LE edema B. Neuro: CN II-XII intact.
Skin: warm/well perfused, several dry patches, no rash, no jaundice.
Area L hip bandaged for superficial pressure ulcer.
CXR: vascular congestion in right upper lung, unchanged since [**1-3**] without active lung disease.
CT abd/pelvis ([**1-3**]): double biliary stent catheter in place with evidence of continued biliary obstruction throught the liver--not improved.
Liver shows areas of decreased enhancement in posterior right lobe and in the anterior left lobe with no definite mass effect seen suspicious for possibility of infections at that site.
In the anteriormost portion of the left lobe, a low area of decreased enhancement surrounded by increaseed enhancement extend over a diameter of 2 cm which could represent early formation of an abscess even though no clear-cut abscess is definitely identified.
Large amount of retained stools in rectum compatible with fecal impaction.
CT head without contrast: no actue abnormality identified, sinus disease and left mastoiditis.
Small vessel disease  ECGs: [**1-2**]: Sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm with PACs, TWI in III, no ST changes.
Q waves in II/III/aVF [**1-3**]: NSR, axis change from [**1-2**] [**1-4**]: AF with RVR, maintained axis change from [**1-2**] [**2169-1-5**]: NSR, normal axis (same as [**1-4**]), normal intervals, TWI V1-V4 (new), biphasic T waves V5-V6, poor baseline d/t Parkinson's tremor but otherwise, no ST changes.
Cardiac Echo [**2169-1-6**]: IMPRESSION: Normal left and right ventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Evidence of elevated left sided filling pressures.
ERCP [**2169-1-6**]: Biliary Tree: There were multiple filling defect that appeared like sludge in the upper third of the common bile duct, right main hepatic duct and left main hepatic duct,within the metallic wallstents.
Procedures: Multiple stone fragments and sludge were extracted successfully using a 11 mm balloon.
No DVT of the right lower extremity.
Probable thrombus of a deep vein of the left calf, likely one of the paired posterior tibial veins.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement consistent with cholangitis.
Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple abscesses.
Vague region of parenchymal enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts could represent obstructive tumor mass, but its margins are difficult to define.
Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
While it is too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion.
[**2169-1-10**] CPK 10  AST 26  ALT 6  AlkPh 135  Tb 1.4   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis presented with biliary sepsis.
# Sepsis/Biliary obstruction/Liver abscesses: At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial bacteremia, with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC, and VRE from blood cultures.
Source is biliary, with additional concern for liver abscess on CT scan.
The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the left lobe.
The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).
# Diarrhea Patient was noted to have ongoing loose stools for which patient has a flexiseal.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: Discussion with family to clarify goals of care revealed that patient is not planning on surgery or chemo/XRT given extremely poor prognosis of cancer.
# Atrial fibrillation: Paroxysmal.
# Left lower extremity DVT: The patient was noted to have right>left lower extremity swelling so lower extremity dopplers were obtained which showed a probable thrombus of a deep vein of the left calf, likely one of the paired posterior tibial veins.
# Diastolic CHF/ECG changes: The patient had a positive single troponin value at the OSH and 2 measured/elevated BNP levels.
Has LE edema and is on chronic Lasix at home.
ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrated a change in axis and co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant notes.
ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintainance of new axis since [**1-2**]--cycled enzymes; Trp 0.05 but CK-Mb remained negative.
A TTE was obtained which showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
She remained NPO until [**2169-1-9**] when Speech and swallow cleared patient for modified diet.
Continue Q8 oral care.
# Parkinson's Disease: She was continued on Sinemet.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 169**] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: # Biliary sepsis # Biliary obstruction # Liver abscesses # Cholangiocarcinoma # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation # Left lower extremity DVT # Chronic diastolic CHF # Parkinson's disease   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical attention if you develop fevers, chills, changes in mental status, abdominal pain, or any other concerns.
