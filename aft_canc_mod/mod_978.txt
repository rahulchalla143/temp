ESCHERICHIA COLI.
There are new bilateral moderate pleural effusions as well as increasing diameter of the pulmonary vasculature.
Together with the also newly occurred retrocardiac atelectasis and the moderate cardiomegaly, overall moderate pulmonary edema is present.
No evidence of pneumonia.
[**2-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2103-9-12**] and [**2-18**] at 10:48 a.m.: Since yesterday moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved, while moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
Left lower lung remains largely airless and should be reevaluated after patient's cardiovascular situation has improved.
Heart size is chronically and severely enlarged, with particularly large left atrium and dilated pulmonary arteries.
No pneumothorax.
[**2-20**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-19**], there is substantial change, most likely related primarily to the upright technique.
Substantial pleural effusions are seen bilaterally, more prominent on the left.
There is increased opacification in the retrocardiac area, consistent with volume loss involving the left lower lobe.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
[**2-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing partial left lower lobe atelectasis has almost completely resolved.
There is only mild retrocardiac atelectasis on today's image.
The pre-existing minimal right pleural effusion could have slightly increased in extent.
The preexisting cardiomegaly with slightly enlarged pulmonary arteries and increased diameter of the peripheral pulmonary vessels, indicative of mild-to-moderate fluid overload, is unchanged.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities .
[**2-23**] LENI: IMPRESSION: No left lower extremity DVT.
If there is persistent concern for calf vein DVT, a repeat study of the calf veins could be performed tomorrow.
R hip arthroplasty.
[**2-18**] EGD: Impression: Internal & external hemorrhoids Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyp in the rectum Polyps in the whole [**Last Name (un) 22332**] Stool in the whole colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: A number of polyps were found throughout the colon.
None were removed or biopsied in the setting of the elevated PTT and recent GI bleed.
[**2-18**] EGD: Impression: Erythema in the whole stomach compatible with mild nodular gastritis Normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Colonoscopy [**2-19**]: Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyps in the rectum Polyp in the 25 cm (sigmoid colon) No sources of active bleeding was noted on this exam.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 88 F with history of afib on dabigatran admitted to hospital for GI bleed, transfered to MICU for hypoxemia in setting of sedation for EGD/colonoscopy, found to have increased pulmonary edema and diuresed with lasix.
# Hypoxemia/acute diastolic heart failure- Pt reportedly de-saturated to 85% on RA shortly after getting fentanyl 50 and versed 1.5mg prior to planned EGD/colonoscopy, also had report of breathing "slowly" during this episode.
Differential included medication induced hypoventilation leading to hypoxemia, though acute on chronic CHF in setting of aggressive volume resuscitation with multiple units of RBCs resulting in acute pulmonary edema is also possible.
TRALI also on the differential, but timing of hypoxemia is >6 hours after last transfusion, so was much less likely.
A-a gradient from ABG in MICU was ~72, which shows that her hypoxemia was not purely from hypoventilation, though it could be combination of volume overload, atelectasis and hypoventilation.
Her repeat CXR showed improved pulmonary congestion, and patient was continued on diuretic therapy.
She did well on this therapy and was on room air without any pulmonary symptoms.
# GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Pt with black stool x 3 weeks and maroon stool x 1 week in setting of dabigatran.
EGD showed no active bleeding or obvious source for bleeding, though it did show some gastritis and pt was started on PPI therapy.
Given poor colonoscopy prep, no obvious source of bleeding was seen but lower GI bleed could not be ruled out.
Repeat colonoscopy revealed hemorrhoids and diverticulosis without evidence of active bleeding.
Repeat capsule was placed endoscopically and preliminary read does not show any mass or evidence of bleeding.
However, IV heparin transition to dabigatran was performed without any evidence of GI bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
At this time, source of GI bleeding unfortunately remains unclear.
Perhaps old blood from diverticular bleed?
# Atrial Fibrillation/R.brachial artery embolism history of afib and right brachial artery embolism s/p thrombectomy.
She was monitored on telemetry for RVR while holding atenolol, but her digoxin was continued.
Discussion with GI and patient's outpatient cardiologist was held re: plan for future anticoagulation and rate control and patient was transitioned back to dabigatran via IV heparin after it was certain that there was no further evidence of GI bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
Cardiology recommended an off label dosing of dabigatran 75mg TID, to potentially decrease her risk of further bleeding.
In addition, atenolol dose was decreased to 25mg daily with good effect and no evidence of RVR.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient's baseline platelet count is 96-255.
Thrombocytopenia was monitored especially while patient was receiving heparin therapy and remained relatively stable.
# EKG changes: patient with ST segment and T wave changes on admission to MICU, concerning for demand ischemia in setting of hypovolemia and acute anemia.
UCX returned with ecoli sensitive to ctx.
