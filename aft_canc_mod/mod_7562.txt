Bone marrow core biopsy [**4-7**]-     Relapsed precursor B- acute lymphoblastic leukemia MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Red blood cells are reduced in number, normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including occasional macroovalocytes and spherocytes seen.
Large granular lymphocytes are seen.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of hypercellular spicules with sheets of blasts.
It consists of a 0.6 cm core biopsy of trabecular marrow with focal aspiration artifact with an overall cellularity of 70%.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature mononuclear cells consistent with blasts occupying 70-80% of overall marrow cellularity.
These blasts are medium-sized with small amount of cytoplasm, oval to irregular nuclei with moderately fine chromatin and distinctive nucleoli.
Opacification in the juxtamediastinal region above the right hilus could be due to either mediastinal widening or a new lung lesion.
There is also a suggestion of consolidation at the right lung base medially.
Left lung is grossly clear and there is no pleural effusion.
Slow progression right middle lobe consolidation over three months, probable low-grade infection, and a different pathogen than multiple small lung nodules, some cavitated, which have not changed over the same period of time.
Middle lobe lesions should be accessible to bronchoscopic sampling from a division of the medial segment of the right middle lobe.
No gross evidence of malignancy, large goiter, showing less severe tracheal narrowing than previously.
Unexplained marrow infiltrative disorder, sternal manubrium, radiographically stable for at least a year.
Increased small-to-moderate layering non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion.
No evidence of tamponade.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-12-4**], no change (very small pericardial effusion was seen on prior).
CT sinuses [**4-13**]- There is mild to moderate mucosal thickening and aerosolized secretions in the bilateral maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses.
There is also mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.
There are no air-fluid levels.
There is no high-density material.
There is no bony erosion or sclerosis.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate mucosal thickening in all paranasal sinuses.
No fluid levels, high-density material or bony erosions to ongoing infection.
Renal ultrasound [**4-14**]- The left kidney measures 11.5 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis.
No renal stone identified.
There is a small simple cyst in the left kidney measuring 1.4 x 1 x 1.6 cm, unchanged.
There is enlarged prostate roughly measuring approximately 4.5 x 4 x 4.8 cm.
Prostatic enlargement.
MRI right leg [**4-14**]- No significant interval change in the appearance of the bilateral calves, including the right anterior knee skin lesion.
No rim-enhancing collection to suggest an abscess and no evidence of osteomyelitis.
No acute intracranial process.
Mild inflammatory disease involving the sphenoid and anterior ethmoidal air cells, and incompletely visualized maxillary sinuses, bilaterally; correlate clinically.
No acute abnormality seen within the brain.
The previously seen FLAIR and T2 hyperintense foci in the subcortical white matter are unchanged compared to study on [**2133-2-15**].
Sinus disease is not changed compared to CT yesterday.
There is diffuse background slowing and there is more severe delta frequency slowing seen over frontal central regions.
EEG [**4-17**]- The recording showed often rhythmic and very persistent, approximately 2 Hz, generalized sharp wave activity throughout most of the record with brief periods of diminished sharp wave activity, as described above.
The record indicates an encephalopathy throughout, but the persistent rhythmic 2 Hz sharp wave discharges.
EEG [**4-18**]- The continuous EEG showed rhythmic generalized 2 Hz sharp wave discharges throughout most of the recording.
The findings are consistent with generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
Nevertheless, there was no evidence of clinical seizure or convulsion.
No focal abnormalities were evident.
EEG [**4-19**]- The recording showed rhythmic generalized 2 Hz sharp wave discharges through midnight at the end of [**4-19**].
There were occasional breaks for a second or two with a more slow and disorganized background even during that period.
EEG [**4-20**]- The background remained slow, disorganized, and indicative of an encephalopathy throughout.
There were no prominent focal findings.
There were very frequent and brief periods of rhythmic, generalized sharp wave discharges.
These sharp waves were usually blunted and without following slowing and were usually not so rhythmic as to suggest ongoing seizures.
No definite electrographic evidence of seizure.
Peribronchial inflammation, in the lower lungs, left greater than right, increased since [**4-9**], could be function of aspiration, but I see no pneumonia.
Moderate enlarging right pleural effusion is responsible for more right basal atelectasis.
Chronic lung infection responsible for small cavitary nodules is unchanged, but a subacute infection responsible for a larger nodule in the right middle lobe is decreasing.
Chronic pericardial effusion increased slightly, now moderate in size.
No evidence of tamponade.
CXR [**4-25**]- Right infrahilar consolidation and pleural effusion appear to be even more prominent than on the prior examination.
There is no left pleural effusion.
Right pleural effusion is at least moderate.
There is no pneumothorax.
No left pleural effusion is detected.
No pneumothorax or new focal consolidation is seen.
Mass effect on the proximal trachea is again noted, better evaluated on prior CT. .
Portable Abdomen [**5-4**] - No evidence of obstruction or perforation.
RUQ ultrasound [**5-6**] - Gallbladder is distended, contains echogenic material in its lumen and shows some mild wall thickening.
No dilated bile ducts.
No focal liver lesion.
No acute cholecystitis.
Chronic gallbladder dysfunction.
CXR [**5-6**] - Newly occurred right basal parenchymal opacity, in addition to a right pleural effusion.
A reactive pleural effusion and accompanying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
CXR [**5-10**] - Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema are present, the latter slightly worse compared to the prior examination.
Large partially layering right pleural effusion is again demonstrated as well as a possible small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 year old man with a history of Ph+ ALL s/p chemotherapy (DVA, Gleevec) and s/p MUD myeloablative allo-BMT [**2132-7-9**] c/b GVHD of the liver, CMV viremia, R leg mucor infection treated with ambisome/micafungin, PICC line thrombus and CKD presenting with worsening pancytopenia, found to have ALL recurrence.
# Pancytopenia:  Patient has had persistent pancytopenia, but CBC on day of admission was notable for worsening thrombocytopenia and immature white cells in the periphery.
# ALL: s/p hyperCVAD and imatinib, s/p MUD allogeneic SCT, admitted with relapse as above.
In addition, given headaches for several weeks and recent seizures, LP was repeated with infusion of intrathecal araC, and dexamethasone 4mg po BID.
Given the severity of disease relapse in conjunction with multiple medical issues below, the patient's family transitioned him to comfort measures only.
# Seizures: On [**4-15**], patient's mental status was acutely changed, with decreased responsiveness and more irritability.
However, patient is likely colonized with RSV, and seizures did not abate with pavalizumab administration.
Patient became less responsive, and per neuro-oncology, he was titrated up on keppra, with addition of lacosamide and eventually valproic acid.
Valproic acid level remained therapeutic, and 24 hour EEG performed did not show further evidence of seizures.
The's patient's family refused further EEG monitoring for patient's comfort.
# Upper GIB:  On [**5-3**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for an episode of hematemesis followed by bright red blood per rectum, associated with increasing tachycardia and mild hypotension.
Following this episode, the patient had multiple episodes of melena, symptomatically managed with transfusion.
He was also continued on a PPI drip for gastritis or stress ulcer.
# Pneumonia:  As the patient's mental status declined, he suffered from a large right sided aspiration pneumonia.
He began spiking high fevers, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
He passed away from fevers of 104 and dehydration in the setting of pneumonia.
# RUQ tenderness:  In the setting of ongoing GI bleed and sepsis from pneumonia, the patient began to experience right upper quadrant tenderness associated with worsening LFTs in a cholestatic pattern.
RUQ ultrasound and HIDA were without evidence of obstruction.
Patient likely had TPN- or sepsis-induced cholestasis.
Pneumonia was treated as above.
# Right leg mucor infection: Stable on ambisome, with no signs of active infection, only eschars remaining.
MRI performed during admission showed no inflammation to suggest extension of mucor.
# Chronic GVHD: Documented GVHD of liver and GI tract.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: During previous admissions, patient has had acute on chronic injury secondary to tacrolimus/ambisome induced tubular toxicity and volume depletion.
Electrolytes were repleted as necessary, as patient had potassium wasting with elevated transtubular potassium gradient.
# Cavitary lesions in lung: Stable in size over serial imaging.
Likely related to mycobacterium kansaii which has been cultured from sputum repeatedly, but not treated due to significant hepatotoxicity associated with RIPE regimen + ambisome.
# History of PICC-associated DVT:  Thrombocytopenic throughout admission.
# History of tachycardia: The patient has a history of wide complex tachycardia.
On admission, the patient was off of metoprolol secondary to orthostatic hypotension, then restarted early in this admission.
Patient was given 5mg IV lopressor as needed for prolonged sinus tachycardia.
Late in his admission the patient had many episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with lopressor 5mg IV q6 hours.
