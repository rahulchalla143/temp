Patient was not travelling at high speed, air bag was not deployed and patient had no injuries from this.
He was post-ictal with drowsiness and confusion post seizure.
CT there showed right temporal hypodensity with edema and minimal midline shift.

No carotid bruits.
NO neck injries.
No obviosu masses.
NO spinal tenderness.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Fundi revealed no papilledema.
Motor:Full power throughout Sensation: Intact to light touch, propioception, pinprick and vibration bilaterally save slight decreased vibration at left great toe.
No gross finger/nose ataxia.

Pertinent Results: [**2138-10-12**] MRI brain with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: A heterogeneous lesion in the right temporal lobe measuring approximately 5.3 x 3.0 cm with heterogeneous nodular peripheral enhancement, moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
Possibilities include a primary neoplasm such as a glial tumor-GBM or a metastatic lesion; less likely lymphoma, etc.
No evidence of primary malignancy within the chest or abdomen.
Tiny low-density lesion within the pancreatic head is not concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma; it may represent a cystic lesion or interdigitating fat.
An MRCP is recommended on a non-urgent basis within 6 months to evaluate for an incidental cystic pancreatic lesion.
Small Bochdalek hernia.
[**10-13**]: Functional MRI and MR Spect Successful functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the expected activation areas in the cerebral cortex during the movement of the hands, feet, language, and during the movement of the tongue.
No significant activation areas are adjacent to the right temporal mass lesion, which is unchanged since the most recent study.
The ASL sequence demonstrates no significant perfusion.
The spectroscopy indicates elevated ratio for Choline medially, suggesting malignancy, either primary or metastatic.
[**10-15**]: MRI IMPRESSION: Relatively stable and unchanged right temporal intra-axial mass lesion with ring-enhancing pattern and necrosis and also associated vasogenic edema, causing mild effacement of the right perimesencephalic cistern as described above.
No new lesions are identified in the interval.
[**10-15**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Immediately status post right temproparietal craniotomy, with post-surgical changes but no evidence of acute complication.
[**10-16**] MRI Brain- Post op changes, enhancement along surgical bed consistent with surgical changes.
No acute infarct or hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 78697**] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service for workup of right temporal brain lesion.
CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out primary malignancy.
No significant activation areas are adjacent to the right temporal mass lesion.
Surgery was without complication.
Post op head CT revealed post operative changes and no hemorrhage.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.

New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
