Admission Date:  [**2185-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-1-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Ciprofloxacin / Ertapenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**] Chief Complaint: ascites, hyponatremia, renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: evacuation of  History of Present Illness: 59 year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis with refractory ascites, s/p TIPS, and hyponatremia, who is transferred from her [**Hospital3 **] facility for refractory ascites.
She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**11-24**] after an admission for altered mental status, likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
Labs on the day prior to admission were remarkable for creatinine of 2.0, elevated from her recent baseline of 1.3-1.5. .
She denies mental status changes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, fevers, chills, or change in her baseline [**5-14**] nonbloody daily bowel movements.
She further denies any dysuria or change in the volume of urine.
Past Medical History: Hepatitis C, Genotype 1: Diagnosed in [**2185-1-8**] with last VL 263,000 in [**8-/2185**] Cirrhosis (Methotrexate and Hepatitis C Induced) Portal Hypertension Chronic Kidney Disease with baseline Cr 1.8-2.0 Diastolic CHF: Grade I diastolic dysfunction [**7-17**], EF 75% Ascites Diuretic-Resistant Esophageal Varices per report; however, EGD [**7-/2185**] reports normal esophagus Psoriasis with Arthropathy - s/p Methotrexate x 15 years (MTX d/c in 12.07 when patient developed ascites and now uses halobetasol cream) Anemia with baseline Hct 25-30 Thyroid nodule 2.2cm identified on ultrasound [**9-16**], needs Bx (has f/u in Thyroid nodule clinic) Admission [**Date range (1) 92102**]: for elective TIPS for refractory ascites, also had UTI Admission [**Date range (1) 92103**]: for hyponatremia and ARF Admission [**Date range (1) 78747**]: for hepatic encephalopathy Foot drop from peroneal nerve injury during TIPS procedure (per DC summary) Hyponatremia with baseline Na 128-130  Social History: Quit smoking in [**2184**].
No alcohol problems, no drugs.
Family History: no FH of liver disease  Physical Exam: VS - Temp 98.6 F, BP 103/69 , HR 85, R 20 , O2-sat 100% RA GENERAL - uncomfortable appearing woman lying on her side HEENT - moist mucus membranes NECK - supple, no thyromegaly LUNGS - faint crackles at left base, otherwise clear HEART - RRR, 1/6 systolic murmur ABDOMEN - prominent umbilical veins.
Tense, distended, nontender, + hepatomegaly on percussion, could not assess for shifting dullness as patient unable to lay on back ([**3-12**] leg discomfort) EXTREMITIES - warm.
1+ pitting edema bilaterally, exquisitely tender SKIN - diffusely scaling.
Anterior chest wall with violaceous plaques.
There is plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base and at the right lung base.
Relatively increased density of left abdominal wall musculature extending into the peritoneum, with relatively high density fluid layering dependently in the pelvis.
Findings suggest small intraperitoneal bleed and/or retracted clot related to recent paracentesis.
Significant increase in the degree of ascites.
Evidence of hemoperitoneum, with the greatest density fluid located in the left upper quadrant, likely indicating the area of recent bleeding.
The proportion of simple ascites fluid to blood is difficult to assess, but there appears to be more hyperdense material layering dependently within the abdomen compared to yesterday.
Hyperdense material also layers in the pelvis, consistent with blood or clot.
Increased opacity at the left lung base possibly representing atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.
No evidence of stone, mass, or hydronephrosis.
PATHOLOGY [**2185-12-22**] Thyroid FNA FNA, Thyroid, left isthmus nodule: SUSPICIOUS for papillary carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year-old woman with cirrhosis, with refractory ascites and hyponatremia, presents with hyponatremia, ascites, acute on chronic renal failure, and an elevated WBC.
# cirrhosis/ascites:  Patient had known TIPS occlusion.
Despite therapeutic tap removing 10 L just 2 days prior to admission, she had considerable ascites on admission.
On the day of admission, she developed some mild abdominal pain, and a diagnostic paracentesis was done to rule out SBP, which it did.
Diuretics were held given acute renal failure and hyponatremia (below).
Lacutlose was continued; rifaximin was stopped because of concern for allergic interstitial nephritis given peripheral eosinophila and urinary eosinophils.
# intra-abdominal bleed - diagnostic paracentesis [**12-23**] in LLQ, then with steady downward trend of hct, then with acute hct drop to 18 on [**12-26**], requiring 10uPRBC with 4uFFP and 1u platelets.
Repeat CT scan of abdomen showed intra-abdominal bleed.
# acute on chronic renal failure:  Creatinine 2.0 on admission, up from recent baseline 1.5.
Likely the recent large volume paracentesis contributed to this.
She was given octreotide, midodrine, and albumin as treatment for presumed hepatorenal syndrome.
# metabolic acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure.
Iron studies were consistent with underproduction secondary to renal failure.
# hypercalcemia:  The patient had worsening hypercalcemia.
Increasing albumin secondary to albumin therapy may have contributed; however, ionized calcium was also slightly elevated.
The endocrine team saw her and commented that she likely had elements of both secondary hyperparathyroidism (from her renal disease) and primary hyperparathyroidism (given the elevated calcium).
This was stable in appearance on repeat ultrasound but concerning for carcinoma.
An FNA was performed and showed papillary carcinoma.
# urinary tract infection:  The patient had a urinary tract infection with ESBL-producing E Coli that was treated with 3 days of Bactrim.
Wound care assisted with dressing of a wound on her posterior leg.
After her transfer out of the MICU, she had several hemorrhagic bullae.
The dermatology team again saw her and thought this was likely secondary to trauma and fragile skin.
Topical steroids were discontinued, and the lesions were dressed with vaseline and gauze.
Urine phorphobilinogen was sent for possible PCT and was negative.
# hyperglycemia:  After tube feeds were initiated, the patient was hyperglycemic into the low 200s despite no history of diabetes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: acute on chronic renal failure, hyponatremia, hepatitis C cirrhosis, anemia secondary: psoriasis   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you had problems with your kidneys and the sodium level in your blood was low.
Your diuretics were stopped, and medications to treat your kidney problems were started.
Please call your physician or come to the hospital if you have chest pain or shortness of breath, high fevers and chills, nausea and vomitting, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
