No substantial subdiaphragmatic gas.
Lung volumes are appreciably lower, exaggerating heart size and pulmonary vascular caliber.
Mediastinal widening and vascular congestion suggest some cardiac decompensation and possibly mild edema surrounding the right hilus.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged but there is interval development of bilateral perihilar opacities continuing toward the lower lungs, right more than left, finding consistent with interval development of at least moderate pulmonary edema accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 27356**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] emergent exploratory laparotomy secondary to hemoperitoneum after hysteroscopy complicated by uterine perforation into the uterine artery.
During the procedure she had a supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel resection, oversew of colonic serosal tear, cystoscopy and proctoscopy.
She did have pulmonary edema noted on CXR and thus was given 1 dose of IV lasix.
She had a small troponin leak thought secondary to demand/ PEA arrest.
Given small bowel resection, she had an NG tube placed intraoperatively and remained NPO.
She was also was given 48 hours of vanc/cipro/ flagyl.
She was ambulating without difficulty, voiding spontaneously, tolerating a regular diet, and had minimal pain.
Call for: - increased pain not responsive to the medications prescribed - fevers, chills - redness, discharge, pain at incision - heavy vaginal bleeding - difficulty with urination - lower extremity swelling, pain - difficulty breathing, chest pain   Followup Instructions: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 27357**] office to schedule an appointment to take your staples out at the end of this week or early next week.
