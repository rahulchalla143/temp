Right basilar atelectasis has increased from the prior study.
Right and middle lobes remain collapsed.
No pneumothorax or effusion is identified.
There is no definite consolidation.
Mediastinum is persistently widened due to known mediastinal mass.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2117-8-26**] 12:31 AM FINDINGS: Centrilobular emphysema is seen.
A moderate right pleural effusion is present.
Middle lobe and medial basilar right lower lobe atelectasis is present.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No embolism or filling defect is noted.
A 2.4 x 4.6 cm precarinal mass impinges on the right middle lobe pulmonary artery (5:42,5:48).
No additional mediastinal, axillary or hilar adenopathy is present.
A multilobulated dense liver lesion is seen in the right lobe expanding out from segment VIII.
Perihepatic ascites is present.
The dense ascites measures complex density of 30 Hounsfield units.
Large precarinal and mediastinal mass consistent with metastatic disease.
Stable middle and right lower lobe atelectasis and moderate right pleural effusion.
No pulmonary embolism.
Large mass consistent with known hepatocellular carcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis and complex ascites.
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-8-26**] 2:46 AM FINDINGS: Right middle and medial basilar lobe atelectasis is unchanged since [**2117-8-3**].
A small right pleural effusion is also similar in size.
A multilobulated hypodense lesion infiltrates the right lobe of the liver, predominantly involving segment VIII but extending medially and inferiorly.
A large 5.2 x 6.1 cm necrotic portacaval node has increased in size from [**2117-6-23**] when it measured 4 x 4 cm.
Dense perihepatic ascites is present with peritoneal implants which are better visualized on the CT of the chest with contrast.
The ascites has attenuation consistent with complex fluid.
Mild ascites is seen throughout the mesentery and both paracolic gutters with the largest pocket in the right lower quadrant.
The abdominal aorta is atherosclerotic without any focal aneurysms.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: Large infiltrative liver lesion consistent with known hepatocellular carcinoma.
Dense ascites consistent with metastatic peritoneal disease.
No dilated or abnormally thickened bowel, though evaluation is limited without intravenous or oral contrast.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2117-8-26**] 10:54 AM CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient with known and previously ruptured hepatoma with invasion of the hepatic veins in inferior vena cava.
Now with markedly elevated lactate levels and rising INR.
The liver demonstrates a coarsened and hyperechoic echotexture.
There is a moderate volume of perihepatic ascites most of which is relatively clear but some of which has a complex appearance consistent with the prior hemoperitoneum.
A 5 x 8 cm hypoechoic mass is seen in segment I and a much larger mass is seen in segment VII and VIII which is difficult to measure with precision but is at least 10-11 cm in diameter.
The right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava were also assessed and appear again to be filled with thrombus which extends well into the inferior vena cava towards the right atrium.
CONCLUSION: Multiple hepatic masses as described, with segment VII-VIII mass invading the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava as noted on prior CTA study from [**2117-7-30**].
Perihepatic ascites is somewhat complex but much more clear than on the prior studies at the time of the ruptured hemoperitoneum.
CXR [**2117-8-29**]: Large right pleural effusion has increased.
Small left pleural effusion has probably increased.
Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
CXR [**2117-8-30**]: Unchanged appearance of right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 55yo M PMHx HBV/HCV HCC, recent hospital stay w R-sided exudative pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis, now re-presenting with worsening shortness of breath, found to have marked lactic acidosis, thought to be secondary aggressive tumor metastasis, stable and transferred to floor.
ACTIVE #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient w recent pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis re-presenting with dyspnea; no signs of infectious pulmonary process on CT, UA; no PE on CTA; culture from recent thoracentesis remained without growth arguing against infected pleural effusion; imaging notable for marked progression of tumor burden; respiratory findings were thought to be compensatory for severe metabolic acidosis [**2-3**] type B (non-ischemic) lactic acidosis.
Lactic acid was markedly elevated out of proportion to patient's overall hemodynamic stability, and was thought to be related to lactate secretion by the patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma.
Lactate (initially 19.9) trended to 10.8 w hydration; as no clear sources of infection were identified, leukocytosis was attributed to tumor burden.
#Worsening Hepatic Function: Rapid increase in INR, and tbili, lactate concerning for worsening hepatic function, thought to be secondary to worsening tumor burden.
RUQ u/s did not demonstrate new thrombosis of portal vein.
Lovenox was held given elevated INR .
#HCC: Patient on Sorafenib as an outpatient, but with w marked increase in tumor burden on imaging.
Patient presented with SIRS with no obvious source of infection, but with broad coverage antibiotics.
Patient complains of minor epigastrium tenderness to deep palpation but not of pain.
# DM: Conservative sliding scale insulin given episode of hypoglycemia .
TRANSITIONAL FROM ICU -> OMED -> DISCHARGE -IP thought effusion too small to tap so did not -Followed lactate and temperatures closely for signs of rapid clinical decline -Followed lipase as trending upward toward end of ICU stay -Followed sodium closely as history of SIADH  Medications on Admission: 1. metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID 2. oxycodone 5 mg PO Q4H prn pain 3. pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID 4. prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg PO Q6H prn nausea 5. enoxaparin 70 mg Subcutaneous Q12H 6. sodium chloride 1 gram Tablet PO TID 7. sorafenib 400 mg PO twice a day.
6. sodium chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-3**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for dry nose.
8. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.

Disp:*1 container* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Country 28334**] oxygen  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: Ambulatory: requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were having shortness of breath and had a lot of acid in your blood.
We think this happened because of your tumor in your liver.
We gave you a lot of fluid to help clear this acid which resulted in swelling of your belly and legs.
You continued to have low oxygen levels.
After a long discussion, you decided that you wanted to go home and not pursue further interventions for your cancer.
Additionally, since the hospice services take a little time to completely set-up, you were discharged with some liquid Morphine which you can take to help with pain or shortness of breath.
