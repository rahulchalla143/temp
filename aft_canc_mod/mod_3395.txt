Reoperative right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy     and en bloc right chest wall resection (ribs 3,4 and 5)     with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and     decortication of right middle and right lower lobes   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 75713**] was initially evaluated for resectability of a locally-advanced right lung cancer.
The patient has a 60-pack-year smoking history and has a complex history  for a right-sided lung mass beginning back in 04/[**2100**].
At that time, he appeared to have a right chest abnormality which on fiberoptic bronchoscopy was cytologically positive for malignancy.
He underwent cervical and anterior mediastinoscopy that did not show any involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a thoracoscopy and subsequent exploratory thoracotomy which defined a chest wall invasive lesion felt to be T3 if not, T4 because I presume a diffuse pleural involvement.
Past Medical History: Significant for a traumatic blindness in the left eye, hypertension, appendectomy, and alcohol-induced gastric ulcers.
Family History: Notable for cerebral hemorrhage.
He had a brother with gastric cancer and another brother with emphysema and a sister with cystic fibrosis.
Physical Exam: HEENT:  Ocular deformity on the left where he is blind .
Anicteric sclerae.
NECK:  He has no adenopathy in the neck region or supraclavicular fossa.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  He has trace peripheral edema.
SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
INDICATION: 70-year-old male with right lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy and bronchoscopy.
COMPARISON: Chest CT dated [**2100-12-1**], and multiple prior chest radiographs dating between [**2100-12-13**] to [**2100-12-27**].
FINDINGS: The patient is status post right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy for lung cancer with surgical sutures.
Again note is made of large right pneumothorax occupying approximately half of the right hemithorax, with two chest tubes and hydropneumothorax at the base.
There is a large pneumomediastinum surrounding trachea and esophagus, which extends somewhat to the left apex.
There is a large subcutaneous emphysema cavity extending from most of the visualized portion of the right chest and shoulder, overall unchanged since [**12-27**] comparing the scout image versus portable radiograph, however, is markedly increased since 23rd.
There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy noted on this limited evaluation.
The aerated portion of the right lung has patchy opacities especially at the bases with effusion, likely representing atelectasis and edema.
There are postoperative changes as well, with opacity surrounding the surgical suture.
In the left lung, there is dependent atelectasis and small effusion.
There are patchy faint centrilobular opacities in the left lower lobe likely representing aspiration.
There are degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine.
There is anterior ligamentous calcification.
There is a 3.2 x 2.7 cm left adrenal lesion, as seen on the prior study, measuring 15 [**Doctor Last Name **], likely representing adenoma.
Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for assessment of mediastinum and great vessels.
Persistent moderate-sized right pneumothorax and large pneumomediastinum with approximately 50% aeration of the right lung with post-operative changes and atelectasis and edema and small effusion.
Post-right upper lobectomy for lung cancer, with surgical changes and prior thoracotomy and chest reconstruction changes, as well as soft tissue density surrounding the surgical suture likely postoperative, however, continued followup is recommended.
The evaluation of the residual right lung is extremely difficult due to extensive pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.
Patchy centrilobular opacity in the left lower lobe, likely representing aspiration.
Atelectasis and small effusion.
2.7-cm left adrenal lesion, likely adenoma.
Please consider dedicated abdominal imaging for the assessment of metastatic disease.
Compared with [**2100-12-31**], there is some interval increase in opacity at the right base, likely related to accumulation of pleural fluid.
Deformity, volume loss, and degree of aeration in the right lung is stable.
Subcutaneous emphysema present.
Left lung grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.
IMPRESSION: Minimal increased opacity right base.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4343**] Approved: SAT [**2101-1-1**] 8:14 PM      Brief Hospital Course: Patient underwent bronchoscopy and reoperative right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy and en bloc right chest wall resection (ribs 3,4 and 5) with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and decortication of right middle and right lower lobes (for further operative details, see dictated operative note dated [**2100-12-21**]).
Aggressive pain control regiment and incentive spirometry was instituted.
Chest tubes were kept on suction as he had a significant air leak, which was expected from the extent of the surgery.
On POD 3 he became more short of breath and his CXR showed white-out of the lower/middle lobe on right.
Secretion were sent for culture and eventually grew Serratia (see ID section).
On [**12-26**] he developed worsening SOB and brief desaturation to 80's.
He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy on [**12-24**], and [**12-28**] for mucus plugging.
Subsequent to this he required no further intervention.
Over the next several days, air leak to chest tubes markedly decreased.
CXR showed a pneumothorax.
Serial x-rays showed the air collection to be stable > 24 hours.
He continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint.
ID:  In light of worsening respiratory status and chest x ray with some lung collapse and mucus plugging, patient was started on Vanco/Zosyn.
Following bronchoscopy on [**12-25**], BAL cultures returned with Serratia that was pan-sensitive.
Neuro: Pain was initially well controlled with an epidural.
This was then transitioned to Percocet with good pain control.
He was discharged home with instructions for follow-up.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain: As needed for pain.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the ER for any of the following: * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
* If you experience shortness of breath that is new or worsening.
* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* Your pain is not improving within 8-12 hours or becoming progressively worse, or inadequately controlled with the prescribed pain medication.
* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 101.5 (F) degrees or 38(C) degrees.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
* If you experience worsening pain, cloudy drainage or pain around your incisions.
*Please call the doctor if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision sites.
