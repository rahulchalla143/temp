She presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] on [**2128-3-18**] with fever, cough, headache, nine pound weight loss over four months, abdominal pain, and is being transferred here for a second opinion and further management.
Results were positive for B cell antigen; positive DBA44, positive CD-4 5 RO, hypercellular marrow with 5% fat composed almost entirely of infiltrating small lymphoid cells, all consistent with the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained which showed massive splenomegaly.
A CT of the chest showed mediastinal adenopathy and multiple nodules.
The bronchoscopy showed no endobronchial lesions and washings were obtained.
Blood cultures eventually grew atypical microbacterium on [**3-17**] of one bottle; [**3-21**] two bottles; [**3-24**] one bottle and [**3-26**], one bottle.
On [**3-25**], she was also noted to have a rash which worsened on [**4-9**], spreading to her face, chest and extremities.
One skin biopsy showed a pathology report consistent with a vasculitis.
Her blood cultures were sent to the state laboratory which determined that the microbacterium growing from her blood were not tuberculosis and not [**Doctor First Name **] and likely some type of rapid grower.
This patient was also noted to have diarrhea at the outside hospital.
At the outside hospital, she had a TTE on [**3-31**] which showed trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, normal ejection fraction, normal wall motion, no vegetations.
Her other past medical history is significant for a history of stomach problems in [**Name (NI) 4194**].
She has a history of low back pain and headache.
In general, she appeared acutely ill, rigoring, although she was afebrile at that time.
Skin examination:  She has a diffuse, erythematous plaque-like, confluent rash, over her entire body, sparing the mucous membranes and the palms and the soles.
Anicteric sclera.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
She did have some small lymph nodes under the right axilla.
Chest examination was notable for rhonchi in the left upper lobe posteriorly and rales at the bases bilaterally.
Heart examination was tachycardiac, soft, 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Her hypotension upon admission resolved with a fluid bolus.
She was also started on Clinda for post obstructive pneumonia (please see the next issue) and Ambazone to cover for fungals as she has been neutropenic for a prolonged amount of time.
She should be pan cultured with spikes, including fungal and acid fast bacilli blood cultures.
A body CT was performed to rule out abscess or other sources of infection and no abscesses were seen; however, she does have a left upper lobe pneumonia, possibly post obstructive.
No abnormalities in her belly despite elevated transaminase.
Left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression.
She is on the above antibiotics to cover for atypical mycobacterium.
There was a pulmonary nodule seen on the CT scan from the outside hospital.
Additional sources of fever:  The patient was noted to have a vaginal yeast infection on [**4-16**] and was started on Monistat treatment for seven days.
She was reportedly HIV negative at [**Hospital3 1280**] as well and she is on Ambazone 3 mcg/kg for empiric fungal coverage as the patient has been neutropenic for weeks and persistently febrile.
They reviewed the bone marrow biopsy slide and agreed that this was consistent with hairy cell leukemia.
No Neupogen, chemotherapy or XRT, which were all received at the outside hospital.
The CT scan of the torso that she had showed extensive lymphadenopathy in her chest.
Question of cord compression: this patient developed urinary retention, clonus and hyper reflexes in her lower extremities on [**4-15**] and a large bladder was seen on the CT of her torso.
A magnetic resonance scan of the spine was obtained which showed no compression in the thoracic or lumbar spine.
[**Doctor Last Name **] to complete his read of the magnetic resonance scan of the cervical spine.
She did have disc protrusion at T8-9 and L5-S1.
Desquamating raised plaque-like skin rash, sparing the mucous membranes:  Dermatology was consulted and a biopsy was performed showed preliminary no growth.
There is a question as to whether or not this is a drug rash, most likely secondary to Ceftazidime, leukemic infiltration into the skin or mycobacterium infiltration into the skin.
HTLV-1 could also explain this rash and this laboratory is currently pending.
Diarrhea leading to malabsorption:  This could be secondary to splenic XRT.
She is being ruled out for Clostridium difficile.
It was negative for Clostridium difficile at the outside hospital.
Will hold off on giving Lomotil until she rules out for Clostridium difficile.
Originally, she had a high PTT which has now resolved and low platelets.
This is consistent with low grade DIC.
She was given Vitamin K, as her high INR was likely secondary to malabsorption.
Here, she has a high alkaline phosphatase and GGT.
CT of the abdomen showed no liver masses or abscesses, unclear etiology.
Headaches:  This patient currently doesn't have headaches here but had multiple headaches at the outside hospital.
We performed a CT of the head, which was negative for bleed or masses.
Nutrition is suggesting TPN although this is not optimal due to her infection, so we will hold off for now.
Lines:  She has a PICC from the outside hospital, placed on [**4-12**], a right internal jugular placed here in the Intensive Care Unit on [**4-13**], prophylaxis Pneumoboots, neutropenic food and a PPI.
