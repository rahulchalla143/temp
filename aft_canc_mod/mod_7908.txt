HPI: 85 year old woman with dementia and advanced erosive basal cell carcinoma involving the left cheek, nasal cavity, palate, and lateral facial region.
She was admitted for surgical resection and will need a prosthesis and by a prosthodontist to have a preliminary prosthesis made that will eventually shell the defect and provide her some cosmesis.
Past Medical History: Hypertension, anemia, renal failure, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, paranoid, dementia, and chronic psychosis.
Excision of left-sided facial carcinoma and type 2 diabetes, and history of prior alcohol abuse.
Family History: None  Physical Exam: VS: 96.2 128/84 HR 69 RR20 O2sat 95% on RA  General: Alert, oriented, mild respiratory difficulty with audible wheeze, difficult to understand when she speaks.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, large defect on left cheek extending to left orbit.
Slight erythema at wound edge.
no odor, no sloughing tissue.
Neck: supple, JVP 2-3 cm above clavicle Lungs: mild crackles at bases bilaterally CV: regular rate, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds hypoactive, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, Gtube without dressing, ~10 in out of abd, clean dressing, no erythema.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, edema Neuro: moving all extremities Groin: minimal erythematous satellite lesions extended to buttocks crease, labial folds .
Blood Culture: Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2131-6-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2131-6-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
However, bilateral perihilar haziness with upper redistribution secondary to mild pulmonary vascular congestion seems unchanged.
A left lower lobe radiopacity is stable from prior radiographs and likely represents moderate atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar atelectasis, left worse than right.
Chest CT: CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There are no filling defects.
A small left pleural effusion is identified.
There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
There is left lower lobe consolidation.
A small amount of pericardial fluid is noted.
There are no lung nodules or masses.
A 1.2 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland measures 16 Hounsfield units, is thus indeterminate but most consistent with an adenoma.
A 3.5 cm hypodense lesion in the right kidney at mid pole measures 13 Hounsfield units and is consistent with a cyst.
On bone windows there is loss of height of T12 and L1 and T9.
Consolidation in the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Small pleural effusion.
Compression deformity of several lower thoracic vertebral bodies and of L1 are of indeterminate age.
The bowel gas pattern shows some mildly dilated loops of small bowel consistent with an ileus.
There are multiple calcifications noted, most predominantly within the aorta.
There is no evidence of free air.
IMPRESSION: Bowel gas pattern consistent with an ileus.
Left medial palatal margin (A):  Negative for carcinoma.
Left medial lip margin (B):  Negative for carcinoma.
Left inferior periorbital margin (C):  Atypical cells present; cannot exclude carcinoma.
Note:  The atypical cells in the initial frozen section are suspicious for carcinoma.
Left medial periorbital margin (D):  Negative for carcinoma.
Left superior medial periorbital margin (E):  Negative for carcinoma.
Left proximal inferior orbital nerve margin (F):  Small cluster of atypical basaloid cells within soft tissue consistent with basal cell carcinoma, see note.
Note:  There is a small focus at the edge of the permanent section of the remaining frozen tissue.
The focus did not appear in the original frozen section which was diagnosed as negative for carcinoma.
Additional margin, left inferior periorbital (G):  Small cluster of atypical basaloid cells consistent with basal cell carcinoma, see note.
Note:  There is a small focus at the edge of the permanent section of the remaining frozen tissue.
The focus did not appear in the original frozen section which was diagnosed as negative for carcinoma.
Coronoid process of left mandible (H-I):  Portion of bone and muscle; negative for carcinoma.
Posterior portion of left inferior turbinate (J):  Nasal mucosa; negative for carcinoma.
Note:  There is perineural invasion (best observed in slide R) and extension of tumor to underlying bone (best observed in slides AD, AF).
In the superficial areas the tumor shows more typical features of basal cell carcinoma including larger nodules with peripheral palisading.
As the tumor infiltrates deeper, the cells are more pleomorphic with loss of palisading, and some areas show infiltration of smaller nests with a marked sclerotic stroma.
There are focal areas showing an adenoid pattern.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 85 yo F h/o HTN, DM, dementia with psychosis, basal cell carcinoma admitted for surgical resection of basal cell carcinoma of the left face.
cxr in the PACU did not reveal pleural effusions, or any other acute lung pathology.
post-op labs were unchanged and wnl, except for abg which was significant for a respiratory acidosis (PaCO2 61) likely related to anesthesia.
In addition, pt tolerated sips for comfort without coughing.
These problems were managed over the course of a prolonged hospitalization to the point she was relatively stable with the main underlying problems being poor airway control with high aspiration risk and PEG tube management.
Plan for discharge on [**6-25**] when she had a minor aspiration event with respiratory distress without hypoxia.
Pt allowed to have sips or small bites of pureed solids for comfort if she requests.
She is written for morphine to be used for respiratory distress.
2) Skin care: Patient has a hole at her G tube site which is draining any oral intake and some gastric secretions also.
4) Pain control: Patient is written for round the clock tylenol and prn morphine.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for discomfort from constipation.
6. morphine concentrate 100 mg/5 mL (20 mg/mL) Solution Sig: Five (5) mg PO q2h as needed for pain or respiratory distress.
7. morphine concentrate 100 mg/5 mL (20 mg/mL) Solution Sig: Ten (10) mg PO q2h as needed for severe pain or respiratory distress.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon on the Parkway - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis  Basal Cell Carcinoma Supraventricular tachycardia secondary to B-blockade withdrawal Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnoses Chronic kidney disease Hypothyroidism Dementia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital for surgery to remove a cancer on your face.
After the surgery, you had a number of post surgical complications including an arrythmia, a pneumonia, and a yeast infection on the body.
