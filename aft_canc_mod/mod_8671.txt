While sitting down patient developed sudden-onset [**11-8**] bifrontal headache, diaphoresis, and blurry vision, and yawning  He soon developed chest pain and shortness of breath as well.
He originally went to [**Hospital3 **], found to have a R parietotemporal hemorrhage and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Currently he reports a [**6-8**] headache and reports the chest pain and shortness of breath have resolved.
He denies any weakness or numbness and no seizures.
No history of trauma.
Occasional tobacco, no drugs.
Family History: Family Hx; Mother with NIDDM, father with aortic and abdominal aneurysms.
No history of stroke, seizure, or hemorrhages.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam; VS; 138/70  92  16 Gen; middle-aged male, lying in stretcher, NAD CV; RRR, +S1,S2, no murmurs Pulm; CTA b/l Abd; soft, NT, ND Extr; no edema Neuro; -Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
Large right temporal intraparenchymal hematoma extending to the parietal lobe as well.
Moderate surrounding vasogenic edema, with mass effect as described above.
Mild increase compared to the most recent study of [**2149-8-30**], performed at OSH.
Patent major intracranial arteries of the anterior and the posterior circulation without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or obvious aneurysm or vascular malformation.
However, any vascular/neoplastic lesion obscured by the hematoma cannot be assessed on the present study.
Right cerebellar DVA.
This can be correlated with direct visualization in the ENT examination to exclude any associated focal lesion and if necessary, MRI, as the left palatine tonsil is bulkier than the right (series 3, image 10).
Post-craniectomy changes including pneumocephalus and subcutaneous gas, with moderate-to-large amount of air in the anterior and medial cranial fossa.
Decrease in size of hemorrhage, with gas collection in its place, but residual rim of surrounding hemorrhage.
No interval development of hydrocephalus, increase in mass effect, or increase in left shift of midline structures.
There is interval resolution of pneumocephalus since 8 days prior.
Small hyperdense foci within the resection bed are less dense in some areas, indicating continued evolution of blood products.
No definite new focus of hemorrhage is seen.
Again, there is hypodensity along the right temporoparietal lobes; however, there appears to be slight decreased mass effect with slight decreased sulcal effacement along the right superior convexity, and also with decreased mass effect on the right occipital and temporal horns.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, effacement of the basal cisterns, or near large vascular territory infarction.
No interval development of hydrocephalus is seen.
There is improvement in partial opacification of the paranasal sinuses, now with residual mild opacification of the sphenoid sinuses.
Areas of hyperdensity within the right posterior parietal lobe in the post right parietal craniectomy surgical bed demonstrate continued evolution, without definite new focus of hemorrhage or interval development of hydrocephalus.
Hypodensity persists in the right temporoparietal lobes, with slight decrease in mass effect.
ATTENDING NOTE: There remains herniation of brain paranchyma through the craniectomy defect.
OSH imaging showed Right Temporal-perietal hemorrhage.
There is a question of an aspiration pneumonia on chest xray and the patient is started on a course of antibiotics consisting of Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin.
There is a question of subclinical seizures as the cause of [**Last Name (LF) 361**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EEG is obtained and shows  On [**9-5**] patient spiked a fever overnight, 102.6 and was pancultured for infecious process.
On [**9-8**] He continued to have fevers and his wound was fluctuant and purulent fluid was draining from the wound.
He was then brought to the OR where he had a washout and the bone flap was removed.
The wound culture grew out E. coli.
he was extubated on [**Doctor Last Name **] day #2 and had a BAL for sputum sampling.
UE dopplers were performed and he was found to have superficial thrombi in the LUE.
This revealed*******  On [**9-12**], right shoulder xray was performed for pt c/o pain.
[**9-14**]: Agitation controlled on Seroquel.
Daily EKG's were followed without evidence of prolonged QT interval.
Hematology was consulted for persistant thrombocytosis and they felt that it was reactive from trauma of surgery and infection.
On [**9-15**], allergy team was consulted for desensitization  for his anaphylactic reaction to cephalosporins.
His neuro exam improved to completely oriented with no motor deficit.
He suffered no complications from this procedure and he returned to the floor.
This showed some areas of herniation with some parietal hyper and hypodensities.
On [**9-19**], he had a single complaint of chest pain.
EKG and cardiac enzymes were done and found to be normal, negative for any acute process.
