Stable left basilar opacity is combination of a small left effusion and atelectasis.
Suture material is redemonstrated in the right upper lung.
There is no pneumothorax.
No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: Right basilar opacity is concerning for developing focal right lower lobe pneumonia.
CXR: [**2153-6-14**] IMPRESSION: Interval progression of a right lower lobe opacity concerning for worsening pneumonia.
Unchanged left lower lobe opacity and right hilar mass.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, large territorial infarction, edema, mass, or shift of normally midline structures is present.
Diffuse periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with cortical atrophy.
No fractures or scalp hematoma is present.
IMPRESSION: Small vessel ischemic changes.
No acute intracranial process.
EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to mild posterior background slowing suggestive of a diffuse mild encephalopathy.
Multilevel degenerative changes and minimal anterolisthesis of C3 on C4.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo F h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI, DES in [**2145**], severe COPD on 4-5L O2 at home and severe TBM, FEV1 0.6, ESRD on HD, lung cancer, recently treated for MRSA HAP and C. Diff, p/w pneumonia.
# Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Possibly from aspiration vs. post-obstructive.
In the setting of 3 prior lung resections and extensive COPD, pt had limited pulmonary reserve.
She was continue on her COPD treatment of spiriva, singulair, albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers prn as well as small doses of morphine/xanax prn for sob/anxiety.
She triggered three times during her hospital stay, two for hypoxia and one for afib with RVR.
Her pneumonia was progressing on imaging and clinically and she was transitioned to vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/cipro.
It was felt by family and physicians that the patient would likely not survive this pneumonia without intubation.
Pt was transferred back to floors for remainder of hospitalization and passed away nearly 48 hours after leaving the MICU.
# Tremor/Weakness: Patient stated she was having difficulty holding water/coffee as it would spill due to her significant tremor.
Also noted to have falls at home.
Neurology evaluated her and felt symptoms were likely secondary to toxic-metabolic etiologies plus albuterol use.
VJKC and acetylcholinesterase antibodies sent.
# Recent C. Diff infection- completed course of flagyl in outpatient.
Never had abdominal tenderness/fullness or diarrhea.
# Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on her home atorvastatin until CMO status.
# ESRD - Continued MWF HD until her transition to CMO of which this was stopped.
# HTN -  She was continued on her home lisinopril and lasix, until CMO when all medicines were held.

You should call your doctor and 911 if pain not resolved.
