There are several prominent cystic-appearing regions, surrounded by more solid heterogeneous enhancement, particularly along the inferior margin of the mass.
There is significantly increased mass effect with marked distortion of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] though no evidence for hydrocephalus.
Extensive signal abnormality is present within the adjacent white matter, crossing the corpus callosum into the left frontal lobe, likely representing vasogenic edema.
There is a tiny nodular region of enhancement within the parasagittal left frontal cortex (3:62) unchanged from multiple prior studies.
Post-surgical changes following prior right frontal craniotomy are again noted.
IMPRESSION: There has been marked interval expansion in the right frontal mass with both cystic regions and solid enhancement and marked associated mass effect.
The findings are highly concerning for aggressive tumor recurrence, though the possibility of radiation necrosis cannot be excluded.
However, close comparison of the pre- and post-contrast sequences demonstrates no appreciable nodular, mass-like or other marginal or central enhancement to specifically suggest persistent tumor at the resection bed.
Apart from the expected dural enhancement, there is also a relatively thin lentiform rim-enhancing structure in the right frontal pole extra-axial space that may represent a posterior surgical seroma.
Allowing for the expected susceptibility artifact from the air within, this demonstrates no definite restricted diffusion, and there is no focus of restricted diffusion, elsewhere.
There is no pathologic focus of parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement apart from that described above.
Remainder of the examination is notable only for fluid- opacification of mastoid air cells, right more than left; the opacified right mastoid apex was present on the [**5-9**] study, while that on the left is new, some of which may relate to intubation and/or supine positioning.
Status post recent repeat right frontal craniotomy, with expected post-surgical changes at this site, including a relatively thin right frontal polar subdural fluid collection with no significant mass effect, as well as extensive pneumocephalus.
However, close inspection of the post-contrast sequences demonstrates no definite focus of marginal or central enhancement suspicious for residual neoplasm.
LENIS [**9-16**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the lower limbs.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 64376**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a right frontal craniotomy for mass resection.
In the PACU he demonstrated some slight left sided weakness.
Post-operaive MRI imaging showed no definite focus of marginal or central enhancement suspicious for residual neoplasm.
He exhibited worsening of this weakness on [**2178-9-13**].
They felt that the post-surgical changes were not infarct and that he was suffering from a pre-motor syndrome and this would, in time regain hid strength.
He was determined to be an appropriate candidate for rehabilitation as he has left sided weakness in both extremities, and was discharged to an appropriate facility on [**9-17**].
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1970**] - [**Hospital1 1559**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Mass Metastatic Melanoma   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions/Information  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-10**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
