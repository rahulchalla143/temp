Guaiac positive stool.
Brown stool, no active bleed.
was continued on Cipro/Flagyl, [**Hospital1 **] PPI, stool sent for C. diff.
Past Medical History: 1. a fib on coumadin, s/p previous attempted cardioversion x2 2. hypertension 3. hypercholesterolemia 4. s/p tonsillectomy 5.
Systolic heart failure thought to be ischemic from echo showing anterior and inferior akinesis.

Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera pale, MM dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: faint bibasilar crackles, R>L CV: Irreg irreg rhythm, normal rate, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, LLQ tenderness to deep palpation, non-distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 1+ pulses, trace pitting edema B/L to knee Skin: no rashes   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs .
Reports: EKG [**6-19**] Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 96 with extensive repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no diagnostic change.
[**6-18**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis INDICATION: Elevated white blood cell count and crampy abdominal pain.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Imaged portions of the lung bases notable for dependent subsegmental atelectasis bilaterally.
A left interpolar hypodensity is too small to characterize, likely a cyst.
The liver is unremarkable, though there is slight prominence of the main, left and right hepatic biliary ducts.
The pancreas is notable for unchanged pancreatic duct dilatation within the distal body and tail measuring up to 10 mm, with surrounding parenchymal atrophy.
The duct dilatation abruptly terminates in the mid pancreatic body and no distinct mass is noted on this exam in this region.
There is also a 2.6 x 1.4 cm lobulated cystic lesion in the uncinate process.
Regional vascular structures are notable for atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta, without aneurysmal dilation.
There is no free gas or free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Note is made of a moderate length segment of sigmoid colon, which is notable for mural thickening as well as adjacent fat stranding.
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no free gas.
There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.
Note is made of extensive degenerative change, which is present throughout the spine.
Notably, there is a grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 as well as a grade 1 retrolisthesis of L2 over L3.
In addition, there is diffuse loss of intravertebral disc height throughout the lumbar spine with endplate sclerosis, which is most severe at L5/S1 as well as L2/L3 and L1/L2.
Additionally, note is made of severe degenerative change present at both hips, though most severe on the right.
Sigmoid colonic mural thickening and subjacent mesenteric stranding, consistent with sigmoid colitis which may be due to an infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic etiology.
Pancreatic duct dilatation and atrophy within the tail with an abrupt termination in duct dilatation in the mid-pancreatic body.
Additional lobulated cystic lesion is also seen in the uncinate process.
While both of these findings may be related to IPMN, the abrupt ductal caliber transition raises suspicion for an obstructive mass in the pancreatic body.
Bilateral adrenal gland thickening without distinct nodule, unchanged.
Prominence of intrahepatic biliary ducts.
Extensive degenerative change throughout the lumbar spine and both hips.
CXR [**6-18**] IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
MRCP [**6-21**] /[**2178**] Final Report  FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates normal signal intensity throughout without evidence of focal lesions.
There is mild intrahepatic biliary duct prominence, similar to the prior study.
No extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The spleen demonstrates normal size and signal intensity throughout without evidence of focal lesions.
Both kidneys demonstrate normal parenchymal thickness without evidence of focal lesions.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is dilatation of mid to distal pancreatic duct up to 1.1 cm with small side branches as well.
There is an abrupt change in caliber of the duct from the dilated portion to the nondilated portion.
There is no evidence of mass at the area of abrupt change in the caliber.
Additionally, there is a similar-appearing dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in the uncinate process measuring up to 1.3 cm, accompanied by dilatation of the side branches as well.
There is no abnormal enhancing component within the dilated pancreatic duct on the post-contrast series.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen, with accompanying compressive atelectasis.
Small amount of perihepatic fluid is noted.
No abnormal enhancing nodularity is seen within the lesions.
No evidence of obstructing pancreatic mass, however, evaluation is limited due to motion artifact.
Complimentary CTA of the pancreas is recommended to definitively exclude a pancreatic mass.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 83 yo woman with a PMH of Afib on Coumadin, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia, recent hospital admission w/ antibiotics, who presented with lower abdominal sharp cramps x 1 day, diarrhea, and an INR of 7 at an outside facility now with fever, a white count of 21, and HCT drop of 10 points to 25.
The presentation was consistent with infectious colitis or ischemic colitis.
# GI Bleed: She was hemodynamically stable on admission to the medical intensive care unit and was without signs of active bleeding.
She had clinical and radiographic signs of colitis, and her bleeding was likely precipitated by her coagulopathy, however, its etiology remained unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] poor PO intake could explain the coagulopathy and also raises the suspicion for ischemic colitis secondary to hypovolemia.
Ischemic colitis could certainly explain the bleeding and may have been exacerbated by her coagulopathy.
Another possibility was an upper GI bleed given her aspirin use, but was less likely, though she was placed on a IV PPI initially.
She was also started on Metronidazole and Ciprofloxacin for infection, c diff, and possible ischemic colitis.
Stool studies showed c diff positive with the other cultures negative.
CT of the abdomen was consistent with sigmoid colitis.
As the admission progressed her initial diarrhea decreased in frequency and became less watery.
# Coagulopathy/elevated INR: Most likely secondary to poor PO intake and diet change with no leafy green vegetables.
# A fib: In chronic atrial fibrillation rhythm.
# CAD: Stable.
Please discuss with PCP restarting ASA due to recent likely GI bleeding.
# Systolic heart failure: Hypovolemic to euvolemic.
# Acute renal failure- Her creatinine remained stable during the admission around 1, however it increased to 1.4 on the last day of admission.
We felt this was due to dehydration and pre-renal etiology given her fluid loss of frequent episodes of diarrhea.
Recheck renal fxn on [**6-25**].
# Pancreatic abnormalities on CT- CT Abdomen on [**6-18**] showed pancreatic duct dilatation and atrophy within the tail with an abrupt termination in duct dilatation in the mid-pancreatic body.
Additional lobulated cystic lesion was also seen in the uncinate process.
No abnormal enhancing nodularity is seen within the lesions and no evidence of obstructing pancreatic mass, however, evaluation is limited due to motion artifact.
Outstanding Issues- -Oral Flagyl 500mg TID for 14 more days from [**2179-6-23**] -She will need a follow up MRCP scan for a possible pancreatic mass in 6 months.
-INR check on [**6-25**] -Restart Lasix once diarrhea improving, or wt is increasing -Check renal function [**6-25**] -Discuss with PCP restarting ASA  Medications on Admission: 1.
Ativan 0.25mg PO BID PRN anxiety 3.
Percocet 5/325 PO Q4H PRN mod-severe pain 14.
C. diff colitis 2.
Acute renal failure  Secondary: 1.
Chronic congestive heart failure 2.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with lower abdominal pain and an elevated INR (a measure of how thin your blood is).
You were given a blood transfusion and had no further evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
You underwent an MRCP of your pancreas which showed a pancreatic abnormality that needs to be reevaluated in 6 months with another MRI.
You also have to take 2 more weeks of oral antibiotics for your intestinal infection which improved in the hospital.
