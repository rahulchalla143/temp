Admission Date:  [**2156-9-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-9-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-5-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for worsening hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 49yoM with advanced anorectal carcinoma s/p anterior pelvic resection and colostomy, XRT and chemo with a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for metastatic mets to the spine ([**8-7**]) who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2156-9-2**] with 3 days of nausea, vomiting and increasing shortness of breath and dry cough.
Admission CXR revealed what was thought to represent b/l pneumonia so he was started on levofloxacin.
A CT chest performed on [**9-3**] showed diffuse b/l reticularity, b/l lower lobe dense consolidation vs. atelectasis and b/l effusions.
Additionally, he was tranferred to the ICU and was placed on Bipap overnight with some decrease in WOB.
was unable to tolerate laying flat, less because of worsened dyspnea, more as a result of severe back pain [**3-5**] to his bony mets.
ROS: + fatigue, + anorexia, no fevers and chills.
No chest pain.
He has been having some lower extremity edema (L>R) without orthopnea or PND.
He does say he has been having shortness of breath over the past few days with cough, but not prior to this.
Nausea and vomiting has improved, but not taking good PO given need for NRB/bipap.
Past Medical History: PMH: # Anal/Rectal cancer, metastatic to spine T12,L1,L3,L4 and paraspinal retroperitoneal mass around L2, mets to lungs, liver  # Rectal fissure # Hearing impaired, wears hearing aids .
ONC HX: Diagnosed in [**3-8**] by rectal mass resection and biopsy demonstrating anal adenocarcinoma, he received chemoradiation with mitomycin and 5-FU up until [**Month (only) 958**] of this [**2154**], and had an anterior pelvic resection and pathology revealed a T3, N0 adenocarcinoma.
In he noticed some new lumps above his left clavicle.
biopsy of a left cervical node that was consistent with his anal adenocarcinoma, and he was then treated with FOLFOX and Avastin winter [**2155-8-2**].
Family History: Mother deceased [**7-8**], stroke and pancreatic ca  Physical Exam: PE: T 98.9 HR 128 BP 100/65 RR 30-38 O2 sat 91-96% NRB HEENT: PERRL, dry MM Neck: Large left sided supraclavicular LN, neck supple CV: Sinus tachy, no mrg apprec.
Resp: Decreased BS bibasilar, crackles mid lateral lung field (unable to sit pt.
fully forward [**3-5**]) Abd: Ostomy bag with liquid brown output Ext: Nonpitting edema LLE, no palpable cord nor calf pain, RLE w/o edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses b/l Neuro: CN 2-12, strength, sensation grossly intact   Pertinent Results: [**2156-9-2**] CXR at OSH: New bibasilar patchy opacities, most likely representing an underlying pneumonia.
[**2156-9-3**] CT chest from OSH: Interval increase in pulmonary metastases and hepatic metastases.
Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, underlying atelectasis or consolidation.
Interval increase in periaortic lymphadenopathy.
Development of large left supraclavicular lymph node.
EKG: Sinus tachy to rate of 135, nml axis, no significant ST/T wave changes.
[**2156-9-11**] bilateral LE Doppler US:  neg for DVT .
for DVT  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 49yoM with h/o of metastatic anorectal ca to spine, liver, lungs presents with worsening hypoxia in the setting of nonproductive cough.
He was found to have probable lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for close respiratory monitoring and possible chemotherapy.
# Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory distress: In review of [**9-3**] chest CT, reticular pattern appears c/w lymphangitic spread of his disease and was likely the major precipitant in the decompensation of his respiratory status.
Had been on face mask, but clinical evidence of increasing resp distress persisted(increased work of breathing, increased O2 requirement, tachycardia), and the patient was intubated on [**9-14**] for worsening respiratory distress and hypercarbia.
Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with zosyn, vancomycin, and azithromycin was initiated on admission for a question of PNA on admission CXR with leukocytosis and left shift.
VAP), but it was difficult to assess for new infiltrate on CXR and the patient was on broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn, vancomycin, and azithromycin) for the duration of admission.
DVT/PE was considered with LUE swelling on exam; however Doppler US was negative for DVT.
Etiolgy may be related to fever of malignancy.
# Sinus tachycardia: The patient demonstrated sinus tachycardia for the duration of admission.
# Metastatic anorectal ca: Last chemo in 2/[**2156**].
With known metastatic disease to bone, liver, lungs (worsening liver mets on [**9-3**] CT as well as hilar/mediastinal LNs).
XRT in [**Month (only) 205**] performed for back pain [**3-5**] to his bony mets (low thoracic-lumbar spine).
His cancer has previously been very chemosensitive, but since last treatment, appears to have rapid progression of disease given imaging as outlined above.
The patient completed cycle of 5FU and G-CSF, which was tolerated well without significant side effects; however, there was little effect on metastatic disease during chemotherapy.
During hospital course the patient developed a leukocytosis, most likely due to G-CSF treatment.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient is chronically thrombocytopenic w/ platelet count 65K-154K in review of OMR labs, with evidence of declining platelets during admission.
Most likely etiology is either progression of metastatic disease versus 5FU treatment.
# ?DVT/PE: On admission the patient was started on a therapeutic heparin drip for concern of PE given hypercoagulable state, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
He was unable to tolerate CTA per back pain from spinal metastases.
# FEN:  The patient had evidence of hypernatremia that responded well to free water repletion; this was likely hypovolemic hypernatremia given his poor po intake.
# During admission the patient was maintained on [**Last Name (LF) 32111**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IV PPI, and heparin (gtt or sq) for prophylaxis.
He became asystolic and was pronounced dead at 9:35am.
