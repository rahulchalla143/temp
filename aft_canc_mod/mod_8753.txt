He denies having felt lightheaded or dizzy.

Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP:135/42 P:77 R: 15 O2:  100% General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Incisonal scar present.
Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 1+ pulses, 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Studies: EGD [**12-16**] - Blood in the esophagus, no active bleeding site noted Blood in the stomach with blood clots, no active bleeding site noted Blood clot in the duodenum, no active bleeding site noted Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
EGD [**12-18**] - Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
Stomach fundus biopsy - Corpus mucosa with superficial [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion and mild edema; no diagnostic abnormalities otherwise recognized.
Microbiology: Cdiff negative X2 Blood cultures ([**2132-12-16**]) No growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old male with a history of CAD (S/P CABG), ESRD on HD, AAA, who was transferred from OSH with lower GI bleed.
No bright red blood per rectum throughout this hospital stay.
Only large amounts of melanotic stool initially that resolved as hospital course progressed.
[**Month (only) **] Surgery was consulted and recommended CT abdomen with contrast which ruled out Aortoenteric Fistula (in setting of patient's AAA s/p repair).
Patient's initial EGD on [**12-16**] showed blood in esophagus, stomach and duodenum but was otherwise unelucidating -- the second EGD on [**12-18**] showed a fundus ulcer that had been previously bleeding but stabilzied.
Biopsies taken from the ulcer were not concerning for malignancy or H.pylori infection.
Of note, there was some concern that his upper GI bleed was in part due to the long-term steroids.
Delirium: Patient was mildly delirious starting [**12-16**] (per daughter) with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] throughout the days.
Patient had been briefly intubated for his EGDs, on sedating/hypnotic medications, underwent significant GI bleed with multiple transfusions, in the ICU - all of which could have contributed to his delirium.
Leukocytosis: White blood cells intiially 27.3, likely secondary to demargination and stress dose intravenous steroids.
Infectious work-up was intiated although patient remained afebrile with no localizing symptoms.
Patient's leukocytosis gradually trended down to ~13 by day of discharge, which is within normal limits considering patient's ongoing steroid use.
# ESRD on HD: Missed hemodialysis on day of admission and was found to be hyperkalemic to 6.0.
Patient was likely significantly volume overloaded due to the many transfusions he received and general immobility; left upper extremity remained significantly edematous >> right upper extremity but was negative for DVT on ultrasound.
Patient did become hypotensive on hemodialysis so he was started on Midodrine 5mg to be given before hemodialysis on hemodialysis days.
- Continue Midodrine 5mg PRIOR to hemodialysis on hemodialysis days, until Renal physicians at Hemodialysis decide otherwise - Continue to hold morning Metoprolol 25mg dose on hemodialysis days until after hemodialysis - Increased Sevelamer from 800mg three times daily to 1600mg three times daily .
# Coronary Artery Disease: Three vessel CABG in [**2122**] and NSTEMI in [**2123-1-27**].
Patient was continued on Simvastatin inhouse but aspirin 325mg and beta blocker (Metoprolol 25mg twice daily) were held in-house in the setting of his GI bleed - DECREASE Aspirin to 81mg daily for now, given his GI bleed - Continue home Metoprolol 25mg twice daily and Simvastatin daily .
# Back and hip pain: Managed with Tylenol in-house - Resume tramadol, oxazepam as outpatient, as blood pressure tolerates .
# Bullous pemphigoid: Stable.
Acetaminophen 325 mg po q6h PRN pain 2.
Oxazepam 10 mg po qhs PRN insomnia 3.
Simethicone 80 mg po qid PRN gas pain 8.
Senna 8.6 mg po bid PRN constipation 13.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Baypointe - [**Hospital1 1474**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper GI bleed (stomach fundus ulcer) Secondary: Coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, bullous pemphigoid   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with blood loss from your gastrointestinal tract.
You underwent an EGD that showed a bleeding ulcer in your stomach.
You were transfused with 7 units of blood and 2 units of clotting factors with good effect; the bleeding from the ulcer has stopped.
You also required extra hemodialysis because the transfusions caused you to swell with excess fluid.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
