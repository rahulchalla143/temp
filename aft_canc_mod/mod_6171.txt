Admission Date:  [**2127-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-6-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: change in mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PEG placement  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 83 yo gentleman with PMHx sig for HTN, skin cancer NOS, and sleep apnea who fell down four stairs at home today.
EMS was called and the patient was intubated due to combativeness.
He was brought to an OSH where a head CT showed a large L temporal ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage, L SDH, and SAH.
Past Medical History: HTN, skin cancer, and sleep apnea  Social History: non-contributory  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Exam upon admission: Vitals: T 98.2; BP 140/75; P 71; RR 13; O2 sat 99%  General: intubated HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no m/r/g Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.
Reflexes: 1+ in UEs and patella, absent ankle jerks.
Pertinent Results: CT head [**2127-12-31**]: FINDINGS:There is a acute subdural hematoma which surrounds the left cerebral hemisphere which measures up to 9 mm in thickness.
Subdural blood layers along the left tentorium.
There is subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left cerebral hemisphere spanning the frontal and temporal lobes primarily.
There is also subarachnoid blood on the right noted in the right sylvian fissure specifically.
There is increase in parenchymal contusion in the left temporal lobe with surrounding edema and sulcal effacement noted.
Areas of pneumocephalus are again noted in the left middle cranial fossa.
Intraventricular hemorrhage is noted primarily in the left lateral ventricle and a small amount is noted to layer in the right lateral ventricle occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is no increase in ventricular size when compared with prior study hough there is now approximately 4 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation which may be increased.
There is no evidence of downward transtentorial herniation though there is some relative hypodensity in the left cerebral peduncle which may reflect edema.
Overall, the most notable difference since the prior study is the increase in left temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusion and the surrounding edema.
Increased hemorrhagic contusion in left temporal lobe with resultant surrounding edema.
No significant change in left cerebral subdural hematoma and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The presence of pneumocephalus in the left middle cranial fossa also suggests an underlying fracture.
HEAD AND NECK CTA [**1-1**]: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent.
In particular, the left MCA is patent without evidence of stenosis, but this does not exclude ischemia.
There is a mild narrowing ofthe basilar artery, most likely secondary to atherosclerotic plaque.
The diamter of The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measures 7 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
No interval change of the multiple intracranial hemorrhage and hematomas.
Persistent mass effect with a rightward shift of midline structures.
No evidence of aneurysm.
Mild narrowing of basilar artery.
Persistent hypodensity extending to the cortex, approximating the left MCA distribution.
Question remains if parenchymal edema is secondary to infarction or contusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo gentleman with PMHx sig for HTN, skin cancer NOS, and sleep apnea who fell down four stairs at home.
EMS was called and the patient was intubated due to combativeness.
He was brought to an OSH where a head CT showed a large L temporal ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage, L SDH, and SAH.
Palliative care recommended a changed in the pain regimen and also recommended giving him medication for his secretions.
