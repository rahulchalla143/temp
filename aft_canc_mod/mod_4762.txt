Admission Date:  [**2118-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-3-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-9-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: severe headache; difficulty ambulating   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Pt with stage 1 root canal performed on Friday [**2118-3-4**].
Tuesday noc she was awakened from sleep with a severe headache ("felt like a rubber band around my head").
On [**2118-3-11**] (following friday) the patient had stage 2 of her root canal performed.
She states that she continued to feel worse afterwards with continued headaches and "difficulty negotiating" around her house.
Due to these symptoms pt went to see her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1262**].
She was started on lisinopril and scheduled for a carotid duplex today.
Pt was accompanied by her friend to appointment and was "unable to get out of car" at that time, also had some transient right arm numbness/tingling.
Head CT was performed which showed mult lesions including cerebellar lesion with edema as well as basilar tip aneurysm.
HEENT: Pupils: 3mm-->2mm reactive bilat  EOMs: intact        Visual fields: left visual field cut Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: Finger-nose-finger with increased ataxia on left hand only.
Emphysematous changes are seen predominantly at the lung apices.
A large mass is seen in the left upper lobe measuring 5.4 cm in maximal diameter.
No other lung masses or nodules are seen.
There are mild atelectatic changes at the left lung base.
No pleural effusions are seen.
The heart is normal in size, there is no pericardial effusion.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is a subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the liver, which most likely represents a cyst but malignancy cannot be excluded, and MRI would be recommended if further evaluation is indicated.
The right kidney contains two hypoenhancing lesions that are too small to characterize, but most likely represent renal cysts.
The pancreas, stomach, and opacified loops of large and small bowel appear unremarkable.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen.
The abdominal aorta and its tributaries appear patent.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.
No ascites or free air is seen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
No free fluid is seen within the pelvis.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is detected.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
Large lung mass in the left upper lobe consistent with lung cancer.
Subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the liver too small to accurately characterize.
Ultrasounds or MRI would be recommended if further assessment is indicated.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Emphysematous changes predominantly at the lung apices.
MRI +/-gado plus mra Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old woman with large cystic lesions on head CT, large lung tumor recent hx of root canal.
R/O abcess vs metatsis; Also has basilar tip aneurysm Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained without and with intravenous gadolinium administration.
There are several large cystic lesions of increased T1 and T2 signal involving the left cerebellar hemisphere, the right parietal lobe posteriorly, and the right frontal lobes.
The lesions demonstrate increased T1 signal probably related to the presence of high content of protein.
There is slight enhancement seen peripherally following intravenous gadolinium administration.
The largest of these lesions is seen within the right posterior occipitoparietal region and measures 5.2 x 3.6 cm.
There is mild surrounding vasogenic edema.
These are most likely consistent with metastatic lesions probably related to the patient's underlying lung mass.
There is mass effect involving the left pontomedullary junction due to the presence of a large left cerebellar lesion and slight compression of the fourth ventricle inferiorly.
No hydrocephalus is seen.
There is slight midline shift to the left by 3 mm.
Mild downward displacement of the left cerebellar tonsil is seen probably related to the large cerebellar lesion and there is partial effacement of the left posterior quadrigeminal cistern.
No pathologic meningeal enhancement seen following intravenous gadolinium administration.
There are no acute territorial infarcts noted on diffusion image.
IMPRESSION: Several large lesions of increased T1 and T2 signal involving the left cerebellar, right frontal, and right occipitoparietal lobes with surrounding vasogenic edema most likely consistent with diffuse brain metastases possibly related to the patient's underlying lung mass.
Large signal flow void involving the basilar tip which should be further evaluated on the MRA exam of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] to follow.
As suspected on the CT examination, there is a large aneurysm involving the basilar tip, which measures 1.1 x 1 cm.
No other aneurysms are seen in the region of the MCA trifurcation.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 57 year-old female who presented with Headache and difficulty of ambulating.
she was initially evaluated by her primary care doctor, her chest radiograph showed left upper lung mass which is promt to do a head CT. Head CT revealed rigth frontal, right parietal and left cerebellar mass further evaluation with MRI confirmed the lesions and she admitted to Neurosurgery service.
Infectious disease consulted for non-neoplastic origin of the brain lesion infection vs tumor; ID sugessted to [**Last Name (un) 12621**] diagnosis and send for aerobic, anaerobic cx, gram stain, mycobacterial cx, AFB, Modified AFB, fungal stain, fungal cx, nocardia culture.
Patient has been afebrile [**Hospital 67169**] hospital stay, vital signs has been stable.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple Brain lesion Left lung lesion   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Take your medications as directed.
Report  if you experience any increased headache, numbness/tingling, visual changes or any other neurologic symptoms come to Emergency room or call 911.
