Admission Date:  [**2158-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-6-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma (recently diagnosed, s/p GEJ stenting [**2158-6-6**]), partial colectomy for transverse colon adenocarcinoma ([**2154**]), restless leg syndrome, GERD who presents with hypotension.
The patient had been at home in his usual state of health when he tried to have a bowel movement and was noted by his family to be there for "hours."
The patient had generalized weakness and could not come off the commode.
CT head unremarkable, CT torso given endorsement of diarrhea and abdominal pain was unremarkable.
GI was consulted in the ED and felt there was nothing else to do re: GEJ stent, especially as the CT torso showed no fluid collection.
CXR suggestive of possible biateral mid-lung field opacifications so the patient also received Levaquin 750mg IV X1.

Imaging: CT head: No actue process.
Note is again made of aortic and mitral annular calcifications.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
Calcified pleural plaques are again seen which likely reflect prior asbestos exposure.
Right upper lobe granuloma is stable.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
There is minimal bilateral dependent atelectasis.
The esophagus is dilated with an air-fluid level and wall thickening particularly distally.
Narrowing of the stent at the GE junction is likely secondary to known malignancy.
The spleen contains punctate calcifications, which likely represent prior granulomatous disease.
Inspissated contrast is seen within multiple diverticula; there is no evidence for diverticulitis.
There is no free air or ascites.
Severe sigmoid diverticulosis is seen with inspissated contrast within innumerable diverticula without evidence for inflammation.
There is no free fluid.
There is a large sclerotic lesion in the right iliac bone and there is marked sclerosis of three mid thoracic vertebral bodies, all of which is new compared to prior and concerning for metastatic disease.
No evidence for pulmonary embolism or other acute process.
New sclerotic lesions in the right iliac bone and mid thoracic vertebral bodies, concerning for metastases.
Narrowing of the distal esophageal stent compatible with known malignancy, and proximal dilatation of the esophagus filled with fluid.
The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta identified.
There are calcified bilateral pleural plaques which somewhat limit assessment of the underlying pulmonary parenchyma.
Compared to the prior radiograph, there may be increased opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally, and underlying infection cannot be completely excluded.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
No acute osseous findings are seen.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral calcified pleural plaques limit assessment of underlying pulmonary parenchyma.
Given this, there appears to be slight increased opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally, and an underlying infection cannot be completely excluded.
M with recently discovered esophageal adenocarcinoma at distal esopahagus.
Pt with severe dysphagia, unable to eat for two weeks.
* A fungating, friable mass of malignant appearance was found in the distal esophagus extending from 35cm down to the GEJ at 40cm.
The mass caused a partial obstruction.
Mass infiltration was noted extending from the esophagus into the stomach, circumferentially in the fundus and then unilaterally extending down to the distal body along the lesser curvature.
The mucosa appeared congested, suggestive of submucosal tumor infiltration.
A 23mm x 120mm [**Company 2267**] Ultraflex Covered Esophageal metal stent was placed across the mass successfully.
THESE FINDINGS COULD INDICATE PRIMARY ESOPHAGEAL OR GASTRIC MALIGNANCY AND FURTHER EVALUATION WITH           BIOPSY IS RECOMMENDED; THE POSSIBILITY OF METASTASIS TO THE           GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, HOWEVER.
MULTIPLE SCLEROTIC AND LUCENT BONE LESIONS CONCERNING FOR           METASTATIC DISEASE NEW SINCE THE STUDY OF [**2154-6-20**].
WHILE THIS IS DECREASED IN           COMPARISON WITH THE [**2154**] CT, THE APPEARANCE IS CONCERNING           MALIGNANCY AND COULD REPRESENT METASTASIS OR ALTERNATIVELY  PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED, LYMPHOMA, IF AN APPROPRIATE HISTORY EXISTS.
GALLSTONES AND BILATERAL NONOBSTRUCTING RENAL STONES.
TINY           HYPODENSE RENAL LESIONS ARE TOO SMALL TO CHARACTERIZE AND IF           SOURCE OF MALIGNANCY IS UNKNOWN AND FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION, PARTICULARLY OF THE RIGHT LOWER POLE LESION IS ESSENTIAL, THEN AN ULTRASOUND COULD BE PERFORMED INITIALLY.
HYPODENSE HEPATIC LESIONS UNCHANGED IN DISTRIBUTION FROM [**2154**], AT LEAST ONE OF WHICH REPRESENTS A CYST.
3 MM RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE PULMONARY NODULE FOR WHICH FOLLOW-UP WITH CHEST CT IN THREE MONTHS IS RECOMMENDED      7.
COLONIC DIVERTICULOSIS.
Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma (recently diagnosed, s/p GEJ stenting [**2158-6-6**]) called out of the MICU with GNR sepsis.
# E. coli sepsis: Likely due to GI etiology, may be associated with patient's known GE cancer and potential bacterial translocation in the setting of recent stenting in the past week ([**2158-6-6**]).
# Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma: s/p GEJ stenting earlier this week with extensive malignancy noted on EGD and likely has metastases in retroperitoneal lymph nodes and the bones.
Recently diagnosed secondary to dysphagia.
Changed omeprazole to lansoprazole on discharge given dysphagia since he was having difficulty swallowing pills.
GI was aware and reports that nothing to do at this time especially given CT scan without abscess or perforation.
# h/o prostate cancer: Metastatic, continue home flutaide and leuprolide q3months.
# Restless leg syndrome: Stable.
# GERD: Stable.
Switched omeprazole to lansoprazole as pt had difficulty with swallowing omeprazole.
This was discussed in a family meeting with the patient and the family Esophageal cancer appears fairly extensive likely with associated metastases.
Goals of care discussed with family and they are aware that swallowing may become progressively difficult as his esophageal cancer progresses and once he is unable to eat this will limit his life span, at which point comfort tastes could be initiated.
