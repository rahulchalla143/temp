Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 52821**] Admission Date: [**2107-1-25**] Discharge Date: [**2107-2-3**] Date of Birth: Sex: Service:   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  To transfer from floor after polymorphic ventricular tachycardia arrest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with unclear history of prior CAD, with history of a mass encapsulating right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi with no liver metastasis, presumed to be a possible malignancy, unclear brain mets (though noncontrast head CT showed no hemorrhage or midline shift), who was initially transferred from an outside hospital for concerns of an aorta dissection.
By MRI at [**Hospital1 **], she was found to have aneurysmal thoracic and abdominal aorta with penetrating ulcers, but no evidence of a clear dissection.
Evaluation on the outside had revealed elevated CKs to around 2200 with troponin T at peak 24.
The outside hospital ECG had shown atrial fibrillation, rapid ventricular response up to 150s with ST depressions.
At the [**Hospital1 **], on [**2107-1-25**], the patient was in sinus rhythm without clear ischemia.
However, until the a.m. of transfer on [**2107-1-26**], the patient had an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation, ultimately requiring DCCV, lidocaine, and amiodarone drip.
History of CAD with MI in the 80s.
Question of psychiatric disorder.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular:  She was tachycardic, irregular with a [**3-12**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Review of systems: CAD; the patient was admitted from an outside hospital with elevated CK and troponin in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.
She was not heparinized in the setting of a known malignancy with possible invasions to the brain.
Initially, she was transferred from the floor on dopamine following a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, degenerative ventricular fibrillation arrest.
The patient initially was treated for a possible cardiogenic insult.
However, the patient also has fevers and there was a concern that the patient having possible pneumonia.
As such, it was unclear if the patient's hypotension was secondary to cardiogenic versus septic shock.
Ultimately, secondary to episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation and also episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient was transitioned from dopamine to levofed.
She did continue to have episodes of hypotension that appeared to be fluid responsive.
As mentioned above, she was initially thought to have a component of cardiogenic shock.
However, her PA catheter numbers did not indicate cardiogenic shock.
She actually did receive a questionable amount of fluid later in her hospital course for episodes of hypotension.
It was felt later on the patient was grossly fluid overloaded, but still is exhibiting septic physiology.
Ultimately, she was gently diuresed to help improve oxygenation with bilateral pleural effusions.
Throughout the patient's CCU course, she remained extremely dependent upon both IV amiodarone and lidocaine.
amiodarone and was attempted to have weaned off of lidocaine.
However, the patient developed several episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation and also was felt to have some episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Her sputum was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus.
She was initially treated empirically with Levaquin and clindamycin for possible postobstructive pneumonia given her history of presumed lung cancer.
Later on, however, the patient developed increased oxygen requirements, as she became progressively more over fluid overloaded, secondary to the amounts of fluids she is requiring for hemodynamics.
Vancomycin was added later on when sputum was found to be positive for staph.
In addition, there was concern about possible line sepsis, so vancomycin was continued for possible line-type sepsis.
Oncology; the patient with history of breast cancer, status post mastectomy.
Upon transfer to the hospital with having findings of her mass increasing in the right middle lobe, right lower bronchi.
The patient had an abdominal CT, which also showed lesions in liver consistent with metastatic disease.
The patient did have a follow up head CT, which was negative for any intracranial malignancy, but did show diffuse mets throughout her skull.
Her platelets remained under 100 and was felt to be stable possibly secondary to underlying malignancy.
As mentioned above, she ultimately found to be grossly fluid overloaded secondary to massive amounts of fluid required to maintain her blood pressure.
Ultimately, given the patient's presumed metastatic malignancy, her ongoing arrhythmias requiring a persistent lidocaine drips, her recent MI, and prolonged hypotension with essential hypertension, and possible anoxic brain injury, it was decided to change the patient's code status from full code to eventually DNR/DNI and to ultimately CMO.
At  07:10 p.m., on [**2107-2-3**], the patient became asystolic and hypertensive.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Presumed metastatic malignancy.
Status post polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Fevers secondary to presumed pneumonia and questionable line sepsis.
