Admission Date:  [**2170-5-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-5-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-12-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, rigors, and worsening mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 80 year old male with metastatic melanoma to the brain s/p resection and cyberknife complicated by radiation necrosis requiring chronic dexamethasone, h/o DVT and PE with anticoagulation discontinued due to brain mets, recurrent DVT, and IVC filter placement, who developed B LE swelling and SOB earlier this week.
He had an ultrasound performed today which showed bilateral DVTs from common femoral vein down.
Repeat CTA [**5-17**] here confirmed no PE at that time.
In the evening of [**5-17**] he was noted to have worsening trouble speaking and was sent to urget MRI at 9:20.
MRI revealed 3x4 cm new bleed in the left parietal region around a previous metastasis.
At approximately 2am, he had an acute rise in his heart rate from NSR in 80s to 150s, acute onset of tachypnea and hypoxia with O2 sat 70% on RA, rigors, and worsening mental status (not following commands).
Past Medical History: # Metastatic Melanoma (pls refer to OMR for detailed hx) # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] x2 in [**2156**] and [**2157**] with chronic left lower extremity swelling # Hx of DVTs on Coumadin # Glaucoma # Benign prostatic hyperplasia .
Oncologic history: Mr. [**Known lastname 13474**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for a primary left calf melanoma in 9/[**2161**].
In [**5-/2165**], he began on the ILEX-651 chemotherapy trial with shrinkage of target lesions, but there was concern for possible residual disease seen on PET scan.An attempt at biopsy of left inguinal lymph nodes showed no evidence of melanoma.
He then developed a soft tissue nodule on the medial edge of his pectoralis muscle that was FDG-avid on PET scan in 3/[**2169**].
Pathology of this lesion showed a dermal/subcuticular malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with metastatic melanoma, likely involving a lymph node, but not seen at the examined specimen margins.
There was also a lymph node excision from his left anterior thigh that showed fibrotic and necrotic nodule with marked pigment deposition.
His PET scan from [**4-/2169**] also showed increased pelvic and abdominal lymphadenopathy.
He did well on study but developed symptoms of distorted color vision, flashing lights and difficulty breathing.
He went for a regularly scheduled CT torso as part of the study and was found to have PE in the RML and RLL.
He then [**Date Range 1834**] a head CT prior to anticoagulation which revealed a metastasis in the right frontal region.
MRI on [**2170-1-15**] showed an increase in size of the right frontal metastasis which had been treated with CK and a new 8mm metastasis in the parasagittal left frontal lobe.
PET thallium scan showed low level uptake in the right frontal lobe lesion but no uptake in the left parietal lesion.
He [**Date Range 1834**] a biopsy/resection of the right frontal lesion on [**2170-2-8**] which was consistent with metastatic melanoma.
He then [**Date Range 1834**] CK to the left parasagittal lesion on [**2170-2-21**].
In early [**Month (only) 958**], he developed weakness on his right side and his wife thought he had a stroke.
MRI showed identical size of the lesion but increased vasogenic edema.
He then had FDG-PET and thallium scans of his brain on [**2170-4-26**] and [**2170-4-23**] respectively which showed low and no uptake of the radionuclide, which per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], suggested radiation necrosis.
He has put on weight, has some mood changes, and has swelling around his ankles from being on dexamethasone.
He has not had any seizures or any recurrent weakness.
He had one fall but says he became off-balance trying to climb over his puppy's fence.
He denies any lightheadedness, dizziness, headaches or visual changes.
He denies any fevers, chills or night sweats.
He had an upper respiratory infection recently with head congestion, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and a cough.
He denies chest pain, SOB, or palpitations.
He denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
He denies any urinary incontinence, dysuria or hematuria, but does have nocturia several times per night.
He has swelling in his legs,R>L, but no numbness or tingling.
He denies any rashes or skin lesions.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On call out from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress Cardiovascular: rrr nl s1/s2 Respiratory / Chest: CTA anteriorly Abdominal: Soft, Bowel sounds present Extremities: + LE edema Skin:  Warm Neurologic: responding to basic commands of squeezing with his left hand and wiggling his left toes.
[**2170-5-16**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral iliofemoral and femoral popliteal deep venous thrombosis.
No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
Increased bibasilar atelectasis.
Bilateral frontal lobe lesions with surrounding edema as detailed above.
These lesions show interval bleeding since [**4-16**], [**2170**], as detailed above.
Hemorrhagic intracranial foci consistent with those seen on MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2170-5-17**] with surrounding parenchymal edema.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 yo male with metastatic melanoma who presented initially with bilateral DVTs.
Hospital course complicated by acute intracranial hemorrhage associated with metastases accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure and tachycardia.
DVT:  After discussion with neuro-onc, he was started on heparin GTT for anticoagulation given large clot burden.
That evening he exhibited neurologic changes and had an urgent MRI which showed ICH around a previous metastasis.
Protamine was recommended and he received vitamin K. Shortly thereafter he had hypoxic respiratory failure.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Acute onset with associated tachycardia, clear cxr, and known extensive DVTs were highly suspicious for PE even in the setting of known IVC filter.
No signs of aspiration, no wheezes to indicate bronchoconstriction, no obvious murmurs or cause for intracardiac shunt.
However, given ICH, he could receive no further anticoagulation.
Acute intracerebral hemorrhage: Pt had acute ICH in the setting of metastatic melanoma and supratherapeutic anticoagulation.
Pt then with altered mental status, aphasia, and right hemiparesis.
Because of his neurologic devastation and poor prognosis, the palliative care team spoke with his family and made the decision to be DNR/DNI with a focus on comfort measures only.
# Glaucoma: He was restarted on his glaucoma drops given concern that pt might not die immediately and that he could become blind in the interterm.
He was allowed to take sips of water with monitorring for signs of aspiration.
