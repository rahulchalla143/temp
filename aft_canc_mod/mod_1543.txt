Admission Date:  [**2192-10-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-11-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2121-4-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year-old male who presented to [**Hospital6 3872**] on the [**6-25**] with acute onset of shortness of breath.
The patient has a history of an myocardial infarction [**2192-9-21**].
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, critical aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared, dilated aortic root and noncritical lesions of his left main and his left anterior descending coronary artery.
History of aortic stenosis.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
At [**Hospital6 3872**] the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and the patient was placed on Amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d.
This is a 71 year-old male in no acute distress.
Lungs with bibasilar crackles right greater then left.
Heart regular rate and rhythm, 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.
Examination of his carotid showed a bilateral radiating murmur.
The patient has a history of leukocytosis with multiple documented white blood cell counts at [**Hospital6 3874**] of 29,000.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for workup for cardiac surgery.
The patient also underwent hematology workup prior to surgery for his history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and his leukocytosis.
Hematology felt that the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] was under good control and the patient was cleared for the Operating Room.
It was felt that his leukocytosis was due to his splenectomy and was not a factor in proceeding with surgery as the peripheral smear showed increased neutrophils.
The patient received multiple blood products and transfusions to control his bleeding in the Operating Room as well as postoperatively.
Hemodynamically the patient remained with an adequate cardiac output greater then 3 with a low systemic vascular resistance.
Hematology felt that his increasing leukocytosis was due to a postoperative leukemoid reaction from coronary artery bypass surgery and was not significant.
His white blood cell differential was significant for elevated neutrophils without a bandemia.
After his chest tubes were removed it was noted that the patient had moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage from the chest tube sites.
Chest x-ray was obtained, which showed a large cardiac silhouette and small bilateral pleural effusions.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and it was decided to obtain an echocardiogram to rule out the possibility of tamponade as the patient had a large amount of bleeding from his chest tube postoperatively.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2192-11-6**] postoperative day number five, which showed severely depressed left ventricular function, no pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
No rhonchi, rales or wheezes are present.
Sternal incision is without erythema.
There is a small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the superior portion of the sternal incision.
There is a small to moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage from the chest tube site.
Chest x-ray from [**2192-11-6**] shows cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged from x-ray of [**2192-11-5**].
Sputum culture [**2192-11-4**] showed mixed oral pharyngeal flora.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
