Admission Date:  [**2180-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-8-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Diffuse Pain and Lower Extremity and Urinary Sensory Changes  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy Endotracheal intubation   History of Present Illness: 64M Cantonese-Only Speaking H/O PUD w/ recent diagnosis of metastatic cancer (lungs, adrenals) admitted with abdominal, chest (non-radiating or exertional), thigh and lumbar back pain along with LE sensory changes.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-12-10**] (for a three day course) with weight loss, night sweats, right thigh pain and elevated WBC (to 44K).
He was diagnosed with likely metastatic lung cancer (to the adrenals) via chest imaging studies and preliminary adrenal biopsy results.
He was DCed with a pain management regimen.
Patient (per translation through his son) has had worsening pain (up to [**10-13**]) in his chest, back, and LEs since his DC.
He also report mild-moderate LLQ abdominal pain.
Of note, the patient reports persistent constipation, but no diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
He also has had progressive decreased sensation in his buttocks and posterior thighs along with progressive difficulty walking because of LE pain and numbness.
He also reports a lack of sensation upon initiating and mainting urination, but no bowel or bladder incontinence.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Cancer (Dx [**12/2180**]; Left Lung and B/L Adrenals), PUD (Dx [**2174**] via EGD with negative biopsy; H. Pylori Ab Positive).
GEN - SEVERE CACHEXIA.
NO RASH OR BRUISING.
HEENT - POOR DENTITION.
SEVERAL METAL TEETH.
NECK - NO MASSES.
BACK/CHEST - LEFT LAT RIB 3 CM CHEST WALL MASS (FIXED, FIRM).
DIFFUSE TENDERNESS OF RIBS.
MILD LUMBAR TENDERNESS.
CV - MILD TACHYCARDIA.
NML S1/S2 HEARD BEST WITH FORWARD LEANING.
ABD - IV/VI EPIGASTRIC BRUIT.
MILD LLQ TENDERNESS.
EXT - NO CCE.
This may represent a focal pneumonia.
However, an infrahilar mass with post obstructive atelectasis/ consolidation is another possibility.
Right infrahilar tumor mass, with probable lymphangitic spread of tumor in the right lower lobe.
Satellite lesions in the right lower lobe cannot be excluded.
Obstruction of the left lower lobe bronchus distal to the superior segment branch.
Nonspecific 5 mm peripheral nodule in the right upper lobe.
Bilateral adrenal masses, likely representing metastatic disease.
RIGHT FEMUR XR ([**2180-12-11**]): Five radiographs of the right femur demonstrate no acute fracture or osseous lesion.
No periosteal reaction or endosteal scalloping is detected.
No knee joint effusion detected.
LEFT ADRENAL BIOPSY ([**2180-12-10**]): A small cluster of atypical cells, which fail to mark with immunostain for pancytokeratin AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2.
The tumor cells show no nuclear immunoreactivity for TTF1 (lung and thyroid marker) with high background staining.
No immunoreactivity is seen for keratin (AE1/AE3; CAM 5.2), chromogranin, synaptophysin and inhibin.
A metastatic tumor can not be excluded.
CLINICAL DATA: 64 yo man with leukocytosis, new lung mass and bilateral adrenal masses, suspicious for metastatic lung ca.
ADDENDUM: The tumor cells show no nuclear immunoreactivity for TTF-1 (lung and thyroid marker) with high background staining.
Brief Hospital Course: During this admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a repeat bronchoscopy ([**12-27**]) with endobronchial biospy which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
CT head was negative for metastases and a bone scan, interestingly, was negative on [**12-27**].
Imaging of his abdomen and pelvis was also performed and revealed advanced, widespread metastatic disease with multiple large intra-abdominal masses, as well as a large, destructive lytic lesion involving the sacrum.
Extensive degenerative changes were also seen throughout the vertebral bodies.
Narcotic doses were escalated to optimize pain management.
Then, while on the floor, the patient developed tachycardia, initially felt to be secondary to hypovolemia and treated accordingly.
The tachycardia persisted.
The patient also developed acute renal failure, limiting diagnostic imaging studies.
He subsequently became tachycardic to the 140s, and desaturated down to the 70s.
On the floor, he continued to require increasing oxygen requirements, and heparin was started for presumed PE.
The patient became progressively cyanotic, with agonal breathing and was intubated.
He remained hypotensive and tachycardic.
Differential diagnosis included septic, hypovolemic, cardiogenic and obstructive shock.
A bedside echo revealed normal EF, no RV strain and no pericardial effusion.
Given the above, septic shock was felt to be the most likely etiology, with possible post-obstructive pneumonia given obstruction by tumor; concerns were also raised regarding tumor lysis in view of recent lab data with elevated K, phosphate, uric acid and low calcium.
Imaging studies revealed bilateral patchy opacities, worse versus AM, consistent with pulmonary edema +/- PNA.
Levophed was started, with marginal improvement.
He had ongoing acidosis on serial ABGs, along with hypoxemia (nadir pH 7.0) with PaO2 decreasing to less than 40 despite therapy and ventilator adjustments.
