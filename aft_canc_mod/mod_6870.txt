Admission Date:  [**2198-3-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2169-7-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname 53228**] [**Known lastname **] is a 29-year-old man with no relevant past medical history who had abnormal behaviors and a large left frontal lobe mass that was partially resected.
He slept on the floor, forgot to eat, and did not keep up with personal hygiene.
Per outside report, he also complained of headache for a few months as well.
There was no reported seizure activity.
He was found to have a large ill defined low attenuation mass in the left frontal lobe with associated mass effect resulting in significant right [**Hospital1 **] shift of normally mildline structures.
He does not have diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or COPD.
Family History: There are multiple family members with various cancers.
His paternal grandmother had pancreatic cancer, while his paternal great aunt had a cerebral tumor at the age of 89 years.
His maternal grandmother had diabetes mellitus.
Language:  No dysarthria appreciated however difficult to get patient to speak other than one word answers with poor comprehension apparent.
No abnormal movements or tremors.
Strength full power [**5-29**] throughout but difficult to fully/accurately assess due to inattention and poor comprehension.
Enlarging left frontotemporoparietal scalp subgaleal hemorrhagic collection.
Allowing for differences in modality and scan angulation, probable worsening further brain herniation through the large surgical defect.
Severe mass effect with 15 mm subfalcine herniation, also probably slightly worse, and similar effacement of the right and trapping of the left lateral ventricle.
No further uncal herniation or effacement of the basilar cisterns to indicate further downward transtentorial herniation.
Relatively small more acutely hemorrhagic focus in the right frontal lobe, as on the recent CT, with no additional hemorrhagic focus identified, and no further acute infarction.
The extent and the size of left-sided subgaleal collection is unchanged but the intrinsic density posteriorly is changed as described above.
Hypodensities in both frontal lobes and small foci of hemorrhage in the inferior right frontal lobe are unchanged.
New area of air is identified in the inferior left frontal lobe which is new which is better visualized on the current study and could be secondary to intervention.
Otherwise unchanged study with mass effect in the basal cisterns and the ventricles unchanged.
CT HEAD [**2198-3-20**] Two new foci of acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the rt.
No evidence of left or right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Significant accumulation of low-density fluid collection within the subcutaneous tissues abutting the craniectomy site.
No new regions of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
Low attenuating subacute to chronic right subdural hematoma does appear to have increased in size from prior exam as described above resulting in increased mass effect on the right and new marked worsening of leftward subfalcine herniation.
Continued involutional changes from prior ACA infarct and left MCA infarct.
EEG [**2198-3-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the right anterior temporal sharp waves, the right anterior temporal and frontal slowing, and the left hemisphere lower voltage and less well sustained posterior region.
The first abnormality suggests cortical irritability in the right anterior temporal region.
The second abnormality suggests subcortical dysfunction in the same region and the subcortical abnormality suggests a broadly distributed abnormality in the left hemisphere that may also be suggestive of thickened interface between the electrodes and the cortex such as a fluid collection.
EEG [**2198-3-5**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a moderately slow background throughout, consistent with an encephalopathy.
Medications (including propofol), metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There was some slowing in the left central region suggestive of artifact.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
Diffuse repolarization changes which are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-3-1**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Postoperative change underlying left frontoparietal craniotomy with persistent pneumocephalus and blood and edema in the surgical bed, unchanged.
Since the last exam, there has been an interval decrease in size of a right convexity subdural hematoma.
Evolving infarcts in the right ACA distribution and left temporal lobe.
No new large territorial infarct identified.
Right ventriculostomy catheter with unchanged caliber of the ventricular system with persistent ventricular blood as described.
HEAD MRI [**2198-3-3**] 1) Status post resection of a frontal lobe mass.
Residual mass is identified to the right of midline.
There is new infarct seen in the right anterior cerebral artery region along the midline frontal lobe and also in the left temporal region.
Residual enhancement is difficult to assess in absence of post-gadolinium T1 images but appears much decreased since the previous study.
Significant accumulation of low-density fluid collection within the subcutaneous tissues abutting the craniectomy site.
No new regions of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
Low attenuating subacute to chronic right subdural hematoma does appear to have increased in size from prior exam as described above resulting in increased mass effect on the right and new marked worsening of leftward subfalcine herniation.
Continued involutional changes from prior ACA infarct and left MCA infarct.
Status post resection of mass in the left frontotemporoparietal region with perilesional parenchymal hemorrhage and edema.
Evaluation for residual tumor is limited on the noncontrast CT, but better evaluated on the MR of [**2198-3-3**].
Expected evolution of infarcts in the bilateral ACA and inferior division, left MCA distribution.
Stable position of right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with near complete interval resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Status post resection of mass in the left frontotemporoparietal region with perilesional parenchymal hemorrhage and edema.
Evaluation for residual tumor is limited on the noncontrast CT, but better evaluated on the MR of [**2198-3-3**].
Expected evolution of infarcts in the bilateral ACA and inferior division, left MCA distribution.
Stable position of right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with near complete interval resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-3**] Status post resection of a frontal lobe mass.
Residual mass is identified to the right of midline.
There is new infarct seen in the right anterior cerebral artery region along the midline frontal lobe and also in the left temporal region.
Residual enhancement is difficult to assess in absence of post- gadolinium T1 images but appears much decreased since the previous study.
Interval decrease in mass effect with persistent entrapment of the right lateral ventricle.
Interval development of intraventricular hemorrhage and inferior left frontal lobe hemorrhage, likely related to surgery.
Please note, this study does not evaluate for residual neoplasm.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2198-3-1**] Large ill-defined low attenuation mass centered in the left frontotemporal lobe with resulting rightward shift of midline structures, entrapment of the right lateral ventricle and obliteration of the suprasellar cistern suggestive of downward herniation.
Differential consideration for this mass favor primary neoplasm of the brain.
Recommend further evaluation with MRI.
FINAL PATHOLOGY: Overall the features are most consistent with GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME, possibly small cell variant.
Supratentorial PNET, and the recently described and somewhat controversial entity of "malignant glioneuronal tumor" would also be a considerations in light of the scattered synaptophysin reactivity and relatively weak GFAP.
scattered positive tumor cells [**Last Name (un) **] ??????
?20% EMA ??????
scattered large positive cells, possibly reactive cells.
INI-1 is recommended to exclude a unusual AT/RT;  Olig 2 and EGFR-CISH would be confirmatory of high grade glioma if positive, and highly amplified, respectively.

He was found to have a large ill defined low attenuation mass in the left frontal lobe with associated mass effect resulting in significant right [**Hospital1 **] shift of normally midline structures.
His hospital course is also complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage, bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarct, and left middle cerebral artery infarct.
On hospital day 18/POD 17 he was having fevers as high as 101.9 F.  Cultures were sent.
Significant on this day also was increase in subgaleal fluid collection which was evaluated by the attending.
On [**2198-3-27**] the patient's family, after meeting extensively with social work decided that they would like to initiate the first round of therapy and also requested another meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26803**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] to pose additional questions about prognosis of this tumor and whether there are any experimental therapies or trials that [**Known firstname 53228**] could be enrolled in.
An MRI done on [**2198-3-29**] showed an enlarged left frontotemporoparietal scalp subgaleal hemorrhagic collection.
Due to this infection, chemotherapy was not an option due to risk of overwhelming infection and likely death after chemotherapy.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Brain Tumor (PNET or Glioblastoma Multiforme) Left Middle Cerbral Artery Infarct Post-op anemia / transfused Right Anterior Cerebral Artery Infarct Post-op Fever Vancomycin resistant enterococcus infection of left scalp subgaleal hemorrhage  Discharge Condition: Expired.
