Pt was also found to have infected pleural effusion with GPC's, and a UTI with klebsiella.
Pt also developed ATN with anuria and progressive renal failure.
The patient had multiple organ systems failing, with multiple critical issues, in the setting of incurable lung cancer.
A long discussion was held with her family on [**4-12**] via interpreter, and there was concensus that pt would not want aggressive care; comfort care only was pursued.
The patient's symptoms were addressed with medications to dry oral secretions for improved respiratory comfort, her pleurex catheter was drained daily initially, and then every other day once the drainage decreased, and she was started on a fentanyl patch to treat her L chest pain at the site of the pleurex.
She became increasingly somnolent, likely due to her renal failure, and she passed away peacefully on [**4-19**].
