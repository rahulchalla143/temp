A nasogastric lavage was negative for blood or coffee-grounds material.
Terminal metastatic prostate cancer with metastases to the liver and bone and extensive pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
History of congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was a pale Russian-speaking gentleman.
The abdomen revealed bilateral small masses in the lower quadrants.
No tenderness on palpation.
No distention.
Rectal examination revealed guaiac-positive black stool.
Skin examination revealed a maculopapular erythematous rash in the inguinal and pelvic regions.
Urinalysis was cloudy with moderate leukocyte esterase, large blood, positive nitrites, and greater than 50 white blood cells.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 85, with left axis deviation, and nonspecific lateral T wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed low lung volumes.
No definite congestive heart failure.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis at the lung bases.
The patient was seen by the Gastroenterology Service and underwent an urgent upper endoscopy which revealed esophagitis and diffuse ulcerative gastritis which was felt to be the likely cause of the patient's gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
The patient was placed on a twice per day proton pump inhibitor and was started on sucralfate for treatment of his gastric ulcerations.
If he does tolerate it then we can cont to taper very slowly over several weeks as this may contribute to an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
If he does have increased symptoms it shoudl be continued.
The patient's Coumadin should not be restarted as he has had a very high risk of recurrent bleeding.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was initially extremely hypotensive with a blood pressure of 68/40.
The patient received rapid volume resuscitation.
His Coumadin was discontinued due to his gastrointestinal bleed and increased risk for recurrent bleeding.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient has terminal metastatic prostate cancer.
He was most recently admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center where he was found to have mild hydronephrosis and a creatinine in the low 2 range.
His urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**] knows the patient well and felt that ureteral stents were not indicated in this patient until he has complete obstruction or becomes septic.

METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER ISSUES:  After a discussion with the patient's primary urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**], it was discovered that the patient was in the terminal stage of the prostate cancer.
There were no further treatments for his prostate cancer.
The patient was placed on 20 mg of prednisone daily by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**] for symptomatic relief in end-stage prostate cancer.
If the patient tolerates it,the dose will be tapered as it was felt the patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleed is increased by his continued use of steroids.
ORAL THRUSH ISSUES:  The patient was found to have oral thrush and was started on Nystatin swish-and-swallow.
GROIN RASH ISSUES:  The patient was felt to have a candidal intertriginous infection on the groin and was started on miconazole and Nystatin powders.
INFERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME:  The patient had a significant amount of bilateral lower extremity and scrotal edema which was felt to be due to his inferior vena cava syndrome.
