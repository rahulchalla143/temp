History of Present Illness: This is a 76-year-old man with DM II, ESRD on HD via LUE AV fistula, AAA, carotid disease, MSSA bacteremia of unclear source, recently admitted for hypotension and complete heart block treated with a permanent pacemaker.
Patient now returns to [**Hospital1 18**] with aletered mental status and hypoxemia.
Was reportedly having labored breathing.
Complained of an odd feeling in his stomach.
Patient was only 1.5KG over dry weight, so only small amount of fluid removed.
Became increasinly confused and changed to 100% NRB.
By report from the family, patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 7362**] and discharged day before admission for hypotension with demand ischemia.
According to family, patient has been confused intermittently for several months.
Belly was soft but patient complained of abdominal pain.
LLE erythema w/o tenderness.
EKG -> sinus tachycardia w/ atrial sensing and V-pacing.

-Remote history of nephrolithiasis.
-Hypertension -Peripheral vascular disease s/p left [**Doctor Last Name **]-dp bypass -carotid stenosis -infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm -deep venous thrombosis in [**2195**] -iron deficiency anemia -recent episode of aphasia which resolved - ?
TIA -Prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy -?Pulmonary hypertension -Uses home oxygen of 2L NC, normally sats 84-86% as per family  Social History: Quit smoking at age 73.
No alcohol or illicit drug use.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.1 BP: 136/77 P: 83 R:24 O2: 100% on 2L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera slightly icteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Supple; no JVP appreciated Lungs:  Clear bilaterally with decreased sounds at bases CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Distended, +BS, tympanic, no organomegally appreciate (but difficult exam) Ext: 1+ edema bilaterally; left second toe is bandaged (bandage is clean, dry, and intact).
Within that limitation, there is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
A 6-mm hyperdense lesion at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] appears stable as compared to prior exams, consistent with a colloid cyst.
Prominent ventricles are essentially stable, without evidence of acute hydrocephalus.
Sulci are prominent, compatible with age-related involutional change.
There is extensive subcortical and periventricular white matter hypoattenuation, consistent with small vessel ischemic disease, unchanged.
A hypodense focus is noted in the right lentiform nucleus, consistent with lacune versus prominent perivascular space.
Within significant limitation by motion artifacts, paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear relatively aerated.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Stable 6 mm colloid cyst and stable appearance of prominent ventricle without evidence of hydrocephalus.
Extensive small vessel ischemic disease and age-related involutional change.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
Overall stable appearance of a fusiform AAA since [**Month (only) 404**] [**2197**], continues to measure 5 cm in diameter.
No evidence of current rupture.
Extensive atherosclerotic vascular disease with two penetrating thoracic aortic ulcers, one of which is increased in size as compared to [**2197**].
12-month followup is recommended to document resolution or stability.
Right lung base linear densities are unchanged since [**2198**], most consistent with chronic fibrotic changes.
Perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
Nodular liver contour suggests cirrhosis.
Heterogeneous-appearing thyroid with a possible subcentimeter nodule and punctate calcification on the left.
Nonspecific mild stable pancreatic ductal dilatation.
No obstructive or mass lesion identified.
Atrophic kidneys consistent with history of end-stage renal disease.
Unchanged occlusion of the left renal artery, unchanged since [**2197**].
ECHO [**2200-3-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
These findings are nonspecific and could be related to third spacing versus renal failure.
Therefore, at this time, a HIDA scan is recommended for further evaluation, if clinical suspicion warrants.
Mild splenomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76-year-old man w/ CAD, AAA, MSSA bacteremia, and pulmonary hypertension who presents with confusion and hypoxemia.
Likely Mr. [**Known lastname **] has some underlying dementia with superimposed delirium in the setting of frequent hospitalizations and medicalizations.
Also possible that there are metabolic derrangements in the setting of frequent dialysis.
Patient will follow-up with geriatrics as an outpatient for neuro-psychiatric testing.
He was given low-dose haldol (~0.5mg) as needed for agitation.
# HYPOXIA/PULMONARY HYPERTENSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted because of hypoxia (O2 sats in the 80s) during a dialysis session.
#DYSSYNCHRONY ON ECHO:  As per echocardiogram performed during admission, there is dyssynchrony between native heart beat and pacemaker.
Electrophysiology was consulted who made some changes to pacemaker setting with moderate effect.
CAD/TROPONIN ELEVATION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin elevation on admission--however, troponin was lower than on admission [**Hospital1 **] the week before (at [**Hospital1 3597**], troponin was 8.9).
Likely patient had a missed MI or troponin leak in setting of hypotension prior to arrival at [**Hospital3 7362**].
Throughout admission, patient had no ECG changes to suggest ischemia, and no new chest pain.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Patient had a rapidly dropping platelet count, ever since being started on cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia in early [**Month (only) 958**].
Patient had no signs or symptoms of bleeding throughout admission.
# MSSA BACTEREMIA:  Patient with MSSA bacteremia found on recent admission in [**2200-2-10**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not have a fever or elevated white count during hospitalziation.
Patient was given low-dose haldol as needed for agitation (can be changed to an anti-psychotic with fewer extrapyramidal side effects if [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body is suspected) and will follow-up with geriatrics as an outpatient.
# ESRD ON HD:  Patient will continue on dialysis Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Hypoxia (resolved) 2.
Thrombocytopenia 3.
MSSA bacteremia 4.
Delirium .
HTN 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Dementia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You came to the hospital because of low oxygen levels at dialysis.
You were found to have low platelets and your Cefazolin was switched to Vancomycin.
