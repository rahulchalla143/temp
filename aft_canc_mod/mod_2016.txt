He ruled out for myocardial infarction there and then underwent stress testing revealing reversible ischemia.
He proceeded to catheterization at [**Hospital 40262**] Hospital revealing three vessel coronary artery disease on [**2141-10-27**] with an 80% mid right coronary artery stenosis, 80% posterior descending coronary artery, 80% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, 60% mid left anterior descending coronary artery, 60% D1 and a 30% left main lesion.
On [**2141-11-4**] he developed recurrent chest pain with anterolateral ST depressions and ruled in with a troponin of 3.55 and CK 199.
Cardiac catheterization subsequently revealed a 90% left anterior descending coronary artery lesion at the origin of the D1, 80% distal left circumflex lesion, 80% acute marginal lesion, the left anterior descending coronary artery lesion underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting with a resultant jailed D1.
The patient was hypertension during most of the procedure and for this received intravenous nitroglycerin.
He also received Lasix 80 mg intravenous for shortness of breath during the case and had a good response.
At the end of the case the patient developed hypotension with a drop in the systolic blood pressure to the 60s, nitroglycerin was discontinued.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed in the catheterization laboratory that ruled out a pericardial effusion.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a fifty year history of heavy pipe smoking.
His father died at age 57 of an myocardial infarction.
Heart regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 with no audible extra heart sounds.
Extremities no edema with 2+ distal pulses.
Groin sties are stable bilaterally with a left femoral IABP and right femoral PA catheter.
Electrocardiogram post catheterization sinus tachycardia at 113 beats per minute, axis negative 45 with normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in lead 2, loss of R wave V1 to V3 with poor R wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 21207**] suffered an anteroseptal myocardial infarction evidenced by loss of R waves on his electrocardiogram from V1 to V3.
On [**2141-11-7**] he underwent repeat transthoracic echocardiogram, which demonstrated EF 30%, slightly enlarged left atrium, no left ventricular hypertrophy, no left ventricular thrombus.
There was severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum, basal anterior and distal inferior walls.
There was akinesis of the distal septum and distal two thirds of the anterior wall and apex as well as 1+ mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.
The patient did well following transfer to the cardiac step down unit and on [**2141-11-10**] was without complaints and was freely ambulatory and tolerating a po diet.
Nitroglycerin sublingual 0.4 mg sublingual prn chest pain, take one sublingual for chest discomfort every five minutes as needed.
Anteroseptal acute myocardial infarction.
