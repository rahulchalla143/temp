High density nodules and multiple ill-defined hypodensities scattered throughout the brain, suggestive of a metastatic process.
Very small (approximately 1 mm) right extra-axial fluid collection, with associated mild edema of the right hemisphere, but without midline shift.
[**11-24**] CXR: New moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Atelectasis at left base.
[**11-25**] Head CT: No interval change in the appearance of the brain.
Unchanged appearance of multiple high attenuation lesions scattered within the brain concerning for metastasis.
There is again seen a large right-sided pleural effusion likely layering and a left-sided pleural effusion which is moderated sized.
There is no evidence for overt pulmonary edema.
Underlying pneumonia would be difficult to exclude given the retrocardiac opacity and the large pleural effusions.
ECHO: [**12-6**]: Conclusions: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size  and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT Head [**2137-12-5**]: FINDINGS: There is a new moderate sized mixed density subdural fluid collection on the right.
The lateral ventricle is completely compressed indicating mass effect from the subdural fluid collection as well as a 3 mm shift of the normally midline structures.
The mixed intensity of the collection likely consists of blood and other fluid given the mixed densities.
The previously identified high-density lesions are subsiding indicating that these were most likely hemorrhages rather than amyloid angiopathy.
CT Head [**2137-12-6**]: There is no change in the size or configuration of the right-sided subdural hemorrhage.
The hematoma extends under the right temporal lobe, which is slightly elevated and medially displaced.
There is mild shift of midline structures to the left, unchanged since the previous day's examination.
CT Head [**2137-12-9**]: IMPRESSION: Stable right subdural hematoma with slight progression of mass effect and shift of midline structures.
CT Head: [**2137-12-18**]: IMPRESSION: Slightly improved right subdural hematoma and associated mass effect, with lessened contralateral shift of normally midline structures.

Subdural hematoma:  Hemorrhage occurred in the setting of mechanical fall.
On day three he developed neurologic changes of increased lethargy and dysarthria.
Findings were consistent with Dilantin toxicity.
His head CT showed multiple lesions concerning for mets disease.
It was unclear whether these lesions could be due to his CLL/PLL or due to his remote history of nonmetastic resected melanoma.
He had a brain MR that showed a single parietal lesion concerning for mets.
The other lesions were read as consistent with amyloid angiopathy.
A repeat head CT on [**2137-12-5**] showed new midline shift and rebleed (unclear of duration) without herniation.
Neurosurgery was consulted and patient was not a surgical candidate because of his comorbidities and the size of the lesion.
In addition, his thrombocytopenia introduced a substantial bleeding risk if any drains were placed in his head.
On [**2137-12-9**], another head CT showed no interval changes in the midline shift, but worsening mass effect.
Throughout the hospitalization, he was transfused platelet products for counts <50 to minimize worsening of his intracranial hemorrhage.
He underwent leukophoresis several times here with reductions in his WBC to usually < 300K.
While the family was advised about the significant risks (inlcuding worsening of his ascites and the mass effect in his brain) regarding the administration of this drug in the face of his multiple medical comorbidities, they still requested that this drug be given.
A short wait period was done to assess his response to the campath.
# ID issues: - Bacteroides and Citrobacter in 2 different blood cultures - on Vanco and ceftaz/flagyl and caspo, ganciclovir - [**12-10**]: switched [**Last Name (un) 2830**] to ceftaz - CMV VL [**Numeric Identifier 961**] on [**2137-12-4**]: started on Ganciclovir -> [**12-7**]: VL 7670  - CMV VL on [**12-14**]->2050 - patient was cultured significant temperature spikes.
# Bilateral malignant pleural effusions.
- Thoracentesis [**2137-12-3**]: 1.5L  by IP service - CXR: [**2137-12-9**]: A moderate right and small left pleural effusion are stable.
- CXR: [**12-12**]: b/l layering pleural effusions and perihilar edema  .
On [**11-16**] pt developed persistent bleeding at site of phereis catheter.
Transfused 3 u platelets, 2 u FFP, 2 u cryoprecipitate c improvement in clinical symptoms and improvement in DIC labs.
This likely accounts for his petechial rash.
Renal ultrasound obtained to r/o post renal etiology.
Unclear cause - possibly secondary to leukemic infiltration vs. previous TLS.
Dry on physical exam; may represent some component of pre-renal azotemia.
- U Na - 28, U Cr - 124, FeNA = .21%; c/w prerenal azotemia - renal u/s showing no obstruction - Cr 2.9 on [**2137-12-7**]: decreased ganciclovir on [**12-6**]; decreased spironolactone on [**2137-12-7**] -> Cr 2.7 on [**12-16**] .
Skin:  patient has rash [**1-2**] lymphoma per oncology; also with diffuse petechiae.
It was reiterated multiple times that he had multiorgan failure and that there was only a small chance that he could recover from his illness.
In the AM of [**12-19**], the patient passed after worsening respiratory status for the last few days of his life.
