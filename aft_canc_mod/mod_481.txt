She was found to be neutropenic, anemia and thrombocytopenic.
There is also a concern for possible confusion and urine incontinence.
Per patient, she is has not experienced any confusion, and was refusing to cooperate for the last few days because she was angry that her physicians have not been forthcoming with her prognosis.
She is usually incontinent of bowel and bladder, and denies diarrhea, abdominal pain, brbpr, melena, dysuria, or hematuria.
She has not felt any fevers or chills and has otherwise been feeling fine and had been expecting to be discharged from rehab on Sunday.
She was diagnosed with orthostasis/autonomic dysfunction and deconditioning and discharged to rehab.
CT head was negative for an acute process.
[**2119-1-20**]: Presented with ear complaints and nasal congestion, initially thought to be related to swimmer's ear.
She was given a course of antibiotics and nasal sprays with no resolution.
Symptoms evolved to include pain with mouth opening and ultimately jaw restriction; right jaw area seemed swollen.
CT sinus/mandible scan on [**2119-1-26**] showed an irregular lucency in the right mandibular ramus.
[**2119-2-10**] biopsy by FNA showed groups of atypical epithelial cells consistent with poorly-differentiated carcinoma.
A PET scan on [**2119-2-10**] showed a left lower lobe lung mass, a left pleural lesion, a dome of the liver lesion and the right mandibular ramus.
On [**2119-2-13**], the left lung lesion was biopsied and showed adenocarcinoma with immunostaining positive for Cytokeratin 7 in the tumor cells, but negative for cytokeratin 20, CDX-2, TTF-1, Mammoglobin, GCDFP, ER and PR immunostains.
Stopped due to progression seen in by new liver and brain mets.
-Smoking Hx: Never -Alcohol Use: 1 glass red wine per night -Recreational Drug Use: None   Family History: Mother had breast cancer at age 85.

No acute process.
Known metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 65F w/ h/o metastatic breast cancer to brain & lungs presenting with neutropenic fever, anemia and thrombocytopenia.
# Neutropenic fever: admitted for febrile neutropenia (temp 100.6 in ED, ANC 38).
denied all symptoms including subjective fevers.
started empirically on vanc/cefepime and pancultured but no obvious source for infection was found, cultures were neg, and CXR negative initially.
CXR showed new area suspicious for pneumonia so coverage broadened to vanc/zosyn to cover anaerobes.
The following day she desatted to 70s and became tachycardic to 140s.
# Respiratory Distress: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patients antibiotic coverage was adjusted.
The following morning, the patient continued to have difficulty breathing and was increasingly altered mental status.
# Anemia: Thought to be secondary to chemotherapy.
# Metastatic breast cancer to liver, lungs, brain: pt was undergoing chemo at the time of admission.
# Falls: Pt has a history of falls with negative neurologic work up.
Thought to be multifactorial, [**2-21**] possible seizures, deconditioning, and orthostasis/autonomic dysfunction.
