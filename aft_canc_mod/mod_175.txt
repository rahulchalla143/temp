Admission Date:  [**2177-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-9-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: This is an 86 y/o man with h/o CLL, CABG, and mitral valve replacement who presents with weakness and SOB for 3 days.
He lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility and was being visited by his son thought he looked very out of breath and weak.
He insisted that he see his doctor, who noted the pt to be tachypnic to 36 and tachycardic to 107, and sent pt to the ED for evaluation.
He recieved IVF and a dose of levofloxacin for RUL pneumonia confirmed by CXR.
Past Medical History: Acute rheumatic fever, which then required mitral valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]) CLL (dx [**2175**]/[**2176**]) Three-vessel CABG for coronary artery disease Hyperlipidemia Skin cancer  Social History: The patient is a widower and former [**Company 378**] electronics mechanic.
Lungs: +sternal wound scar, decreased breath sounds on RUL, rhonchi heard 1/2 up lungs b/l.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2177-9-17**]: CXR SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Extensive opacity of the right upper lobe is consistent with pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
Blunting of the left CP angle could be pleural thickening of chronic small pleural effusion.
Air space consolidation involving the right upper lobe, densest peripherally not significantly different compared to yesterday's study.
Taking into account head position, slight leftward tracheal deviation below the thoracic inlet is unchanged as far back as the patient's first study from [**2176-7-17**].
CONCLUSION: No significant interval radiographic change in right upper lobe pneumonia.
[**2177-9-19**]: CXR FINDINGS: Lung volumes are slightly diminished.
There is relatively stable right upper lobe consolidation consistent with lobar pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Within differences of inspiratory effort, the right upper lobe lobar pneumonia is stable.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is seen.
Again seen is pleural thickening along left mid and lower chest walls.
No gross right effusion.
[**2177-9-22**]: CXR FINDINGS: Since prior examination, there has been no significant interval change.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No evidence of CHF or pulmonary edema.
Small right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right upper lobe pneumonia, without significant interval changes.
No evidence of CHF or pulmonary edema.
[**2177-9-22**]: CT Chest IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia, including right upper lobe consolidation and early right lower lobe consolidation.
Left basilar opacity may represent atelectasis or another focus of consolidation.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia and initially treated with levofloxacin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin.
On hospital day #2, the patient was noted to have an increasing O2 requirement (satting low 80s on 10L NC) and an ABG ABG 7.47/33/63 on 95% fm.
He was transferred to the MICU and did well, with progressing decrease in O2 requirement, and urine Legionella antigen was found positive.
While on the floor, the patient began to develop an increased O2 requirement.
The etiology of his increased requirement was thought to be multifactorial: anemia secondary to CLL, RUL and RLL legionella PNA, and mild CHF (further discussion of problems below).
On repeat CXR, the patient was found to have multifocal PNA, spreading to RLL as well.
The patient also developed symptoms of mild CHF, most likely secondary to his decreased EF (last checked in [**2176**] was 40-45%) and volume overload.
Upon discharge, the patient was satting 97% on RA and had no symptoms of shortness of breath.
His lung exam findings had considerably improved with crackles limited to the bases of the lung fields.
2. afib/CVS: The patient had an extensive prior history of cardiovascular disease, including CAD with CABG and mitral valve replacement secondary to rheumatic fever.
During his hospital course, he developed crackles in the bases of the lungs, increased O2 requirement, and although no indication of CHF on CXR, he was found to have an elevated BNP.
The diagnosis of mild CHF was made and he was treated with furosemide PRN.
He responded well, with improved oxygenation as he became euvolemic and his PNA improved.
This episode of mild CHF was thought to be due to an episode of atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was most likely secondary to infection and increased metabolic demands.
His Atenolol was changed to metoprolol as the patient has chronic renal insufficiency.
The dose was steadily increased to 100 mg PO BID for rate control.
Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia with Hct ranging from 24-30.
The anemia is likely secondary to CLL.
He was treated with iron supplementation and was transfused with three units PRBCs to increase his 02 carrying capacity in the setting of severe PNA.
During his hospital course, the patient was found to have increasing Cr levels, highest at 2.3.
Although legionella can cause renal failure, pre-renal azotemia was thought to be the cause of this patient's acute renal failure.
Upon discharge, his renal failure was improving with a Cr of 1.8 and he was thought to be back to his baseline.
Thrush:  During the hospital stay the patient developed dry mouth with some irritation.
Upon visual inspection, he was noted to have white exudate on the internal buccal mucosa.
The development of thrush is presumably due to the patient's immunocompromised state secondary to his CLL.
CLL: Patient's diff is 90% lymphocytes which is consistent with CLL.
The infection with legionella PNA was thought to be attributable to the patients immunocompromised status secondary to his CLL.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for mouth irritation/white exudate for 7 days: Please take for mouth irritation or white exudate.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Legionella Pneumonia new onset atrial fibrillation .
Secondary: CAD s/p 3vessel CABG Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma acute Rheumatic Fever -> s/p mitral valve replacement hyperlipidemia Sq cell skin CA removed from scalp [**5-10**]   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: Please call you PCP or return to the ER if you experience increasing shortness of breath, lightheadedness, chest pain or any other symptoms that concern you.
