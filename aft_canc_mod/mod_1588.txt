He was sent for a CT of the chest [**2182-1-18**] which revealed findings consistent with lung cancer in the left field with metastases to the right lung, liver, bones and likely adrenal glands.
The cytology from the pleural effusion showed adenocarcinoma with immunostains of the tumor cells positive for CK7, [**Last Name (un) **]-31 and TTF-1.
He subsequently underwent MR of the head and thoracic spine on [**2182-1-30**] which showed diffuse metastasis.
He went to [**Hospital **] clinic this afternoon with progressive worsening of dyspnea.
Had 2 L taken off and was direct admitted to floor for observation overnight and plan for pleuradesis or possible pleurex cath placement in the morning with subsequent transfer to OMED.
He had minimal pain at the site of the thoracentesis.

Acute pulmonary embolus in the right main pulmonary artery with extension to the right upper, right middle, and right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries.
Additionally, there is a focal opacity in the right lower lobe which can be representative of a developing infarct versus a developing pneumonia.
Large left perihilar mass with extension and circumscription to all lobes of the left lung and complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
Evidence of lymphangitic carcinomatosis is visualized in the left upper lobe.
Two right lower lobe nodules which may be representative of metastatic foci, but are of unclear etiology.
Additionally, there is thickening of the anterior right pleura, which may be representative of a metastatic focus.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Although severely limited evaluation of the abdominal structures, the non-opacified visualized portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates a hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver which may be representative of a metastatic focus.
Further characterization with a dedicated abdominal study is recommended.
[**2182-2-1**] LENIs Left peroneal vein thrombosis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
[**2182-2-1**] CXR: FINDINGS: There continues to be large left pleural effusion and there is a new right pleural effusion.
There is hazy vasculature bilaterally, left greater than right, compatible with fluid overload.
There continues to be some rightward mediastinal shift similar compared to the film from the prior day.
[**2182-2-2**] CXR: FINDINGS: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with mediastinal shift towards the left.
This is compatible with increased fluid and associated volume loss.
IMPRESSION: Increased collapse of the left lung with complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
[**2182-2-3**] CXR: Compared to the prior study, there is no significant interval change in complete opacification of the left hemithorax and mediastinal shift to the left.
There is a right lower lobe infiltrate, similar in size compared to the study from the prior day.
[**2182-2-11**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
The scattered small metastases which were previously seen on MRI are not visualized on CT, even after the administration of intravenous contrast.
No fracture is identified.
No acute intracranial process.
Known small metastases which were visualized on the recent MRI are not visualized on this exam.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year-old male with stage IV lung CA with brain metastases initially admitted directly from [**Hospital **] clinic for enlarging left-sided malignant effusion and hypoxemia, admitted to the ICU for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, then transferred to the oncology service.
# Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma:  Cytology-confirmed diagnosis with widespread metastases, a tumor in the perihilar region of the left lung causing collapse and recurrent malignant effusions made his prognosis particularly poor.
In addition to an essentially non-functional left lung, his right lung was compromised with a pulmonary embolism in the main right pulmonary artery (see below).
In addition to management of his hypoxia and shortness of breath, the patient was initiated on chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed in an attempt to reduce his disease burden in the lung and thus reduce his symptoms.
# Nausea:  The patient experienced nausea for several days following chemotherapy.
# Pleural effusion:  The patient was first noted to have a left pleural effusion in late [**Month (only) 404**].
# Pulmonary embolism:  The patient was found to have a pulmonary embolism in the right lung.
TTE showed severe pulmonary artery hypertension, likely representing the conditions in both lungs creating back-pressure.
After weighing the risks/benefits of starting anticoagulation, it was determined that starting a heparin gtt with close monitoring was indicated at this time despite the known risk of intracranial bleeding from metastases.
His blood pressure was maintained below SBP 140 and DBP 110 to help prevent intracranial bleeding.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was found to be elevated to 1.3, thought to be due to hypovolemia.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal process.
# Hypertension:  Good SBP control will be important for him to prevent catastrophic ICH.
In the two days prior to discharge, his BP dropped slightly necessitating reduced regimen.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with family # COMM: patient, wife .
