Right upper lobe opacity is little less apparent than on the prior examination.
Remainder of the appearances of the lung fields are essentially unchanged with no acute process identified.
Mild distension of visualized colon.
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Cat Scan - CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate two noncalcified lung nodules in the right middle lobe measuring 9 mm and right lower lobe measuring 4 mm (S2, I1).
Atelectatic changes in the dependent portions are noted.
The previously described mass in the right upper lobe is excluded in this study.
There is no pleural effusion.
Coronary artery calcifications.
The liver is diffusely hypodense consistent with fatty infiltration.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no hydronephrosis.
Small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted, not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.
Persistent diffuse dilatation of large and small bowel with an area of change of caliber at the junction of the descending colon and sigmoid.
When compared to the prior study, the degree of dilatation appears slightly worse.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76 year old female admitted with persistent abdominal pain and bloating from [**Hospital **] Rehab.
By CT - shows stricture in the sigmoid region as well as an upper R lung mass.
Postoperative course complicated by tachycardia, respiratory failure, nonoperative lung mass, urinary tract infection, several admissions to ICU for tachycardia and respiratory difficulty.
Cardiology Consult - Postoperatively patient had several periods where she became tachycardic 130's she remained tachycardic after fluid resuscitation and no longer febrile.
Thoracics Consult - nonoperative lung mass, small cell lung cancer to be followed up with radiation/oncologist - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for radiation treatments.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
