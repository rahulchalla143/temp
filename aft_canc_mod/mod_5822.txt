Admission Date:  [**2185-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-11-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-11-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Darvocet-N 100  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: Fever, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP ([**2185-11-7**]) PICC line placement ([**2185-11-10**])  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 6357**] is a 71F with stage 4 pancreatic head cancer s/p biliary stenting [**10/2185**] presenting with fevers at home.
She reports that otherwise she felt OK, her ROS is only notable for one episode of vomiting yesterday.
She denies any chills, night sweats, abdominal pain, increase in frequency of stools, change in skin color, confusion, or increased pruritis.
She also denies any new cough, dysuria, frequency or polyuria.
Notably, she had some episodes of SVT in the ED to 150s, with associated hypotension to the 70s/50s.
These episodes reverted spontaneously within ~30seconds before any treatments or EKGs could be initiated Her exam was notable for RUQ tenderness.
Laboratory data was notable for an increase in her transaminases and alkaline phosphatase.
Urinalysis was negative, blood and urine cultures were sent.
A RUQ ultrasound showed expected pneumobilia with pancreatic ductal dilation.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed proper stent placement with biliarly ductal dilation, and incidental cecal thickening.

Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Never smoked, no etoh in 30+ years, no tobacco; lives at home independently although her daughter has been staying with her since her discharge from the hospital.
Family History: Brother with pancreatic cancer  Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T 98.8, 71, 136/41, 96% RA GENERAL: NAD, lying in bed in bed.
No conjunctival pallor.
mild icterus.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ DP pulses.
AV fistula with bruit on left arm SKIN: No obvious jaundice PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant CN intact.
Pertinent Results: PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA: [**2185-11-6**] 3:10 pm BLOOD CULTURE    Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
There is accentuation of the pulmonary vascular markings with crowding of vascular structures, likely due to low lung volumes.
Lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.
Chronic thickening of the left pleura is again noted.
Known mass in the head of the pancreas is suboptimally evaluated in the absence of IV contrast.
Stent in expected location of the distal common bile duct is probably patent, given presence of pneumobilia.
Mild biliary ductal dilatation.
Adjacent duodenal wall thickening may be due to underdistention, however, inflammatory changes and/or tumor involvement is not excluded.
Cecal wall thickening is nonspecific and could be due to inflammatory or infectious reasons.
Redemonstration of a known pancreatic head mass with distal pancreatic atrophy and pancreatic duct dilatation.
CBD stent not visualized, however, presence of pneumobilia suggests patency of the stent.
Mild biliary ductal dilatation.
Left lobe hepatic hyperechoic lesion measures slightly larger today, and may be due the technical reasons; this probably represents hemangioma, however, a metastatic lesion not excluded in the setting of malignancy.
Subsequent images show cannulation and opacification of the common bile duct with a mild diffuse dilatation.
Irregular filling defects are seen in the common bile duct during its course through the metallic stent.
There are no other filling defects and there are no strictures.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid inferior and inferolateral segments.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetation, abscess or significant valvular regurgitation seen.
Moderate symmetric LVH with mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
No evidence of acute pneumonia or other cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer presented with fevers, vomiting, and abdominal pain on [**2185-11-6**].
Bacteremia:  On admission, patient was febrile to 102.5 found to have RUQ tenderness.
Given known pancreatic head mass and evidence of ductal dilatation on CT, concern for ascending cholangitis.
Blood cultures ([**12-1**] set) grew out GNR within first 24 hours.
On day 1 of admission, patient underwent ERCP with debris extraction from major papilla stent.
Sensitivities revealed E coli sensitive to only Zosyn; further antibiotic sensitivities are pending.
Given history of pencillin allergy (anaphylaxis) in [**2174**] and unclear history regarding whether patient has received penicillins since that time, patient was transferred to MICU for pencillin desensitization.
Zosyn desensitization was completed in MICU with decreased beta-blocker dosing (beta-blockers lower threshold for anaphylaxis reaction).
Palliative care was contact[**Name (NI) **] during admission, and patient elected to have home hospice with continuation of hemodialysis and antibiotics.
On floor patient with stable vital signs; on review of telemetry patient had few episodes of sinus tachycardia to 150s.
On day 1 of admission patient triggered for tachycardia to 130s; by EKG, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: 3-5 MLs Intravenous Daily and PRN as needed for line flush.
Saline Flush 0.9 % Syringe Sig: [**4-9**]  Injection Daily and PRN as needed for line flush.
Hold for respirations < 10/minute or oversedation.
IV Morphine Instructions Please continue to take Morphine Sulfate 1-2 mg IV Q4H:PRN for pain relief  Hold for oversedation   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 3005**] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Ascending cholangitis - E. coli bacteremia - Penicillin desensitization  Secondary: - AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia - End stage renal disease, on hemodialysis  Discharge Condition: Ambulatory.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted on [**2185-11-6**] with abdominal pain and a fever.
During your hospitalization, you were found to have bacteria in your blood, likely coming from your abdomen.
You also received IV antibiotics; this required a brief stay in the ICU to allow you to take penicillins given that you have a pencillin allergy.
