- Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mildly hypercellular marrow for age with megakaryocytic dysplasia and occasional ringed sideroblasts (10%) without evidence of lymphoma.
Evolving myelodysplastic syndrome could not be excluded.
- treated for Stage IIB MALT lymphoma of the stomach with 6 cycles of CVP, completed in [**11-30**] - recurred in [**2142**] and was treated with four weeks of Rituxan therapy ([**Date range (1) 51244**]) - no evidence of disease since this time.
