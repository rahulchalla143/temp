Admission Date:  [**2107-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-11-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**] Chief Complaint: leg weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 79 year old male male with h/o inoperable 6 cm AAA, severe AS (0.9 cm), alcoholic cirrhosis, stable liver lesion x 3 years, who was in his USOH until 3 months ago, when he developed progressively worsening upper back and bilateral shoulder pain.
He went to see his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he was noted to have a 10 lb unintentional weight loss over one year, but ROS otherwise negative.
Labs checked at that time were normal, except for an elevated AFP of 450.
An abdominal u/s demonstrated a stable liver lesion of three years (never biopsied at patient's wishes) and a new bladder lesion.
On day of admission, the patient's granddaughter, who is a RN, called the patient's PCP reporting that he fell yesterday from a standing position onto right side, and was now unable to get up from the couch and unable to urinate.
His BNP was elevated to 1600, troponin of 0.3 with no ischemic changes noted on his EKG.
CXR was consistent with pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
At the OSH, he received 250 mg Levoflox x 1, Lasix 20 mg IV x 2, and lovenox SC for elevated troponin prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management.
6 cm AAA - inoperable 2. severe AS (0.9 cm) 3. alcoholic cirrhosis 4. h/o liver lesion x 3 yrs 5. new bladder lesion 6. elevated AFP 7.
Dullness to percussion at flanks, no discernable fluid wave.

T4 infiltrated with mild pathologic compression and retropulsion.
T4 moderate spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression  [**9-3**] MRI C-spine: probable metastatic compression T4  OSH: [**8-22**] Abd u/s: 2.1 cm x 2.3 cm hyperdense lesion in right posterior lobe of liver, unchanged from [**12/2103**], likely hemangioma.
1.7 x 2.3 cm polypoid soft tissue mass in the base of the urinary bladder.
[**9-2**] - CT chest/abd/pelvis without contrast: small left, moderate right pleural effusion.
Moderate RLL infiltrate abd atelectasis.
COPD with upper lobe with "honeycombing."
Nodular liver, spleen is enlarged, esophageal and periumbilical varices, and small amount of ascites.
Small calcified hepatic granuloma.
Several tiny non-obstructing left kidney stones, indwelling foley with a collapsed urinary bladder.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 y/o male with AAA, EtOH cirrhosis, critical AS, p/w LE paresis found to have cord compression at T4 due to metastatic cancer (multiple spinal, liver, bladder) of unknown primary  1.
Spinal cord compression: Spine MRIs showed T4 infiltrated with associated compression fracture and cord compression.
Multiple other lesions noted throughout thoracic vertebra T2-T8.
Given worsening lower extremity functioning, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] medical service for urgent radiation.
Neurosurgery evaluated him for possible surgery, but felt he was not a good operative candidate given critical aortic stenosis and 6 cm AAA.
Metastatic cancer to spine (unknown primary).
Given known liver lesion and markedly elevated AFP (865), hepatocellular carcinoma was suspected.
Other possibilities include bladder cancer (given bladder mass), although urine cytology showed only degenerated epithelial cells.
Initially, a full metastatic work-up (chest CT, bone scan) was planned with possible IR-guided biopsy (spine vs liver).
However, given underlying medical problems (critical AS), poor prognosis (multiple metastases), worsening medical status (worsening transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, possible DIC, CHF in setting of severe AS, demand ischemia), the patient was felt to be unlikely to tolerate both invasive diagnostic testing and chemotherapy.
Lovastatin 20 mg qod   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: spinal cord compression Secondary: metastatic cancer of unknown primary, aortic stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, aspiration pneumonia.
