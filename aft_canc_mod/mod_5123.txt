is a 63 year old with a history of hypercholesterolemia who presents for further work up of gait ataxia and mass seen on Head CT.
He reports that he has been seeing his doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] that have been attributed to depression since [**2163-12-6**].
He's felt sad, and he feels that his speech is "flat" with no intonation.
He was started on Celexa for these [**Year (2 digits) **] on [**12-15**], but feels that this has made no impact.
He's not had any nausea or vomiting.
He presented to his PCP because of the gait unsteadiness today, and was referred to the ED in [**Location (un) **].
There a Head CT was performed and showed a 4.3x3.2 complex mass in R parietal area with contrast enhancement and central necrosis, and additional R frontal mass with surrounding edema, and minimal midline shift.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No observed myoclonus or tremor +Left pronator drift    [**Doctor First Name **] Tri [**Hospital1 **]  WF WE FE FF  IP  H  Q DF PF TE TF R  5   5   5  5  5  5  5   5   5  5  5  5  5  5 L  4+  4   4+ 5  4+ 4+ 5   4+  4+ 5  5- 5  5- 5  Sensation: Intact to light toucH  Reflexes: +2 and symmetric throughout.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient status post surgery for post-operative evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Since the previous MRI examination the patient has undergone craniotomy in the right frontal region for right frontal lobe enhancing mass lesions.
There are blood products seen near the convexity along the midline with foci of air consistent with recent surgery.
The other enhancing mass lesion seen more laterally is again visualized unchanged.
There is no significant change in the brain edema identified.
There is continued mass effect on the right lateral ventricle identified without significant midline shift.
There is no hydrocephalus.
No acute infarct is seen.
Previously noted smaller enhancing mass laterally in the right frontal lobe is again identified unchanged.
**************** postop head CT CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-12-25**] 10:45 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o inc MLS / Mass effect  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old man with s/p crani for tumor resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o inc MLS / Mass effect CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Rule out increased midline shift/mass effect.
There is interval decrease in pneumocephalus.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
No midline shift.
No evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Upon admission, he was oriented x 3, but with delayed speech; he has mild left-sided weakness.
No intra- or postop complications are encountered.
Postop CT showed slight bleeding; postop MRI showed residual brain tumor.
Neurologically he remained stable with mild left-sided weakness postoperatively.
Upon discharge, neurologically he is oriented times 3, following commands; mild left-sided weakness (UE/LE, motor 3 to 5-/5); motor [**5-21**] with RUE/RLE.
