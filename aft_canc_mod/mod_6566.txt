She also reports a history of diverticulitis 30 years ago, but no bleeding.
She denies any recent ibuprofen or alcohol use.
No uncooked hamburgers or fresh water ingestion.
Maroon colored blood clots admixed with stool were noted in the ED.
GI was consulted in the ED, who recommended INR reversal and NPO for possible colonoscopy tomorrow vs. tagged RBC scan.
She was transferred to the MICU for treatment of active GI bleed.
On the floor, she denies any fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, LH, dizziness, or syncope.
She has chronic SOB from her asthma.
She reports a LLE laceration on transfer from bed to wheelchair a few day ago that is s/p repair.
Past Medical History: Asthma Lower extremity cellulitis Morbid Obesity, home bound at nursing home HTN Hypercholesterolemia atrial fibrillation on coumadin DMII Gout Chronic Constipation  Social History: lives in [**Hospital **] nursing home, recently moved there 1 month ago [**1-23**] multiple medical problems and multiple hospital admissions for viral illness/asthma exacerbations.
Physical Exam: General: obese F lying in bed, Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: increased expiratory phase, wheezes in upper lung bases CV: irregularly irregular rate, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, obese, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pitting edema BL, chronic venous stasis changes BL, bandages over LLE wound c/d/i; 1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .

Lateral view demonstrates moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Otherwise, no new gross focal abnormality concerning for pneumonia .
Erythema of the mucosa was also noted in this area likely due to scope trauma.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old female with h/o Afib on coumadin, morbid obesity, DM, Gout, remote diverticulitis who was admitted from [**Hospital1 1501**] with hematochezia in setting of therapuetic INR.
Recieved 2U more prbc for active hematochezia and 2U FFP and Vitamin K for INR 2.5 at OSH.
Strong suspicion for diverticular bleed given acute history and spontaneous resolved.
Plan was for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **], but this was delayed by a few days because of both poor prep and difficulty arranging for OR time (couldnt do in GI suite due to weight).
C-scope showed diverticulosis, rectal ulcer (would not have expected such a brisk bleed), and polyps (nonbleeding)-->likely diverticular bleed.
She needs f/u C-scope for removal of polyps in future (not done due to recent bleed).
GI will contact with biopsy of rectal ulcer to r/o malignancy.
Will reccommend it should be safe to resume prior dose of coumadin after 1week (so less risk for bleeding from rectal ulcer biopsy site).
Presumed not on BB due to bad asthma.
Below is progress note from day of discharge 75 year old female with h/o Afib on coumadin, morbid obesity, DM, Gout, remote diverticulitis who is admitted with hematochezia in setting of therapuetic INR.
Awaiting EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on [**5-17**], delayed due to poor prep and issue related to body habitus.
Has issues with Afib/RVR and dCHF.
Acute GI bleed: Patient likely with lower GI bleed given history of diverticulosis and HDS while active hematochezia.
INR reversed with ffp and vit K. -C-scope [**5-17**] with diverticulosis, rectal ulcer (would not have expected such a brisk bleed), and polyps (nonbleeding)-->still suspect was a diverticular bleed -needs f/u C-scope for removal of polyps in future -GI will contact with biopsy of rectal ulcer to r/o bleed -EGD not done because high risk, again, very low suspicion for UGIG, d/c IV PPI, place on oral -resume coumadin in 1 week -can resume ASA now .
Pt is total body volume overloaded and has effusions on CXR -no more fluids -s/p lasix 40mg IV [**5-15**] and 20mg IV on [**5-16**], creat 0.8--> so far pt about negative 5L -start on lasix 40mg QD-can titrate to [**Hospital1 **] as BP and creat tolerates -lisinopril-titrate dose .
Acute diastolic CHF: effusions on CXR.
needs better rate control (afib and gets albuterol) and BP control.
no recent echo.
-start lasix 40mg daily--titrate as BP, creat tolerates -O2 sats good during day but needs O2 at night -dilt started and titrated to 240mg-->HR is now in 80s -unclear why not on BB, but possible due to recurrent asthma exacerbations.
no clear asthma flare, more likely fluid component as above -continue duonebs prn, advair, claritin 10mg daily .
Coumadin was held in setting of acute GI bleed.
Atypical CP: Pt endorsed atypical CP on admission.
EKG with non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Milk Of Magnesia Concentrated 2,400 mg/10 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: hematochezia-likely diverticular bleed acute blood loss anemia Afib, RVR Acute diastolic heart failure HTN uncontrolled   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
