Originally presented friday to OSH with abdominal pain and SOB.
She was sent home but came back today feeling a lot worse and at OSH was noted to be in ARF (creatinine 2.58 - unknown baseline but per notes higher than before), elevated transaminases and bili.
This CT scan also showed extensive lymphadenopathy concerning for lymphoma as well as a massive peri-umbilical hernia containing fat and colon.
Patient was given 5L NS because of hypotension while team tried to place more IV access and draw labs.
Mixed venous sat in upper 80s but remained hypotensive (BPs in 80s systolic) so was started on levophed.
CVP 14 (per report from resident although RN quoted it at 9)and h/o CHF so ED concerned about cardiogenic shock after the 5L NS but O2 sats stable (100% on 5L NC).
On the floor, patient said her breathing felt fine but she has had a cough.
She was having no pain and was hungry.
Per her family she has had abdominal pain for about a month but in the last few days has had increasing shortness of breath and trouble breathing.
She also had increasing lower extremity swelling and they were worried about her heart.

mild central vascular engorgement .
CXR (my read): RIJ in SVC (after pulling back from prior XR) with left-sided pleural effusion/consolidation as noted previously.
mild pulmonary edema unchanged from prior despite 5L NS in ED.
Brief Hospital Course: 75yo F with h/o CHF admitted with cholecystitis, impacted gallstone on CT Abd at OSH, with PNA clinically and on CXR initially seen here in septic shock likely from biliary source.
Biopsy demonstrated a high grade undifferentiated malignancy, and immunohistochemical stains were pending.
On CT, patient had substantial mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggestive of lymphoma.
After ERCP she failed spontaneous breathing trial, and was kept on the ventilator.
Given her evolving sepsis, she was started on ARDSnet protocol low tidal volume ventilation, given risk for ARDS.
Given her shock, antihypertensives and diuretics were held.
Her hypotension progressively worsened, requiring IVF boluses, and pressor support.
Her serum lactate increased to 7.1 and she developed acute renal failure with a metabolic acidosis and bicarbonate of 11.
A central venous saturation was 88 consistent with septic shock.
It was thought that her limb ischemia was likely caused by pressors with a possible contribution of arterial thrombus.
She still became hypotensive to SBP 70s.
