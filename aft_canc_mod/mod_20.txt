Cards was consulted and an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial fluid collection with tamponade.
She was transferred back to her bed and at that ppint was noticed to be in full cardiac and respiratory arrest without pulse or spontaneous respirations.
Patient did have a rhythm on monitor so patient was diagnosed with PEA arrest.
A stat repeat ECHO was performed at that time and patient was found to have [**Male First Name (un) **] (systolic anterior motion), severe MR, and new wall motion abnormalities but no re-accumulation of pericardial effusion.
Past Medical History: Pancreatic cancer s/p whipple [**2141-7-18**], metastatic to liver Ovarian ca s/p carboplatinum/taxol ([**2126**]) HTN AAA OA Depression Vertigo   Social History: Occupation: former storekeeper in [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**], moved to US in [**2134**] after husband disappeared during their pilgrimage to [**Location (un) 481**] in [**2133**] Drugs: None Tobacco: None Alcohol: None   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Thin Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL, Conjunctiva pale Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, dry MM Lymphatic: Cervical LAD Cardiovascular: (PMI Normal), (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), (Murmur: [**1-23**] soft Systolic Ejection Murmur) Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present) Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Breath Sounds: Crackles : [**12-19**] way up bilaterally) Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, No bowel sounds present, nontender palpaple mass in epigastrium Extremities: Right: 2+, Left: 2+ DP pulses Skin:  Warm Neurologic: Attentive, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Oriented (to): person and place, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed   Pertinent Results: U/S Lower extremities: No DVT of the right lower extremity .
Renal U/S: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of hydronephrosis .
Echocardiogram: Moderate sized pericardial effusion (up to 1.3cm in greatest diameter - near the RV apex).
There is RV diastolic collapse, consistent with tamponade physiology.
Mild symmetric LVH with small LV size and probably normal function.
Bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates are again demonstrated.
A focal area of increased density at the right base persists.
There is no definite interval change.
Reticulonodular opacities at the lung bases.
Calcified granuloma projecting over left pelvis.
Degenerative changes along spine.

Patient remained unresponsive after the PEA arrest and EEG was negative for seizure.
Neurology felt her mental status was consistent with global hypoxic injury after PEA arrest.
Patient remained peristantly acidemic and began to have multi-organ symtem failure including oliguric renal failure and transaminitis concerning for shock liver.
