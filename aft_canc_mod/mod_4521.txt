He has been complaining about a large mouth sore, abdominal discomfort, constipation, perirectal pressure, loss of appetite and weight loss.
He was given 50 mg hydrocortisone for bronchspasm (+wheezing on exam), 50 mg total of Demerol for rigors, 25 mg of Benadryl for ?transfusion reaction and 2 grams cefepime for febrile neutropenia.

STREPTOCOCCUS SPECIES.
Minimal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, without definite etiology, though in the setting of gallbladder sludge.
New left lower lobe pulmonary nodular opacity.
Mild area of fat stranding surrounding a segment of sigmoid colon with relative mural thickening.
Overall, this finding is nonspecific and though there is no evidence of diverticulosis, a mild uncomplicated diverticulitis may have this appearance versus focal uncomplicated colitis.
Nevertheless, recommend correlation to colonoscopy upon cessation of symptoms in order to exclude an underlying mass.
Small hiatal hernia.
Unchanged renal cysts and splenomegaly.
CXR ([**6-29**]):  IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Previously noted edema has resolved.
CXR ([**7-2**]): Small left pleural effusion has developed since [**6-29**], and there is mild left lower lobe atelectasis.
The new left basal lung nodule detected on [**6-29**] abdomen CT is not large enough to be seen on chest radiographs, particularly when performed bedside.
TTE ([**7-3**]): IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
No evidence of pneumothorax or other complications.

# Neutropenic Fevers/rigors with tachycardia:  Given the timing of his fevers/rigors, a transfusion reaction was considered, but ruled out.
His symptoms were considered more likely to be of infectious origin.
He had multiple sites that could contribute to infection, including a mouth sore, a PICC line, and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.
As patient is neutropenic, vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl were started to treat the potential infecious sources.
The PICC line was removed and the tip cultured and had no growth.
Anti-fungal coverage was changed from fluconazole to micafungin to treat a possible fungal infection of the mouth and/or rectal area.
CT abdomen/pelvis revealed both a LLL opacity in the lung and a possible colitis vs. diverticulitis in the sigmoid.
The patient remained afebrile on this regimen.
# Direct hyperbilirubinemia: On presentation, the patient had an elevated bilirubin at 1.9, with direct of 0.9 and an AP of 490; all mildly elevated from prior baseline.
Differential for this includes a biliary process (obstruction) vs. hemolysis (less likely due to increased direct bilirubin fraction).
Flagyl was included in antibiotic coverage (as noted above) for possible biliary/abdominal process.
# ST depressions in anterolateral leads: On presentation there were some EKG changes that were concerning for possible ischemia.
EKG was repeated once the patient was less tachycardic and these changes resolved.
# Pancytopenia: Patient is transfusion dependent due to chemotherapy.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fever and shaking chills after receiving a blood transfusion in clinic.
Your blood cultures drawn on admission grew 2 types of bacteria: E coli and Strep.
