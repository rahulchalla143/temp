PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical examination revealed Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] was a well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.
His oropharynx was pink and moist with no lesions.
His neck was supple with no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.
His chest was symmetric with no palpable masses.
His heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur; consistent with aortic stenosis.
No palpable masses.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact as was his gross neurologic status.
His skin showed no pathology.
He had a preoperatively placed epidural for pain control; which at the time contained only narcotic medications.
He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and proceeded to receive  multiple fluid boluses postoperatively for decreases in urine output.
On postoperative day one, he continued to have labile blood pressures and the requirement of pressors (namely Levophed) to help maintain this.
On postoperative day two, he was found to have some degree of pulmonary deterioration as his PCO2 continued to rise.
At this time, Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] also had episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Later on postoperative day five, the patient was found to have a worsening PO2, for which Lasix was given.
Also during this time, the patient was found to have a pneumonia by chest x-ray, and a sputum culture was positive for Klebsiella which was pan-sensitive.
He did require occasional suctioning for desaturations as he respiratory status continued to fluctuate.
The patient was concurrently followed in consultation by the Cardiology Service due to his atrial fibrillation and previously existing aortic stenosis.
He was started on Coumadin on postoperative day 19 due to his prolonged atrial fibrillation.
He was elevated by Physical Therapy on multiple occasions who deemed him to require a stay in an acute rehabilitation facility in order to build strength and mobility and to gain independence with activities of daily living.
The patient was tolerating his tube feeds without nausea or vomiting, and return of bowel function was indicated by bowel movements.
At this time, the patient continued to receive daily doses of Coumadin with intravenous heparin for anticoagulation due to his atrial fibrillation.
