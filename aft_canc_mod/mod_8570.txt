Patient was given 2U PRBC and was closely monitored on the wards, when she was noted to have a large bloody bowel movement accompanied by onset of Afib with RVR and hypotension.

A sister has had multiple TIAs.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] is a 68yo female with CAD and PVD with multiple coronary and peripheral artery stents and recent left lobectomy for lung cancer complicated by atrial fibrillation on Coumadin now presenting with LGIB.
# LGIB:  Upon admission, patient was given 2U PRBC and was closely monitored on the wards, when she was noted to have a large bloody bowel movement accompanied by onset of Afib with RVR and hypotension.
Colonoscopy was performed on [**6-25**], showing old and new blood throughout the colon, with more active bleeding present in the descending colon when compared to ascending colon.
Moderate to severe diverticulosis was also noted.
Per GI recs, tagged red blood cell scan was performed on [**6-26**] and showed no evidence of GI bleed.
By [**6-26**], the patient had received a total of 10 units of blood and was no longer passing BRBPR, though she continued to pass clots.
Given history of diverticular disease ([**2134**]) and severe diverticulosis observed on colonoscopy, this episode of LGIB is most consistent with diverticular bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on initial presentation associated with hypotension, resulting in MICU transfer.
Patient was transferred to the general medical service where she was monitored on telemetry and had a recurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR to the 140s, though mostly resting in the low 100s.
Her coumadin was discontinued in the setting of her GI bleed.
# CAD: Patient remained chest pain free during her hospitalization.
Given significant cardiac history, they recommneded that she be continued on both.
In the latter part of her hospitalization given that she was still having small amount of bleeding even on plavix alone, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he recommended discontinuing the plavix given that her last bare metal stent was placed in [**2140**] (renal artery stent), and her last drug-eluting stent was placed in [**2136**].
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every twelve (12) hours as needed for constipation: Take as long as taking Narcotics Stop if stools become loose .
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed, probable diverticular bleed Atrial fibrillation Squamous cell lung cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable, in normal sinus rhythm with stable hematocrit.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, that is most likely due to diverticulosis.
While you were in the hospital, you went into atrial fibrillation and your blood pressure decreased.
You underwent a colonoscopy which showed blood and diverticula in your colon.
You experienced another episode of atrial fibrillation which resolved on its own overnight.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, blood in your stools or any other symptoms that concern you.
