No acute abnormality.
Pacing device in the left upper quadrant, which probably corresponds to the palpable subcutaneous foreign body.
Right pleural effusion.
2.Moderately distended sludge filled gallbladder with gallstones with suggestion of gallbladder wall edema.
In the appropriate clinical setting, this appearance could represent acute cholecystitis.
[**2129-8-4**] Radiology CHEST PORT.
Satisfactory placement of right internal jugular line.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo m with h/o cad, diastolic HF, who p/w 3 wk h/o post-prandial RUQ pain, confusion.
Hypotension: felt to likely be [**1-26**] hypovolemia given history of aggressive diuresis and exam findings consistent with dehydration.
No evid of cardiogenic shock.
Admitted to MICU with MUST protocol, though there was no evidence of sepsis.
If gout flares, could do local injection, avoid NSAIDs given renal failure.
Urine lytes/osms consistent with prerenal state.
No evid of hydronephrosis on renal u/s.
RUQ pain: presentation was concerning for cholecystitis, and though he did have stones in his GB there was no indication on imaging that he had cholecystitis.
Felt that he may have had a mild gallstone pancreatitis given his transient pancreatic enzyme elevation, possibly from a passing gallstone.
There was no evidence of ischemic bowel (neg thumbprinting on KUB, no h/o BRB, benign abdomen).
He was on levo/flagyl for coverage of possible cholecystitis, though this was d/c'd on Day#5, the day of his discharge, as he had no indication for antibiotics.
Hyponatremia: felt to be hypovolemic in origin, resolved quickly with IVF; was on HCTZ, this was discontinued and he should not be restarted on it.
Has had no recurrent GI bleed and hct has remained stable.
GI bleed: in setting of supratherapeutic PTT > 150 and after straining to have a bowel movement, the patient developed BRBPR.
In this setting, he also had epistaxis and oozing from his central line.
His hct remained stable and all evid of bleeding stopped after his PTT was brought down below 100.
