Admission Date:  [**2134-6-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-7-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-8-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Gammar  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**] Chief Complaint: esophageal carcinoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2134-6-18**] laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy [**2134-6-23**] thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 65-year-old man with a history of Barrett's esophagus, who has been followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
He had an endoscopy for surveillance and had a very small raised area, which was biopsied and found to be adenocarcinoma in a segment of Barrett's esophagus.
Since then, he has undergone a number of studies such as a PET-CT, which shows an abnormal focus of uptake in the distal esophagus.
There was a focus of uptake in the distal rectum, which was probably physiological.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has done a colonoscopy, which shows no lesion.
Endoscopic ultrasound was done here, which showed a very small mass, which was 4x6 mm.
Past Medical History: Past medical history: -Early onset Alzheimer's disease -History of prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.
ALLERGIC to IgG with an unknown reaction.
Family History: History of breast cancer in his mother.
Physical Exam: Gen: WDWN male, pleasant, 6"2, 200lbs HEENT: WNL Neck: Supple, without mass, nodes, thyromegaly Chest CTAB with normal percussion Heart: normal sounds, no m/r/g Abd: soft, no t/d/r/g Ext: no c/c/e; diminished pulses in feet; L heel ulcer  On discharge, essentially the same except L neck JP drain with small amounts of sputum draining.
Periazygous tissue (Y):  a.
Three lymph nodes with no carcinoma identified (0/3).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: Approximately 7 mm.
Postoperative changes following esophagectomy and pull-up procedure, with no evidence of mediastinal extraluminal collections.
However, assessment for a leak is limited due to request for no oral contrast.
If there remains clinical suspicion for this complication, a fluoroscopic study may be helpful if warranted clinically.
Moderate dependent pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent atelectasis.
Perihilar ground-glass opacities, which may reflect mild hydrostatic edema.
Please re-evaluate small apical pneumothorax.
Small right apical pneumothorax has decreased.
There is new ill-defined opacity at the right lung base, which may represent areas of subsegmental atelectasis, though aspiration cannot be excluded.
Minimal pleural effusion is unchanged.
Decreased small right apical pneumothorax.
New right basilar airspace opacity could represent areas of subsegmental atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded.
Intraoperatively there was trouble placing a foley catheter and urology was called for cystoscopy, foley placement, and urethral stricture dilation at bladder neck.
On [**6-19**] he self-discontinued his nasogastric tube and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation which required a diltiazem drip.
His lasix drip continued and he was noted to have som mild amount of erythema around the chest tube site.
None was immediately seen though a significant left pleural effusion was noted and ultimately tapped by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-23**].
On [**6-27**] he was noted with RUE swelling and tenderness, UENI was negative.
On [**6-29**] his chest tube and foley were both discontinued with minimal apical pneumothorax (stable).
He was essentially pain free and excited to leave the hospital.
