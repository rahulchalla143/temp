Leukemia: Patient presented with neutropenia and anemia.
His counts dropped as expected and he developed severe abdominal pain and fevers (discussed below).
He was noted to have some atypical cells in his peripheral smear.
He never had a day 14 BM biopsy because of his clinical deterioration during that time.
T2DM: Holding outpatient oral regemin and treating with lantus at night and sliding scale.
Patient had increased inslulin requirements while on steroids.
Then he had pretty well controlled diabetes until the week prior to discharge when he started having pretty severe hyperglycemia.
# Febrile neutropenia / Fungemia - while patient was having fevers during his nadir, he had a positive blood cutlure growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
Eventually when he had elevated LFTs, we switched his micafungin to anidlofungin per ID recs.
During this time, he was having severe abdominal pain, so with worries for hepatosleno candidemia, we did an MRI that did not show any involvement.
His abdominal pain improved, but he contined to have elevated LFTs despite switching antifungals.
He also was hyperglycemic and tachycardic which would lead more to continued infection.
# Elevated LFTs - after having fungemia, he had elevated LFTs which were thought to likely be due to med effect v. hepatospleno candidemia.
His MRI was negative, but he continued to have clinical signs of infection (although never spiked another fever once on antifungals).
# Abdominal pain - while patient was in his nadir of his counts, he developed severe abdominal pain, which caused him to stop eating.
He was placed on TPN because of his poor PO intake.
He had two CT scans that did not show any bowel infection or typhlitis.
It did show severe constipation.
He was treated for his constipation and his symptoms improved.
When his counts recovered, he no longer had abdominal pain and was eating very very well by the time of discharge.
# Enterococcus UTI: Diagnosed from urine culture in the ED and treated with cefepime.
Patient was spiking fevers after that which were attributed to Leukemia but as he was neutropenic he was continued on a course of Vancomycin and cefepime for neutropenic fevers until his count recovers.
He had second fevers while on vanco/cefepime and found to have fungemia (as discussed above).
# Stridor/respiratory distress: The patient was started on chemotherapy on [**3-6**].
After his first dose, he developed acute respiratory distress, with tachypnea and audible stridor.
He was presumed to have an anaphylactic reaction to his chemotherapy, and was given solumedrol 125mg IV X1, Benadryl 25mg IV X1, inhaled racemic epinephrine, and epinephrine .3mg IM X1.
His respiratory distress did not subside, and he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] emergently for intubation.
Anesthesia intubated the patient without complications, and did not observe swollen or edemetous trachea or vocal cords.
It could not be determined if he actually had a reaction to the chemo or a transfusion reaction.
His blood was sent for a transfusion reaction but none could be identified.
He had no other respiratory symptoms except one day of wheezing which was likely due to fluid overload and disappeared after being diuresed.
# Gluteal Hematoma: Patient had a traumatic bone marrow biopsy complicated by a gluteal hematoma.
This eventually extended down his thigh and was likely the cause of a hematocrit drop.
There was no evidence of compartment syndrome and he was transfused.
He improved with supportive care.
Neutropenia/Anemia 2.
Diabetes 4.
Fungemia 5.
Right when you started you had a bad reaction to either some blood or the chemo.
You were given medications to prevent another reaction with blood.
While your white count was low, you got an infection with [**Female First Name (un) **] (a type of yeast/fungus).
You were very sick and had a lot of abdominal pain during this time, too.
We treated you with antibiotics.
We think your pain was mostly from constipation.
You also likely had the fungus infection in your liver.
Please return to the hospital for any fevers, chills, redness or pain around your PICC line, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea, constipation or any other concerns.
