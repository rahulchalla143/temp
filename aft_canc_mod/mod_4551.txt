Contrast medium was injected and partial oacification of pancreatic duct was achieved.
A small precut was performed to facilitate biliary access,however this was unsuccessful  [**2155-6-3**] EUS: IMPRESSION: Mass #1: A 45mm X 30 mm ill-defined mass was noted in the head of the pancreas.
The mass was hypoechoic and heterogenous in echotexture.
The borders of the mass were irregular and poorly defined.
FNA of the mass was performed and aspirate was sent for cytology.
This mass likely represents a second tumor deposit and may involve the splenic vein.
Pancreatic parenchyma: The pancreas appeared to be mostly replaced by the tumors.
The parenchyma showed marked atrophy.
2.6-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic head mass concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with resultant massive dilatation of the CBD, distention of the gallbladder, and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Abnormal heterogeneous enhancement of a 2.8-cm portion of the pancreatic body, concerning for multifocal involvement vs. area of pancreatitis with resultant splenic venous thrombosis and collateral formation.
Conventional hepatic and vascular anatomy with the exception of duplicated right renal arteries.
Small non-hemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
Left upper lobe residual consolidative abnormality may be resolving pneumonia or hemorrhage.
No strong evidence of metastasis.
A 4-mm right middle lobe nodule is indeterminate.
There was a second mass at the panc body   concerning for a second tumor deposit.
ERCP not   successful on [**2155-5-27**] due to mass involvement of duodenum   and ampulla.
PTBD placed by IR but not able to traverse   stricture or obtain cytology.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1982**]  DIAGNOSIS: EUS, Pancreatic head mass:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old woman who presented with obstructive jaundice due to a tumor involving the pancreas and duodenum.
Ms. [**Known lastname 88723**] presented with jaundice and elevated total bilirubin.
Imaging showed a mass at the head of the pancreas.
On [**6-2**] and [**6-4**] she went back to the IR suite for internalization of her drain, though both attempts were unsuccessful due to being unable to pass the pancreatic blockage.
There was a high suspicion for malignancy.
She will need follow-up with Oncology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**], as the cytology from the EUS was consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Shortly after the placement of the external biliary drain on [**5-29**], she became hypotensive and hypoxic.
Her biliary and blood cultures grew out E. coli.
On [**6-9**], she underwent hepatojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy and open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
The patient arrived on the floor NPO with NGT, on IV fluids, TPN and antibiotics (Meropenem), with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound was evaluated daily and no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
Hematology: The patient developed thrombocytopenia with platelets of 83 on HD # 5, a HIT Ab was sent and returned negative.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with bystander assist, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
