The patient reports that he first noted the bilateral facial and neck swelling yesterday morning.
However his parents have noticed mild swelling even on the day prior.
Today in the morning the patient noted worsening swelling also now involving the L arm.
He also noticed problems swallowing and felt that he could not get his saliva down.
He denies any problems breathing at rest, but noticed shortness of breath with ambulation.
He thinks that he lost consciousness for several minutes.
A CXR was done, that showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
He was discharged from ED with likely allergic reaction.
IR was [**Name (NI) 653**], and [**Name2 (NI) **] underwent CT imaging of head and chest.
ROS: negative for CP, SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, f/c/ns, weight loss, dysuria, changes in the color of the urine or stool.
He underwent 7 and 3 induction chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission, although his course was complicated by diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
He developed hepatic candidiasis which was treated successfully with oral Diflucan, which delayed his allogeneic stem cell transplant, but then he underwent matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with Cytoxan and TBI conditioning on [**2116-8-25**].
He did relatively well post-transplant until [**10/2116**] when he developed left upper lobe and bilateral opacities with he underwent BLL, which was nondiagnostic and then proceeded to VATS biopsy with a diagnosis of acute and organizing pneumonia.
He had no other infectious etiology found and he was begun on a prednisone for presumed idiopathic BOOP and this has been tapered slowly over time.
On [**2116-12-31**], Mr. [**Known lastname 72663**] developed increasing cough, sore throat with yellow sputum.
With worsening symptoms he was admitted on [**2117-1-1**].
CT scan showed new right upper lobe hazy infiltrate and nasal aspirate was positive for RSV.
He was given a dose of palivizumab and was treated with a course of levofloxacin.

New bilateral left greater than right pleural effusions with associated passive atelectasis.
Increased size of small pericardial effusion.
New axillary and anterior chest wall subcutaneous edema.
Calcified basilar pleural plaques associated reticulation, indicating prior asbestos exposure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

Small pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
As a result, there is a mild resting outflow tract gradient that increases with Valsalva.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Delayed R wave progression across the anterior precordial leads.
A 36-hour followup TPA infusion [**Date Range 17911**] venogram was obtained with injection of contrast through the indwelling 5 French vascular sheath, which demonstrated further partial interval clearance of thrombosis in upper [**Date Range 17911**], and a tight severe focal mid-[**Date Range 17911**] stenosis.
Balloon dilatation was performed at segment of [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis with 12 mm x 4 cm and 14 mm x 4 cm balloon catheters.
Followup venogram after balloon dilatation demonstrated segmental stricture at mid [**Date Range 17911**] and thrombus in upper [**Date Range 17911**] with multiple collateral veins.
Followup venogram after balloon dilatation demonstrated much interval improvement of [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis and disappearance of collateral veins and small residual thrombus in upper [**Date Range 17911**].
****IMPRESSION: Significant improvement in [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis and thrombosis s/p TPA infusion and [**Name (NI) 17911**] PTA.
[**2117-2-5**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination.
There is also mild diastolic invagination of the apical portion of the right ventricular free wall.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in tricuspid (but not mitral) valve inflow, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
However, abnormal repirophasic variation of right venrticular inflow, and mild apical right ventricular diastolic invagination, are now present, consistent with early cardiac tamponade.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2117-2-7**] FINDINGS: There is a large filling defect within the right main pulmonary artery, at its bifurcation, consistent with pulmonary embolus.
Pulmonary emboli are also seen in several of the segmental branches to the right middle and right lower lobe.
There are equivocal tiny filling defects in several of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries in the left lower lobe.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions, and associated minor bibasilar atelectasis.
There is a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion.
In the upper lobes bilaterally, in a predominantly bronchovascular distribution, there is new airspace opacity and bronchial wall thickening, right greater than left.
Previously noted thrombus within the upper [**Year/Month/Day 17911**] is more difficult to evaluate on today's exam due to timing of contrast bolus, but is probably still present, although it appears slightly decreased in size, now occluding approximately half the vessel lumen at the level of the top of the aortic arch (3, 33).
There are scattered small mediastinal and bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
Pulmonary embolism in the right main pulmonary artery at the bifurcation, with several smaller segmental pulmonary emboli on the right, and possible small subsegmental pulmonary emboli on the left.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, increased from prior exam.
New [**Hospital1 **]-apical centrilobular airspace opacity and bronchial wall thickening, right greater than left, concerning for infectious pneumonia, less likely representing aspiration or pulmonary edema.
Likely slight decrease in extent of partially occlusive thrombus in the upper [**Hospital1 17911**], although timing of contrast bolus in this study is suboptimal for evaluation of this region.
Unchanged appearance of calcified pleural plaques, consistent with history of asbestos exposure.
[**2117-2-15**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Where it is adjacent to the basal right ventricle, the effusion is echo dense consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-2-10**], the effusion is slightly smaller.
Improving but not completely resolved ground-glass opacities in both lungs but predominantly at the lung apices indicate a resolving pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia.
Considerable decrease in the pleural and pericardial effusion.
********* PATHOLOGY ********* [**2117-2-12**] BAL- Negative for malignant cells.Reactive bronchial cells and abundant pulmonary macrophages.
No viral cytopathic effects seen.
[**2117-2-12**] PLEURAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
T cells comprise ~90% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens (CD2, 3, 5, and 7).
No abnormal events are identified in the "blast gate."
INTERPRETATION:  Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia or lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Brief Hospital Course: # [**Year/Month/Day 17911**] syndrome: The patient had a history of AML and presented five months following his matched unrelated allogeneic transplant with evidence of [**Year/Month/Day 17911**] syndrome (an edematous face and bilateral upper extremities).
On the day of admission, [**2117-1-31**], he underwent IR-guided [**Month/Day/Year 17911**] clot thrombolysis and venous ballon stenting.
He was also thought to possibly have a thoracic duct obstruction versus PE as well.
Pulsus paradoxicus was consistently 8 mmHg prior to transfer to the [**Name (NI) 3242**] unit; EKG was without alternans and ECHO was without evidence of tampondade.
He consistently had sinus tachycardia in the unit and was felt to be intravascularly dry though fluids were net positive in the unit.
Also, with the tachycardia and known [**Name (NI) 17911**] clot, there was concern for PE in setting of [**Name (NI) 17911**] clot.
CTA for PE was not repeated as long-term management would not change, i.e.
# Pulmonary embolism CTA showed large right mainstem pulmonary embolism, likely the cause of tachycardia and dyspnea.
The patient also had several small PEs bilaterally.
However, he remained SOB with ambulation.
It was unclear if PE is related to malignancy as he is in remission for AML.
It was also unclear if the pulmonary emboli were associated with the initial clot burden or if they were related to the lysis procedure in [**Name (NI) 17911**] and downstream propogation.
Respiratory rate remained stable at approximately 24 and patient has stable dyspnea on exertion but no hemodynamic compromise or right ventricular dilation or strain.
# Pericardial effusion: An ECHO on [**2-4**] revealed a small to moderate pericardial effusion with Right atrial invagination during diastole however no RV collapse, again a hyperdynamic LV.
A repeat ECHO on [**1-/2038**] revealed more right sided compromise, the size of his effusion was unchanged by ECHO but there was mild diatolic invagination of the apical portion of the RV free wall and significant accentuated respiratory variation in the tricuspid but not mitral valve inflow consistent with impaired filling.
However, per cardiology attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**], read not quite worsening; pericardial effusion possibly simple effusion without evidence of pretamponade, no evidence of tamponade.
Serial ECHO showed decreased in pericardial effusion and no evidence of tamponade physiology.
# ?Pulmonary infection The patient was started on levofloxacin on [**2-4**] due to the question of an infiltrate on chest radiograph to cover for a community acquired pneumonia.
On [**2117-2-7**] the patient spiked to 100.3 and given bilateral apical infiltrates on CT chest, he was started on vancomycin in addition to levofloxacin.
No obvious endobronchial lesions were seen.
No organism was isolated on BAL microbiology studies or from other sputum samples.
He was afebrile upon discharge.
# Pleural Effusions Large to moderate bilateral pleural effusion increased from admission were noted on CT chest on [**2117-2-7**].
No microorganisms were isolated from the pleural fluid, and flow cytometry/cytology of the fluid sample did not reveal neoplastic cells.
Repeat CT chest on [**2117-2-16**] showed considerable decrease in the pleural effusions bilaterally.
# Acute renal failure On admission, the patient's creatinine was 0.8, near baseline.
The acute renal failure was likely due to supratherapeutic vancomycin levels in the setting of contrast nephropathy.
No evidence was present for active GVHD at this time.
