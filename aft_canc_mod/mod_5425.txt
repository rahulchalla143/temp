Pregnancy was complicated by PPROM on [**2174-8-1**] at which time the mother was admitted and treated with betamethasone which was completed by [**2174-8-3**].
Mother began to have contractions and gradually worsening abdominal pain and tenderness prompting induction of labor on the day of birth for concerns of chorioamnionitis.
Maximum maternal fever was 99.2.
The baby developed moderate retractions and work of breathing and was brought to the NICU.
General: This is a premature infant with mild tachypnea and contractions are rest but overall comfortable without significant work of breathing.
Neck: Supple, no lesions.
Chest: Moderate to mild retractions, clear lungs bilaterally, some asymmetry with left side elevated compared to right.

[**Known lastname **] had a history of having some occasional episodes of apnea and bradycardia but did not require caffeine during her admission here.
She was noted to have problems with desaturation during feedings.
She had a severe episode of bradycardia and desaturation on [**9-14**] for which she required stimulation and blow by oxygen.
The patient has been free of significant episodes of desaturation and bradycardia since then.
Feeding related episodes of apnea and    bradycardia as described above have resolved.
