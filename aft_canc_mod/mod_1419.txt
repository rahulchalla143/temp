Diff and hematochezia.
He was tranferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**9-28**], but readmitted when he developed BRBPR with hct drop from 32 to 28 over 24h.
GI was consulted; colonscopy revealed a cecal clot which was not disturbed, and no intervention was done.
CAD: s/p CABG x 3 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-Diag in [**9-4**] at [**Location (un) 7349**] [**Hospital1 **] after presenting with loss of consciousness).
HTN 7. s/p Left-sided CVA 8. dyslipidemia 9.
Elevated PSA, sclerotic lesions on CT scan, but bone scan [**9-6**] negative   Social History: He lives alone, has family in [**Location (un) **].
HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, MM dry, OP without lesions Neck: supple, no JVD Chest: R sided HD tunneled line without erythema/ TTP Pulm: CTA Cardiac: RRR nl S1/S2, 2/6 systolic murmur LSB Abdomen: + BS, firm but not tense or rigid, NT.
R groin with CVL, minimal erythema, no exudate or TTP Neurologic: AAO x 3, appropriate, conversant in Chinese.
Multiple small radiopaque fragments overlie the right pelvis, which were not present on the prior study, consistent with residual contrast from the recent CT scan.
Air fills the descending and transverse colons, and there are few colonic air-fluid levels.
No free intraperitoneal air is identified.
The patient has had a mitral valve replacement.
The lungs demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, a chronic finding.
No free air is identified under the hemidiaphragms.
No free intraperitoneal air seen.
Features consistent with pancolitis, also with some involvement of the terminal ileum.
New abnormal small fluid collections in the left upper quadrant, which may communicate with each other.
These are non-specific new fluid collections, but infection cannot be excluded.
Atrophic native kidneys.
AbdXR [**9-29**]: Non-specific, but no definite evidence for colonic distention .
Bleeding study [**10-2**]: No scintigraphic evidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, though sensitivity is limited by extremely poor tracer labeling of RBC's, likely due to ESRD.
Abd XR [**10-8**]: No overt features of toxic megacolon, no free air or pneumatosis.
A partial or early small-bowel obstruction is possible and clinical correlation and followup film should be considered.
GI Bleeding study [**10-11**]: Source of GI bleeding not identified.
RUE U/S: Large intraluminal thrombus within the right internal jugular vein, which is otherwise patent.
The clot could not be lavaged off so underlying mucosa or source of bleeding could not be seen.
There was no evidence of c diff colitis.
Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Blood in the proximal ascending colon and cecum Blood in the whole colon Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Normal mucosa in the colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
Colonoscopy [**10-19**] (prelim): multiple diverticula seen but with no clear bleeding source identified, evidence of diffuse colitis, the diffrential includes infectious colitis and ischemic colitis   Brief Hospital Course: # GI bleeding.
DDX AVM, ischemic colitis, microscopic colitis, diverticular bleed, repeat colonoscopy done when pt's hematochezia resolved did not show clear bleeding source, showed multiple non-bleeding diverticula, and an area of colitis likely corresponding to healing C. Diff.
# C. diff colitis.
Continued to have likely postinfectious diarrhea while in house but improved somewhat upon discharge.
No abdominal pain while in house.
# LUQ lesions on admission CT.
Per discussion with radiology likely small abscesses from micro perforations.
had no abdominal pain, and normal WBC and afebrile on d/c.
# ESRD, secondary to IgA nephropathy.
# CV: s/p CABG, MV repair, AICD, h/o AFib.
His BP medications were also decreased due to recurrent episodes of hypotension in house.
Continued on amiodarone and is not a coumadin candidate due to bleeding risk.
# Anemia, chronic, secondary to ESRD.
# High PSA.
Recent bone scan did not confirm sclerotic bone lesions on CT. - outpatient follow up .
Please call your doctor if you experience worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, or other concerning symptoms.
