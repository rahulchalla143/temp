Work-up revealed CT findings concerning for CAP and a small-moderated pericardial effusion thought to be malignant.
Also had associated chest pain and rub consistent with pericarditis.
After his radiation therapy, he proceeded to have his labs drawn.
During blood draw he became pale, diaphoretic and had brief LOC without evidence of seizure.
He was then trasnferred to the ED where he was noted to have mild leukocytosis with fever to 101.
CT chest revealed new epicardial mets and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Bedside ECHO showing effusion, no tamponade.
Hct dropped with hydration and he was transfused 1u PRBC for concern of unstable blood volume.
Was initially admitted to the ICU for brief hypoxic episode to 86%/RA and concern of hypotension in ED (none in documentation).
Has gotten his infleunza vaccine.
While in the ICU, he was continued on levofloxacin and flagyl for presumptive flagyl.
Upon arrival to floor he confirms no SOB, or difficulty breathing.
Denies any further pleursy and think pain is [**3-17**] and well controlled.
Otherwise denies any new complaints and confirms vago-vagal episodes with blood draws in the past.
Additionally confirms anorexia, early satiety & 20lb weight loss in last several months.

H/o asthma  Oncologic history: He reports that he began to feel unwell in 09/[**2137**].
At that time, he developed left leg and hip pain, early satiety, night sweats, and a 0-pound weight loss over the ensuing two to three months.
This study demonstrated postsurgical changes at L4-L5 with a small right recurrent disc protrusion.
New small left foraminal protrusion was noted at L3/L4.
There was an abnormal process at the retroperitoneum, which included retroperitoneal adenopathy and abnormal soft tissue infiltrating the right perinephric space and right kidney.
Due to his severe discomfort of the leg and back and his difficulty walking, he was admitted to the BMT service.
His inpatient evaluation included a urine cytology analysis, which demonstrated atypical urothelial cells.
This was seen in the setting of innumerable pulmonary nodules, right hilar lymph node, and destructive left acetabular mass.
These findings were felt to be most suggestive of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and were felt to be an unusual manifestation for lymphoma.
It was felt that, given that destruction of the osseous portion of the left acetabulum, the patient was at high risk for pathologic fracture in the weightbearing setting.
On [**2138-1-22**], a core biopsy of the patient's acetabular mass was obtained demonstrating carcinoma, consistent with renal origin.
Immunophenotypic analysis of the tissue was nondiagnostic.
An MRI of the abdomen was performed on [**2138-1-25**], which demonstrated a large heterogeneously enhancing mass within the right kidney.
Imaging characteristics were suggestive of a clear cell subtype.
There was suggestion of invasion of the posterior musculature and question of diaphragmatic involvement with abnormal enhancement and thickening of the diaphragm as detailed above.
There was evidence of metastatic disease with an acetabular lesion on the left, pulmonary nodules at the lung bases, and significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There was also suggestion of abnormal enhancement involving a nodular appearing apex of the right adrenal gland.
He has no history of cocaine or intravenous drug use.
Family History: The patient's father is 75 and has a history of prostate cancer, diagnosed seven to eight years ago.

No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
Enhancing nodule at the cardiac apex centered in the epicardium, concerning for a metastatic lesion in this area with stable moderately large pericardial effusion, likely malignant.
For confirmation, or evaluation of possible involvement of the underlying myocardium, cardiac MRI can be performed, if warranted clinically.
Bilateral metastatic nodules in the lungs, and incompletely evaluated large right renal mass.
Mild increase in the pleural fluid bilaterally and associated lower lobe atelectasis.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-2-10**] 5:35 PM No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease or acute process.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with newly dx metastatic RCC to L acetabulum, admitted for LOC and found to have new epicardial metastases and fever.
# LOC - Appears to be most c/w a vaso-vagal response.
Has h/o of similar events with blood draws.
No evidence of seizure.
No tamponade physiology on exam or by TTE.
No PE on CTA.
Monitored on telemetry without event.
# Hypoxia - Concern for CAP as seen on CT on last admission.
Despite admission fever, no evidence of therapeutic failure.
# Pericardial Effusion - As found on last admission.
No tamponade physiology.
Given concern that it is malignant - especially considering new epicardial metastases - would like to start chemotherapy as soon as possible.
Continued on anti-inflammatories PRN given resolution of chest pain since prior admission.
# Epicardial Metastases - Found on admission CT. New since CT from last admission.
Initially kept on telemetry given concern for possible arrhthymia, discontinued once no events x 48 hours.
# Acetabular Metastases - Found in [**2137-12-7**] after pathological fracture.
# RCC, metastatic - Newly diagnosed.
Attempting to start systemic therapy ASAP given ?malignant effusion and new epicardial metastases.
