Admission Date:  [**2141-12-2**]       Discharge Date: [**2142-1-1**]   Service: MICU  The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple medical problems who presented initially on [**2141-12-2**] with complaints of short of breath, fatigue and low fever.
The patient had presented on [**2141-11-18**] with fevers, a productive cough for two weeks and a left lower consolidation on chest x-ray and was admitted for pneumonia thought potentially secondary to obstruction given her history of bronchiectasis.
Repeat x-ray at the time showed an unchanged left lower lobe process verses atelectasis.
She also had a chest CT which showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolus and confirmed the left lower lobe infiltrate.
She was admitted with recurrent pneumonia and failure to thrive.
Over the following two weeks in the hospital the patient had a significantly elevated white blood count that rose from 32,000 to a peak of 113,000 on [**12-13**] with declining mental status and increased dyspnea and fatigue.
CT of the head was done and a repeat CTA was done on [**2141-12-13**] which was negative for an acute process of a pulmonary embolus.
The patient was sating 98 to 100% on four liters nasal cannula with stable vital signs including a blood pressure of 152/96, heart rate of 110, sinus tachycardia and respiratory rate in the 40's.
At the time we were unable to obtain an arterial blood gases.
Had a pO2 from an arterial blood gases done on the day prior to obtundation showed 52 mm of mercury with a pulse oximetry of 98%  The patient was hemodynamically stable, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for elective intubation secondary to respiratory distress and a change in mental status.
The patient's baseline white count is between 30 and 60,000 with increased lymphocytes.
She has a history of hypertension, Type II diabetes mellitus.
The patient has no history of coronary artery disease.
She had a transthoracic echo done in [**3-20**] which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with no focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient had a history of bronchiectasis with recurrent pneumonia, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease with recurrent abdominal pain, rheumatoid arthritis on Methotrexate and Prednisone, osteoporosis, atypical chest pain, aortic insufficiency, depression, stress incontinence, cystocele, atrophic vaginitis, post herpetic neuralgia, chronic low back pain, status post fall recently with a right humerus fracture.
Flow cytometry from [**12-11**] showed CLL with progression, showing increased lymphocytes.
Sputum from [**12-4**] showed moderate yeast, positive E. coli, acid fast bacilli negative times three.
Chest x-ray shows persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation.
A CTA on the same day shows no pulmonary embolism.
It was a limited evaluation of the subsegmental arteries.
It showed an increase in the left lower lobe consolidation, a small pericardial effusion, no lymphadenopathy and a goiter.
Head CT done on [**2141-12-13**] showed no hemorrhage or acute process and a CT of the abdomen on [**12-7**] showed no acute process, stable cyst in the right upper quadrant and right pelvis.
A left lower lobe consolidation.
ASSESSMENT:  This is an 81-year-old female with progressive CLL/PLL, bronchiectasis with recurrent lower lobe pneumonia, Type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, afebrile neutropenia intubated for respiratory distress and change in mental status.
The patient initial respiratory failure was thought secondary to a change in her mental status and inability to protect her airway.
The patient was extubated for a day before developing worsening short of breath and hypoxemia.
At this point an EMG was obtained to asses for patient weakness and the study was an abnormal study, the electrophysiologic findings most consistent with a moderately severe generalized myopathic process with active denervation.
Patient with a history of CLL with lymphocytic leukemia with central nervous system involvement.
The patient's original change in mental status was found to be secondary to leukemic meningitis.
The patient had a lumbar puncture done with the full cytometry revealing central nervous system involvement of her peripheral lymphoma.
The cerebrospinal fluid showed immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by the patient's known beta-cell [**Last Name (un) **] restricted non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Fludarabine treated her systemic CLL as well as her central nervous system involvement as it does have properties allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier.
The patient's mental status improved after treatment for her central nervous system involvement.
She did not have any interthecal chemotherapy at the time of this dictation and this will be further discussed with her primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104852**] at the [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute.
The patient had been treated for a total of four weeks of antibiotics for her left lower lobe pneumonia with Cefepime.
In the early part of her hospitalization the patient was found to have C. difficile in her stool.
The patient had multiple cardiac risk factors but no evidence of coronary artery disease prior to her admission.
This was done to evaluate her lower extremity edema, short of breath and fatigue.
At that time she had an ejection fraction of 70% with some mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal systolic function.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed new Q-waves in the anterior and inferior leads.
A repeat echo which was done on [**2141-12-25**] revealed a markedly depressed ejection fraction of 20 to 30% The echo now also shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy in addition to a severely depressed left ventricular systolic function confirming a large anterior inferior infarction.
The patient has a history of Type II diabetes mellitus.
Neuro/Psych:  The patient had persistent mental status decline for a number of days, status post intubation.
She was no uremic and she had no new infection although her pneumonia persisted.
The central nervous system tap revealed evidence of leukemic meningitis.
An EEG was also done which showed generalized swelling of the background along with bursts of generalized delta swelling overlying that consistent with a toxic, metabolic encephalopathy.
Thus her mental status change was thought to be secondary to leukemic meningitis in addition to toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
The patient has a history of Interphalangeal joint and is status post splenectomy.
The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis.
The patient should be continued on subcutaneously Heparin three times a day as she has a relative immobility being vented and also with the history of cancer she should continue on her proton pump inhibitor.
The patient has a right humerus fracture status post a fall.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
for short of breath or wheezing.
Hypertropion two puffs inhaled q 4 hours as needed for short of breath or wheezing.
The patient should have her pressure ulcer on her left buttock cleansed daily with a dry dressing and saline.
