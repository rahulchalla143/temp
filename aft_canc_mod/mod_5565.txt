Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Dr. [**Known lastname 97128**] is a 78-year-old man with bronchoalveolar carcinoma diagnosed in [**4-3**].
CT scan done on [**2160-4-1**], while admitted for treatment for pneumonia, demonstrated widespread ground-glass opacities, more severe in the right lower lobe with increased number of mediastinal lymph nodes.
A transbronchial biopsy on [**2160-4-3**] showed a pathology suspicious for bronchioalveolar carcinoma.
A PET scan done on [**2160-4-17**] showed a FDG-avid area of lobar ground glass opacity with bowing of the intralobar fissure involving the right lower lobe compatible with history of pneumonic type bronchoalveolar carcinoma, though given high avidity may represent superinfection in this region.
He also had interval improvement in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe ground-glass opacity since the chest CT from [**2160-4-1**].
MRI brain [**2160-4-17**] did not show any evidence of metastases.
He was followed clinically for several months, but he was hospitalized frequently for pneumonia and ultimately for altered mental status in [**11-3**].
An MR of his head at that time showed new cortical T2/FLAIR-hyperintensity along the medial aspect of  the left frontal lobe, and extending along the base of the left frontal lobe  and the orbitofrontal gyrus in the anterior cranial fossa.
Coronary artery disease, s/p MI [**2139**], and s/p stenting in [**2149**].
Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.
Allergic rhinitis.
Chronic back pain/spinal stenosis s/p L4/L5 laminectomy in [**2113**].
History of erysipelas with chronic right lower extremity skin changes.
Other relatives had diabetes mellitus.

There is interval increase in ground-glass opacities involving the bilateral lower lungs which is concerning for interval progression of bronchoalveolar carcinoma though the possibility of a superimposed pneumonia is impossible to exclude.
No large effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Worsening mid to lower lung ground-glass opacities which may reflect worsening bronchoalveolar carcinoma versus superimposed pneumonia.
No filling defects within main, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental branches of pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is no septal bulge or right heart strain.
Atherosclerotic calcification in the coronary arteries is moderate to severe.
Borderline sized lymph nodes and multiple other small nodes which do not meet CT size criteria for pathological enlargement are unchanged since [**2162-10-14**].
Allowing for differences in CT technique, since [**2162-10-14**], multifocal ground-glass opacities predominantly in bilateral lower lobe have progressed, which is marked in left lower lung.
Given that known multifocal BAC has been slowly progressing, this short interval increase in opacities is more likely a result of superimposed aspiration or infection or hemorrhage.
Interval progression of lung malignancy is less likely.
BONES: D3 and D7 vertebral bodies demonstrating mild wedging and endplate sclerosis is unchanged.
Degenerative changes at multiple vertebral levels are present.
No bone lesion suspicious for malignancy.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval progression of bilateral ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the left lower lobes since [**2162-10-14**] is likely from aspiration or infection or hemorrhage.
Malignancy is less likely considering short duration and prior imaging history demonstrating slow disease progression of multifocal BAC.
Consider prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-12-27**] no diagnostic interval  change.
