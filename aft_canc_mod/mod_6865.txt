Admission Date:  [**2146-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-4-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Confusion, Dysphasia/Dysarthria, Bradyphrenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: WXRT  History of Present Illness: 79y Russian speaking woman w/ atypical carcinoid tumor, metastatic to liver and hylum c/o of headache for over 48 h (started in the occipital region, spreading to frontal area).
Mrs [**Known lastname 79094**] did not complain of nausea or diplopia associated with her headache but was noted to be dysarthric.
Hospital course obtained from fellow's note: "Evaluation at [**Location (un) 47**] [**Hospital1 1281**] revealed a left thalamic hemorrhagic infarct, and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] NSICU for further management.
On arrival here, her neurologic symptoms had resolved with the exception of an inability to ambulate, which the patient attributes to generalized weakness and exhaustion rather than to a focal weakness of the lower extremities.
She appears in no acute distress with stable vital signs.
Her major c/o has been constipation (no BM x 5 days) and generalized weakness.
- Per Fellow note: "The patient was diagnosed with atypical carcinoid tumor in late [**2144**] when a hepatic mass was identified, with FNA showing low-grade neuro-endocrine carcinoma.
She underwent a right middle lobe wedge resection of a lung mass on [**2145-2-19**], with pathology revealing a 2cm atypical carcinoid tumor with satellite lesions.
In [**8-1**], a CT showed disease progression with an enlarging right upper lobe mass, a stable right hilar mass, and a liver mass that had increased in size.
The patient was treated with carboplatin/etoposide followed by four cycles of pemetrexed with evidence of further disease progression.
Her most recent CT scan on [**2146-7-12**] demonstrated a small increase in the size of her right lung mass with an increase in both the size and number of her hepatic metastases.
Glaucoma affecting b/l 2.
Hypertension Hx 3.
Hypothyroidism (Synthroid stopped by her Oncologist).
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE EXAMINATION on admission:  temperature 97.6 F, HR 84 bpm, BP 111/56, saturating 96% on room air, respiratory rate 14 Neurological examination Cranial nerves I and VIII not formally tested II: peripheral vision constricted bilaterally, presumed to be due to her glaucoma.
III, IV, VI: normal eye movements Va, b, c : no sensory deficits noted.
However, proprioception appeared to be reduced on the [**Last Name (un) 2043**] prominences of her hallux bilaterally.

There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, this lesion is protruding partially to the left side of the third ventricle.
Magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated in these lesions related with hemorrhagic changes.
On FLAIR, no significant vasogenic edema is demonstrated.
After the administration of gadolinium contrast punctate lesions are also visualized suggesting metastatic infiltration (image #18 series #12).
A punctate focus of magnetic susceptibility is noted on the right cerebellar hemisphere (image #6 series #9), mild restricted diffusion is demonstrated surrounding these lesions, there is no evidence of acute ischemic events.
The orbits, the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Multiple hemorrhagic brain lesions most of them located supratentorially in both cerebral hemispheres and left thalamic region as described above, given the history of lung cancer the differential include metastatic hemorrhagic lesions.
Some of these lesions demonstrate magnetic susceptibility including a small focus of low signal on the right cerebellar hemisphere as described above.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
CT - IMPRESSION: Large hemorrhage within the left thalamus with concern for noncommunicating hydrocephalus.
Subtle hypoattenuation surrounding the lateral ventricles may reflect transependymal egress of cerebrospinal fluid.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There are other lesions, with surrounding edema in the right frontal lobe (series 2, image 26), and left frontal lobe (series 2, images 21 and 22).
These findings are most suspicious for metastatic disease.
Recommend MR with contrast if these are not known lesions.
US UE [**7-31**] - IMPRESSION: Superficial thrombus within the left cephalic vein limited to the antecubital fossa consistent with either a partial acute thrombus or partially recanalized chonic thrombus.
CXR [**8-2**] - IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Right infrahilar opacity consistent with lymphadenopathy demonstrated on the outside chest CTs as well as the area of prior lung resection/biopsy.
This area might represent neoplastic involvment and should be further evaluated if this was not obtained previously.

There was no evidence of elevated intracranial pressure on exam or Hx throughout the admission.
There were no changes in the neurologic exam from [**2146-7-30**] at discharge.
[**Hospital **] hospital stay was complicated by L antecubital fossa cellulitis, likely allergic reaction at onset, now cellulitis/thrombophlebitis [**2-26**] puncture wound.
Patient was started on Clindamycin PO x 3 days with progression of erythema and edema (12 x 18 cm erythematous/edematous area).
An U/S [**7-31**] showed no loculation or fluid collection, just superficial thrombophlebitis.
On [**2146-8-3**] patient was started on Vancomycin IV 1g Q12 hours for MRSA coverage, which was decreased to 750mg Q12 due to elevated trough.
Erythema and edema continued to progress, repeat U/S showed no change.
By [**8-6**] however, progression of erythema and edema was arrested.
By [**8-8**] the cellulitis nearly resolved.
Patient remained afebrile throughout the hospitalization and on discharge only minor erythema remained at site of thrombophlebitis.
# LLL crackles - noted on exam on [**2146-8-1**].
Most likely atelectasis, as patient w/o fever, cough, or SOB, thus less likely PNA.
CXR - no evidence of pulm edema, consolidation, effusion.
#) Weakness - likely [**2-26**] proximal myopathy of unknown etiology.
Per PT reports - patient will benefit from home PT 3-4times per week for balance and daily tasks, she was cleared for home.
#) Glaucoma - continued home treatments, no symptoms.
