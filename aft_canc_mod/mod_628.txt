Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal septum and apex.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-5-26**], global left ventricular systolic function is improved and a myxoma is no longer visible.
Mild mitral regurgitation is now apparent.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
