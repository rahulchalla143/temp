Of note patient was treated for pneumonia with levaquin initially but was broadened to zosyn for better GNR coverage and discharged on Augmentin which he is still currently taking.
His course was also complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and continued hypoxia for which he was discharged on supplemental O2.
His current presentation is described as Nausea and vomiting x5 starting evening prior to admission, he also noted worsening SOB.
Patient reports chills last night when nausea and vomiting started.
CT chest/abd showed increased size of pericardial effusion and persistent empyema.
Post-pericardiocentesis course complicated by severe 10/10 chest pain and atrial fibrillation with RVR.

PENDING LABS: [**2132-5-30**] 01:53 MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIAE ANTIBODY IGM Results Pending [**2132-5-30**] 01:53 MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIAE ANTIBODY, IGG Results Pending [**2132-5-31**] 09:03PM PERICARDIAL FLUID UNIVERSAL PCR FOR BACTERIA-PND   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] is a 44 year old man with hx of HTN, OSA, and asthma, recently discharged from CT surgical service where he was treated for a LLL PNA/parapneumonic effusion and empyema s/p bronch, decortication, and chest tube who presented to ED with nausea and vomiting found to have acutely worsening pericardial effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis, post-procedure course complicated by pericarditis.
# Pericardial Effusion: Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] remained hemodynamically stable in ED prior to pericardial drain without evidence of tamponade based on TTE, though pulses was initially 16.
Patient is underwent pericardiocentesis, during which 750cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed.
Repeat TTE after removal of drain showed no further accumulation of pericardial fluid.
Etiology of pericardial effusion presumed to be secondary to spread of strep pneumo in setting of recent pneumonia.
Gram Stain initially showed GPCs but lab later clarified that this may have been misread and may be debris; culture results negative to date, but patient had been on augmentin for pneumonia prior to pericardial fluid cultures, so 16S PCR was sent from pericardial fluid and is still pending.
Mycoplasma IgG and IgM were also sent and pending.
# Pericarditis Pain was controlled initially with IV toradol and IV narcotics.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Likely secondary to acute adrenergic surge from pain and pericardiocentesis.
Had episode of RVR while on CT surgery service in setting of para-pneumonic effusion and pericardial effusion.
CHADS2 is positive for hypertension and diabetes.
# Pleural effusion: Loculated and possible empyema though improved from prior.
No positive culture from prior effusion drainage.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:  New Diagnosis.
HbA1c was checked to search for causes of immunosuppression and was noted to be elevated to 8.2%.
Metformin was not started on discharge because it can theoretically interact with levofloxacin to cause hypoglycemia, and patient has no glycometer at home yet.
Presumed to be related to congestive hepatopathy from constrictive physiology of pericardial effusion.
# Hypertension: Chronic hypertension, initially held antihypertensives but restarted home meds on admission, amlodipine-benazapril.

Discharge Instructions: You had a pericardial effusion that was drained and that has not reaccumulated.
You have been started on colchacine to decrease pain and inflammation.
You had some atrial fibrillation that we think is because of the effusion and have started an aspirin to decrease your risk of a stroke.
START taking levoquin for a total of 2 more weeks for the pneumonia 3.
START taking aspirin to prevent a stroke 5.
