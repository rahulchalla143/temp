CHF, with recent admission for COPD exacerbation and rapid afib (complicated by brief MICU stay for BiPAP/CPAP) who presents with acute on chronic shortness of breath and respiratory failure.
He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 93122**] with COPD flare in the setting of URI.
Per report from his wife, since discharge he has had persistent fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance.
Per report he had been compliant with his medications, with no real sick contacts or travel.
However, early this AM, the wife reports worsening of his respirations and SOB.
She called EMS for immedicate evaluation.
EMS arrived, his end tidal C02 near 100, 02 80s with decreased mental status.
Nasotracheal intubation attempted without success and was taken to the ED.
Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus II Morbid Obesity COPD - no hx of intubations or steroids, uses inhalers?

The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is markedly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate-to-severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief this was a 68M with COPD, OSA, CHF, and A-fib who presented with acute on chronic hyperbaric respiratory failure following recent COPD exacerbation.
He received nitric oxide treatment over night ([**2135-2-17**]) for pulm HTN, however w/o any change in his respiratory status.
Other possible causes of respiratory failure were explored and ruled out, which were acute CHF in the setting of acute MI (CE negative x 3), pulmonary embolism (CTA negative).
However he appeared to be in CHF exacerbation with some fluid overload, also cardiomegaly.
Therefore Solu-Medrol was d/c'ed, which was initially given for COPD exacerbation and diuresed with daily goals of -1L.
He also was empirically treated for PNA with Vancomycin, Zosyn and Cipro.
During the course of his hospital stay his cardiorespiratory status became more difficult to manage, as he remained in hyperpercarbic respiratory failure and developed shock symptomatic in the setting biventricular heart failure as well as afib with RVR which remained poorly controlled.
Was restarted on Neo-Synephrine, however also on maxed out of esmolol & diltiazem for rate control (which was almost impossible to control w/o compromise in BP).
Patients respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock remained unchanged.
