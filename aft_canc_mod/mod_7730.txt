Admission Date:  [**2103-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-9-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-8-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Clindamycin / Vancomycin / Bactrim DS / Codeine / Phenobarbital  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10323**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Port removal G-tube replacement PICC placement   History of Present Illness: 56M w/HIV on HAART, Hodgkin's s/p chemoradiation, and HNSCC of tongue s/p chemo/radiation w/PEG-tube p/w fever to 101 last night, profound lethargy, hypotension today.
Patient was brought in by husband for 1 day history of suddden and progressive lethargy, fever to 101 at home, and weakness.
Patient also complained of nausea/vomiting x1-2 times over last few days.
Also noted recent history of pain at and around the PEG tube site along with serous then serosanguinous discharge and accompanying redness/erythema.
Patient and husband thought this might have been secondary to vomiting.
On the day prior to admission, he did have abdominal pain on context of too much G tube feeding, but has since resolved.
Of note, for hypotension at home, patient received a 2600 cc bolus by the husband, and pressures did not respond.
Because of general malaise, fever, and non-fluid responsive hypotension, husband brought patient into the [**Name (NI) **].
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.4 (spiked 102.8 shortly after coming to ED) 103 70/40 18 93%  Patient was noted to be lethargic and ill-appearing.
FAST ultrasound was performed which showed non-collapsable IVC, no pericardial effusion, and good wall motion.
Labs were notable for a normal white count at 8.2 (diff N: 86.1, L 9.5, M 3.8, E 05, B 0.1), normal chem 7 with bun/cr of [**12-29**].1, lactate 2.0, low albumin at 3.2, no transaminitis, and slight coagulopathy with INR 1.4.
2L NS were run and patient remained hypotensive although AOx3 and mentating well.
This current presentation is within a broader history notable for: - Hypotension responsive to fluids for last 3 months ever since completing chemotherapy.
Husband feels general malaise started ~30 days ago and has worsened since, and that hypotension has become harder to manage in teh last 30 days - Of note, patient recently admitted for opioid withdrawal and detox, and discharged on fentanyl taper with standing clonidine and prn clonazepam.
On transfer from ED, VS were: 99.9 80 102/56 18 98%  Prior to transfer, patient was noted to be resting without complaints, and on levophed at 0.6.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 97.7 70 112/65 97% 2L NC    Past Medical History: Oncologic history: -Mr. [**Known lastname 93766**] started having difficulty swallowing back in [**8-/2102**], and this continued to progress.
-He was being evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who follows him for his Hodgkin's disease and he [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a PET scan on [**2103-4-16**], on which was seen a marked FDG avidity at the base of the tongue consistent with a primary malignancy and a single right level IIB lymph node with FDG uptake.
Complicated by mucositis, pain while swallowing.
In [**2098**], he represented with two to three months of left inguinal lymphadenopathy.

There is trace physiologic pericardial fluid.
The liver enhances homogeneously without evidence of focal lesion.
The decompressed gallbladder has a large calcified 1.4-cm stone in the neck.
A 1.8-cm simple cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney (2A:29) has increased in size since [**2098**].
Smaller subcentimeter hypodensities in the interpolar region of the right kidney and upper pole of the left kidney are too small to characterize.
Small paraaortic lymph nodes are unchanged, for example an 8-mm node to the left of the SMA origin (2A:28).
Additional small subcentimeter nodes are seen all along the paraaortic chains.
There is no evidence of contrast or air extravasation.
Minimal air is seen along the PEG tube tract (2A:24).
PELVIS:  A small amount of free pelvic fluid tracks along the right paracolic gutter (300B:37) and into the pelvis (300B:25).
The adjacent loops of small bowel and ascending colon have thin walls.
There is no pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
Free abdominal fluid along the right paracolic gutter is of uncertain etiology and may relate recent volume resuscitation.
There is no evidence of adjacent colitis.
No abscess or fluid collection to explain fever and hypotension.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
PEG tube without evidence of leakage.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior and apical near-akinesis and hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferior and inferolateral segments.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of multi-vessel coronary artery disease.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
There is no evidence of extravasation.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Chemotherapy port was de-accessed because of concern as source of infection.
Blood cultures were followed, which grew out coag + staph aureus in [**5-2**] bottles.
CT scan was performed, which did not show abscess or evidence of obstruction associated with the PEG tube.
*TTE was performed, and showed no vegetations *TEE was not performed due to recent chemotherapy and radiation for head and neck cancer.
ID recommended 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment with daptomycin due to inability to definitively rule out endocarditis.
*Surveillance blood cultures were sent, with negative cultures x 2 on [**2103-9-12**] *Patient remained hemodynamically stable, and the central line was discontinued on [**2103-9-18**] *PICC line was placed on [**2103-9-18**]  # DECREASED EF: On TTE, patient found to have new wall motion abnormalities suggestive of multivessel CAD.
ECHO revealed LVEF 25-30% with anteroseptal, apical, and inferiolateral hypokinesis.
has had several sets of cardiac enzymes drawn, all which were negative, although he did have T wave inversions in I, V1-V4 which were new from prior EKG done in [**2103-5-29**].
This is most likely to due to a silent MI at least 1 week prior to admission given half-life of Troponin-T. Cardiology was consulted and recommended coronary catheterization once patient has completed treatment for MRSA bacteremia.
Was thought to be [**3-1**] known septic shock vs. opioid withdrawal vs. opioid withdrawal meds (was on standing clonazepam).
An effort was made to discontinue all hypnotic medications, and Zydis was started, to which the patient responded.
# TACHYCARDIA: Patient's HR increased over the day [**9-14**] to the low 100s.
Patient's Klonipin was discontinued in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in light of AMS, so tachycardia may represent benzo withdrawal.
PE considered as a possibility though LE was reassuring and no evidence of hypoxia or acute symptoms of SOB, chest discomfort.
# ANEMIA & THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Thrombocytopenia likely [**3-1**] HIV/immune-mediated picture vs. simply hemodilution (received aggressive fluid bolus at home as well as in hospital).
Anemia with hemodilution in context of anemia of chronic disease.
Given peri-sepsis picture and slightly elevated INR, considered potential DIC, although unlikely given clinical picture.
# COAGULOPATHY: Mild.
Likely [**3-1**] poor PO intake in context of HNSCC and recent difficulty with PEG tube.
# HYPERTENSIVE EPISODE: On first night of admission, patient developed hypertension with auscultated SBPs to 160s-180s.
Thought to be potentially clonidine rebound hypertension (was holding because of septic shock), worsened by severe anxiety.
EKG was performed which showed T wave inversions in lateral precordial leads.
Troponins were cycled which did not show evidence for acute MI.
Patient remained asymptomatic thereafter.
Came in on fentanyl taper in context of opioid dependency for HNSCC mucositis/pain.
# Anxiety: Acute on chronic.
Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine 15-30 mL PO QID:PRN throat pain 4.
Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine 15-30 mL PO QID:PRN throat pain 17.
Fluconazole 200 mg PO Q24H   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 6438**]  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA bacteremia due to port infection Tongue cancer HIV   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
