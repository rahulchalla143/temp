On the day of her third dose she had noted some constipation, abdominal distention and fatigue with decreased sleep and took stool softeners with some avail.
On [**2122-4-17**], she had developed some nausea with non-bloody, non-bilious, food particulate emesis and loose, non-bloody stools despite her prior constipation concerns.
She discussed these findings with her Oncologist, but had no abdominal pain or fevers; her PO intake had tapered.
On [**2122-4-21**], she spoke with the on-call provider from [**Name9 (PRE) 2287**] who instructed her to present to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED given that her PO intake had been poor, her fatigue had worsened to the point of her being bedbound and her nausea with emesis had persisted.
She also noted some urinary frequency and urgency.
She has had no recent sick contacts, upper respiratory or cough symptoms.
No neck pain or meningismus; no photophobia.
Of note, she also underwent therapeutic paracentesis on [**2122-4-10**] with removal of 4 liters of serosanguinous ascites which showed negative cytology.
This was performed given on-going worsening abdominal distention and ascites with a significant decrease in PO intake.
Since her therapeutic tap she has noted no increase in intra-abdominal distention or abdominal pain.
A CXR showed no evidence of consolidation.
in the ED she received 4L normal saline with minimal UOP.
She received Cefepime 2 grams IV x 1 for neutropenic fever concerns.
Of note, at 15:00 she developed fever to 102.9 with rigors and tachycardia to the 130s.
She denies worsening abdominal discomfort, but has had minimal urine output.
ROS: Denies headaches or vision changes.
No cough or upper respiratory symptoms.
Denies chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
No nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria.
Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or neurologic complaints.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Presented with abdominal distention, early satiety and anemia in 10/[**2120**].
EGD ([**2120-12-20**]) demonstrated gastritis that was H.pylori positive.
CT imaging in [**12/2120**] revealed inumerable liver metastases and omentum cake with marked ascites and small left adrenal mass.
Cytology was positive for malignant cells.
Biopsy of a liver lesion noted poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features (strongly positive for CK7, TTF-1, synpatophysin and focal positivity for chromogranin and [**Last Name (un) **]-31, but CK-20, CDX-2, S100 negative.
The immunohistochemical profile fit lung carcinoma, but CT chest imaging revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules without dominant lung mass.
In [**1-/2121**] she had large volume paracentesis and underwent initiation of chemotherapy ([**2121-1-15**]) - Carboplatin AUC 5 and Paclitaxol (therapy from [**2121-1-15**] to [**2121-5-1**] for 4-cycles) - Carboplatin and Doxil (for widespread recurrence, [**2121-9-4**] to [**2121-11-6**] for 3-cycles) - Gemcitabine and Docetaxol (for disease progression, [**2121-12-4**] to [**2122-4-2**] for 6-cycles) - Cisplatin and Etoposide (began cycling on [**2122-4-13**], last dosing [**2122-4-15**]) .

[**4-21**] Urine culture- no growth [**4-22**] Blood culture- no growth [**4-23**] Blood culture- no growth .
[**2122-4-6**] FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT) - Significant progression of disease burden since the examination from [**2122-1-28**] with worsening peritoneal carcinomatosis, ascites, liver metastases, and pulmonary nodules.
Mild worsening of right hydroureteronephrosis.
[**2122-4-10**] PARACENTESIS DIAG/THERA - Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis, with removal of 4.0 liters of serosanguinous ascites.
[**2122-4-21**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Large ascites with layering dependent hematocrit level consistent with hemoperitoneum.
The source of bleeding is not identified on this examination, though the patient is known to have intraperitoneal metastatic disease.
Findings again consistent with known widely metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin, with probable interval progression of liver masses, and redemonstration of adnexal mass, multiple omental masses, and peritoneal implants consistent with metastatic disease.
Bilateral hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter to the level of the pelvis.
Delineation is limited on this non-contrast examination, but the fibroid uterus and pelvic metastatic deposits may be contributing to progressive ureteral dilation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

# SEVERE POLYMICROBIAL SEPSIS, FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA - Presented with nausea, emesis and neutropenic fevers.
She was broadly covered, then narrowed to vancomycin/ceftriaxone once cultures grew pansensitive klebsiella and streptococcus.
Source of GNR, GPC bacteremia appeared to be biliary or intra-abdominal given her peritoneal carcinomatosis and implants resulting in probable bacterial translocation and seeding.

# ASCITES- Patient has known chronic ascites.
She had increased abdominal girth after aggressive fluid resuscitation in ICU for early goal directed therapy.
She had no evidence of SBP.

# ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY, METABOLIC DERANGEMENTS - Patient presented with acute elevation in creatinine to 1.5 with BUN 40 in the setting of septic shock.
# LEUKOPENIA, ACUTE ON CHRONIC NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA, THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Patient required PRBC and platelet transfusions during admission secondary to myelosuppressive therapy.
Patient received neupogen injections daily until neutropenia resolved.
# POORLY DIFFERENTIATED METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY - Notable for neuroendocrine features.
