A CXR was done and was negative for a overt infiltrate or pulmonary congestion.

Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo with COPD, morbid obesity, now p/w with COPD exacerbation, likely triggered by URI.
# Hypoxia: admission exam c/w with COPD exacerbation.
No evidence of pulmonary infiltrate suggestive of PNA.
Trigger for COPD exacerbation could be recent URI, also ?influenza, although patient received vaccine.
Patient was transferred to the cardiology service for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The high dose of beta blocker did not worsen his breathing with his COPD flare and in fact his breathing had improved likely due to the effect of steroid / abx / bronchodilators he had been on.
Rate controlled to a range of 90-110 on the cardiology floor and patient was transferred back to medicine service for further management of COPD flare.
# Recent fever: likely due to URI.
Unlikely to be due to rectal abscess.
# Diabetes mellitus: Continued on metformin and insuline regimen.
# Coagulopathy: on warfarin for atrial flutter, goal [**12-26**]; INR 5 on admission with no sign of bleeding, and warfarin was held.
