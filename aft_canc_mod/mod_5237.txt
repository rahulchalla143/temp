Admission Date:  [**2102-3-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-12-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**] Chief Complaint: Hepatic encephalopathy, iatrogenic pneumothorax, respiratory failure.
History of Present Illness: A 59 yo male with HCC and Hep C cirrhosis who was admitted to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center on [**3-7**] for respiratory failure in the setting of worsening hepatic ecephalopathy.
He was extubated on [**3-10**], but subsequently reintubated for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure which failed NIPPV.
An attempted at a CVL on [**3-11**] resulted in a left-sided pneumothorax.
An emergent chest tube and left subclavian line were placed on [**3-12**] after discovery of the pneumothorax (likely the result of CVL attempt on [**3-11**]).
Hepatitis C cirrhosis, previously on transplant list but now off due to non-compliance.
Multifocal hepatocellular cancer diagnosed in [**10-18**] on imaging which revealed two enhancing lesions within the liver: one in high dome of segment VII and the second was lateral to the bifurcation of the right portal vein.
MRI [**2-/2101**] revealed four dominant arterially enhancing lesions with progression of at least one lesion.
At last follow-up in [**10-19**], was found to have new pulmonary nodule in RML, worrisome but not definitive for HCC met.
No evidence of liver recurrence as of [**10-19**].
Pneumonia in [**2078**] with prolonged admit, 2 pulmonary abscesses.
Mild COPD.
History of narcotic abuse.

Cirrhosis with massive ascites, splenomegaly and varices.
Main portal vein markedly narrowed, and right portal vein diminutive, without definite evidence of complete occlusion.
Patient is status post chemoembolization in the right hepatic lobe, with evidence of tumor extension of a segment VI lesion to the diaphragmatic/peritoneal reflection.
New 12 mm lesion in segment 3 and 7 mm lesion in segment 7 that are potentially concerning for new foci of HCC.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with collapse of both lower lobes.
Small left pneumothorax remains after removal of chest tube.
Patchy right upper lobe opacities and bilateral nodular densities are as previously seen.
Speech and swallow consult showed continuing aspiration.
This was presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy from non-compliance with lactulose at home.
Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
He was found to have progression of hepatocellular carcinoma with an AFP of >3000 up from less than 200.
As expected by the elevated AFP, the CT showed extension of the liver cancer to involve the capsule and diaphragm.
In addition there were several new lesions visualized in the liver parenchyma.
Thus he was no longer a surgical or transplant candidate.
The left-sided chest tube (placed at outside hospital for pneumothorax) continued to drain large amounts of straw-colored fluid, and it was felt that this fluid was likely draining from his ascitic abdomen (via the diaphragm) down the path of least resistance to the pleural space.
Thus we spoke with thoracics service and they agreed to remove the chest tube, as serial x-rays had demonstrated near complete resorption of the apical pneumothorax and it was clear the ascitic fluid would continue to accumulate in the pleural space.
Follow-up chest x-rays after chest tube removal showed stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Cultures from the pleural fluid (presumed to be draining from the peritoneal cavity) grew out vancomycin-resistent enterococcus.
Meanwhile, urine cultures taken on the same day grew out VRE as well.
Initially, while the urine and pleural fluid cultures were still pending sensitivities, he was kept on ceftriaxone for UTI and presumptive SBP.
His mental status improved markedly on the combination of lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and Daptomycin for VRE UTI and SBP.
Ascites and Lower Extremity Swelling (due to Cirrhosis).
He underwent ultrasound-guided paracenteses x2 for total of 4.5 L fluid removal.
These should be continued for treatment of ascites and lower extremity swelling.
For pain related to his ascites, we have been treating with morphine 15 mg twice daily.
He was complaining of intermittent jaw pain during the last few days of this admission.
On exam there was no focal tenderness or jaw malalignment to suggest bone metastases or fracture.
We felt the symptoms were consistent with TMJ dysfunction, and treated with low dose Flexeril as needed.
It was agreed that we would continue to take measures to alleviate his pain and to treat the infections and complications from his end stage liver disease and hepatocellular cancer.
