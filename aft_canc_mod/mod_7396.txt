Marked scoliosis is again seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right lower extremity.
[**8-31**] RLE Duplex: FINDINGS: There is normal color Doppler signal, pulse Doppler waveform, compressibility, and augmentation within the veins of the left lower extremity, including the left common femoral, left superficial femoral, and left popliteal veins.
IMPRESSION: Negative for DVT within the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
Large posterior ulceration extending to the left iliac bone, with associated inflammation consistent with osteomyelitis.
4 x 1 cm low-density fluid collection within the residual joint of the right hip.
Small fat-containing right lumbar hernia.
[**9-5**] CT P: CT-guided needle placement in the right hip yielded no fluid; the hypodense area seen on the CT scan therefore likely represents organizing granulation tissue or phlegmon rather than a loculated fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 year old woman with transverse myelitis and paraplegia c/b severe pressure ulcers and several prior wound infections who presented on [**8-11**] with sepsis successfully treated with early goal-directed therapy thought [**2-19**] decubiti and osteomyelitis also with E.coli and subsequent E.cloacae urinary tract infection stable on current regimen of vancomycin and meropenem.
Osteomyelitis - Upon presentation, the patient had several decubiti that could be probed to the bone.
She continued to spike and there was some concern for drug fever although the offending drug was unclear.
As she continued to spike fevers and was repeatedly cultured without isolation of probable offending bacteria, the patient was imaged to look for possible fluid collection.
All antibiotics were stopped for approximately 2 days after an area of possible fluid collection was located in the patient's right hip.
Unfortunately, her course in IR was complicated when the IR needle broke off in her hip and had to be retrieved with a small incision by surgery.
There was discussion as to the potential benefit of bone biopsy if the patient continued to spike but the patient was resistent to this idea due to her protracted and complicated course.
On [**9-25**], patient developed fevers and a UTI.
Sacral decubitus ulcer / heel ulcers: Most likely source of infection.
Plastic surgery team consulted but did not feel like she was a surgical candidate given chronic infection and the size of the wound.
They did not believe that she needed an MRI to assess for osteomyelitis, given presumed diagnosis as they were able to probe to bone.
Wound care nursing made recommendations regarding how to treat wounds and followed patient throughout her stay with drastic improvement in her decubiti during her stay.
UTI: The patient was found to have a highly resistant E.coli UTI on [**9-5**].
She defervesced with ceftazadime and, since this antibiotic was necessary for her osteomyelitis treatment, she was continued on this antibiotic for her UTI as well as her osteo.
Patient subsequently developed a UTI with fevers with E.cloacae sensitive to meropenem growing within urine on urine culture.
Urinary Incontinence: The patient's urinary incontinence was thought to be contributing to maceration of her pelvic tissues.
She had foley's in place throughout her stay but has an incompetent urethra with leaking of fluid around the foley balloon.
Patient also constantly was accusing staff of prejudice due to her self declared adherence to both the [**Hospital1 **] and jehova's witness faiths.
Psychiatry diagnosed her with shizophrenia vs. schizoaffective disorder, and started her on Risperdal 2mg [**Hospital1 **] with 2mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN.
Anemia: Patient has beta-thalassemia trait along with anemia of chronic disease.
Lowest HCT was 22.4, however patient declined transfusions given that she is a Jehova's witness.
She was slightly tachycardic during her stay but was otherwise unsymptomatic.
No blood products.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**1-19**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Risperidone 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety, agitation.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-19**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed for congestion .
Grade 4 Sacral, perineal, and ischial decubitus ulcers 3.
Chronic osteomyelitis 5.
Likely Schizoaffective Disorder 6.
Anemia with presumed beta-thalassemia trait   Discharge Condition: good, vital signs have been stable, afebrile for the last 7 days, eating, drinking without complaint.
Patient has a tendency to believe that people are prejudiced towards her due to her religion, it is helpful if people explain to her the procedures being done before doing it in a calm fashion.
Also, patient ambulates via wheel chair and has several decubitis ulcers and heel wounds which need constant attention and dressing as outlined in the discharge instructions.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital in septic shock, due to the infection in from your ulcers.
Orthopedics had placed some staples in your lower right abdomen which was later removed after the area had healed.
In addition, you were started on two antibiotics, meropenem and vancomycin, because you had started having a urinary tract infection, and a possible infection in your blood and your bones.
Please check weekly ESR/CRPs to assess for resolution of inflammatory response, and weekly vancomycin troughs, and fax to the Infectious Disease Clinic: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**]    Completed by:[**2129-10-11**
