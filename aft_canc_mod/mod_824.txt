Admission Date:  [**2135-4-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-11-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Reglan / Protonix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R IJ placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] is a 54 yo man with ESRD on home PD, CAD s/p MI with 3-vessel disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, who presents with hypotension.
Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] reports that for the past 3-4 days he has been noting mild cough productive of white sputum.
He did feel light headeded but denies loss of consciousness or neausea.
He denies any respiratory distress, fevers, urinary symptoms, focal pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, or other localizing symptoms.
He does endorse slight increase in chronic LE edema .
Exam was without localizing features apart from an elevated JVP.
Bedside echo demonstrated global hypokinesis, thought to be similar to prior.
EKG showed ST depressions in v3-v6 and new QW in II, new from prior.
Labs were notable for trop elevated above baseline but no CK elevation.
They felt that this was either demand ischmia or a missed cardiac event.
They recommended Plavix and [**Known lastname **], which were given, but no heparinization unless CK became elevated.
Past Medical History: # Recent septic shock: [**1-26**].
This was treated with vanc/cipro/zosyn, and stress-dose corticosteroids.
Wound swab from a LLE ulcer grew MSSA and antibiotics were changed to nafcillin x 1 day and then Unasyn.
No other positive culture data.
# Recent c diff infection: [**2-/2135**], s/p 21 days PO vanc # Insulin dependent diabetes type I - complications of neuropathy, retinopathy, gastroparesis (somewhat responsive to erthromycin) # Renal transplant, [**2119**], now on PD since [**5-27**] - followed by Dr  [**Location (un) 805**] # CAD - 3VD, DES to OM [**3-26**] - Cardiac cath [**12-14**] showed 3VD, no intervention was performed.
- Cardiac surgery planed for surgery pending resolution of medical issues - during admission [**1-26**] for sepsis, pt noted to have demand ischemia with CK peaking at 647 and troponin 1.59.
# Systolic CHF: ECHO [**1-26**] showed EF 20 % with hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall; akinesis of the posterior wall.
# Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] # PVD # HTN # h/o Osteomyelitis of R 5th metatarsal in [**2128**] # Eosinophilic gastritis # Stoke in [**2123**] with right hand weakness, resolved on its own   Social History: no smoking, ETOH, or illicit drug use  Family History: One sister has a congenital [**Last Name 4006**] problem.
Mother and another sister with bipolar disorder on lithium.
Physical Exam: On arrival to MICU: Afebrile, BP 110/70 on .09 levophed, O2 97% RA, HR 70s General: comfortable appearing man lying flat in bed in no distress, friendly and conversant [**Name (NI) 4459**]: Sclera anicteric, Moon face Neck: supple, JVP to jaw Lungs: bilateral expiratory crackles 1/3 up lung fields, no wheezing or rhonchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, PD catheter site clean, dry, nontender Ext: cool distal extremities, faint pedal pulses.
~ 1 cm eschar on R heal, nontender and nonerythematous, s/p L 2nd toe amputation, site without skin lesions, 1+ pitting edema to mid-calf bilaterally On Discharge: BO stable off pressors.
There is no pneumothorax.
The component of mild pulmonary edema has resolved.
There is persistent right lower lobe opacity consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.
# Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic vs distributive vs hypovolemic causes.
Among cardiogenic causes, this may represent an acute exacerbation of his chronic CHF or a new cardiac event.
He may be septic, although afebrile and without localizing signs or symptoms.
He does state that he has noticed a decrease in his weight and poor PO intake.
For the possibility of sepsis, vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactem were started but discontinued after there was no evidence of sepsis.
Blood, urine, PD fluid, sputum cultures, stool for c diff if diarrhea were ordered.
Most likely was a combination of poor systolic function, poor PO intake, and adrenal insufficiency.
# EKG changes: Patient has known 3VD and systolic dysfunction with EF 20% with new QW on EKG.
This likely represented a recent cardiac event with CK now resolved and troponin trending down.
Bedside echo in ED without clear evidence of new WMA.
Per cardiology recommendations in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Plavix were continued and no heparinization.
He likely also had demand ischemia in the ED related to poor perfusion pressures with shock.
# ESRD: c/b failed renal transplant, on nocturnal PD.
No urgent indication for dialysis on admission, although BUN/creatinine higher than previously in OMR, likely secondary to missing HD the night prior.
Likely secondary to renal failure and mildly elevated lactate.
# Diabetes type I:  He was given home dose of insulin lantus and humalog sliding scale.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Disp:*270 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 932**] Area VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: hypotension heart failure  secondary: Adrenal insufficiency End stage renal disease Diabetes type I   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were seen and treated in the hospital for low blood pressure requiring admission to the medical intensive care unit in order to maintain your blood pressure to adequte levels.
The most likely cause of your low blood pressure may have been due to over-dialyzing with peritoneal dialysis at home resulting in removing too much fluid.
It may also have been caused by your lack of appetite for five days resulting in reduced fluid intake.
Given new findings on your Echocardiogram one other possibility for your low blood pressures may have been due to a mild heart attack.
During your hospital course you were started on antibiotics for presummed septic infection but these medications have been discontinued given no signs or symptoms of infection.
