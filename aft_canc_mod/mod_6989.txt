Was off anticoagulation (Coumadin) since ~ [**2162-8-6**] secondary to hematuria, wet macular degeneration and scheduled surgery.
Underwent transurethral resection of bladder cancer for hematuria on [**2162-8-26**].
Post-procedure his blood pressure increased again to 200/95 and his EKG was concerning for ventricular bigeminy.
He was treated with esmolol 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg IV respectively, followed by labetolol 10 mg IV and lidocaine 100 mg IV with improvement in his blood pressure and ventricular ectopy.
He was also noticed to have increased shortness of breath and oxygen requirement and had a CXR which showed pulmonary edema.
He underwent a STAT head CT which was negative for hemorrhage.
CTA was showed a likely superior division MCA embolic stroke.
Given the patient's previous history of hemorrhagic stroke, surgery that same day and hypertension he was felt to not be a candidate for TPA.
The neurosurgical service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and determined that there was no indication for intraarterial TPA or mechanical clot retrival.
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and upon arrival there was noted to be aphasic with right gaze preference and no motion of his left lower extremity.

Likely consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension.
Neurologic function improved - patient withdraws to pain on left forearm and does spontaneously move left leg.
Neurology reccomending as of [**8-31**] to restart anticoagulation as they believe the risk of repeated stroke is greater than the risk of bleed into the area of already ischemic damage.
On admission, saturating well on 3L NC but exam concerning for harsh bilateral rales and tachypnea.
Patient was intubated subsequent morning for concerns over pulmonary edema and also inability to protect in the airway in the setting of not immediately improving neurologic function.
Patient was extubated [**8-30**] without complication.

FEN: Patient initially NPO with concern for aspiration.
He failed speech and swallow evaluations.
However, due to family concerns regarding bleeding risk while being on aspirin, this G tube placement will be deferred to the outpatient.
Risks of being off aspirin, including risk of embolic stroke with atrial fibrillation, were discussed with the [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) 440**] [**Name (NI) 15532**], as well as risk of septal erosion, sinusitis, and pain and agitation with prolonged NG tube placement was also communicated.
