He denies loss of conscious but does endorse feeling lightheaded more than usual this week.
He is not on any anticoagulation and denies any vasoactive or changes in medications.
He does endorse poor PO intake, feeling lightheaded more this week than usual in addition to R hip pain where he had previous surgery.

Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, + LIJ CVC Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, upper extremity skin impairments from fall, right ankle with deformity.
Low lung volumes limit evaluation, likely right basiliar atelectasis.
C-spine ([**2193-6-4**]): Severe multi-level degenerative disease without acute fracture or dislocation  CT Head ([**2193-6-4**]): Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right lateral sulculs just posterior to the right insula.
Small para-falcine subdural hematoma.
CT head ([**2193-6-5**]) Redistribution of subarachnoid [**Month/Day/Year **] with a slight increase in intraventricular hemorrhage located dependently in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, bilaterally.
No new hemorrhage in any other compartment.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed or other acute intra-abdominal process.
Unchanged pulmonary nodules and pleural plaque, stable since at least [**2187**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with history of lymphocytic lymphoma and recent hospitalization two weeks ago for pneumonia and multiple admissions for orthostatic hypotension presents from home with fall resulting in SAH with other issues including ARF from poor PO intake, relative hypotension, and worsening anemia.
# Subarachnoid hemorrhage Patient presented from home with a fall after getting dizzy, resulting in skin tears on left arm and R hip pain.
NCHCT in the ED showed Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right lateral sulculs just posterior to the right insula.
Small para-falcine subdural hematoma.
Patient had known thrombocytopenia prior to fall.
# Fall Patient reported falls in setting of dizziness, and were likely the result of orthostatic hypotension.
Patient was placed on telemetry which revealed sinus rythm, and an EKG did not show ischemic changes.
# Relative hypotension [**Name2 (NI) **] usually SBP 140-160 supine to 105 with standing.
No obvious source of infection with clear CXR and urinalysis although leukocytosis relative to baseline (WBC ~ 3 --> 5).
While anemia was concerning for possible GI bleed, FOBT was negative.
Given his long h/o orthostatic hypotension and failed trials of medical therapy in the past, we felt it was best that he be evaluated by a specialist in the field.
# Anemia Patient presented with a drop in Hgb 8.8-9.3 a week prior to admission to 5.9.
Reteroperitoneal bleed was ruled out with abdominal CT and no other sources of active bleeding were identified.
# Thrombocytopenia:  had known thrombocytopenia from underlying malignancy likely contributed to development of SAH.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease:  BUN and Cr were elevated from baseline in the setting of poor po intake.
#BPH:  Finesteride was held due to orthostatic hypotension.
TRANSITION OF CARE: -f/u in neurosurgery [**Name2 (NI) **] with repeat head CT -f/u with hematology for neupogen and procrit -f/u with neurology for orthostatic hypotension w/u    Medications on Admission: 1. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Orthostatic Hypotension Anemia attributed to MDS Thrombocytopenia Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital because you had a very bad fall.
A CT scan of your head showed that there was a small amount of [**Known lastname **] around your brain, but it did not cause you any problems.
You were also found to have low [**Known lastname **] counts, so while you were here you received [**Known lastname **] and platelets.
You still have orthostatic hypotension.
Your florinef medication was stopped earlier this year since it was causing many side effects.
