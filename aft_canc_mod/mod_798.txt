[**2138-9-20**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS: No evidence of pulmonary embolism, Left lower lobe airspace disease with air bronchograms consistent with pneumonia, Bilateral loculated pleural effusions, Marked left-sided pleural thickening and a large loculated left subpulmonic effusion.
No gross evidence of airway obstruction.
A separate hilar mass is felt to be less likely, but correlation with previous outside studies would be useful.
1.8 x 1.5 cm enhancing lesion in the left lower lobe of the liver.
Differential diagnosis includes focal nodular hyperplasia, adenoma, or a flash filling hemangioma.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion primarily anterior to the right ventricular free wall and minimal lateral and inferolateral to the left ventricle.
There is no right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse.
Mild prominence of interstitial markings persists consistent with mild interstitial edema.
Left apical pleural thickening or fluid cap persists.
The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged as well as diffuse pleural thickening of the left hemithorax and small right pleural effusion.

There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No RA or RV diastolic collapse.
Sinus tachycardia.
The P-R interval is short at 100 without evidence of pre-excitation.

Compared to the previous tracing left atrial abnormality is new.
[**2138-9-27**] PORTABLE CXR: Left-sided pleural opacification appears similar.
Cardiomediastinal contours remain slightly widened, and a worsening diffuse interstitial process is present, likely reflecting pulmonary edema.
Additional dependent airspace opacities in the retrocardiac regions are unchanged and could reflect dependent edema or infection.
[**2138-9-30**] REPEAT TTE: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of Hodgkins Lymphoma diagnosed in [**2127**] who was recently diagnosed with mesothelioma in [**2138-5-18**] after confirmatory biopsy at [**Hospital1 112**] /[**Company 2860**].
He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as a transfer from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital where he presented shortly after 2am on [**2138-9-20**] with tachypnea and multiple episodes of SVT terminating with vagal maneuvers and IV adenosine.
ABNORMAL RHYTHM: The patient's differential included aVNRT, WPW given his short PR interval on EKG and family history.
He was symptomatic with lightheadedess and hypotensive.
Procainamide was discontinued and Amiodorone PO was started for better control of Mr. [**Known lastname **] SVT with the understanding that it would not be used as a long term medicine in the setting of underlying pulmonary disease.
Metoprolol was discontinued given risks for bradycardia and hypotension while on Amiodorone.
He had a breakthrough episode of SVT on [**2138-9-27**] and his HR rose into the 160s range for less than 5 minutes.
He remained alert and oriented and had no associated chest pains, dizziness or desaturations during this episode.
The tachycardia terminated  after carotid massage and no additional anti-arrhythmics were needed.
Following this event the EP team was consulted for further review of the patient's EKGs and telemetry strips and felt that this SVT was a 2:1 atrial tachycardia with aberrancy and was slightly slower than the more rapid SVT the patient had experienced after admission.
At the time of discharge he had no complaints of dizziness, palpitations, chest pain or shortness of breath at rest.
Of note - just prior to transfer on the morning of [**2138-10-1**], he had another episode of asymptomatic SVT.
EKG was suggestive of 2:1 atrial flutter.
CARDIAC PUMP FUNCTION: In regards to Mr. [**Known lastname **] cardiac pump function he had serial echocardiograms during his hospital stay which revealed a normal EF in the 55-60% range despite some evidence of pulmonary volume overload.
These pulmonary findings were likely due to his underlying underlying mesothelioma versus cardiac in origin.
He had no JVD elevations or lower extremity edema consistent with pump failure during his hospital course despite having an elevated BNP.
Repeat TTE studies showed that his baseline pericardial effusion appeared more circumferential, but still remained primarily anterior to the RV.
No RA or RV diastolic collapse or tamponade features were noted.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Initially a pulmonary embolism was ruled out with CTA after admission given the patient's baseline sinus tachycardia and tachypnea.
During an acute episode of SVT on [**2138-9-21**], hospital day 2 in the CCU, the patient's HR reached 260-270 range and after failed vagal maneuvers and 2 rounds of Adenosine IV the patient was cardioverted to attain NSR again.
Prior to cardioversion, anesthesia was called and the patient was sedated and given Propofol and Midazolam prior to intubation for airway protection and comfort as the patient was extremely anxious and respirations were in the 30s.
The patient became very sedated with low RR and repeat ABG showed a respiratory acidosis with pH 7.17 and pCO2 101.
The patient had excellent urine output and self-diuresis s/p extubation and did not require any additional Lasix.
He complained of a mild sore throat after extubation which abated in 2 days and he was given additional Cepacol throat lozenges for added relief.
PNEUMONIA: The patient's above respiratory distress was felt to be multi-factorial with contributing underlying poor lung reserve at baseline given his mesothelioma alongside a newly recognized LLL pneumonia on CT and CXR as well as his extreme anxiety and tendency toward tachypnea.
The patient's bilateral basal pleural thickening and and bilateral effusions were prominent on prior imaging but he had a newer left lower lobar consolidation which was felt to be a new Pneumonia.
He also had an elevated white count which was 13 on admission and peaked at 17.
He was therefore started on IV Vancomycin, Zosyn and Azithromycin for extended atypical bacterial coverage.
All studies returned as unremarkable for any definitive infections.
MESOTHELIOMA: Based on above outlined chest CT and CXR results it is unclear whether that patient has progression of his underlying Mesothelioma process in light of overlying changes secondary to new PNA and infiltrates which may account for soem of the effusions on imaging.
ANXIETY: The patient was initially managed with low dose Ativan and his home Celexa regimen but after he had benzodiazepine related somnolence and impaired respirations requiring extubation his Ativan was held.
Trazadone was given twice for insomnia but was soon discontinued as the patient was extremely sensitive and became confused and lethargic as with other benzodiazepines that he had previously been taking.
SUPERFICIAL PHLEBITIS: The patient had an erythematous inflammation on his right forearm at the site of a prior IV placement.
The area had mild edema and was also tender.
No open sores or ecchymoses.
An ultrasound was done which showed no underlying abscesses to be drained.
He had no febrile episodes corresponding to this presentation.
UTI: At admission the patient had a routine UA done which showed WBC [**11-6**] with  trace leukocytes and negative nitrates but moderate bacteria was noted.
Clinically, he denied suprapubic pain, urgency, dysuria or hematuria.
Post-extubation he had a hearty appetite and continued to have good PO intake with a regular diet.
The patient had persistent hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia during his stay which was repleted continuously.
These electrolyte abnormalities were attributed to the patient's underlying malnutrition secondary to his advanced cancer and chemotherapy as well as some loose stool he experienced towards the end of his hospital stay.
TRANSFER OF CARE: It became clear that the initial plan of controlling his SVT and discharging him to home for further outpatient management was not possible with his continued hypercarbia.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  NEb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Supraventricular tachycardia Mesothelioma Leukocytosis Pneumonia Depression   Discharge Condition: Intubated, calm but alert on 10mcg/kg/min propofol.
Discharge Instructions: You had rapid heart rate called suprventricular tachycardia that was not controlled on the Metoprolol dose you were on.
You also had a left lower lobe pneumonia shown on chest x-ray and an elevated white blood cell count and you were treated with antibiotics.
