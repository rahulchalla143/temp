ICU Course 11-26-12/2: 88 year old male with tracheal stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia s/p placement of Montogmery T-tube on [**10-19**] and revision on [**10-20**] admitted to MICU with increased secretions and hypoxia with coughing following procedure ([**2172-10-26**]) s/p Y-stent and T-TUBE removal, mucous plugging s/p bronchoscopy and Portex trach tube re-insertion ([**9-29**]) after patient agitated and pulled out balloon.
# Tracheobronchomalacia with respiratory distress On [**10-26**], the patient underwent removal of his T-tube and Y-stent given minimal symptom improvement and hoarseness, and a [**Last Name (un) 295**] # 7 trach was placed.
Following the procedure, the patient had an episode of respiratory distress, and he was placed on pressure support ventilation.

In the ICU, CPAP settings of 10 with FiO2 of 50 %  He was continued on xopenox and acetylcysteine nebs and will need continued attention for secretion management.
#Tracheobronchitis: Patient was thought to have teacheobronchitis given prominent secretion component of symptoms with fever, leukocytosis, or infiltrate on CXR.
Patient's antibiotics were broadened from cefepime to meropenem for E. coli EBSL and vancomycin was switched to linezolid for history of vancomycin associated ototoxicity.
