Two-three weeks prior to admission, patient originally admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with fevers, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea.
He had full resolution of his symptoms with good PO intake, until this morning, when he developed fevers to 102, crampy abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea similar to his prior presentation.
During his prior admission, patient also found to have a clot in his right jugular vein and started on coumadin as an outpatient.
ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with rate of 121 and without signs of ischemia.
CT abdomen with contrast demonstrated colitis and multiple mesenteric masses and right pararenal mass consistent with patient's history of low-grade fibrosarcoma.
Past Medical History: - barrett's esophagous s/p nissen fundoplication in [**2093**] at [**Hospital3 1810**] [**Location (un) 86**] - emergent splenectomy in [**2099**] s/p snow boarding accident - metastatic soft tissue fibrosarcoma s/p small bowel resection in [**2104**].
No supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: tachycardic, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: Midline vertical scar from prior surgeries.

[**2107-2-13**]: Chest radiograph ([**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2107-2-13**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast ([**Hospital1 18**]): PRELIM READ: 1. mildly thickened colonic wall may represent resolving infectious colitis 2. multiple mesenteric masses and R pararenal mass c/w pt's hx of low-grade fibrosarcoma   Brief Hospital Course: #.
Fever/abdominal pain/diarrhea: In lieu of recent hospital discharge from [**Hospital1 2025**] for c. diff infection and recurrence of symptoms with cessation of flagyl therapy, symptoms most consistent with recurrent c. diff infection.
CT abdomen with evidence of colitis but without other nidus for infection.
He remained afebrile and his abdominal pain resolved.
Stool cultures did not reveal any of CAMPYLOBACTER, O&P, VIBRIO, YERSINIA, OR E. COLI 0157:H7.
Major risk for initial C. Diff infection is chemo and PPI therapy, and major risk for recurrent severe C. Diff colitis is PPI therapy during first treatment course.
Tachycardia: Likely secondary to underlying infection and hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea.
Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to underlying infection as above.
Metastatic Fibrosarcoma: CT abd/pelvis demonstrates multiple mesenteric masses and R pararenal mass.
Right IJ Clot: secondary to intervention during last hospitalization.
Barrett's Esophagous: Stable, continued home PO PPI, though consideration for discontinuing this should be given since PPI don't affect transformation of Barrett's epithelium into adenoca.
Active Issues on Discharge: - Metastatic Fibrosarcoma (continued treatment per O/P oncologist) - Reccurence of C. Diff (to discuss with PCP the need for further PPI therapy) - Transaminitis (Patient found on discharge to have a slighly elevated ALT, with remaining liver enzymes WNL; encouraged PCP f/u for further eval as needed).
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Clostridium Difficile Colitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 12263**], you were admitted to the hospital because you had an infection of your gastrointestinal tract known as Clostridium Difficile.
