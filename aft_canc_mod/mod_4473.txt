History of Present Illness: The patient is a 74-year-old male with a previously treated head and neck cancer now with an enlarging nodule in the left upper lobe.
Biopsy was consistent with non-small-cell lung cancer.
The tumor was very close to the inferior pulmonary vein, lower lobe bronchus, and lower lobe PA and, given this location, we recommended an open approach.
Past Medical History: DM HTN T3 N0 M0 glottic squamous cell carcinoma s/p chemoradiation therapy spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe  PSH: tracheostomy on [**2134-11-3**] a PEG tube placed on [**2134-11-17**].

Of note, estimated blood loss was 500cc and he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
He did well the first night on the floor, but on the morning of POD3 he went into atrial fibrillation and became hypotensive to SBP in the low 80's.
He remained in atrial fibrillation most of the day but converted to sinus rhythm by the evening of POD 3.
The following day he was noted to have increased oxygen demand and chest pain.
CT chest revealed a large air/fluid collection in his left hemi-thorax.
A pigtail pleural catheter was placed in the apex which drained 400cc of serosanguinous (Hct 13) fluid in the first 24 hours and a significant amount of air.
His remaining chest tubes were clamped on POD 6 and follow-up CXR showed no re-accumulation of air or blood.
