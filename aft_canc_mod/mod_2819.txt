Admission Date: [**2179-4-5**]        Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2113-3-1**]        Sex:  F  Service:  VSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral ankle ulcerations.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease who presents with 6 weeks of bilateral medial malleolar ulcerations and bilateral lower extremity cellulitis (right greater than left).
This has been complicated by a recent (4.5 weeks ago) medial malleolar fracture.
The patient also complains of bilateral foot pain which is worse with a.m. ambulation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General appearance is a very pleasant white female in no acute distress.
Chest exam reveals lungs are with crackles bilaterally at the bases.
HEENT exam shows bilateral carotid bruits and JVD.
Extremity exam with 2+ edema bilaterally with shallow ulcerations on the medial aspect of both ulcerations.
Pulse exam shows palpable radial's and femoral's bilaterally.
Cardiology medicine was requested to see the patient because of her congestive heart failure on admission chest x-ray.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of congestive heart failure.
The patient an echocardiogram done which showed symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional systolic dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or other diffuse process.
In the absence of systolic hypertension and infiltrative process should be considered.
There is moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular cavity is enlarged, free wall is hypokinetic.
The stress perfusion images showed a moderate reduction in tracer distribution involving the mid and distal inferolateral wall.
Stress perfusion images additionally demonstrate a moderate defect in the tracer uptake of the apex, and this defect was partially reversible.
The stress also demonstrated moderately reversible defects in the mid and distal anteroseptal wall.
Once the patient was compensated for her congestive heart failure and her renal function stabilized, she underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2179-4-13**] with documented 3- vessel disease with markedly elevated and right and left- sided filling pressures.
She required a transfusion for a low hematocrit.
This was related to her chronic myelodysplasia disorder.
There was a small pericardial effusion.
There was no echocardiographic sign of tamponade.
The patient did experience contrast renal failure post cardiac catheterization and required aggressive treatment for hyperkalemia.
The patient was seen by the orthopaedic service for her ankle fracture.
Recommendations were bivalved cast with nonweightbearing and that further surgical orthopaedic intervention would be done after her cardiac and peripheral vascular problems were addressed.
The patient will return on [**4-26**] to be readmitted for elective revascularization of the right lower extremity on [**2179-4-27**].
Bilateral medial malleolar ischemic ulcerations.
New insulin-dependent diabetic.
Chronic renal insufficiency exacerbated by contrast-    induced acute tubular necrosis.
Coronary artery disease with a positive stress test;    status post arteriogram with stenting of the left anterior    descending/diagonal and angioplasty of the left anterior    descending with attempted angioplasty of the right    coronary artery with catheter transection resulting in a    myocardial infarction.
Arteriogram of pelvic vessels and right leg runoff on    [**2179-4-22**].
