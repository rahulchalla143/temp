The ventricles and sulci appear slightly prominent, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Minimal periventricular and subcortical white matter changes appear consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is atherosclerotic calcification of the bilateral vertebral arteries, left greater than right.
Rounded metallic density seen in the soft tissue infraorbitally on the right.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Right lobe hepatic cyst unchanged from CT of [**2136-8-23**].
LENIS [**2137-3-31**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in left lower extremity  ECHO [**2137-4-1**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Preserved left ventricular regional and global systolic function.
Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.
CXR [**2137-4-2**]: Recent mild pulmonary edema has improved, and nearly resolved in the left lung.
Greater opacification at the base of both lungs particularly the right is an indication of decreasing aeration either by virtue of atelectasis or Pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion is probably unchanged since [**3-31**], and noncontributory.
No pneumothorax.
MICRO:  C.DIFF: TEST NOT PERFORMED AS STOOL FORMED  URINE CULTUREL NO GROWTH  BLOOD CULTURES x 2: NO GROWTH TO DATE   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 y/o M with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, recent hospitalization for a UTI and C.diff infection who presented from home with increasing somnolence and improved with empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
Was found to have a pneumonia and possible recurrence of his c diff colitis.
He has not had any localizing symptoms other than perhaps some tachypnea and a subjective sense of dyspnea in concert with increasing perihilar consolidation.
We initially started him on IV Vancomycin and cefepime for presumed cellulitis because of the eryhtema in his legs but that was later judged to be venous insufficincy.
He was noted to have an opacity in his RLL which was read as pneumonia vs atelectasis.
However, at time of discharge, given that he had been on room air for his stay on the floor, and had no other sign of recurrent infection, was transitioned to PO levofloxacin and will complete an 8 day course at rehab.
He was also noted to have some watery diarrhea on and off and therefore was started on PO vancomycin for a total 14 day course for possible recurrence of his c. diff.
#) CAD s/p CABG:  stable.

5. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: as directed Sublingual every 3 minutes upto 3 times as needed for chest pain.
Pneumonia 2.

Metastatic Prostate Cancer 2.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with confusion and low blood pressures which was likely thought to be due to an infection in your lungs.
You improved with antibiotics and are now being discharged with antibiotics to treat your lung infection as well as your belly infection.
