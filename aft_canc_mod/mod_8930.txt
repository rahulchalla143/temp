HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 46-year-old woman with a history of a desmoids of the anterior abdominal wall and of the abdomen presents with fever and abdominal pain and hypotension.
She has a history of a desmoid tumor status post multiple resections of the abdominal wall with ventral hernia repairs.
These areas seemed to have finally settled; however, she presented with an intra-abdominal  mass which has been treated with chemotherapy.
Of note is that she was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting in [**Month (only) 547**] and discharged after a 5[**Hospital 15386**] hospital stay.
CT scan at that time showed persistent infiltration of the mesentery of small bowel with the adjacent jejunum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell trait, blindness secondary to bilateral optic nerve atrophy, diabetes, depression, anxiety, bilateral pulmonary emboli diagnosed in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Include multiple resections of a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall and chest wall, ventral hernia repairs, a D&C, bilateral breast reductions.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Notable for blindness.
The neck is supple without masses or thyromegaly.
The abdomen is soft without particular tenderness.
There was some fullness in the mid abdomen.
No peritoneal signs.
Extremities without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
CT scan with contrast showed a large mass in the midabdomen with a large amount of enteric contrast and air in the mass, but not extravasating outside.
There also was some enlargement of the area perhaps and some bleeding into the mass.
There was also a second large mass within the left anterior abdominal wall.
Surgical consult was obtained and thought best to resect as much of the mass as possible as there was clearly an erosion of the mass into the small bowel.
At operation an extremely large abdominal mass was resected along with a small bowel resection.
As much of the mass was dissected away as possible.
Perforated small bowel desmoid tumor.
Sickle cell trait.
SURGICAL PROCEDURES:  Laparotomy and resection of intra- abdominal tumor with small bowel resection; date is [**2125-6-1**].
