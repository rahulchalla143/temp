He stated he felt warm on occasions and some chills, but no fevers.
He also had some nausea, but no vomiting.
The OSH CT abd/pelvis was re-read and showed a 6mm x 8mm calcified stone at the ampulla of Vater resulting in dilation of the intra & extrahepatic ducts and pancreatic duct.
There was also a 24mm cystic lesion of the uncinate process of the pancreas as well as a 8mm lesion in the proximal body.
He was given morphine & zofran for his pain and nausea.
ERCP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and plan for ERCP when INR is 1.5 unless develops signs of cholangitis at which point they would take him emergently.

8-mm stone in the ampulla of Vater with dilation of the common bile duct and both pancreatic ducts, suggestive of obstruction at the ampulla of Vater.
Multiple pancreatic cysts, which given size should be evaluated with follow-up ultrasound in 6 months.
Right 2.3-cm parapelvic renal cyst which could be further evaluated with ultrasound if it has not been evaluated previously.
Right bladder diverticula.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence for inflammation.
ERCP Impression: Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 14 mm.
There was a filling defect in the distal CBD.
A small stone was extracted with a balloon catheter.
24 hours after his procedure he was restarted on anticoagulation given his mechanical aortic valve and his post-procedure course was complicated by a slow GI bleed and bile duct obstruction thought to be a post-sphincterotomy site hematoma.
Pt was treated with IV unasyn and supportive care.
He had spontaneous resolution of bleeding after stopping Aspirin and only required a single prbc transfusion.
He developped volume overload after initial fluid resucitation due to his baseline systolic CHF (EF 15%) and required IV diuresis.

He was noted to be having abnormal pacer spikes.
