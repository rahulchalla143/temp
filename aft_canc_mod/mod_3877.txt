History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman with oligodendroglioma that later progressed to anaplastic oligodendroglioma who presents after a seizure at home.
He then had a short (~8 sec) seizure.
Given his history of bilateral pulmonary embolism after surgical procedure in [**11-11**], at [**Hospital1 18**] CTA performed demonstrating small subsegmental pulmonary embolism, lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT, and a head CT showed a small bleed in the area of surgical resection cavity.
Neuro-Oncology was consulted as to whether anticoagulation was reasonable in setting of head bleed.
Per Neurology housestaff, has baseline persistent left-sided weaksness was worse in the upper extremity.

INDICATION: 58-year-old man with history of brain tumor (oligodendroglioma s/p resection) and seizures.
Evaluate for new intracranial hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: An approximate 12-mm rounded area of increased density is seen within the right temporal lobe, below the area of tumor resection, where there is a known mass.
No new areas of mass effect are identified.
There are no findings to indicate acute territorial infarction.
Surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures again reveal the right parietal craniotomy site.
IMPRESSION: Small focus of hemorrhage within the left temproal lobe tumor.
No substantial change in the morphology of the brain or extent of edema.

INDICATION: 50-year-old man with oligodendroglioma with known pulmonary emboli.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There has been interval resolution of the filling defects within the pulmonary artery supplying the left lower, right upper, right middle, and right lower lobes.
There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The lung fields show dependent changes at the bilateral lung bases.
There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Degenerative disc disease is seen within the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of bilateral pulmonary emboli.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 4267**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background was of lower voltage fairly broadly over the right hemisphere and included prominent 1 Hz delta slowing especially in frontal and temporal areas.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with very frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage suppression and prominent slowing widely over the right hemisphere with the slowing somewhat more anterior.
This suggests both cortical and subcortical dysfunction on the right side.
A major structural lesion appears likely from the tracing.
Nevertheless, there were no epileptiform features.
The tracing was also abnormal due to the slow background on the left side, suggesting a more widespread encephalopathy.
Finally, an abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with oligodendroglioma and hemorrhage, for further evaluation.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
There is a small area of acute/subacute hemorrhage seen in the right periatrial region as seen on the CT of [**2178-11-14**].
There is also enhancement seen surrounding the area of hemorrhage which is new since the previous MRI examination.
Overall the white matter edema has not significantly changed compared to the previous study, however.
There is no midline shift seen.
Moderate prominence of ventricles is noted including prominence of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
IMPRESSION: Status post craniotomy on the right temporoparietal region with enhancement around the surgical cavity.
A small new area of hemorrhage and new surrounding enhancement in the right periatrial region since the MRI of [**2178-11-13**].
No evidence of midline shift seen.
No other areas of abnormal enhancement are noted.
