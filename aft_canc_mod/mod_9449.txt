Shortly after this, she was noted to have melanotic stools.
She then had lower extremity Duplex studies which showed deep venous thrombosis in the right common femoral vein extending to the popliteal vein.
Her hematocrit continued to drop to 27.4 on [**7-18**], and the decision was then made on [**2172-7-19**] to stop her anticoagulation since she was having symptoms of a gastrointestinal bleed and had required four units of packed red blood cells.
Since her respiratory status was stable, and her hematocrit was stable at 30 off of Heparin, and she had an IVC filter in place, she was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2172-7-21**].
The following day she had an EGD which revealed gastritis that appeared somewhat hemorrhagic in nature.
This was described as granularity, friability, and erythema in the antrum stomach body and fundus compatible with hemorrhagic gastritis.
She was also found to have a positive urine culture from a sample sent from the Intensive Care Unit and ciprofloxacin was started for the urine culture.
She continued to be stable on the floor with her blood pressure under good control with the metoprolol, and on Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis as well as antibiotics for treatment of her urinary tract infection and her H. pylori.
Colonoscopy on [**2172-7-24**] noted a 4 cm fungating lesion in the region of the cecum.
No acute clot was identified.
Following this, CT scan was obtained to stage what was considered to be a likely malignancy, and no abnormal lesions or adenopathy were identified.
Of note, were filling defects in the right external iliac, common femoral, and left common femoral veins consistent with deep venous thrombosis.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Surgery was consulted for the cecal mass, and discussion was initiated with consultation of Cardiology by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 690**] and the Pulmonary service as well as the GI service in order to discern in this complicated patient which would be the most prudent course of action, balancing the risks of anticoagulation related hemorrhage from either the colon mass or the gastritis with the likelihood of extension of pulmonary thrombus or clotting of the IVC filter without anticoagulation.
There was also a discussion about the time of her surgery related to her right ventricular function.
Echocardiogram was repeated which showed improvement in her right ventricular function, but still elevated right pulmonary artery pressures.
A VQ scan was completed which showed multiple profusion deficits consistent with nonpulmonary emboli.
Her stool was guaiaced by rectal examination, and a small amount of green stool was guaiac negative.
She was then ready for discharge home, having completed her seven day course of treatment for H. pylori and five day course of treatment for her urinary tract infection.
Low residue diet.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15064**] or return to the hospital for any evidence or any occurrence of shortness of breath, respiratory distress, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, melena, or guaiac positive stools, as well as any nausea or vomiting.
Pulmonary embolus.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Hemorrhagic gastritis.
Cecal mass, pathology villus adenoma with foci of high grade dysplasia.
