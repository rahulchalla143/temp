Of note, pt had been discharged on [**2116-1-11**] after undergoing AV node ablation, and had denied respiratory distress during [**1-23**] EP outpatient follow-up; at that time, ICD had been interrogated and found to be WNL.
ROS: Positive for SOB, increased peripheral edema x1day, decreased ability to sleep given SOB, and decreased exercise tolerance.
ED course: # Vitals: O2sat 91 on RA, mid 80s on RA with conversation, 96 on 2L # Meds: Furosemide 40mg IV (excreted 400cc urine), levofloxacin  Past Medical History: # CAD s/p inferior MI, CABG x2 ([**2080**], [**2100**]: SVG to OM, SVG to LAD, patent in [**2110**]), LCx stent [**2110**] # Systolic CHF [**12-28**] ischemic CM (EF 35%) s/p BiV ICD [**2110**], replaced [**2114**] # HTN # 4+ MR # h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion [**2114**], s/p AV node ablation [**2115**] # COPD: No home O2 # DM2 # Hypercholesterolemia # Chronic renal insufficiency # GERD  Social History: # Personal: Lives with wife, has 2 sons.
No carotid bruits.
No rhonchi, wheezes.
NEURO: A&Ox3  Pertinent Results: Studies/imaging: # EKG: V-paced at rate 69 # CXR:  Mild cardiogenic pulmonary edema although no definite focal infection is visualized.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is helpful to assess for underlying infection.
ECHO [**2116-2-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal walls, and hypokinesis of the apex, c/w multivessel CAD.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A very eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of [**Location (un) **] (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen, likely on the basis of the posteromedial papillary muscle dysfunction.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate regional systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD.
Severe secondary mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-12-25**], mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are more severe and pulmonary pressures are higher.
The LMCA had mild disease.
Venous conduit arteriography revealed widely patent SVG-LAD and SVG-OM1.
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2116-2-12**] 3:14 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-2**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in this patient who has undergone a previous CABG procedure with intact sternal sutures.
Prominence ill-defined interstitial markings is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of vascular congestion.
He was Iron deficient by labs and given the concern for GI bleed, though stool guaiac was documented as negative, he was taken to colonoscopy and EGD, which showed no source of bleed.
His Plavix was held upon admission in anticipation for cardiothoracic surgery.
He was restarted on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation.
He remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet.
