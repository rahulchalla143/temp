Admission Date:  [**2130-2-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-7-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia, AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical Ventilation (intubated at outside hospital)   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 30207**] is a 66 y/o F w history of SCLC (s/p XRT to RLL mass, mediastinum, hilum).
She was found on day of admission to OSH by neighbors to be unable to walk (c/o generalized weakness), lethargic and confusion 2 days after chemotherapy.
She denies any acute CP, SOB, lower extremity edema, trauma to her legs, or recent prolonged travel hx.
She reports difficulty with SOB at baseline, but does not require O2 at home.
She noted some increased SOB and wheezing.
Patient also has a chronic cough that has been worsening.
On ROS, denies fevers, chills, NS, abdominal pain, diarrhea, n/v, blood in stools, or constipation.
On admisison, she was noted to be confused and agitated on arrival.
A CTA Chest was unable to be obtained b/c the patient was in renal failure, so she was started on heparin gtt emperically for PE.
Cardiac enzymes showed flat CKs, but slightly elevated troponins to 0.8/0.6.
She was noted to be obtunded, but communicative with a non-focal neurologic exam.
COPD - no PFT testing 3.
Hypertension   Social History: lives by self in single home in [**Hospital1 **].
No recent travel hx.
Family History: no history of cancer in the family.
Extremities: wwp, no lower extremity edema.
?upgoing babinski on L, downgoing babinski on R.   Pertinent Results: [**2130-2-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Left upper lung nodule and increased interstitial markings in b/l lung apices incompletely assessed.
[**2130-2-4**] Lower extremity dopplers: IMPRESSION: No DVT of the lower extremities.
Lack of contrast limits sensitivity for metastases, however, no mass or mass effect identified.
Severe periventricular white matter disease suggesting chronic microvascular ischemia.
No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
Airways secretions, right lower lobe peribronchial consolidation and widespread mucoid impaction, likely related to pneumonia, could be aspiration given normal chest x-ray 2 days ago.
Subtle peribronchial abnormality in the left lower lobe could also be aspiration.
Followup after treatment is recommended and comparison with older study is warranted to rule out any lung lesion.
Complete collapse of right middle lobe with obstruction of subsegmental bronchi.
Diffuse soft tissue edema.
3-mm right upper lobe nodule, warrant further followup in one year.
No abnormal enhancing lesions to suggest metastatic disease.
Unchanged severe periventricular white matter disease consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Creatnine on admit 1.8, on discharge 1.1  Brief Hospital Course: 66 yoF with SCLC s/p XRT and unknown prior PMH, presented with weakness, hypoxia and confusion.
Hypoxia: Patient presented to an outside hospital with new, acute onset hypoxia with oxygen requirement (does not use oxygen at home).
She was intubated there for hypoxic respiratory distress thought secondary to pneumonia.
At the outside hospital, pulmonary embolus was considered and because she was in acute renal failure, she was started on emperic heparin drip.
After transfer to [**Hospital3 **], her creatinine  normalized, she had a CTA and pulmonary embolism was ruled out, and the heparin drip was stopped.
There was a question of aspiration, and she was evaluated by speech and swallow and was thought not to aspirate on a normal diet.
She was also started on guaifenesin for mucous plugging and secretions.
Altered mental status: Patient has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status while here with occassional hallucinations.
Initially, altered mental status was likely secondary to infection and hypoxia.
For work up of this, she had a head CT that shows no acute process and both an MRI without gadolinium and with gad.
Both show no evidence of metastatic disease.
RPR negative, B12 elevated, TSH WNL to slightly elevated (4.1), indicating possibly hypothyroidism.
This is likely delerium in setting of hospitalization and known lung CA.
Renal failure: Patient with acute renal failure on admission with a creatinine of 1.8.
Likely pre-renal in setting of poor PO intake.
No evidence of acute bleeding.
Hypertension: patient hypertensive during hospitalization, was started on lisinopril 10mg daily with stabilization of blood pressures.
Radiation oncology saw patient while here and she had no acute issues.
She also had MRIs while here that show no evidence of metastatic disease.
Weakness: Likely due to poor PO intake and decreased appetite.
Pt reports generalized weakness.
Medications on Admission: Xanax (unknown dosage) Cyprohepatadine 4mg PO BID (appetite stimulant) Detrol LA 4mg QHS Prednisone 1mg QID (filled [**1-16**], 30 pills, 7 day course, finished already) Spiriva IH [**Hospital1 **] Albuterol 2 puffs QID:PRN SOB Percocet 5/325 q6H:PRN pain Enalapril (dosage uncertain) Tylenol 325-650 mg PO q6H:PRN pain Lasix 20 mg PO daily (x1 month only) MVI .
Ipratropium-Albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-27**] Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: 1' Diagnosis Hypoxia Pneumonia Dehydration Acute renal failure Altered Mental Status  2' Diagnosis Small Cell Lung Cancer Hypertension   Discharge Condition: satting well on room air on discharge   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with altered mental status and hypoxia.
This was likely due to a pneumonia, mucous plugs in your lungs, and poor oral intake of food of water.
You did not have pulmonary embolism and were not aspirating.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or wheezing, difficulty thinking, loss of consciousness, fever > 101, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, difficulty keeping food/water down, fall with trauma, or any other symptoms not listed here that warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 2742**].
