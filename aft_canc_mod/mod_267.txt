ECG: sinus at 115, normal axis/intervals, no ST-T changes .
CXR: Hickman line in place, no infiltrates .
TTE [**2159-5-29**]: EF 30-40%, mod global HK, 2+ MR (incr from previously), no vegetations seen .
# Coag negative staph bactermia: She initially had a high grade bacteremia with 4/4 cultures positive and [**1-10**] surveillance cultures positive.
The infectious disease and surgery teams were consulted and after extensive discussion, initially attempted to treat through the line with linezolid, given that the last line was very difficult to place, and resulted in many complications.
She was monitored in the ICU for 30 hours given her history of reportedly severe red man syndrome, and tolerated the infusion well with benadryl 50 mg iv and pepcid 40 mg iv premedication 1h prior to vancomycin, as recommended by the Allergy attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She had a TTE which was negative for vegetation and ID felt a TEE was not necessary.
She only required ~2-3 L of IV normal saline boluses for low blood pressure her whole hospitalization.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8815**]Urinary retention: She reported urinary hesitancy and being unable to completely empty her bladder fully, which was longstanding and relieved with spirits of peppermint.
This may be due to autonomic dysregulation and seemed to be worse with benadryl.
# Tremor: On the orignal day of discharge, she reported a fine tremor of her upper extremities and worsening urinary hesitancy.
A very fine tremor was noted on examination.
She was kept overnight for observation and allergy and toxicology were called.
Allergy recommended possibly benzos or a small dose of neostigmine, [**1-8**] that used for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], to counteract anticholinergic effects.
Toxicology recommended changing benadryl to [**Doctor First Name 130**] or claritin, but the patient was unwilling to try this latter option given that it would require transferring her back to the ICU setting for monitoring.
