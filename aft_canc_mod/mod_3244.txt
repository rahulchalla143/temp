Two 6-mm lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere unchanged from [**2143-10-22**] likely represent old infarcts.
The appearance is not typical for metastatic disease.
No additional large masses identified with no shift of midline structures.
MR is more sensitive for detection of small masses and should be considered if clinically indicated.
No evidence of hemorrhage or major vascular territory infarction.
Multifocal subsegmental pulmonary emboli in vessels supplying the left lower lobe, lingula, and right lower lobe.
Segmental nonocclusive embolus in a blood vessel supplying right middle lobe.
Some of these have a more peripheral locale within the vessel suggesting subacute time course.
No right heart strain or pulmonary infarct.
Atelectasis and emphysematous changes in the lungs.
Interval decrease in size of left upper lobe nodule.
Elevated and rotated cecum compared to prior imaging, configurational change consistent with volvulus, with new segmental wall thickening and edema of the ascending colon in the involved segment.
Given the abnormal configuration of the cecum, and the presence of underlying vascular disease, findings are concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
However, there is no portal venous gas, and mesenteric vessels appear normally opacified.
Diffuse distention of remainder of colon is nonspecific but given concerns for ischemia requires monitoring.
Acute occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein, extending proximally into the left common iliac vein.
This is extensive residual clot burden in a patient with known PE (refer to CTA Chest [**2143-2-4**]), placing the patient at risk for further embolization.
Small hepatic hypodensity, too small to characterize, unchanged from prior CT.  CXR ([**2144-2-11**]) - FINDINGS: In comparison with the previous study of this date, there is little change.
The patchy area of opacification in the right lung apex is unchanged and quite similar to recent chest CT examination.
There appear to be sinus beats with premature atrial contractions, although this could also be atrial fibrillation.
Poor R wave progression non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO ONCOLOGY SERVICE  Pt was initially admitted on [**2144-1-27**] after he was noted by his daughter to have a witnessed partial complex seizure, which lasted 10 minutes.
He was noted to be post-ictal, had urinary incontinence.
On admission to the ED, he was noted to be hypotensive to the 90s, which was attributed to poor PO intake and was responsive to fluids.
On that day, he was also noted to have a 400cc bright red bloody bowel movement with no decrease in Hct.
GI were consulted and were concerned for possible ischemic colitis (r/t hypotensive episode) versus chemo versus C. Diff.
He was placed, per GI recs, on a clear diet with stools sent for culture.
That evening, his [**1-27**] blood cultures grew out GPCs, and pt was also noted to be hypotensive to the mid 70s with minimal response to 80s after 1L of NS.
He was started on vancomycin and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for question of hypovolemia vs septic shock.
A subclavian line was placed initailly due to concern for contaminated port.
AFTER TRANSFER TO ONCOLOGY SERVICE  # Hypotension ??????
On the floor, he was noted to have atrial fibrillation (see below).
# Diarrhea/Abdominal Pain ??????
The patient had an episodes of GI bleeding that prompted transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Of note, after this initial episode, he did not have any further significant episodes of GI bleeding.
GI was consulted and felt that this was likely infectious or inschemic in etiology (considering the pateint?????
?s hypotension on arrival).
Throughout the rest of his hospital stay, the patient did not have any further episodes of significant GI bleeding.
He did, however, have some intermittent trace guaiac positive stools.
Of note, the patient did have worsening of his abdominal pain on [**2144-2-6**].
CT scan was performed and showed malrotation of the cecum, which was concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
At this time, the patient was already on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for his neutropenic fever (see below).
He was treated conservatively with IV fluids and bowel rest, and his symptoms improved.
# Atrial Fibrillation ??????
The patient was noted to have new atrial fibrillation while he was in the MICU.
Initially, his atrial fibrillation was difficult to control because attempts at rate control would result in hypotension.
During this time that his rate was difficult to control, CTA of the chest was performed and revealed a pulmonary embolus (see below).
# Pulmonary Embolism ??????
After transfer from the MICU to the oncology service, the patient was noted to have repeated episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate that was somewhat difficult to control  CTA of the chest was performed and revealed a pulmonary embolism.
While he did have some trace guaiac positive stools, he was not noted to have any evidence of significant bleeding while he was on the heparin drip.
# Fever / Neutropenia ??????
At the same time, he became progressively neutropenic secondary to his recent chemotherapy.
When he became more neutropenic and still continued to spike fevers, micafungin was also added to the patient?????
While he did have one positive blood culture prior to his neutropenia (a contaminant), no other cultures grew out any bacteria.
At the time of discharge, the patient is no longer neutropenic, and he has not had a fever for several days.
# Anemia ??????
On transfer to the MICU after his episode of GI bleeding, the patient was not transfused, as it was felt that his decreased hematocrit was more representative of the large amount of IV fluids he had received.
However, after transfer to he oncology service, the patient continued to have anemia that was likely related to his recent chemotherapy treatment.
Iron studies were sent prior to discharge and did not show evidence of iron deficiency.
# Thrombocytopenia ??????
On transfer to the oncology, the patient was noted to have worsening thrombocytopenia.
This corresponded to his anemia and neutropenia and was likely related to his recent chemotherapy.
?s creatinine was elevated above his baseline, likely because of hypovolemia.
Of note, urine electrolytes also suggested some component of ATN to the patient?????
?s renal insufficiency, likely related to his hypotension early in his hospital course.
# Seizure ??????
He was continued on his home phenobarbitol regimen as well as seizure precautions.
He was not noted to have any further seizures during his hospitalization.
# Esophageal and NSCLC ??????
While hospitalized he complained of heartburn and throat pain, likely related to his radiation therapy.
For pain control, he was initially giving oxycontin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
However, this was ultimately switched to fentanyl patch with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.

While in the hospital, you had some low blood pressures and one episode of GI bleeding.
Your [**Hospital 47430**] hospital course was complicated by anemia (for which you received blood), neutropenia (low white blood cells), low platelets, fevers (for which you were given bload antibiotics), a blood clot to the lungs, and some concerning findings on an abdominal CT scan.
You were treated for all of these complications and were stabilized.
