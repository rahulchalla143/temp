Head CT ([**4-21**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Paranasal sinus disease in the left maxillary and sphenoid sinus, as described above.
CXR: ([**4-21**]) : FINDINGS: Allowing for differences in technique there has been no interval change in appearance of the chest since the recent study with no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary of Hospital Course: 53 year old man with h/o AML s/p allo cord transplant (day +516 on admission) complicated by chronic GVHD with arthritis, BOOP, who now presents to clinic with acute on chronic renal failure.
#Syncope: Patient had syncopal episode the day of admission, where he was unresponsive for ~1 minute while lying flat.
Unclear etiology, possible due to orthostatic hypotension (noted to have orthostatic physiology in the ICU and on the floor) vs arrythmia vs seizure activity.
Patient denied any heralding symptoms and was not post-ictal afterwards, but was noted to have a resting tremor in the MICU.
His history of tremor is not consistent wtih seizure activity.
It appears to be an intention tremor that gets worse when holding on to objects and is low in amplitude while high in frequency, bilateral and not associated with change in consciousness or incontinence.
Noted to be hyperkalemic during the code, given amp D50 and 10 U insulin peri-code and kayexalate in the ICU, with drop in potassium down to 4.0 on discharge.
Neurology consulted on patient who recommended EEG and possible midodrine or fluorinef support.
Held patient's lisinopril, but continued him on his carvedilol 12.5 mg PO BID as this was recently decreased in the setting of light headedness/dizziness by his cardiologist on [**3-21**], although informed him not to take the medication if he had any pre-syncopal symptoms.
Patient had no further syncopal episodes or events on telemetry in the ICU or on the floor.
Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG, possible blood pressure support with midodrine or fluorinef, at the discretion of the patient's outpatient oncologist and nephrologist.
Was noted to not have any telemetry events or syncopal events while ambulating, with appropriate increase in pulse and blood pressure.
and requested to be discharged with outpatient syncope work-up.
#Acute on chronic renal failure: Noted to have mildly elevated Cre to 2.3 in clinic the day of admission.
Creatine has fluctuated over the past two years, with several episodes of acute renal failure while hospitalized.
Less likely due to AML infiltration of kidneys (very rare) or chemotherapy.
Unlikely progressive glomerular disease given patient only has scant proteinuria.
Patient has refused renal biopsy in the past.
Renal failure resolved to baseline creatinine (1.9) on discharge.
#Congestive Heart Failure: Euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic on exam.
Held ACEI due to hyperkalemia.
continued prophylactic medications.
#Epigastric discomfort: Gastritis, likely in setting of prednisone.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1' Diagnosis Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Hyperkalemia Syncope  2' Diagnosis Congestive Heart Failure Hypertension Acute Myelogenous Leukemia   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without syncopal episode x48 hours  Discharge Instructions:   You were admitted with a diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure, high potassium levels, and syncope.
We wanted to run some lab tests to evaluate the reason for your syncope, but you felt well and wanted to go home and have the testing done as an outpatient.
Please take your medications as directed - Please hold your lisinopril as this medication can cause elevated potassium levels.
Please return to the hospital if you have fever > 100.4, any further fainting episodes, chest pain, palpitations, or any other symptoms not listed here concerning enough to warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 2742**].
