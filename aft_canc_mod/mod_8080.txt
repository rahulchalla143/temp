She was seen here at [**Hospital1 18**] last week and a Brain MRI demonstrated a large right frontal mass and a left vestibular schwannoma.
She was discharged and return  [**3-29**] for surgical intervention  Past Medical History: PVD cataracts Dizziness Right frontal mass left vestibular schwannoma  Social History: Non smoker   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
HEENT: OP clear CV: RRR PULM: CTAB ABD: soft, NT, ND EXT: no edema  Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2118-3-29**]: The previously noted right frontal tumor, with small component extending across the midline on to the left side is redemonstrated for surgical planning.
There is no significant change in the overall size and shape of the lesion.
This is in close proximity to the adjacent venous tributaries and the inferior sagittal sinus as seen on the prior study.
There is indentation on the right lateral ventricle, better seen on the prior study.
An enhancing lesion in the left CP angle and IAC is again seen.
No new lesions are noted.
Status post recent right frontal craniotomy with postoperative changes including subcutaneous air, small amount of hemorrhage and edema in the surgical bed, as well as extensive bifrontal pneumocephalus, measuring up to 23mm and exerting mass effect on the adjacent frontal lobes.
Known extra-axial mass in the left cerebellopontine angle is better- demonstrated on dedicated enhanced MRI from [**2118-3-29**].
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is a large amount of post-operative pneumocephalus, with air in the anterior interhemispheric fissure and effacement of the subjacent frontal gyri, giving rise to the so-called "Mt.Fuji sign," as may be seen with tension pneumocephalus.
Also noted is a relatively small region, roughly 3.3 cm (AP) of likely cytotoxic edema, at the operative bed in the right paramedian frontovertex (2:24-30), not present previously.
Status post right frontovertex craniotomy and tumor resection, with large amount of residual subdural pneumocephalus with mass effect as well as post-operative subdural fluid collections and pachymeningeal enhancement.
Circumferential slow diffusion at the margins of the resection bed, with only low-level enhancement, suggestive of peri-operative ischemia.
Expected appearance of the post-surgical cavity with residual blood products, but no definite evidence of residual tumor.
No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Post op head CT showed post operative changes.
Brain MRI post op showed expected post-op changes with no residual tumor.
There is a question of ischemia in the surgical bed.
3. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every  6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Have a friend or family member check the wound for signs of infection such as redness or drainage daily.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting >10lbs, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
?Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4676**] to schedule an appointment with one of the Physician Assistant in 10 days from the time of surgery for suture removal.
