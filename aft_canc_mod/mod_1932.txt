She had a recent hospitalization on the thoracic surgery service [**Date range (1) 31081**] with large left spontaneous pneumothorax that was treated with a chest tube and removed prior to discharge with a residual small left apical pneumothorax.
She had been in her normal state of health on intermittent home oxygen (2L n/c)until [**7-29**] when she developed a cough productive of clear sputum with blood streaking and a fever to 100.8.
CXR showed persistant but not enlarged left apical PTX and a new RUL consolidation.
She denied having chest pain, tightness, or pleuritic pain.
On discharge AF, VSS Gen: NAD speaking in full sentences.
CXR 1) Stable small left apical pneumothorax, unchanged from [**2180-7-25**].
2) Interval worsening right upper lobe opacity, likely infectious or aspiration related given its rapid development.
3) Mild interval worsening in left mid and lower lung zone opacities, which may be related to the patient's underlying tumor and/or infection/aspiration.
Correlate with the subsequent CT. 4) Persisting small left pleural effusion.
5) At least one destructive left-sided rib lesion, likely a metastasis.
CTA chest: no pulmonary embolus.
Numerous ill-defined lung nodules bilaterally with more confluent opacity in the left upper lobe, bronchial narrowing, and  irregular interlobular septal thickening and ground- glass opacities representing metastatic BAC.
Increase in size of soft tissue mass destroying a portion of the T7 vertebral body and medial left 7th rib.
Deformity of the left 6th rib at the site of previously seen destructive lesion.
Chronic fracture deformity of theleft lateral 8th rib.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 56yoW with metastatic bronchoalveolar lung cancer with a recent admission for spontaneous pneumothorax presenting with fever, dyspnea, persistant small-moderate pneumothorax.
# Dyspnea/Fever: Ms. [**Known lastname 31082**] presentation of fever, dyspnea, productive cough and known sick contacts were considered most concerning for pneumonia.
Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] was therefore treated broadly to cover for community and hospital aquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin.
Her dyspnea improved along with her hypoxia.
Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] remained afebrile the rest of her admission and the aggressiveness of her antibiotic regimen was weaned, first with the discontinuation of vancomycin.
# Depression-Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] has struggled with longstanding depression.
# Anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] has a normocytic normochromic anemia.
Studies are suggestive of anemia of chronic disease/likely hypoproliferation secondary to chemotherapy.
# Anticoagulation: Ms. [**Known lastname 16462**] was continued on her home regimen of comadin at 5mg qday.
She became supratherapeutic with the institution of antibiotics and her dose was decreased and she became subtherapeutic.
Cefdinir 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO bid () as needed for pneumonia for 7 days.
