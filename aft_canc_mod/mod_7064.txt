Cryoablation of pseudomembrane  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old gentleman who presents with 3D of atraumatic neck, R shoulder and insidious R sided weakness, first arm then leg.
He denies any preceding symptoms or other complaints.
In addition, he reports radicular pain into bilateral hands with any neck rotation and now constant paresthesias of all fingertips.
He has been incontinent of urine once; no other changes to his bowel or bladder habits.
Pain is constant, sharp, exacerbated with any motion.
He presented to [**Hospital6 1597**] after the weakness progressed to such a point that he could no longer work as a mechanic due to hand weakness or ambulate normally due to right leg weakness.
Imaging was concerning for pathologic fracture and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.
Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, cough or weight change.

Posterior bowing and fracture fragments appear to contact the spinal cord at this level.
Lytic lesion in the C5 vertebral body appears to erode through the cortex to the left transverse foramen.
In correlation with prior MRI, there is abnormal soft tissue surrounding the vertebral artery.
Overall, the appearance is compatible with multiple myeloma or widespread metastatic disease.
Mild pulmonary edema and mild bibasilar atelectasis are new.
Heart size is normal but mediastinal fullness could be due to either dilated pulmonary artery or prevascular mediastinal mass.

No evidence of pneumonia.
Destructive paraspinal mass in the mid thoracic spine, more fully evaluated by previous cross-sectional imaging studies  C-spine x-ray [**3-1**]:  In comparison with study of [**2-20**], there is little change in the corpectomy and posterior fusion spanning C2 through C7.
Unchanged appearance of left posterior thoracic soft tissue mass with extensive bony lytic lesions as described above involving the thoracic spine, right scapula and ribs, and possibly the sternum.
Mild streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases, most compatible with atelectasis, although an early developing pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
Short segment of thickened trachea at the thoracic inlet may represent residual tracheitis.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2194-3-6**] 2:16 PM Cardiac size is mildly enlarged.
The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Known left retroaortic mass is visualized as a round opacity in the left AP window.
There is no rim enhancement or significant inflammatory changes surrounding this area making an abscess unlikely.
Asymetric, left predominant enhancement of the bilateral tympanic and mastoid portions of the facial nerves, that may be related to viral infection but should be substantiated by dedicated IAC MRI.
Otherwise, normal MRI of the head, specifically without evidence of infarct, hemorrhage, or masses.
BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS Procedure Date of [**2194-3-18**] INTERPRETATION:  KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[20].nuc ish(FGFR3,IGH@)x2[100],(CCND1,IGH@)x2[100], (D13S319x2)[100],(TP53x2)[100]  No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Small clonal populations and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
FISH analyses with a multiple myeloma panel of probes were interpreted as normal for all probes examined.
No aberrations were detected with the:  1) LSI IGH/CCND1XT Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe for IGH at 14q32 and CCND1XT at 11q13 in 100/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal FISH finding can result from the absence of a deletion or rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
MR [**Last Name (Titles) **] W &W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-3-21**] 3:01 PM IMPRESSION: Abnormal enhancement of the tympanic and mastoid segments of the left facial nerve.
Viral infection is the most common cause, less likely neoplastic etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 59Y M with no significant PMH who presented to the ER on [**2-16**] with 3 days of right shoulder and neck pain, right sided arm and leg weakness.
Images taken on [**2-16**] showed multiple lesions extending from C3 to thoracic vertebra.
On [**2-20**] he developed "gurgling" with respirations and Tachypnea to the 30s with mild desaturation to 80 on RA which improved to 97 on 2L NC.
He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and acute encephalopathy and had to be re intubated secondary to pulmonary embolism in LUL and airway swelling.
The patient also had a fever to 101 and was started on empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia in addition to heparin GGT for PE.
He was extubated and then re intubated the same day for respiratory distress and acidosis.
He was taken to the OR on [**2-24**] for a flexible bronchoscopy where aspiration and cryoablation of the pseudomembrane on the proximal tracheal wall.
He was scheduled to have an IVC filter placed by ACS but this was cancelled secondary to scheduling difficulties.
On [**2-27**] he was transferred to the Oncology floor where he states that he has pain in his neck but that it moderate and is the same as yesterday.
It is not associated with nausea or vomiting.
He also has back pain which is moderate and unchanged as well.
The pt was supposed to complete a 7 day course of vanc/zosyn for pneumonia, but he continued to spike fevers so the antibiotics were not stopped.
Cultures grew only coag neg staph, while CXR failed to show a definite pneumonia.
The fevers could be due to PEs, or underlying infection not detected.
A CT of the chest from [**3-2**] showed residual tracheitis.
The pt was afebrile on [**3-6**] overnight, but spiked again overnight on [**3-7**].
His eosinophil count was elevated so ID recommended a course of Ivermectin which he completed for possible Strongyloides infection.
The pt was started on radiation therapy and velcade for multiple myeloma treatment.
He tolerated therapy well without significant pain or nausea noted.
Near the end of this admission he also developed Left sided facial nerve palsy.
An MRI of his internal auditory canal was performed which showed enhancement of the facial nerve.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and recommended that we just observe him for resolution of symptoms at the present time.
