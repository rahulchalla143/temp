He reports Double vision with his Left eye on R gaze and he describes skewed images c/w 4th CN palsy.
He was evaluated for lazy eye surgery and worked up for his HA with an MRI scan, revealing a L skull base lesion with cysctic and solid components, most likely representing a benign tumor.
Past Medical History: epression/anxiety PSH: Baby tooth removal [**8-/2122**]; Tooth exposures, [**2123**]; Wisdom tooth extraction [**11/2129**]   Social History: Student; Politial science major; Currently unemployed Non-smoker; Non-drinker; Marital status: single   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On Admission: AF VSS; 6'1''; ca 180 lbs NAD Neck: supple, no LNN HEENT unremarkable RRR no SOB NTTP Warm peripherals, no CCE  Neuro: AAO x3; normal mentation; pleasant, cooperative Normal recall, fluent speech and comprehension.
CN: I not tested II: vision adequate and no VFC to confrontation III-VI: Left 4th CN palsy V: nl sensation and bite strength VII symmetric VIII hears finger rubs bilaterally no swallowing difficulties; Palate midline, cough + Tongue midline  Bilaterally full strength, no drift Normal sensation to LT, vibration No paresthesias Symmetric reflexes 2+ B; Babsinski - Stand and gait stable; Rhomberg - No ataxia, dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesis; Fine movement and coordination intact  On Discharge: A&Ox3 PERRL EOMs intact vision acuity stable with glasses Full motor throughout Incision: slight oozing at L temporal region stable with pressure dressing.
Pertinent Results: OSH MRI (The imaging institute RI; [**2131-9-3**]) This reveals a L sided skull base tumor at the level of the prepontine cistern that ahs a solid, contrast enhancing component measuring ca 2cm; sharply demarkated and displacing the hypothalamus upwards, the mesial temporal lobe laterally and the brainstem posteriorly; There is a second cystic component in the Left posterior brain stem c/w an extension indenting the L brain stem and displacing it.
[**2132-8-6**] MRI Brain: IMPRESSION: Surgical planning study demonstrates partially solid and partially cystic enhancing lesion in the left suprasellar cistern as well as in the cavernous sinus deforming the left side of the mid brain and pons.
The differential diagnostic consideration includes a schwannoma as suggested previously.
[**2132-8-6**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative changes as described above without evidence of acute hemorrhage.
[**2132-8-7**] MRI Brain:  Status post resection of left-sided cavernous sinus and prepontine cistern mass with some residual enhancement near the brainstem  and mild mass effect.
The majority of the solid component and portion of the cystic components have appeared to be resected since the previous study.
The tiny area of diffusion abnormality, best visualized on series 502, image 15 could be due to postoperative change, blood products or due to a tiny area of ischemia.
No definite territorial infarcts seen or brainstem infarct identified   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted electively for craniotomy for removal of a left sided brainstem lesion.
Postop head CT demonstrated some pneumocephalus but no hemorrhage.
On [**8-7**] he underwent a Brain MRI which revealed residual enhancement near the brainstem and edema.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
