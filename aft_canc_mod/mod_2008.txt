She notes that she has had a cough since extubation but has not been bringing up significant secretions.
She had a portable CXR which was suggestive of pneumonia and was started on levofloxacin.
She had a CT T-spine to evaluate post-operatively and although not protocoled to evaluate the lungs, lung windows revealed a moderate-to-large left pleural effusions, small right pleural effusion with bibasilar dependent consolidations, left greater than right, concerning for pneumonia and pleural effusions.
A trigger was called on the floor at 16:29 on [**2188-7-19**] when she developed worsening respiratory status.
She was noted to appear anxious with labored breathing with respiratory rates in the 30s and HR in the 130s.
She reports that her acute respiratory distress started shortly after receiving acetylcysteine She received 1 mg PO ativan and a MICU evaluation was called.
She received a nebulizer treatment which she says improved her symptoms and was also placed on 50% by facemask.
On arrival the MICU she reports that her respiratory symptoms have dramatically improved.
She has mild pain with deep inspiration but is able to take a deep breath.
She has cough productive of minimal sputum and feels as if her cough is weak.
She has no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.

Status post posterior fusion spanning from T5 to T12 with appropriate anatomical alignment, no evidence for hardware failure.
Moderate-to-large left pleural effusions, small right pleural effusion with bibasilar dependent consolidations, left greater than right, concerning for pneumonia and pleural effusions.
Status post left nephrectomy.
Bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly at the left lung, concerning for pneumonia.
Airspace opacity at the right apex, could be due to early lymphangitic spread of tumor with metastatic burden here increased from prior.
Large dependent pleural effusion on the left and small pleural effusion on the right.
Status post posterior fusion spanning from T5 to T12 with appropriate anatomic alignment, and no evidence of hardware failure.
No definite evidence of upper airway obstruction.
No significant lymphadenopathy in the neck according to CT size criteria.
Bilateral peribronchial opacities at the lung apices, described in more details on the CT torso from the same day.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-20**], no major change is evident.
No definite vegetations seen .
[**7-31**] CXR PA/Lat: FINDINGS: There is persistence of airspace disease in the left middle lung and the right lung base.
Diffuse bilateral reticulonodular interstitial markings (right greater than left) likely represent lymphangitic carcinomatosis given clinical history, and is consistent with findings on chest CT from [**2188-7-20**].
IMPRESSION: 1) Persistent bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates.
2) Reticulonodular interstitial disease likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
[**7-24**] Pleural fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells .
[**7-26**] Pathology of Lung, left lower lobe, transbronchial biopsy:     Carcinoma morphologically consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (history of renal cell carcinoma)  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine and lungs who was admitted for an elective vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9 for spinal stabilization.
She tolerated this procedure well on [**2188-7-15**], but developed postoperative respiratory distress and likely hospital acquired PNA.
1) Hospital Acquired Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress:  Patient transferred to the MICU on [**2188-7-19**] for acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea and fevers.
Pt with poor pulmonary reserve s/p multiple lung resections with mild restrictive defect on recent PFTs at baseline.
CT torso showed pneumonia and dependent effusion in L lung.
CT neck without obstruction of upper airways.
In addition, a TTE was performed showing no evidence of any vegetations.
This showed uptake at T8 adjacent to a larger photopenic area, likely related to osteoblastic activity in a known mixed lytic and sclerotic metastasis and minimally increased activity at multiple thoracic levels not as avid and extensive as would be expected from the appearance on CT suggesting the tumor is primarily osteoclastic, decreasing the sensitivity of the bone scan for visualization of metastatic disease.
CT T-spine with appropriate anatomical alignment, no evidence for hardware failure.
Patient treated initially with dilauded and morphine for pain control, which was gradually stopped.
At discharge, pain well-controlled on standing tylenol and naproxen, with fentanyl lozenges prn.
3) Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Patient taking everolimus as part of the RAD001 protocol prior to surgery, restarted on [**7-29**] with significant improvement in breathing.
No obstructing mass see on bronchoscopy, but biopsies positive for renal cell carcinoma.
4) Persistent Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in setting of acute illness, fever, anxiety, anemia and medications such as xopenex.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no acute ischemic changes.
5) Chronic normocytic anemia, likely related to renal cell carcinoma and chronic inflammatory state.
6) vaginal candidal infection on examination [**8-2**].

Keep wound clean / No tub baths or pools until seen in follow up/ take daily showers ??????
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine ??????

If you experience any of the above symptoms, chest pain, dizziness, persistent high fevers, or significant worsening of your shortness of breath, please return to the hospital or call your primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1729**].
