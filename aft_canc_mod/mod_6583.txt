# PEA Arrest:  Unclear precipitating event.
Possible causes of PEA included pneumonia +/- mucuous plug causing transient hypoxemia or possible primary cardiomyopathy.
Patient has decreased EF to 15-20% unlcear primary or secondary to recent code.
Patient also had hyperkalemia (K 6) on presentation, another possible factor.
Ruled out PE with negative PE-CTA.
# healthcare-associated pneumonia:  On admission, patient had leukocytosis and RLL effusion.
Diagnostic thoracentesis demonstrated a transudative process, thought to be parapneumonic vs CHF-related.
On [**3-19**], nearly one week after completing Meropenem therapy, patient was found to have an elevated WBC count.
Paitent remained afebrile throughout the second course and vitals were stable.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine on admission was 1.1 and rose to 2.0 in the days after the arrest.
Most likely prerenal due to poor forward flow in the pericode period.
There was likely also a component of ATN secondary to contrast.
# acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  EF 15-20%, newly decreased this admission.
Despite CXR findings of significant pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, her O2 Sat was 98% on RA.
Effusions and peripheral edema decreased.
# Pleural Effusion:  Diagnostic thoracentesis showed a transudative process.
Differential included parapneumonic process, metastatic disease, and/or effusion secondary to cardiomyopathy.
# Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma:  Patient with recent diagnosis and complicated course including mets to transverse colon s/p resection.
Tumor unresectable, felt to have poor likelihood of tolerating chemotherapy per OSH oncology notes.
# Guaiac + stools:  The pt was found to have grossly bloody stool from ostomy site.
# Bowel obstruction s/p R colectomy ??????
# CAD s/p CABG [**2147**] - Beta blocker was continued, ACEI held given ARF, lasix given as above, statin held.
# Diabetes Mellitus - Lantus and RISS were continued.
Lantus was decreased for hypoglycemia in the setting of holding tube feeds.
# Nutrition - Patient was getting tube feeds.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary:  cardiac arrest, hospital acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure secondary: metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, coronary artery disease, diabetes   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a cardiac arrest.
It is thought that you cardiac arrest was secondary to hypoxia from pneumonia.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, high fevers and chills, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
