Partial secondary closure of abdominal wound with VAC application 6.
She currently was at the nadir of her white count and she presented today to the emergency room with a white count of 0.1 and abdominal pain with altered mental status and hypotension.
CT scan revealed pneumatosis of the colon, a small amount of free air and very extensive portal venous air throughout the liver.
After a discussion with the family, she was taken to the operating room for treatment of presumed dead bowel of unknown origin with progression to infarction and septic shock.
Past Medical History: Vancomycin SENSITIVE enterococcus faecium bacteremia from port during induction chemotherapy [**1-/2113**] PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] [**2-/2113**] - not confirmed by culture Hypothyroidism Hypertension Seasonal allergies s/p hysterectomy s/p appendectomy .
Pt was in USOH until [**12-12**] [**2111**], when she had a cold with dry cough, fevers and chills, all improved by [**12-18**].
After a few days, pt had vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue increasing for about a week until [**12-28**], when the pt went to [**Hospital3 1443**] for the above symptoms.
She was found to have an enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia.
Rare EtOH use, no smoking, no IVDU.
Family History: Aunts and uncles with breast cancer and asbestos related lung cancer by report.
Physical Exam: SBP low on 10 dopa/max levophed 63; SBP increased to 134 on dopa 20/max levophed- received 8+L fluid gen: ill appearing, intubated, facial erythema, no scleral icterus cv: tachycardic, no m/r appreciated lungs: occ wheeze on anterior ausculation; bilateral breath sounds noted abd: distended, tender to palp ext: no rashes  [**2113-6-11**] pH 7.20 pCO2 48 pO2 223 HCO3 20 BaseXS -9   Pertinent Results: On admission: .
[**6-11**] colon pathology: Ileo-total abdominal colectomy: Colon with extensive transmural ischemic type necrosis, extending to the distal resection margin.
Ileum with patchy ischemic type necrosis, extended focally to the resection margin.
4.2 x 3.5 cm  calcified hyperdense mass within the right frontal lobe.
Differential diagnosis includes calcified meningioma and, much less likely calcified cavernoma.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Diffuse pneumatosis along the ascending, transverse, and descending colon with dilatation of the ascending and transverse colon, mucosal wall thickening, lack of enhancement, mesenteric  and portal venous gas.
These findings are consistent with ischemic  bowel.The severe stranding around the cecum suggests that this may be perforated locally.There is also a questionable small focus of eccentric extraluminal air here 2.
Free fluid within the abdominal cavity.
Basilar airspace consolidations in the dependent portions may represent atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia.
Dilated pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
2.2 x 2.2 cm soft tissue density mass in left anterior pelvic wall.
L1 compression fracture.
At CT of the abdomen showed pneumatosis of colon with free air.
Colonic necrosis from the cecum to upper rectum without perforation was discovered and Total abdominal colectomy and damage control packing of the abdomen was performed.
On [**2113-6-30**] she returned to the operating room due to abdominal wound dehiscence, prolonged respiratory failure, need for vascular access, and abdominal fat necrosis.
She underwent exploratory laparotomy with incision and drainage and re closure of laparotomy incision, drainage of intraabdominal collection (most likely sterile fat necrosis), tracheostomy, and placement of right subclavian central venous catheter.
Her open wound was managed by VAC therapy.
The patient's post-operative course was also complicated by the development of a gastrocutaneous fistula out of the wound bed, assumedly due to erosion of gastric wall by the G-J tube.
As her wound began to granulate, we progressively sutured her wound closed.
NEURO: The patient's post-operative course was also complicated by profound upper and lower extremity weakness.
The etiologies considered included critical illness myopathy, critical illness neuropathy vs.
Her most recent chemistry panel [**8-11**]:                   Glucose UreaN  Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap                      143*  12      0.2* 138 3.8 98 32 12 PULMONARY As noted above, she suffered from prolonged respiratory failure and required tracheostomy placement.
Her tracheostomy was removed and her incision site healed without complication.
On the day of discharge she was >95% Sp02 on room air without respiratory symptoms.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY: On [**2113-7-24**] she underwent sternal aspirate by the Heme/Onc service which did NOT show evidence of leukemia: (CELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS.
ID She did have a urinary tract infection on [**7-21**] and was treated with Zosyn for 7 days once the sensitivities were back.
