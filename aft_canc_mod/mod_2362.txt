Likely pancreatic masses, or lymphoma with sparing of portions of pancreas for which further characterization by CT or MR is recommended.
Right hepatic lesion that could be characterized by CT or MR. 4.
Distended galbladder with moderate pericholecystic stranding suggesting acute cholecystitis.
Pancreatic body mass partially evaluated on this non-contrast study.
Further evaluation of the pancreatic mass, mesenteric vasculature and possible hepatic metastasis could be performed with MRI with contrast.
Splenomegaly and varices consistent with portal hypertension.
# RENAL U.S.
Grayscale ultrasound demonstrates mild increased echogenicity of the kidneys consistent with medical renal disease.
No evidence of stone, hydronephrosis, or mass.
Elevated resistive indices within both kidneys with absent/reversed diastolic flow in the intraparenchymal renal arterial waveforms.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-4-22**] 8:54 AM No signs for overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.
# MR 3D RENDERING W/POST PROCESSING ON INDEPENDENT WS  [**2102-4-23**] 12:48 PM 1.
Large pancreatic mass consistent with pancreatic carcinoma with local invasion and vascular encasement.
Intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Two liver lesions, which are nonspecific in appearance but concerning for metastases.
# FNA Cytology Report PANCREAS [**2102-4-24**] POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
# Pathology R. OF MIDLINE CENTRAL BACK [**2102-4-26**] Lentiginous compound dysplastic nevus with moderate atypia and numerous dermal melanophages, extending to a peripheral specimen margin.
# ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT  [**2102-4-27**] 7:55 AM Successful plastic stenting across a distal common bile duct stricture secondary to known pancreatic cancer.
Irregular dilatation noted proximal to the stricture.
# ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2102-5-1**] 3:41 PM No evidence of catheter obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 70M h/o DM1, gastroparesis, admitted with N/V, anorexia, unintentional weight loss, found to have poorly differentiated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cholangitis, and ATN.
# Pancreatic head mass:  After undergoing fine needle aspiration via endoscopic ultrasound, pt was found to have poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic to the liver and encasing major vessels.
Because the mass impinged on the biliary tree, pt also underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy and ERCP-placed common bile duct stent.
Pt was discharged with capped drain in place, with instructions to uncap if he developed abdominal discomfort, fevers, or chills.
On discharge, pt was tolerating PO intake, with no nausea or vomiting.
# Cholangitis [**3-18**] pancreatic head mass: After undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage, pt completed a course of piperacillin-tazobactam for cholangitis.
# Portal vein thrombosis:  Pt was noted to have portal vein thrombosis, probably subacute, likely related either to invasion or extrinsic compression by the pancreatic mass, as pt had no evidence of chronic liver disease.
# ATN: Pt developed ATN with significantly decreased urine output in the setting of ARF, which initially was [**3-18**] prerenal failure due to dehydration with nausea, vomiting, and continued furosemide use.
# Enterococcus UTI: Pt's urine culture was positive for enterococcus, sensitive to ampicillin.
# Atypical nevus: Pt was noted to have an atypical nevus at midback, which was biopsied and found to be a lentiginous compound dysplastic nevus with moderate atypia and numerous dermal melanophages.
# [**Doctor Last Name 21078**] syndrome: Pt was noted to have a papular rash on his back, diagnosed as [**Doctor Last Name 21078**] syndrome; steroid creams were applied with good effect.
# R foot stage II pressure ulcer: On day of discharge, pt was noted to have a stage II pressure ulcer on his R foot.
Anemia was considered likely [**3-18**] chronic disease and CRI.
# Hypertension: Pt's home regimen of antihypertensives were held given his low SBP; he was discharged with no continuing antihypertensives.
Percutaneous drain bag Please provide drain bag for percutaneous drain.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Mupirocin 2 % Ointment Sig: One (1) application Topical three times a day for 10 days: Apply to stage II sore at right foot.
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Cholecystitis Portal vein thrombosis Acute tubular necrosis Enterococcus urinary tract infection [**Doctor Last Name 21078**] disease Atypical nevus NOS, question melanoma Stage II right foot ulcer Glaucoma .
Diabetes mellitus type I Hypertension Hyperlipidemia GERD   Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating PO intake   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were nauseous, vomiting, and were jaundiced.
We found that you had a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas, which had blocked your gallbladder and led to cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts).
# Using endoscopic ultrasound, we performed a fine needle aspiration of the pancreatic mass, in order to determine what kind of cells were there.
We also started you on antibiotics for your gallbladder infection (cholecystitis) and the urinary tract infection that you developed while you were here.
Also, we found that you had a rash on your back that dermatology diagnosed as [**Doctor Last Name 21078**] Disease.
Dermatology was also concerned about an abnormal mole on your back, which was concerning for melanoma.
(It is your choice to have your sutures removed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24642**] or by the [**Hospital1 18**] dermatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].)
Finally, on the day we discharged you, we found a small blister on your right foot.
We have started some new medications for you, and changed some medications: .
# For your kidneys: --Take 1 nephrocap daily --Take Sevelamer three times daily with meals .
# For nausea: --Take ondansetron 4mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea .
# For constipation: --Take lactulose 30ml twice daily as needed for constipation.
If you have any extremely concerning symptoms, call your primary care doctor and go immediately to the emergency room.
