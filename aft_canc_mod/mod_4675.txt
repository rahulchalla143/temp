Admission Date:  [**2190-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-3-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 85086**] Chief Complaint: Fever, cough, weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy and endobronchial debulking of squamous cell lung mass [**10-21**] Endotracheal intubation [**10-21**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10689**] is a 62 y/o man w/ recently-diagnosed LUL poorly-differentiated squamous cell lung cancer admitted for hypotension and fever secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Patient had back pain, weight loss, and productive cough with mild hemoptysis at the beginning of [**Month (only) **]; [**Month (only) **] at that time revealed a LUL opacity.
F/U CT thorax on [**10-8**] revealed LUL mass 5 x 6.7 cm concerning for malignancy.
On [**10-14**], patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsies, and a linear endobronchial ultrasound with lymph node biopsies (both procedures performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Endobronchial biopsies revealed poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Patient presented to PCP's (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Angels) office with worsening cough, fever and weakness on [**10-20**].
Vitals at PCP's office were:  101.7, SBP 82/52, tachycardic to 115, and breathing 98% on RA; had diminished L upper lung breath sounds, per PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] on [**10-20**] revealed new infiltrate peripheral to the mass lesions; likely consistent with PNA.
LUL mass thought to be obstructing airway- OR endobronchial debulking performed this afternoon, [**2190-10-21**], prior to transfer from MICU to the floor; suggested by IP consult.
Patient's procedure was c/b hypoventilation and PaCO2 noted at one point to be > than 100.

Enlarging left upper lobe mass with left upper bronchial stenosis, at the level of stenosis the pulmonary artery is less than 11mm posterior to the bronchus.
Encasement of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery and post-obstructive pneumonia.
New bilateral small pleural effusions.
New left basal pneumonia, probably aspiration of left upper lobe contents.
MRI Head With and Without Contrast ([**10-23**]): No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Progression of left upper lobe atelectasis and consolidation as above.
There is stenosis of the left upper lobe bronchus, however there is mild increase in aeration of the apicoposterior segment with peripheral dilated bronchioles.
Progression of ground-glass and consolidation in left lower lobe, possibly related to aspiration and in part to compressive atelectasis due to enlarging left pleural effusion.
Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Pleural Fluid Analysis ([**10-24**]): 4+ PMNs, no organisms, fluid culture without growth, anaerobic culture without growth.
FDG avid left upper lobe consolidation, with more focally increased FDG avidity surrounding a narrowed left upper lobe bronchus, compatible with the known squamous cell carcinoma with post-obstructive collapse and consolidation of the left upper lobe.
FDG avid consolidation of the left lower lobe and lingula, likely pneumonia or aspiration.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
Trace free fluid in the pelvis.
Interval improvement in left upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia with improved aeration of the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe.
Known mass lesion is not well evaluated due to surrounding consolidation.
Slight interval increase in left pleural effusion.
Resolution of right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound with Doppler of Lower Extremities ([**11-2**]): Non-occlusive thrombosis of bilateral popliteal, the right peroneal and the left posterior tibialis veins.
Chest X-Rays were repeated 11 times throughout admission and demonstrated left upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia with little to no improvement.
Images later in stay further revealed almost complete white out of the left lung with collapse of the left lower lobe detected late in the hospital course.
Lymph node, 4R, biopsy (A-D): No malignancy identified.
Lymph node, 4L, biopsy (E-F): No malignancy identified.
Lymph node, level 7, biopsy (G-H): No malignancy identified.
Lymph node, 2R, biopsy (I): No malignancy identified.
Lymph node, 2L, biopsy (J): No malignancy identified.

The patient continued to have intermittent hypotensive episodes during his stay that were associated with severe night sweats and fevers.
After infectious work up was negative on multiple occassions, the fevers were attributed to his tumor and he was started on scheduled acetaminophen and continuous IVF.
The patient did not have subsequent episodes of hypotension.
# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: In the setting of known left upper lobe squamous cell carcinoma and radiographic evidence there was high concern for a post-obstructive pneumonia.
The patient subsequently began radiation therapy in an effort to shrink the tumor with hopes that this would be definitive therapy for the pneumonia.
Repeat chest x-rays throughout admission demonstrated little to no improvement in the post-obstructive pnemonia with subsequent collapse of the left lower lobe and progression of the ateletctasis of the left upper lobe.
# Left Upper Lobe Poorly Differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma:  Patient was diagnosed several weeks prior to admission at which time the lymph nodes were clear.
Brain MRI showed early in the hospitalization revealed no evidence of brain metastases.
PET scan on [**10-26**] revealed mediastinal lymph nodes suspicious for metastases.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and performed a mediastinoscopy for which the sampled lymph nodes were negative for malignant cells.
The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his Oncologist as well as with the Chest Disease Center.
# Pleural effusion: Pleural fluid  was negative for malignant cells on thoracentesis [**10-24**] with cultures showing no empyema.
An exudative parapneumonic effusion was suspected, with no evidence of empyema.
The patient was treated for pneumonia as per above.
# Partial Occlusive Thromboses: Patient had mild right-sided lower extremity edema midway through admission.
An ultrasound study with Dopplers revealed non-occlusive thromboses of the bilateral popliteal, the right peroneal and the left posterior tibialis veins.
# Thrombocytosis: Likely acute phase reactant in the setting of ongoing infection and inflammation.
Patient's platelet counts remained elevated throughout admission.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
