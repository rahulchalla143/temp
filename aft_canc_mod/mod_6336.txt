Admission Date:  [**2175-8-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-2-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Sore throat, coryza symptoms  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement Bone Marrow Biopsy   History of Present Illness: 51 yo male presents with 1 week history of sore throat and URI type symptoms.
He presented to an OSH where he was noted to have leukocytosis (WBC >70K) and given concern for hematologic malignancy, he was transferred here for further care.
Hematology evaluated the patient, and a peripheral smear was consistent with likely AML.
His symptoms continued to worsen which is why he presented to the ED.
On ROS, he denies fevers, chills, weight change, visual changes, headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, BRBPR, melena, dysuria, hematuria, frequency, urgency, numbness, weakness, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Seasonal Allergies   Social History: Occasional ETOH.
Family History: First cousin with leukemia  Physical Exam: VITALS: 101.0  124/72  85  20  96%1L GENERAL: WDWN male, NAD, appears comfortable HEENT: NCAT, no cervical adenopathy; mucous membranes slightly dry CV: RRR, no M/R/G LUNGS: few coarse BS in R base, otherwise clear without wheezes rales or rhonci ABDOMEN: soft, obese, non tender.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffuse right pleural thickening with sparing of the medial pleural surface together with tiny right pleural effusion likely account for the CXR appearance.
Together with shift of the mediastinum towards the right, fibrothorax is a possibility, especially if the patient has had prior pleural disease.
Diffuse ground-glass attenuation of the lungs with smooth septal thickening can be seen in hydrostatic edema, but also in atypical infections such as viral or pneumocystis pneumonia.
Borderline enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes may be reactive but attention at follow up CT suggested.
Splenomegaly with splenic infarct.
Possible left renal hypodensity, which may represent either renal lesion or renal infarct.
This could be evaluated by renal US if warranted clinically.
Mucosal thickening involving maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinus, consistent with mucosal sinus disease.
No evidence of soft tissue infection or osseous erosion.
Bibasilar opacity is new on the left, could be atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Aside from minimal atelectasis in the right base, the lungs are clear.
There is no evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
[**9-11**] SKIN BIOPSY PATHOLOGY REPORT: Superficial dermal hemorrhage associated with small vessel thrombi and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (see microscopic description and comment).
No herpes virus identified (routine and immunostains).
Microscopic description.
Sections show intact epidermis with occasional dyskeratotic cells.
No vesiculation is identified in the multiple tissue levels examined.
There is an area of red blood cell extravasation in the superficial dermis which is associated with thrombi in small  vessels.
No vasculitis is seen.
In addition, there is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**] superficial to mid dermal perivascular and predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate, with some admixed histiocytes.
No herpes virus cytopathic effect is seen on routine stains.
No immunoreactivity for herpes simplex or varicella zoster is seen on specific immunostains.
No bacterial or fungal organisms are identified on Gram or GMS stains, respectively.
No infectious agents are identified in this sample on routine or infectious stains, and specifically, no herpes viral cytopathic effect is seen.
If there is continuing clinical concern for herpes virus, culture may prove more sensitive than tissue based stains.
The combined findings of apparently localized superficial dermal hemorrhage, small vessel thrombi and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration are unusual and are not specifically diagnostic in this biopsy.
The histologic differential diagnosis includes trauma, an adjacent lesion or excoriation, a hypersensitivity reaction, and possibly an occlusive vasculopathy.
On [**2175-9-1**], the patient's bone marrow demonstrated "Markedly hypocellular marrow with chemoablation effects.
No morphological evidence of residual leukemia is seen."
Febrile neutropenia Following a fever on [**2175-8-20**], the patient was started on cefepime on [**2175-8-21**] and vancomycin on [**2175-8-23**].
Micafungin and levofloxacin were added on [**2175-8-25**] after CT chest showed ground glass attentuation.
The patient developed a non-pruritic maculopapular rash on his upper right arm.
For pruritus treatment, Derm recommended clobetasone.
The patient also has an intertriginous rash on his right groin; has miconazole powder to use.
Rash, likely hypersensitivity reaction to drug Patient has maculopapular rash that developed on extremities and torso.
The rash persisted after discontinuation of antibiotics and derm was consulted for possible viral etiologies.
A punch biopsy was obtained and sent for pathology which showed superficial dermal hemorrhage associated with small vessel thrombi and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with no evidence of HSV or VZV.
The patient had a suture at the site of biopsy in place at time of discharge with instructions to remove around [**9-26**].
Sarna Anti-Itch 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) application Topical four times a day as needed for itching.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 20 doses.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Acute myelogenous leukemia  SECONDARY: Neutropenic fever Rash, likely in reaction to cefepime   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a sore throat and symptoms of an upper respiratory infection.
You were found to have a high white blood cell count and were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia.
You had multiple bone marrow biopsies.
Your counts went down as expected and you developed a fever which was treated with antibiotics.
You also developed a rash which may have been related to antibiotics and it was determined that there was no virus causing the rash.
Some of your medications were changed during this admission: START Acyclovir START Oxycodone as needed for pain .
