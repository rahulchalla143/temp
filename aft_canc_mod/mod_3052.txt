Admission Date:  [**2198-8-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-9-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2133-2-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROMEDICINE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Difficulty mobilizing secretions, shortness of breath  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 45354**] is a 65-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and hypertension, who was presenting with a myasthenic crisis, symptoms of facial weakness, difficulty mobilizing secretions in the setting of a urinary tract infection.
Ms. [**Known lastname 45354**] was diagnosed with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] in [**2197-7-22**] after first noticing a drooping eye and slightly slurred speech in [**2197-5-21**].
In [**2197-7-22**], she has a positive tensilon test and the presence of acetocholine receptor antibodies was noted.
A chest CT was performed at [**Hospital3 45357**] in [**Hospital1 1474**] and revealed a 2 cm nodule anterior to the distal aspect of the main pulmonary artery that was suspicious for thymoma.
She had one episode of dyspnea in [**2197-12-22**], at which time her Mestinon was increased to 60 mg three times a day.
Ms. [**Known lastname 45354**] states that she was in her usual state of health until approximately three weeks prior to admission, when she developed a urinary tract infection, marked by increased urinary frequency.
At approximately the same time as she developed the urinary tract infection, on [**7-22**], she began to have difficulty chewing and swallowing.
On approximately [**8-9**] or 20, the patient began to have extreme bifacial weakness and shortness of breath with orthopnea and difficulty handling her secretions.
Hypertension  HOME MEDICATIONS:  Mestinon 60 mg by mouth three times a day, Dyazide 37/25 mg by mouth once daily, Prinivil 20 mg by mouth once daily, Macrobid.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies, however, due to her myasthenia, penicillin, iodine contrast, beta blockers, quinine and procainamide are contraindicated.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for her mother having had a myocardial infarction, and her father deceased with cancer.
Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1 and S2, with a regular rate, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Her speech is appropriate and fluent, without paraphasic errors.
Extraocular movements were full, but she gets diplopia on holding extreme gaze.
Her palatal elevation is bilaterally symmetric.
On coordination, finger-to-nose was slightly ataxic, likely due to weakness.
Urinalysis still has signs of infection.
At that time, her NIF was -20 and she had a FVC of 1.5, although it is unclear whether she is making a tight seal with the mask or tube, as she has extreme bifacial weakness.
Two days later, on [**8-16**], the patient had worsening weakness with a NIF of -30 and FVC of 0.9.
Again, this was thought to have a large component due to difficulty with a proper seal, as the patient was no more tachypneic than she had been before.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she also had some vaginal bleeding, which was resolved by the time of her transfer.
On [**8-19**], she had a repeat chest CT which showed a 15 x 8 mm anterior mediastinal mass, suspicious for thymoma.
On [**8-23**], the patient was continuing to improve, and discharge was anticipated, however, on that day, she had an episode of clotted blood which appeared to be from her urine.
Vaginal examination was done, which showed no blood in the vaginal canal.
Despite her increased facial weakness and difficulty swallowing, the patient had no decrease in her NIF or vital capacity, which remained stable at -80 and 1.3 liters.
On the 14th, the patient had a speech and swallow study, and her nasogastric tube was pulled.
On the afternoon of the 15th, Ms. [**Known lastname 45354**] had another episode of vaginal bleeding.
A vaginal examination revealed blood in the vaginal canal.
This examination revealed an extremely small cervical opening secondary to scarring status post a cone biopsy in the spring of [**2197**].
