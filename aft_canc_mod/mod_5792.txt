Admission Date:  [**2115-9-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-9-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2037-10-7**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 96864**] is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peripheral neuropathy recently admitted to the [**Hospital3 4527**] and found to have massive ascites and abdominal carcinomatosis on abdominal [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for gynecologic/oncology evaluation and possible surgical staging and debulking who was then subsequently transferred to the Medicine Service for a right deep venous thrombosis and management of this due to her allergy to heparin.
At the outside hospital, as mentioned before, she had massive ascites and abdominal carcinomatosis with diffuse omental studding and a CA125 of 1,200.
On transfer to the Medicine Service, she was denying any complaints including shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, saying that her left leg was less full than it had been in the several days prior.
She reports an allergy to heparin, although she is not sure of the specifics of the allergy, but has been told in the past not to be given heparin.
After talking with the family, they state that she has denied seeing a doctor for many months but has been complaining of abdominal swelling and right-sided abdominal pain for months.
They also say that she points to the region of her liver as a source of pain.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Questionable history of CVA in the past with right-sided weakness.
Pneumonia two months ago.
History of anemia with Guaiac positive stools at [**Hospital3 4527**] with an EGD and colonoscopy which were negative.
FAMILY HISTORY:  She has one daughter who had breast cancer diagnosed at age 45.
She denied any family history of ovarian or cervical cancer.
There was no evidence of scleral icterus.
Heart: There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium with radiation to the carotids.
Pulmonary: She had decreased breath sounds on the left, no audible wheezes or rhonchi.
She had increased venous distribution in the periumbilical region.
She had no rebound or guarding.
She had no palpable cords.
She had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, and there was no erythema or evidence of venostasis changes.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], Doppler ultrasound of her right lower extremity showed a nonocclusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein and occlusive thrombus in the superficial femoral vein.
She had an EKG as well which showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block, and Q waves in the lateral limb leads.
HEMATOLOGIC:  It was presumed and was felt most likely by Gynecology/Oncology as well as Hematology/Oncology that the mass in the patient's abdomen correlated with an elevated CA-125 of 1,200 were probably most consistent with ovarian carcinoma.
It was felt necessary to medically manage her medical issues including her deep venous thrombosis by the Medicine Team with further discussion later in her admission with her family regarding possibility for surgery.
She was inconsistent as well throughout admission as to whether or not she wanted to undergo surgery or possible paracentesis with analysis of fluid for cytology and possible follow-up chemotherapy.
Since no conclusion could be made or decision made by her family, it was conveyed to them that it was inappropriate for her to have an extended hospital course or hospital stay while they waited to make this decision and this decision could be made as an outpatient.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted and recommended three treatment options; the first being surgical debulking and staging by Gynecology/Oncology with possible follow-up chemotherapy; the second, being abdominal paracentesis with analysis of fluid for cytology and pending the results palliative chemotherapy; the third being hospice care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**].
She also was noted on admission to have a right deep venous thrombosis, and has an allergy to heparin.
She received one dose of Coumadin prior to consideration of surgery, and resulted in an elevated INR to 5.6, which subsequently came down to the 2.5 range.
It was unclear why her INR was persistently elevated, possibly due to malnutrition.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] also has a history of anemia with iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
She had been receiving iron supplementation when admitted; however, she was not discharged on iron supplementation due to inability of iron supplementation to help with anemia of chronic disease.
Her hematocrit was monitored very closely.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] has a history of hypertension and had good blood pressure control while admitted on her Captopril 50 mg t.i.d., and she was originally kept on her Atenolol 12.5 mg b.i.d., which was subsequently increased to 25 mg b.i.d.
There was a questionable history of coronary artery disease on admission given the Q waves in the lateral limb leads, and right bundle branch block.
She underwent an echocardiogram which showed a mildly dilated left atrium, a normal left ventricular cavity, a normal ejection fraction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and mild aortic stenosis.
She also had a Persantine MIBI stress test which revealed no EKG changes, normal ejection fraction, and no reversible defect.
It was felt that her cardiac postoperative risk for death was 10-15%.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] also suffered from fluid overload and congestive heart failure while admitted.
She had some oxygen desaturations and was maintained on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
She had audible wheezing and evidence of hypoxia, but improvement with her nebulizer treatments.
and strongly recommended that she have respiratory treatments with nebulizer treatments p.r.n.
She also had evidence of increased sputum production several days after admission and a poor quality chest x-ray.
At this point, it was attempted to get sputum from induction; however, no sample was ever obtained.
She remained afebrile without any clinical evidence of pneumonia.
ENDOCRINE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] has a history of type 2 diabetes and is maintained on Actos and Glyburide as an outpatient.
It was recommended that she have close follow-up at the nursing home as an outpatient for hypoglycemia given her likely decreased p.o.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Several days into admission, it was noted that Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] was somnolent and it was felt that she was possibly developing an infection, and had been on Tylenol; therefore, a fever spike could not be detected.
A U/A revealed signs of a urinary tract infection; however, urine culture times two came back as fecal contamination.
Initial blood cultures grew one out of four bottles positive for gram-positive cocci in chains from her PICC line site.
This was followed the second day with surveillance cultures which at the time of discharge had never grown anything and it was felt that this was probably secondary to contamination.
PSYCHIATRY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] has a history of depression and has been maintained at the nursing home on Zoloft, Zyprexa 2.5 mg q.h.s., and Klonopin 0.5 mg t.i.d.
These were continued while she was admitted, and several of her Klonopin doses were held for concern of excessive sedation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Urinary tract infection.
