prior OSH exam is not available for comparison  CT head [**2183-1-28**] FINDINGS: There has been interval right-sided craniotomy with evacuation of the right subdural and epidural hematoma.
There is decreased cerebral edema with improved demonstration of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
There is a small residual subdural hematoma layering along the entire right convexity and tentorium, measuring 5 mm in thickness.
There is a small residual right parietal epidural hematoma, measuring 6-mm in thickness.
No subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage is seen.
A large amount of post-operative pneumocephalus is noted.
Aerosolized fluid pooling in the posterior nasopharynx likely represents retained secretions relAted to intubated status.
Interval right craniotomy and evacuation of right subdural and epidural hematoma with marked improvement in mass effect and cerebral edema.
Small residual right subdural hematoma and small residual right parietal epidural hematoma.
[**2183-2-11**] CT Head: The patient is status post right frontal temporoparietal craniotomy for right hemispheric subdural hematoma evacuation.
Again seen is a small right subdural collection surrounding the right cerebral convexity, maximally measuring 7 mm.
In comparison to the prior study, there is decreased attenuation of the subdural hematoma, suggesting interval evolution.
There is mild decrease in the hyperdense hematoma layering the tentorium cerebelli.
Mild effacement of the right hemispheric sulci, predominantly in the temporoparietal regions, is stable.
Minimal leftward shift of midline structures, is unchanged.
Mild compression of the right lateral ventricle is unchanged.
No acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage, edema, or mass is seen.
Calcification in both cavernous carotid arteries are noted.
Minimal fluid is seen within both mastoid air cells.
No abnormal enhancement is seen in the post-contrast images.
Status post evacuation of right subdural hematoma, with interval evolution of previously seen small residual right-sided SDH.
Mild interval decrease in the layering SDH in the tentorium cerebelli, compared to [**2183-2-1**].
No new hemorrhage or acute infarction.
Lungs are low in volume, making it difficult to exclude mild interstitial edema, particularly in the left lung.
No pneumothorax.
RUQ Ultrasound ([**2183-2-12**]): Limited views of the liver obtained due to a small acoustic window.
There are echogenic areas within the right and left lobe of liver which are subcentimeter and most likely represent scarring.
No suspicious focal liver lesions identified.
No intra- or extra-hepatic duct dilation is identified.
There is no free fluid identified.
No evidence of right hydronephrosis.
Barium passed freely through the oropharynx without evidence of obstruction.
There was penetration with nectar liquids and aspiration with thin liquids.
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin liquids and penetration with nectar liquids.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: 71 M history of prostate CA, skin CA, DVT 2 yrs ago on coumadin, HTN, admitted for large subdural hematoma s/p fall, now s/p hematoma evacuation transferred to medicine from neurosurg for fever workup.
When he arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**], he had a diffuse rash as well as fever.
It was thought to be due to his Dilantin administration.
He developed another rash after administration of Vit K.   After long discussion with his family, they consented for a right craniotomy for evacuation of the clot.
He has right sided weakness at present due to Kernohan's phenomenon.
He had fevers on [**2183-1-30**] and [**2183-1-31**] for which cultures were sent and found to be negative.
His exam continued to fluctuate and he was evaluated by medicine for intermittent fever spikes wihtout clear source as well as assisting in deciding about managment of remote DVT/PE with current negative LENI's.
Pt spiked fever again on [**2-5**].
On [**2183-2-6**], he was transferred to medicine for workup of persistent fever.
Active Problems: .
# Fever: After transfer to medicine, he continued to have low grade fevers, the cause of which is unclear.
Infection was felt to be unlikely given his persistent low grade fever despite 5d of Vanc/Cefepime and repeatedly negative culture data.
He continued to have low grade fevers, but became tachypnic and tachycardic.
In retrospect, he may have had an ealry PNA, which was the cause for his fevers vs. chemical pneumonitis with a superimposed bacterial infection which revealed itself later in his course.
His AMS was most likely multifactorial given his intracranial bleed and prolonged hospital stay, which likely contributed to his delerium.
There was no e/o subclinical seizure and Neurology felt his mental status was likely related to his intracranial bleed c/b delerium.
He should not be anticoagualted in the future given his severe intracranial hemorrhage unless directed to resume anticoagulation by neurosurgery.
# Nutrition: Pt failed repeated speech/swallow [**Last Name (LF) 92279**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started.
Video study showed continued abnormal deglutition, but he was cleared for nectal thick liquids and pureed solids.
# siADH: On transfer to medicine, pt had siADH, likely realted to ICH vs PNA.
Chronic Problems: .
# Metastases: CT C/A/P shows [**Last Name (un) 2043**] mets.
He should engage in rehab for his neurologic deficits and will require ongoing nutritional support and evaluation of his capacity to tolerate an advancing PO diet.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital through the emergency department for a subdural hematoma after a fall.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
