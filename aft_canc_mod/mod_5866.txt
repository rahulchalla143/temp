She also felt increased abdominal pain and bloating.
Upon going to the bathroom, she noticed a large amount of bright red blood in the toilet bowel.
She still had continuous bleeding through her [**Location (un) 1662**].
She underwent a colonoscopy on the day of transfer showing continuous bleeding potentially above the ileocecal valve, but was not well-visualized.
She had a CTA of the abdomen that showed a uterine mass that could be eroding into the intestinal wall.
Patient was transferred here for potential hysterectomy and surgical repair of her small intestine.
Her [**Hospital1 18**] notes on anemia do not mention guaiac or GI bleeding.
Of the past few weeks, she has also experienced more abdominal distention and pain, which she attributed to weight gain.
She denied shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal pain.

Imaging: [**2185-8-31**] CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: ABDOMEN:  There are several subcentimeter hypodense lesions in both lobes of the liver.
The left hepatic duct and common hepatic and common bile duct are moderately dilated down to the level of the sphincter of Oddi.
No obstructing lesion is identified.
There are bilateral circumscribed hypodense lesions in the kidneys consistent with cysts.
Almost all of these are too small to accurately characterize by CT.  No lymphadenopathy is apparent.
PELVIS:  The uterus is markedly enlarged and has an irregular lobulated contour.
There is a short segment of small bowel abutting the uterine fundus that demonstrates some ill-defined hyperemia or active bleeding.
No lymphadenopathy is apparent.
The ureters are mildly prominent.
No osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion is noted.
IMPRESSION: ABNORMAL ENLARGED UTERUS AS DESCRIBED.
FINDINGS ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANT NEOPLASM SUCH AS LEIOMYOSARCOMA OR ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA.
THERE IS AN ADJACENT SHORT LOOP OF ABNORMAL SMALL BOWEL.
ITS ENHANCEMENT SUGGESTS POSSIBLE INVASION BY TUMOR AND THERE [**Month (only) **] BE ACTIVE BLEEDING AT THIS SITE.
MRI Pelvis w/ and w/o contrast: Large, heterogeneously enhancing, multilobulated mass within the pelvis, with central areas of necrosis and focal hemorrhage.
It is intimately associated with and inseparable from a distal loop of small bowel.
Given this relationship to the small bowel and its appearance, this is thought most likely to represent a small bowel GIST.
While neither ovary is seen, this is thought less likely to be ovarian in origin given only the trace amount of free fluid and no evidence of metastatic disease within the pelvis.
Discharge Labs:  [**2185-9-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD Hct-29.1* [**2185-9-6**] 06:10AM BLOOD WBC-4.1 RBC-2.61* Hgb-8.4* Hct-24.2* MCV-93 MCH-32.1* MCHC-34.7 RDW-17.7* Plt Ct-210  Pathology: Small bowel, segmental resection:  Atypical spindle and focally epithelioid neoplasm (13.5 cm in greatest dimension), consistent with gastrointestinal stromal tumor of high malignant potential; see note.
Nine mesenteric lymph nodes with no tumor seen (0/9).
Tumor nuclei demonstrate areas of marked pleomorphism with coarse chromatin and irregular nuclear contours.
Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor are diffusely, strongly positive for C-kit, focally, weakly positive for actin, and negative for desmin and S-100, consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) immunophenotype.
Mitoses number greater than 15 per 50 high power fields and frequent tumor cell apoptosis is identified.
The tumor size of greater than 10 cm and mitotic activity of  greater than 15 per 50 high power fields confer a high risk of malignant potential  The tumor appears to arise within the muscularis propria, but extensively involves the submucosa and subserosa, with focally marked attenuation of the overlying mucosa, and the exact layer of origin is difficult to discern; definitive mucosal invasion by tumor cells is not identified.
Where evaluable in non-disrupted areas, however, a thin (from <1 mm to 3 mm) rim of serosal tissue is present along the external surface.
Brief Hospital Course: 77F with PMH significant for previous endometriosis and s/p benign uterine tumor removal, who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] ED with GI bleeding and BRBPR, found on colonoscopy to have bleeding from above the ileocecal valve, and on CTA to have a uterine tumor impinging on small bowel at OSH and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] .
MRI pelvis here demonstrated that the primary mass was actually in the small bowel abutting the uterus.
Based on CTA at [**Location (un) 620**], there was suspicion for uterine tumor eroding into small bowel leading to GI bleeding.
# Hypertension.
The patient has hx of hypertension.
Antihpertensive medications were held in the setting of active GI bleed.
Patient has chronic cough from [**Doctor First Name **] and followed by [**Hospital1 **] pulmonology.
Her pain was well controlled on PO Diluadid.
She received HSQ for prophylaxis and encouraged to ambulate on her own.
At the time of discharge on POD#8, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, passing gas and pain was well controlled.
Disp:*80 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
