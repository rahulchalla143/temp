Nonocclusive thrombus within the right femoral vein, which is of indeterminant age.
Nonocclusive thrombus within the left great saphenous vein.
No complication of the hardware or cement.
Degenerative changes of the bilateral hips.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**6-14**]): The imaged lung bases are clear with minimal bibasilar atelectasis without focal nodularity, pleural or pericardial effusion.
Coronary atherosclerotic calcifications noted.
Mild cardiomegaly also seen.
The liver is hypoattenuating, which could reflect mild fatty infiltration.
Focal hypodensity is seen in the left lobe (2:13), which is too small to be fully characterize.
Gallbladder is unremarkable with the exception of some layering hyperdensity which likely reflects [**Doctor Last Name 5691**]/small stones.
The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable with scattered hypodensities in the spleen also too small to characterize but likely cysts or hemangiomata.
Small and large bowels are unremarkable with the exception of diverticulosis without active inflammation.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no focal fluid collection or hematoma.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy though scattered nonenlarged nodes are noted.
Dense atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and major branches including a long segment of the SMA is noted.
No pathologic pelvic adenopathy is seen with the largest node measuring 8 mm in the left pelvic side wall.
There is no inguinal adenopathy.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
OSSEOUS AND SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion concerning for osseous malignant process with multilevel degenerative changes in the spine including marked lower lumbar facet arthropathy.
There is no groin or pelvic hematoma identified.
Lateral plate and screw fixation is seen of right distal femoral fracture without hardware or cement related complication.
Fracture lines are still evident without callus formation and slight displacement of small fracture fragments is noted.
Vascular calcification seen along the SFA and popliteal arteries bilaterally.
No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen, pelvis, retroperitoneum, groin, or thigh.
Diverticulosis and cholelithiasis without active inflammation.
Indeterminate right renal lesion can be assessed on ultrasound.
Status post ORIF of right femoral fracture without hardware comlication.
No evidence of fistulae, aneurysms, or thromboses.
Patient now s/p large GI bleed x 2.
C. diff +, on antibiotics, and with right hip pain of unclear etiology.
# GI bleeding: The patient presents with a 2-day history of hematochezia.
NG lavage was negative, and EGD was notable for gastritis but did not show bleeding ulcers or lesions.
She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring of hemodynamic status.
She underwent colonoscopy, and was found to have diverticulosis, sessile polyps throughout the colon, and stigmata of recent bleeding in the left colon.
A suspicious diverticulum was clipped and the bleeding stopped.
# Respiratory distress/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient desaturated to 89% and was placed on 2L NC oxygen supplement during her ICU stay.
It was likely that she developed pulmonary edema from CHF in the setting of a large amount of blood and plasma transfusions.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient continued to be diuresed until she no longer had an oxygen requirement.
#Right Hip Pain - Pt complaining of R. hip.
Given recent catheterization there was concern for pseudoaneuysm at site of R. femoral catheterization or RP bleed given R. hip pain.
No evidence of fistulae, aneuysm or thromboses.
Xray showed no new fracture.
CT hip/pelvis showed no evidence of bleed.
Pain was thought to be MSK in origin.
# UTI: The patient had been on nitrofurantoin for 2 months for UTI prophylaxis, but UA in the ED suggested UTI.
# Hypernatremia: On admission, the patient had an increasing sodium level.
It was thought that she developed hypernatremia from being placed on NPO for colonoscopy and restricted access to free water.
# Acute renal failure: On admission, the patient's cr was 2.5, higher than her baseline Cr of 1.9-2.0.
However, she had a second episode of acute on chronic kidney disease after her angiogram for the second GI bleed.
Renal was consulted, and the patient was found to have contrast-induced nephropathy.
# Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate was in 50's on admission due to delayed atenolol metabolism in the setting of acute kidney failure.
# Thrombosis:  The patient has a remote history of DVT on chronic coumadin.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was found to have asymmetric leg swelling and right calf tenderness.
She underwent bilateral lower extremity duplexes that showed right lower extremity DVT and left superficial femoral thrombosis.
She was found to be C. difficile positive.
# IV infiltrate in right forearm: IV infiltrated into the right forearm while giving 500cc of D5W for hypoglycemia on [**6-6**].
# Mental status change: She appeared upset and cantankerous, which was changed from her baseline mental status.
# Depression: Chronic.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Chronic.
# Hyperlipidemia: Chronic.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Americare at Home Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  Lower GI Bleed, Deep Vein thrombosis, Clostridium difficle Secondary:  DM2, CKD (chronic kidney disease) stage 4, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the ICU for a GI bleed.
On colonoscopy, you were found to have a bleeding diverticulum and it was successfully clipped.
On the medical floor, you were found to have an old blood clot in your right leg, and a new blood clot in one of the surface veins of your left leg.
We stopped the heparin drip, and your bleeding continued.
You went to angiogram to look for the source of the bleed, but no active bleeding was found.
While you were at angiogram, you had a temporary fiter placed in the vein going to your heart to prevent the flow of blood clots to your lungs.
During your hospital course, you developed some diarrhea, and were found to have an infection called Clostridium difficile.
You also developed some right hip pain while in the hospital.
