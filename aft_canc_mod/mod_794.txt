HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old white female with recent new upper lobe mass in the left lung, liver masses, as well as spine metastases seen on the recent MRI.
She had several weeks of severe low back pain associated with bilateral lower extremity weakness, left greater than right.
She also complained of left shoulder weakness and numbness.
She denied any GU or GI incontinence.
She was referred for an MRI by her PCP and was found to have multiple vertebral metastases.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for chronic shortness of breath times the past two months.
No bright red blood per rectum or melena.
The patient does have a decreased appetite, no abdominal pain, no chest pain.
Status post phyllodes tumor with a wide excision in [**2186**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for a family history of lung cancer in her father.
General:  The patient was a pleasant female in no acute distress.
Lungs:  The lungs were with diffuse wheezing bilaterally.
Extremities:  With no edema, clubbing, or cyanosis.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient is a 54-year-old female with a left upper lobe lung mass with multiple liver and bony metastases in the spine seen by imaging studies over the last month.
The ultimate diagnosis of small cell lung cancer was made and the patient had been treated with cisplatin and etoposide.
The CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at this time showed a new large mass in the left upper lobe of the lung concerning for lung cancer.
There were multiple liver masses concerning for metastatic disease.
There was also a precarinal lymph node measuring 13 mm.
The patient also had an MR of the cervical lumbar spine.
The MR of the cervical and lumbar spine dated [**2191-2-6**] were notable for diffuse marrow signal abnormalities, indicative of marrow hypoplasia or infiltrative processes.
Focal signal abnormalities involving L1, L3, and L4 vertebra were seen consistent with metastatic disease.
Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine lesion were noted as well.
This was a limited examination but on a sagittal T2 weighted images of the cervical area, there were no foci or abnormal signal intensities in these regions.
The bone marrow biopsy showed that the aspirate was almost entirely infiltrated with neoplastic cells with high nucleocytoplasmic ratio.
The biopsy slides also showed marrow packed with approximately 90% of the trabecular space infiltrated by malignant cells showing scant amount of cytoplasm.
By immunohistochemistry, the cells were diffusely positive for pankeratin and exhibit extremely weak diffuse immunoreactivity for synaptophysin.
They were negative for chromogranin.
The remaining of the 10% of the space had positive cellularity of 80% with trilineage hematopoiesis and increased M:E ratio.
Finally, of note, the patient had her left upper lobe lung biopsy which showed cells consistent with small cell carcinoma.
The corresponding bronchial washings obtained with the biopsy were positive for malignant cells consistent with small cell carcinoma.
The cells were positive for cytokeratin, very rare tumor cells were positive for chromogranin.
Since the treatment with the chemotherapy, the patient had afterwards become neutropenic with white blood cell count of approximately 0.3.
She also had platelet transfusion for low platelets as well.
PULMONARY:  The patient, during her hospital course, presented with a left upper lobe nodule.
During the hospital course, she had episodes of desaturation and hypoxia.
She had a CT angiogram at that time which revealed no evidence of PE; however, the study was somewhat limited due to motion artifact.
In addition, the CT angio revealed a large left upper lobe mass and hilar adenopathy which had been seen on previous CTs.
The mass almost surrounded the left pulmonary artery, nearly compressing it.
In addition, on the CT, there were new patchy bilateral opacities predominantly in the upper lung zones.
The left upper trunk was noted to be occluded with an overlying mucosal abnormality and the lower trunk was significantly narrowed, probably due to extrinsic compression.
To the lower trunk was an additional abnormal white nodular area.
Following the brushing, there was significant bleeding with rapid clot formation of that nodule.
A repeat bronchoscopy showed complete obstruction of the left main stem bronchus with multiple clots.
These clots were resectioning the mass completely and included the left upper lobe bronchus.
Since then, the patient had been noted to have an increase in shortness of breath and increasing tachypnea with 02 saturations decreasing to the mid 80s on 6 liters which had improved on nonrebreather.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed partial clot to the left upper lobe and interstitial involvement of the right lung field.
The patient had been transferred to the MICU for further evaluation of her respiratory status.
The patient's respiratory status had improved with continuing her treatment of the pneumonia as well as some diuresis.
The echocardiogram had a left ventricular systolic function low normal at 50-55%, mild 1+ aortic regurgitation, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with this study.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient is a 54-year-old female who presented during this hospital course on her second day with increasing shortness of breath and new upper lobe infiltrates seen on CT.
The infiltrates showed that there were patchy bilateral infiltrates, predominantly in the upper lung zones.
There may have been a pulmonary edema; however, given that the patient spiked a fever at this time, the development of the pulmonary infiltrates had developed, she had been started on levofloxacin and clindamycin for a ten day course for treatment of a potential aspiration pneumonia.
Otherwise, during this hospital course, the patient's infectious disease status had been notable for the development of herpetic lesions which have been on her lower back.
The patient has had these lesions in the past.
She had been started on Valtrex for these lesions.
The patient had developed thrush in her mouth and had been started on fluconazole for the thrush.
After the patient had completed her treatment course with levofloxacin and clindamycin for the pneumonia, she developed a fever to 102.1 on [**2191-2-18**] in the evening.
At this time, the patient had been neutropenic with a white blood cell count of 0.3.
For febrile neutropenia, she had been started on cefepime and Flagyl for coverage of febrile neutropenia.
At this time, the patient had significant diarrhea associated with this.
A chest x-ray at this time revealed the persistent left hilar mass with collapse of the left upper lobe; however, the remainder of the lung fields were well aerated and the opacities previously seen on the right side were not observed and there was interval improvement of the pleural effusion on the left side.
