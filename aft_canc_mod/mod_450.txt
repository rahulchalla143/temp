#Iron deficiency anemia due most probably to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient was found to have a hematocrit of 17 and was noted to have ST depression on EKG that resolved with transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells.
Labs were notable for iron deficiency.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and anemia remained stable after red cell transfusions.
The patient was seen by GI and had an upper endoscopy and colonscopy which could not identify a source of bleeding, but colonoscopy had poor prep.
She has had trouble with hyperkalemia in the past and lisinopril has been reduced in the past.
#Probable CAD: Patient had ST depressions with hematocrit of 17 that resolved with transfusion of red cells to hematocrit of 27.
She was on aspirin and statin at home per report, but aspirin was held in the setting of chronic blood loss anemia.
#Atrial fibrillation: Patient was noted to have asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal, up to rate of 150s-160s without hemodynamic effect.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by hypoglycemia: Patient recently had NPH reduced for hypoglycemia.
#Congitive impairment/Social: Patient was noted to have significant cognitive impairment and the patient's daughter noted that there was often discrepancy between the patient's glucometer readings and her log.
She may also benefit from outpatient cardiac ischemia workup.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia, Iron deficiency, chronic blood loss Coronary Artery Disease COPD exacerbation Diabetes Mellitus, type 2 Chronic Kidney Disease, stage IV Hyperkalemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were referred to the hospital for evaluation of anemia and hyperkalemia in addition to treatment of your COPD.
You were seen by the Gastroenterology team and had an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy to evaluate for cause of GI bleeding.
Your upper endoscopy did not show evidence of bleeding but did show abnormalities.
Additionally, your colonoscopy did not show evidence of bleeding but you had a poor prep.
Additionally, when your blood counts were low you had EKG changes which suggest possible underlying coronary artery disease.
She will also likely order you for a stress test once your bleeding is worked up completely.
