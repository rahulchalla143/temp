Field of view: 36  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old woman with hx of Paget's dz of rectum, chronic incontinence now with no stool output past 3days.
INDICATION: 76-year-old female with history of Paget's disease of the rectum and chronic incontinence.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No pulmonary nodules, opacities or pleural effusions are present at the lung bases.
There are extensive coronary artery calcifications.

Extensive gas and stool is seen within mildly dilated loops of large bowel.
There is no evidence of bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis or intraperitoneal air.
There is extensive atherosclerosis involving the abdominal aorta and its branches.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are pathologically enlarged.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A large amount of stool and air is seen within the sigmoid colon with mild wall thickening.
Extensive soft tissue density is seen in the region of the rectum without evidence of rectal stool or air.
Several suture lines are seen within the lower pelvis.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
There are several borderline enlarged left inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
There are significant degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine.

Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2199-7-7**]   *** Not Signed Out ***  BRIEF HISTORY: 76 yo female with history of rectal cancer and hypertension who presented to the hospital with rectal obstruction.
She underwent  diverting colostomy and in the PACU developed mild hypotension and and was noted to have new STE V1-V3 on ECG.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had moderate diffuse disease throughout.
The LCX had a 50-60% stenosis in the mid vessel and the RCA was totally occluded in after the marginal branch and filled via left to right collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal filling pressures and a preserved cardiac index.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-7-7**] 2:35 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o Pulmonary edema, EKG changes  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old woman POD 1 with EKG changes REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o Pulmonary edema, EKG changes PORTABLE CHEST [**2199-7-7**] AT 02:44  INDICATION: EKG changes postop.
FINDINGS: Again seen is an elevated right hemidiaphragm.
Since the prior study, there is subsegmental left basilar atelectasis but otherwise no evidence for new infiltrate and no evidence for interval development of CHF.
No significant interval change versus prior.
That same day, she underwent a diverting colostomy for anal stricture due to Paget's disease of the anus.
In the PACU, post-op, she had low urine output, for which she received a total of 2 L of bolused fluids.
Ms. [**Known lastname 17832**] was then taken to the catheterization suite, where she was diagnosed with a complete right coronary artery occlusion with collateralization and a mid- to high-grade occlusion of the left circumflex artery.
On hospital day 7, she experienced one bout of nausea with vomiting.
On hospital day 8, she was tolerating a regular diet, she had passed much of the residual stool in her colon, and her incision appeared clean, dry and intact.
