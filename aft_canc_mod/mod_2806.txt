Right anterior and left intrahepatic biliary tree obstruction and peripheral enhancement are features seen as well as tumor thrombus in the right portal vein and fat content within the lesion, as well as elevated AFP lead to concern for mixed-type hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma.

Samples from both drains were obtained for culture/sensitivity/gram stain  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-13**] 10:31 PM  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a right upper quadrant drain.
The extent of the right pleural effusion has minimally increased, as has the atelectasis at the right lung bases.
In particular, there is no evidence for pneumonia.
Crowding of the vascular structures in the perihilar areas is caused by a decrease in lung volumes.
Bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged on the left and may be slightly decreased on the right due to interval insertion of the pigtail catheter.
Minimal pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax is seen  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-15**] 7:39 AM As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase of the right pleural effusion.

No evidence of right pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-6-15**] 10:30 AM  As compared to the previous image, there is a mild increase in extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of a right pneumothorax.
Minimal increase in extent of a left retrocardiac atelectasis.
Unchanged right-sided pigtail catheter without evidence of the right pneumothorax.
Unchanged minimal left pleural effusion.

The extent of the right pre-existing pleural effusion is constant.
Today's radiograph shows evidence of minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, suggesting the presence of a left pleural effusion.
Moreover, there is increasing opacity at the bases of the right upper lobe, concerning for developing pneumonia.
No evidence of right pneumothorax.
No evidence of pneumonia.
There is no stone, hydronephrosis or suspicious renal mass.
The bladder is moderately distended and appears normal.
Moderate cardiomegaly, moderate retrocardiac atelectasis  BILIARY CATH CHECK Study Date of [**2119-6-20**] 1:26 PM 1.
Further intervention including ballon dilation and possible extension of the stent may be performed under appropriate anesthesia prior to removal of the biliary catheter.
There does remain leakage along the catheter track and at the time of catheter removal, the track may be embolized.
Balloon plasty and stenting of left biliary stricture.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo male with HCV and recent imaging studies concerning for HCC vs CC vs combination, s/p IR guided biliary drainage and PTC drain placement, presenting with hemoperitoneum and distended abdomen.
Active Issues:  # Liver mass (HCC vs CC): IR guided procedure was performed [**2119-6-8**] without issue.
Specimens were sent for cytology brushings.
He was taken back to the OR for postop cholangiogram and both drains were found to be in place.
The cultures were subsequently positive for Klebsiella and Enterobacter.
Upon discharge he was w/o abdominal pain, his abdomen was soft / non distended and he was tolerating oral nutrition.
#Septic shock: Two days postop on the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name 679**] service, the patient was in mild abdominal pain and found to have features of SIRS (WBC 21, temp 99.2, HR 110s) and modest rise in LFTs.
He was found to have worsening abdominal distension and SBO with hemoperitoneum on imaging.
However, he continued to be tachycardic with low grade temps.
He was taken for repeat cholangiogram, drain placement verified and bile sampled for culture.
Cultures of the bile and pleural fluid grew Klebsiella and Enterobacter resistant to Unasyn and Zosyn.
1 blood culture grew GP rods which they were unable to speciate due to loss of viability.
Sensitivities to Ertapenem were obtained and showed the bacteria to be susceptible to this medication.
#Pleural Effusion: The pt developed a new oxygen requirement on the floor.
Repeat CXR showed a R sided pleural effusion which was tapped by interventional pulmonology.
This was believed to be a complication from biliary drain placement.
The patient was noted to have a new right-sided pleural effusion after PTC placement in the biliary system.
He underwent PTC placement in the right pleural effusion for drainage, approximately 600cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.
The patient's pleural effusion was noted to be bilious with growth of Gram negative rods.
The patient acutely developed hypoxia, rigors, and tachycardia during which blood cultures were drawn.
Because of the patient's bilious effusions and concern for tracking of the biliary system into the pleural space, the patient was taken back to the IR [**2119-6-16**].
There were no complications of the procedure.
The patient remained afebrile through his ICU course.
Pain was managed with scheduled APAP 500 mg q6hours and standing oxycodone 5mg q6hours.
The patient's serum creatinine was noted to be elevated on his last day in the ICU, in part due to pre-renal causes (poor po intake) and possible contrast-induced nephropathy in light of multiple IR-take backs.
The patient's white count was acutely elevated and he was re cultured.
The patient was transferred to the floor for continued work-up/management of his biliary drains, bilious effusion, leukocytosis, [**Last Name (un) **], and known infections in the bile and pulmonary effusion.
