His initial presention was in late [**2173**] with hip pain from bone mets, and has been tried on pamidronate/lupron, bicalutamide, ketoconazole and ydrocortisone, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and most recently zometa/lupron q12wk and samarium ([**12-4**], [**12-12**]).
He has chronic pain between his shoulder blades, on his lateral ribs, and his right pelvis/hip for which he requires chronic narcotic pain medications.
He was feeling fine until early [**2176-12-17**] when he had fecal impaction requiring hospitalization from [**2176-12-18**] to [**2176-12-20**].
He does note that he feels less muscle control, but but he denies any loss of bowel continence.
With regards to urinary retention, he has had chronic issues with urinary hesitancy from his prostate disease, but he has never had urinary retention.
On the day he presented to St. [**Doctor Last Name 11042**], he had urinary retention requiring foley placement, but after disimpaction this resolved.
Also, when he coughs he has noticed pain radiating down his back to his legs as well as his scapula.
He has noticed left buttock numbness for the past week and bilateral foot paresthesias for the past 4 days.
Also has noticed subjective weight loss since eating less (he was told to start with liquids and advance his diet as tolerated, and he has been hesitant to do so in light of his recent fecal impaction).
HEENT: No headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
CV: No chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
PULM: No cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
No hematochezia or melena.
MSK:  No myalgias.
DERM: No rashes or skin breakdown.
Other Past Medical History: -reconstructed eardrum due to chronic ear infections -chronic constipation (on narcotic pain meds), s/p fecal impaction requiring hospitalization at St Josephs in [**12/2176**]  Social History: He was smoking until last week; he has smoked 1-2 packs a day since the age of 20.
He and his wife had one son, who died in a car accident at the age of 16, the same year as the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Family History: Significant for lymphoma in his mother and thyroid cancer in his father, who died at age 47 and had disease in his lymph nodes, thyroid and bone.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: BS+, soft, NT, no rebound/guarding, no suprapubic fullness or tenderness Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: CNs II-XII intact.
Interval development of metastasis involving the T4 vertebral body with epidural extension and high-grade spinal canal narrowing with spinal cord edema.
Interval worsening of metastatic involvement extending from T7 through T11 with new epidural extension and moderate-to-severe spinal canal narrowing.
Abnormal cord signal is difficult to assess at these levels secondary to technical factors.
Interval progression of lumbosacrsal and iliac bone metastatic disease with no evidence of high-grade spinal canal narrowing or epidural involvement in the lumbar spine.
CT THORACIS SPINE [**2176-12-25**] [final report pending]  Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname 8214**] is a 50y/o gentleman with end-stage castrate-resistant prostate cancer refractory to treatment who was admitted from clinic with saddle hemianesthesia, intermittent urinary retention, and radicular pain with strain that were concerning for cord compression/cauda equina syndrome.
MRI showed evidence of cord compression; Neurosurgery was been consulted and he underwent T4 laminectomy and T1-7 fusion.
Cord compression: MRI showed new lesion at T4 and mild canal compromise at T10, which was causing spinal canal stenosis and foraminal stenosis.
He has not had bowel incontinence, and his urinary retention last week resolved after disimpaction but overall, his saddle hemianesthesia, intermittent urinary retention, and radicular pain with strain were concerning.
His surgical site pain was somewhat difficult to control and he was started on a dilaudid PCA on [**12-28**] with good result.
he ambulated well with PT and pain was controlled with oral meds.
Metastatic Prostate cancer: poor prognosis overall.
He has extensive bony mets and has not responded well to multiple chemotherapies.
He does feel symptomatic relief in his pain since the Samarium.
Chronic constipation: in the setting of chronic opiate medication use.
He was continued on an aggressive bowel regimen (senna, colace, miralax, lactulose) and had no issues with constipation or excessive loose stools.
In addition, he is chronically ill and likely has anemia of inflammation.
He was guaiac negative and has been constipated, so GI loss is possible but less likely.
His iron studies do not suggest iron deficiency; his anemia is most likely due to recent chemo/samarium.
