Brief Hospital Course: This patient is a 67 year old female with NHL s/p CHOP, MDS, Hep C, recently diagnosed afib [**6-12**] transfered to MICU for hypoxia on floor accompanied by [**Month/Year (2) 5162**], frequent episodes of afib with RVR, also hypotension originally thought to be consistent with sepsis.
1)SIRS/ Sepsis: Patient had episodes of  fever and hypotension (during tachycardia and not during tachycardia), lactate 1.5, temp most likely related to pna -patient placed on vanco, levo, flagyl  originally- changed to vanc and zosyn since patient continued to spike [**Month/Year (2) 5162**].
Plan was to consider tap of pleural effusion if patient remained febrile.
The though was that patients underlying MDS and ?functional neutropenia was impairing her ability to clear her pna.
2) Hypoxia:  Unclear how hypoxic patient was while on the floor, but likelyw as due to pna and tachycardia.
was on a 6.0 liter nc in the unit  3) Hypotension: related to her underlying infection and afib with rvr  4) CV: patient had intermittent episodes of afib with rvr, responded well to lopressor but difficult situation given her low bp.
We attemped to use PO metoprolo for rate control.
Patient was not being anticoagulated as she is a fall risk and platelets very low with high inr.
Echo with mild sysytolic dysfuction, likely with some doastolic dysfuction.
5) Anemia/ thrombocytopenia: heme onc thinks this was a manifestation of MDS in setting of being infected, no evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear  6) Elevated bili: workup with RUQ and HIDA scan was been negative ------  Patient resp and clinical status continued to decline.
She became septic and hypotensive on three pressors.
