Admission Date: [**2141-1-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2141-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-3-25**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ms. [**Known lastname 84593**] is a 67-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, admitted today to begin cycle 1, week 1, high-dose IL-2 therapy.
Her oncologic history began in [**2134**], after she underwent an MRI to evaluate back pain was incidentally found to have a left kidney mass.
A small liver lesion was noted during her yearly followup CT scans for which she underwent an ultrasound which did not reveal metastatic disease.
During an annual mammogram on [**2140-7-8**], she was discovered to have a new density in her right breast.
An ultrasound guided biopsy of this mass was performed on [**2140-8-11**], and pathology revealed the presence of an invasive carcinoma with clear cell features concerning for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PET CT performed on [**2140-8-26**], showed the presence of a lesion in the medial right hepatic lobe, worrisome for a growing neoplasm.
An additional low attenuation lesion on the lateral right hepatic lobe was also seen.
No liver lesion was biopsied on [**2140-9-12**], with pathology consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
She underwent right partial mastectomy with pathology from the breast and a repeat liver biopsy confirming metastatic kidney cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing female, no acute distress.
Moist oral mucosa with areas of erythema on her bilateral lower mandible.
No cervical, supraclavicular or bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
ABDOMEN:  Rounded, soft, nontender, no HSM or masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
Side effects during this week included diarrhea improved with antiemetic therapy; mild nausea improved with Ativan; an erythematous pruritic skin rash; mucositis and fatigue.
On treatment day #5, after her 10th dose of IL-2, she became hypotensive and was placed on dopamine to a max of 6 mcg per kilogram per minute.
She initially stabilized with blood pressure in the high 90 to low 100s, and then again developed hypotension to the 70-80 range with additional IV fluids given.
She was hypoxic to the 80s requiring non-rebreather, and there was concern for pulmonary edema given recent IL-2 dosing, capillary leak and fluid boluses.
She was also noted to be lethargic with difficulty staying awake.
She was transferred to the unit where she improved from a mental status perspective.
She had no further hypotension throughout her hospitalization.
During this week she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.3 improved to 2.9 at the time of discharge.
She had associated oliguria and metabolic acidosis with a minimum bicarb of 18 improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
During this week she developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 55 and a peak AST of 71, both improved at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 3.2, improved to 1.9 at the time of discharge.
She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of 103,000 without evidence of bleeding.
She had no coagulopathy or myocarditis noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - status post cycle 1, week 1, high-dose IL-2 complicated by shock, pulmonary edema and acute renal failure.
fever or pain, Zantac 150 mg p.o.
