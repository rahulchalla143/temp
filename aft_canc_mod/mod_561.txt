Her neurological problem began one year ago with vertex headache.
It was worsened by cough but not change in body position.
In Mid-[**2137-2-7**], her headache was severe and her primary care physician sent her to the ER at [**Hospital6 2561**] and a head MRI showed a dura-based mass in the left cerebellum.
Past Medical History: She has bilateral breast cancer (DCIS in the right breast and breast carcinoma in the left breast).
Rare etoh   Family History: FH: Mother had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] CA, grandmother had breast cancer at age [**Age over 90 **]   Physical Exam: On Discharge: AOx3, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus.

Right frontal extra- axial collection, likely subdural is present extending towards the vertex.
Pneumocephalus overlies the frontal lobes bilaterally, and is present within the surgical bed.
Edema around the surgical bed is unchanged in comparison to prior study.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Soft tissue swelling and subcutaneous emphysema is present in the left temporoparietal region.
Post-Resection MRI of Head: FINDINGS: There is a new left suboccipital craniectomy.
The left extra-axial posterior fossa mass has been resected.
There is no evidence of contrast enhancement beyond the area of the blood products on the postcontrast T1-weighted images to suggest residual tumor.
There is unchanged compression of the fourth ventricle and unchanged mass effect on the midbrain.
There are small bilateral subdural collections along the convexities, falx, and the tentorium, as seen on the preceding CT scan.
There is a punctate focus of high signal on the diffusion-weighted images in the right superior frontal parasagittal cortex (series 502, image 23), without a definite corresponding signal abnormality on the ADC map.
It is not clear whether this represents a small acute embolic infarction or an artifact.
Head CT [**3-4**]: FINDINGS: There is little change, s/p left suboccipital craniectomy, with minimal to no decrease in blood products within the surgical bed.
Subdural blood layering along the left tentorium demonstrates slight decrease.
Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter is in stable position without hydrocephalus.
There is slight decrease in overall amount of pneumocephalus.
Minimal decrease in tiny right subdural hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was electively admitted on [**3-1**] for suboccipital crani for mass resection.
Post-operatively she was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and managment of her external ventricular drain.
On [**3-2**], postoperative labs revealed a low platelet count of 83.
Postoperative course was significant for nausea and incisional pain.
Her pain medications were adjusted and an antispasmodic added, with relief of nausea, and better pain control.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-16**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
