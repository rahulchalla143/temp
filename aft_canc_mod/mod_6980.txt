HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS;  The patient is a 77 year old female, who presented with six to seven weeks of severe right knee pain and warmth.
She notes chills, no fevers or rigors.
She has noted decreased ambulation secondary to pain.
A repeat x-ray was taken [**2195-11-23**], with a small effusion noted.
Laboratories were drawn at that time with blood cultures, the blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains, in two separate bottles.
Of note, the patient had developed a heart rate to the 140s, noted to be atrial flutter.
Upon initiation of Dopamine drip, she returned into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response to the 170s.
The patient continued to have episodes of atrial flutter requiring Diltiazem boluses intravenously as needed, however, she had a tendency to drop her blood pressure with this medication.
After successfully weaning the Neo-Synephrine, the patient had another episode of hypotension requiring reinitiation of Neo-Synephrine.
On [**2195-11-26**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102 degrees Fahrenheit and was pancultured.
At that time, the patient also experienced oxygen desaturation.
A chest x-ray was performed which was consistent with congestive heart failure.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no vegetation of the valves, and left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 65%, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
The patient's Theophylline was discontinued secondary to her continued episodes of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and this medication's likely erythrogenic potential.
On [**2195-11-27**], the patient had two more episodes of supraventricular tachycardia of which she was asymptomatic with no decrease in her blood pressure.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was eventually performed to rule out valvular endocarditis which was significant for a vegetation demonstrated of her native aortic valve.
On [**2195-11-27**], the patient was transferred to the medical floor and upon arrival was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response to the 140s.
She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, radiating pains or light-headedness upon arrival.
In general, an elderly female in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Neck - no jugular venous distention appreciated.
Cardiovascular - irregular, tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur appreciated at the right upper sternal border.
No rubs appreciated.
Extremities - no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
The right knee was without erythema but was noted to be warmer than the left knee.
Right knee, three views, plain films obtained [**2195-11-23**], which demonstrated small joint effusion, no fracture was identified.
A portable chest x-ray on [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated no radiographic evidence of acute pulmonary or cardiac disease processes.
A chest x-ray on [**2195-11-29**], demonstrated small pleural effusions bilaterally, unchanged from the prior radiograph.
CT angiogram on [**2195-12-2**], was preliminarily negative for pulmonary embolus.
There were noted to be atelectatic changes in the bases of the lungs bilaterally.
The pleural effusions noted on chest x-ray were also evident.
Microbiology - Joint fluid from [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no microorganisms seen on gram stain.
The fluid culture resulted in no growth.
The joint fluid analysis demonstrated 5,480 white blood cells, 945 red blood cells, 94 polys, 4 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes and no joint crystals.
Electrocardiogram on [**2195-11-25**], demonstrated recurrent supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid rate of 171.
Slight ST segment depression leads V3 through V4, raising the possibility of rate related ischemia.
Electrocardiogram performed on [**2195-11-27**], demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with occasional ventricular premature beats.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2195-11-26**], demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, and physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.
There were no valvular vegetations demonstrated.
No valve abscess was seen.
Moderate aortic regurgitation was demonstrated.
Electrocardiogram performed on [**2195-11-30**], demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
There was low limb lead voltage.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Status post right total knee replacement [**2191-4-25**], secondary to osteoarthritis.
Peptic ulcer disease in [**2173**].
Coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 77 year old female with Strept variant bacteremia, endocarditis involving aortic valve, infectious source likely the right knee, who was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit after requiring short term use of pressors secondary to hypotension.
Hypotension was likely secondary to sepsis.
Her Medical Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by episodes of supraventricular tachycardia requiring intravenous Diltiazem.
The patient was transferred to the medical floor for continued intravenous antibiotic administration, treatment of her arrhythmia, and transition to an acute care rehabilitation facility.
The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response in the Medical Intensive Care Unit as well as on the medical floor.
When she arrived to the medical floor in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, 25 mg of intravenous Diltiazem was required to convert the patient into normal sinus rhythm.
The patient remained on telemetry which demonstrated several more episodes of this supraventricular tachycardia.
Telemetry demonstrated that she tolerated this dose well with no episodes of atrial fibrillation.
The patient was initially on an ace inhibitor on admission, however this medication had been held secondary to her low blood pressure.
Infectious disease - The patient was originally referred to the Emergency Department for blood cultures positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and chains.
An infectious disease consultation was obtained and this service felt that the likely source for this organism was the right prosthetic knee joint.
The patient remained afebrile from [**2195-11-29**], through the time of dictation.
A repeat echocardiogram should be considered to check for valvular vegetations at this time as well.
Pulmonary - The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Her inhalers were continued throughout the admission, however, the [**Last Name (un) **]-DUR was discontinued secondary to its erythrogenic potential.
Prior to discharge, her oxygen requirements had slightly increased from three liters per nasal cannula to four liters nasal cannula.
There were two episodes where the patient became acutely short of breath.
With each occurrence, she felt prompt relief after using her Atrovent and Albuterol MDI.
A chest x-ray was obtained on [**2195-11-30**], which was not significant for congestive heart failure or infiltrates.
Considering her chest x-ray and clinical examination is somewhat consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure as the etiology for the increasing oxygen requirement, a CT angiogram of the chest was obtained on [**2195-12-2**].
Preliminary report from this study resulted in no evidence of pulmonary thrombi.
Bilateral basilar atelectatic changes were demonstrated although small pleural effusion was also noted.
The patient's hypoxia may be related to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and will require continued maintenance and rescue inhalers, nebulizers as needed.
There should be a low threshold for obtaining a repeat echocardiogram if she becomes short of breath and a chest x-ray is consistent with congestive heart failure to rule out valvular dysfunction.
It is unclear why she had anemia as her baseline hematocrit was 41.9 on [**2195-6-30**].
Hemolysis laboratories were negative.
Secondary to the patient's history of coronary artery disease, the threshold for transfusion is hematocrit of less than 28.0.
Sepsis-Streptococcus nutritional variant.
Atrial fibrillation.
Endocarditis-aortic valve native.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Right knee prosthesis.
She will need an evaluation of her right knee at that time to determine persistent effusions and a repeat tap of that knee will be decided at that time.
She will also require a repeat echocardiogram after the antibiotics have completed to check for persistent valvular vegetation and valvular dysfunction.
