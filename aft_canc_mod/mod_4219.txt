The patient reported the onset of a gradual right-sided back pain that radiates to her lateral hip and down her anterior thigh to just below the knee.
She denied any weakness, numbness or saddle anesthesia.
She went to an urgent care clinic approximately one week ago for dysuria and was started on Bactrim for a UTI.
During that visit she was also referred to a spine specialist who ordered an lumbar MRI that was performed the day prior to admission and demonstrated a large midline lumbar mass centered around L3.
On presentation, the patient acknowledged a lesion on her left breast that had been present for at least six months.
She further reported intermittent fevers as well as an unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 pounds over the last two months.
Smoking: 25 pack-year history, stopped 2 months prior to admission 3.
Family History: Sister with skin cancer but no other family history of cancer.

No previous tracing available for comparison.
CXR ([**11-24**]): No acute intrathoracic process.
If metastatic disease is a concern, then a CT is recommended for further evaluation.
No pathologic fracture, epidural mass or spinal cord compression.
Large, necrotic left breast mass with associated left axillary lymphadenopathy, as described above.
Diffuse metastatic disease involving the liver and lungs.
Multiple osseous metastases as described above, including a large soft tissue mass involving the L2 through L5 posterior elements, with encroachment on the spinal canal.
Additional areas of heterogeneity are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
These findings are better evaluated on the comparison MR of the thoracic spine, which does demonstrate evidence of metastatic disease throughout these levels.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2100-11-24**] no diagnostic interval change.
The mediastinum is slightly widened due to lymphadenopathy, better seen in prior CT performed a day earlier.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the right side.
New right perihilar and bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, most likely correspond to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but given the asymmetry, aspiration is also a possibility.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR ([**11-29**]): Interval decrease in right-sided pulmonary edema with residual small right pleural effusion.
Compared to CXRAY on [**11-29**], right mid and lower lung zone opacity has nearly resolved consistent with resolved asymmetric pulmonary edema.
There is no new focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
The remainder of the examination is unchanged without an acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Urine culture ([**12-7**]): Repeat urine culture after 9 days on Ciprofloxacin for complicated UTI, culture shows no growth.

Necrotic Breast Mass and Lumbar Mass: Patient reported appearance of left breast mass approximately six months prior to presentation with development of low back pain approximately four months later (two months prior to presentation).
Patient's presenting complaint was low back pain.
Examination revealed a large necrotic left breast mass with left axillary lymphadenopathy, a large midline lumbar mass and some proximal lower extremity weakness, left greater than right, but no other significant neurological deficits.
Spine MRI revealed bony metastasis in T4, T5 and T6 vertebral bodies as well as in T10 vertebra but no pathologic fracture, epidural mass or spinal cord compression.
CT torso revealed diffusely metastatic disease involving the liver and lungs, thoracic spine metastases as reported in the MRI findings, as well as multiple other osseous metastases including a large soft tissue mass involving the posterior elements of L2 to L5 and greater than 50% effacement of the spinal canal.
A left breast core needle biopsy revealed a grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma that was ER/PR +.
Patient went to the OR on [**12-2**] for spinal stabilization and on [**12-3**] for spinal mass debulking.
The patient initially had a Wound vac in place but was removed several days prior to dishcarge.
Presumed Pyelonephritis: Patient presented to urgent care clinic one week prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**] for symptoms consistent with cystitis.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient reported recent fevers to 101.5F, shaking chills, nausea, and flank pain (which was impossible to differentiate from pain due to her metastatic disease).
Patient had leukocytosis on presentation.
Despite the negative urine studies, the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin IV (Ceftriaxone was not given as patient reported penicillin allergy) for a total of a 10-day course as clinical suspicion for possible pyelonephritis was sufficiently high.
A repeat urinalysis was performed and showed no evidence of active infection so no further antibiotics were given.
Bony metastases were deemed the most likely etiology.
Calcitonin and Pamidronate were given for osteoclast inhibition.
Lasix were given when the patient subsequently developed hypoxia with CXR evidence of pulmonary edema.
The patient continued to receive IVF as needed with Lasix to prevent recurrence of volume overload.
Anemia of chronic disease (AICD) was considered the most likely etiology given the patient's underlying disease process.
Reticulocyte count 2.2 with reticulocyte index of 0.95, indicating an [**Last Name 88383**] problem consistent with her inflammatory state.
Calculated TIBC was 229, ferritin was 879, and transferrin was 176, all consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient did ultimately require transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells for surgery-related losses.
Pain control: On admission, patient complained of significant back pain and sharp, shooting pain down her right leg with movement.
Patient still felt pain was substantial.
On [**12-8**], the patient required 6 mg of IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Likely etiology of patient's constipation presumed to be her hypercalcemia.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of compressive obstruction.
5. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety or nausea.
6. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
13. hydromorphone 2 mg/mL (1 mL) Syringe Sig: 1-2 mg Intravenous Q3H as needed for breakthrough pain.

Start taking Polyethylene glycol 17 g by mouth daily as needed for constipation.
Start taking Ondansetron 4 mg by mouth every eight hours as needed for nausea.
