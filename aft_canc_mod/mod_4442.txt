Punctate and coarse calcifications in the spleen are noted.
Differential diagnosis includes splenic infarct vs. small perisplenic hematoma.
Left tenth rib fracture and comminuted right mid clavicle fracture, as described above.
Multiple hypodense lesions within the pancreas, differential includes IPMN or other neoplasm.
Prominent endometrium measuring up to 1.0 cm.
Multiple thyroid hypodensities which can be further evaluated on ultrasound.
111/30/09 Head CT : Small left superior parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, stable to slightly increased when compared to prior exam.
A smaller intraparenchymal component of the hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
No evidence of new hemorrhage identified.
No acute cervical spine fracture seen.
Multilevel degenerative changes which cause focal canal narrowing, as above, which increases the risk for spinal cord injury.
If high clinical concern, MRI is more sensitive for spinal cord or ligamentous injury.
Stable focal area of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci of the upper left posterior frontal lobe.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is unlikely given the appearance and lack of surrounding parenchymal edema.
No new hemorrhage.
Scalp swelling at the vertex seen on the lateral scout view is more pronounced on today's study.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 4145**] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency Room then admitted to the Trauma ICU for frequent neurologic checks and serial hematocrits.
She remained hemodynamically stable, had no neurologic deficits and a stable hematocrit.
The Neurosurgery service was consulted in light of her SAH and a repeat head CT was done on [**2160-11-4**] which showed no interval change in the small left parietal SAH.
Her hematocrit was stable at 27 and she was able ambulate and carry out her ADL's without tachycardia.

Of note, on her initial Abdominal CT there were cystic lesions in the pancreas which were suspicious for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm or some type of neoplasm.
