Harvesting of intercostal muscle and buttressing of bronchial staple line with intercostal muscle.
History of Present Illness: 50y F initially presenting in [**2105-1-18**] w/ a single episode of hemoptysis, bronchoscopy was performed that demonstrated no gross lesions but cytology showed some atypical cells.
Upon subsequent follow-up in [**2105-9-20**] a repeat bronchocsopy was performed, cytology consistent w/ non-small cell carcinoma.
She has no current complaints of cough, hemoptysis, or weight loss, but does relay some recent hx of night sweats.
Her history is significant for Hodgkins lymphoma s/p staging laparotomy, splenectomy w/ no evidence of infradiaphgramatic disease, s/p radiation as well as a short course of chemotherapy.
There has been no evidence of recurrent lymphoma to date.
Family History: lymphoma in a cousin; otherwise unremarkable  Physical Exam: Discharge day exam:  VS 98.5  98.2  92  110/76  18  97RA Gen: awake, alert, NAD CV: RRR Chest: CTAB, incision sites clean/dry; chest tube site with moderate serosanguinous drainage, non-erythematous skin Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended Ext: WWP, no edema or cyanosis   Pertinent Results: [**2105-12-2**] - Chest x-ray: In comparison with study of [**11-25**], there are now two right chest tubes in place following surgery.
Although difficult to visualize, there appears to be a pleural line on the right, consistent with a mild pneumothorax.
No evidence of collapse or consolidation.
The following information covers dates [**12-2**] - [**12-4**]:  Neuro:  Pain controlled initially with morphine / bupivacaine epidural per APS with inadequate pain control per patient.
Epidural was split to contain only bupivacaine and the patient was started on a dilaudid PCA for pain, which improved her pain control somewhat.
Her pain control did improve each subsequent hospital day with adjustments to the doses and frequency of these medications.
Attempts to wean the pressor on POD 1 were unsuccessful, likely related to high-dose bupivacaine epidural.
A CXR on POD 1 demonstrated small right pneumothorax and the chest tubes were placed back to suction.
The CXR showed slight increase in apical pneumothorax and a hydropneumothorax.
