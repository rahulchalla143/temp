Acute pancolitis extending up to the rectum is likely due to infectious process, but inflammatory causes should be considered.
Pseudomembranous colitis should be considered.
Ischemic causes are less likely due to diffuse pattern of colonic involvement.
Cholecystectomy, gastrojejunostomy and choledochojejunostomy changes without evidence of surgical complications.
Pancreatic mass is without significant change from prior [**2167-8-18**].
Multiple diffuse liver lesions are likely stable in number with slightly increase in size of the largest lesion in the right lobe.
Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Stable ectasia of the intrarenal abdominal aorta and aneurysmal changes at the bifurcation of the right common iliac artery.
CXR ([**9-11**]): No acute pulmonary process.
No free air under the diaphragm is detected.
Air is present in several dilated small bowel segments.
No free intraperitoneal air is identified.
Unclear if the small bowel dilatation represents developing small-bowel obstruction or ileus.
Abdominal XR ([**9-14**]): Nonspecific small bowel gas pattern with interval resolution of gaseous distention.
No definitive evidence of obstruction on this examination.
Air is seen in the distal colon without significant large bowel dilation.
Mild scrotal skin thickening.
Nonspecific small bowel gas pattern not suggestive of obstruction.
No evidence of free air to suggest perforation.
Lower Extremity US ([**9-20**]): No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo man with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presented with bloody diarrhea, was found to have pancolitis on CT and was C. diff toxin positive.
Abdominal CT revealed pancolitis that was most concerning for infectious colitis.
# Pancreatic/duodenal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver: Patient had previously had resection.
# Pancytopenia.
Most likely due to chemotherapy, as decrease in all cell lines.
Patient did experience some back pain following the injections.
# Pain control: Patient initially received IV Morphine for pain control.
# Right lower extremity edema: Patient presented with mild right lower extremity edema.
Several days prior to discharge the RLE was warm to the touch and mildly erythematous.
A bilateral LE ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT.
# Scrotal fullness: There was concern for possible hydrocele versus hernia.
# Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: Patient was maintained on a Humalog ISS while inpatient.
Methotrexate was held due to concern for infection and pancytopenia.

Laboratory tests revealed an infection in your colon (C. difficile colitis).
The following changes were made to your medications: -- You will need to complete another 7 days of Vancomycin (an antibiotic) 125 mg by mouth every six hours -- Stop taking your Dilaudid 2 mg tablets, [**12-20**] every four hours as needed for pain until you follow up with your outpatient gastroenterologist or hematologist -- Start taking Methadone 1 mg by mouth every eight hours a day for pain -- Start taking Morphine sulfate 5 mg by mouth every four hours as needed for breakthrough pain -- Both the Methadone and the Morphine will be increased as needed by your hospice -- Do not take the Senna or Docusate sodium for now as you have been having loose stools.
Once your diarrhea resolves, you may resume these medications (which your hospice should instruct you to do) to prevent constipation from the Metadone and Morphine  Followup Instructions: Please keep all of your outpatient appointments as described below:  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2167-9-21**] at 11:30 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 593**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2167-9-21**] at 11:30 AM With: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4912**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4913**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2167-9-21**] at 1 PM With: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 539**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10603**], RN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage                                [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 831**] MD, [**Doctor First Name 3018**]  Completed by:[**2167-9-22**
