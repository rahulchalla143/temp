Admission Date:  [**2129-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-6-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Zocor / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Biliary obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic retrograde pancreaticogram (ERCP)x 2 Endoscopic ultrasound Transjugular liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59 year old male with a history of CAD, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, Hodgkin's disease in remission, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD implant in [**2123**].
He was transferred from [**Hospital3 29818**] for possible ERCP after having an elevated TBili and RUQ ultrasound showing borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation and borderline CBD dilation 6 cm.
He was recently discharged home from rehab on [**2129-7-26**] after a one month stay following a brief hospitalization for a CHF exacerbation.
On the day he returned home, he developed severe bilateral neck pain and stiffness which prompted him to present to the [**Hospital3 2568**] ED.
The pain was constant, worsened with palpation or head movement, and not exertional.
His neck pain improved, and he was about to be discharged, but he became hypotensive with SBP down to 66/34.
There was concern for both PE and GI bleeding, so he was admitted.
Cardiology felt that his Troponin leak was due to demand ischemia.
He had several episodes of rapid Afib requiring rate control.
He did report some chest pain during one episode, and noted that he had been having intermittent chest discomfort over the last few weeks at rehab which was attributed to GERD.
Subsequent abdominal US on [**7-29**] showed borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation and CBD dilation 6.5 mm.
Abdominal CT on [**2129-7-30**] showed stranding and inflammatory changes adjacent to the pancreatic head.
He denied any abdominal pain or other GI symptoms, but did note several days of diarrhea at rehab ust before discharge which was worked up for C diff but negative.
He was treated with empiric Flagyl and Levofloxacin given the concern for colitis noted on CT.
Once in the ICU, he reported feeling fairly well with few specific complaints besides his chronic medical issues.
He reports that the neck pain that initially brought him to [**Hospital3 10959**] has completely resolved.
He has not noticed any bloody, black, or tarry stool.
He does not have any abdominal pain or recent change in bowel habits.
He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.
He has chronic lower extremity edema which he thinks is slightly increased from baseline.
He has chronic weakness of the left arm from his inclusion body myositis.

Blowing holosystolic murmur at LLSB and apex.
No rebound tenderness or guarding.
No organomegaly.
Lower extremity edema 2+ bilaterally.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position (suggestive of RV pressure overload).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Coarsened hepatic echotexture suggests underlying parenchymal disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of hepatic lesion.
Indistinct lobulated appearance of the pancreatic head may represent focal pancreatitis (correlate with labs), differential diagnosis includes cystic neoplasm such as IPMN ; correlation with prior imaging is recommended and MR may be considered if further work-up is indicated.
Enlarged right iliac lymph node with calcification consistent with treated lymphoma, thus no evidence for recurrence.
Moderate esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction  EUS ([**2129-8-3**]): Impression: EUS: Fatty pancreas, but no evidence of pancreatic mass lesion or chronic pancreatitis.
Stent in the CBD without adjacent mass seen.
Small amount of peri-gastric ascites was noted.
No cause of rising bilirubin found.
Mild canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis with focal bile duct damage and proliferation with associated neutrophils (immunostains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 are examined to better highlight biliary epithelium).
Mild mixed steatosis with focal ballooning degeneration; no intracytoplasmic hyalin seen.
Minimal lobular mixed inflammation including lymphocytes, neutrophils and rare eosinophils.
Mild sinusoidal fibrosis demonstrated with trichrome stain without portal fibrosis.
No stainable iron on iron stain.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo man with CHF, RA with hx of methotrexate, CAD, VT s/p ICD, admitted from Rehab for neck pain, found to be hypotensive, went to ICU where he was found to have anemia and CBD stricture and significant LFT abnormalities.
# Acute hepatitis with Hyperbilirubinemia/Multiple LFT abnormalities: He was noted to have an elevated conjugated bilirubin during his OSH stay, with workup showing intrahepatic ductal dilatation and a borderline dilated common bile duct.
CT abdomen showed inflammatory changes adjacent to the pancreatic head as well as abnormal wall-thickening of the ascending and proximal transverse colon which may reflect colitis.
CT scan showed "Indistinct lobulated appearance of the pancreatic head may represent focal pancreatitis (correlate with labs), differential diagnosis includes cystic neoplasm such as IPMN ; correlation with prior imaging is recommended and MR may be considered if further work-up is indicated."
ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a biliary stricture in the lower third of the CBD concerning for malignancy.
Repeat ERCP/EUS on [**8-3**] showed a patent stent and no evidence of pancreatic mass or chronic pancreatitis.
Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl had been given empirically given the colitis and biliary involvemnt, these were stoppped on [**8-3**].
MTX was held given his acute liver dysfunction; this may be restarted PRN as an outpatient.
A CT abdomen was performed, which did not show any evidence of recurrence of his lymphoma, and did not reveal an etiology of his liver dysfunction.
EUS with brushings/biopsy will be done at that time to evaluate for malignancy as etiology of the stricture.
Pathology results revealed a cholestatic injury.
The exact cause of his liver dysfunction is not completely clear but it is likely that much of his liver injury was from the biliary stricture itself, with possible contribution from drug injury, specifically from antibiotics that he received at the outside hospital.
# GI Bleeding: His Hct was reportedly 27.3 on presentation to OSH with guaiac positive stool.
Because of his NSTEMI /demand ischemia with Troponin leak, he was transfused PRBCs for a goal Hct >30 and remained stable during the remainder of his stay at the outside hospital.
His Hct on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 34.7 without evidence of frank bleeding.
ERCP showed evidence of esophagitis, which may explain the patient's anemia and guaiac positive stools.
He will need repeat outpatient EGD at some point to re-assess esophagitis.
He will also need an outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate his anemia with guaic positive stool.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was on NSAIDs and methotrexate at the time of admission to the hospital.
These were held in the setting of his acute illness.
In this setting, he developed increasing severe left hip pain; which improved with physical therapy.
# Leukocytosis: The patient was noted to have leukocytosis to 13 on [**8-15**].
The leukocytosis resolved by [**8-16**]; no etiology was found.
# Coagulopathy: He was noted to have an elevated INR 1.7-2.0 without anticoagulation.
Fibrinogen was checked given concern for a consumptive coagulopathy, but the level was high, which would not be consistent with such a process.
The cause of his coagulopathy is unclear, but the lack of response to Vitamin K suggests a synthetic defect in the liver or an acquired condition such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or factor inhibitor.
Suspect, the elevated INR was due to acute liver dysfunction.
# Metabolic Acidosis: He was noted to have a non anion gap metabolic acidosis at OSH with bicarb [**12-21**].
Subsequent ABG showed partial compensation.
The etiolology of his acidosis is unclear, as the patient denies any diarrhea or vomiting.
Medication effect or renal tubular acidosis is a possibility.
# CAD/ Demand Ischemia/ NSTEMI: He has a significant history of CAD with DES to the RCA in [**2123**].
He had several episodes of rapid Afib at OSH with mild Troponin elevation to 0.16 and to 0.36 which were thought to be from demand ischemia.
He denied any chest discomfort or palpitations during his stay.
No statin given acute hepatitis.
Patient appears to have a history of intermittent RBBB.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  He was in sinus rhythm on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] with rate ~100 bpm.
He had several episodes of AFib with RVR while at OSH leading to demand ischemia as discussed above.
Patient was intermittently in Afib w/RBBB while in the ICU, requiring IV lopressor for rate control.
He was evaluated by cardiology on [**8-3**] due to recurrence of afib with RVR.
It was decided to not anticoagulate him given the risk for GI bleeding.
# Peripehral edema- the patient developed significant edema in his lower extremities followed by his left arm.
This was likely multifactorial--he appeared to have low oncotic pressure (albumin low of 2.2) and received large amounts of IV fluids due to his low blood pressure, he also has a history of right sided heart failure.
Lasix was gradually increased in dose and frequency to [**Hospital1 **], and his edema gradually improved.
He continues to have significant edema at the time of discharge and he should continue to receive diuretics.
Renal function should also be closely monitored with his diuresis.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Nursing & Therapy Center - [**Location 1268**] ([**Location (un) 86**] Center for Rehabilitation and Sub-Acute Care)  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension Atrial fibrillation CAD with NSTEMI bile duct obstruction due to common bile duct stricture Acute hepatitis ?pancreatic head mass Anasarca/Edema  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from an outside hospital due to need for an ERCP.
You had low blood pressures at the outside hospital as well as here in the beginning of your admission; these improved as you got better.
There was a blockage of your bile duct and the ERCP team opened this area up with a stent.
They also looked at your pancreas and did not see evidence of chronic pancreatitis.
At the outside hospital you had a decrease in your red blood cell count and were found to have microscopic blood in the stool.
You underwent a liver biopsy, which showed cholestatic injury, likely due to the stricture mentioned above, perhaps with a contribution of a drug injury.
You had a lot of swelling of your legs and left arm and this was likely from all the fluids you received when your blood pressure was low.
You still have a lot of extra fluid and this will need to be removed with ongoing diuresis when you are at the rehab facility.
Followup Instructions: ** You will need to get an endoscopy and colonoscopy by your gastroenterologist for anemia with blood in your stool.
