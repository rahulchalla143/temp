female with a h/o severe PVD including AAA status post repair and stenting, and metastatic Ca of unknown primary complicated by T7 destructive lesion here in [**12-26**], s/p T3-T11 fusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] status post radiation with left pelvic metastasis, s/p XRT to chest and cervical subcutaneous soft tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer metastasis and paraneoplastic syndrome manifest with diffuse lower extremity weakness who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from her rehab for initiation of chemotherapy.
She was started on IVIG for paraneoplastic weakness during her recent admission ([**2102-4-27**] to [**2102-5-31**]) and discharged to rehab where she did not continue to receive IVIG.
She was seen in clinic today with noted growth of her neck mass with associated [**2104-7-28**] pain in right shoulder despite current pain medication regimen.
She states that other than the growth of her neck mass and associated right shoulder pain, she has no other specific complaints or concerns.
Her weakness in her lower extremities improved status post IVIG so that she can now move both feet and has some fine motor control of both hands (right-handed) as she is now able to stitch which she could not do before.
She also reports numbness of LE b/l that is unchanged since IVIG and paresthesias in UE b/l.

CT [**6-30**]:  CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Air bronchogram containing right lower lobe consolidation is not significantly changed from [**5-4**], [**2101**] examination.
Additionally, more anteriorly within the right lower lobe, a new 4-mm pulmonary ground-glass nodule is noted.
Post-radiation changes along the mediastinum bilaterally including scattered regions of ground-glass opacity and linear fibrosis are stable.
Large left infrahilar mass is grossly stable from [**5-4**] examination but significantly increased from [**2101-11-18**] examination measuring 18 x 24 mm currently and displays mass effect on the adjacent lower lobe bronchus.
No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.
14-mm right axillary enhancing node has significantly increased in size from [**Month (only) 116**] examination where it measured approximately 7 mm.
No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.
Mild coronary artery calcification and aortic calcification is again noted.
Large soft tissue lesion posterior to T1 has also increased in size from [**Month (only) 116**] examination from 33 x 52 mm to 38 x 74 mm on today's exam (3:1).
Hypoattenuating thyroid lesions are noted within the isthmus and lower lobes bilaterally.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, stomach, small bowel, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear unremarkable.
Atrophic right kidney with mild rim-enhancing normal parenchyma within the upper pole is again noted.
Prior [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] bypass including bifemoral bypass and bypass supplying the left renal artery are again noted and remain patent.
No free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified within the abdominal cavity.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: Intrapelvic bowel, uterus, and urinary bladder appear normal.
No free fluid or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present within the pelvic cavity.
Multiple small soft tissue attenuating lesions are noted within the anterior abdominal wall, increased from [**2101-10-20**] exam.
Increased mild anasarca is also noted within the surrounding soft tissues.
BONE WINDOWS: Healing left superior and inferior rami pubic fractures are again noted and there is stable appearance to osseous harvest site along the left ilium.
Extensive thoracic spine surgical spine hardware remains in position.
Enlargement of known metastatic C7-T1 posterior soft tissue lesion.
Increased size to single left axillary lymph node and increased mediastinal soft tissue surrounding the right bronchus intermedius are all worrisome for progression of disease.
The right axilla node is atypical for lung cancer and may warrant breast evaluation.
Mild mass effect on the adjacent left lower lobe bronchi.
Single new right lower lobe ground-glass pulmonary nodule, likely inflammatory or infectious, but should be followed up on subsequent exams.
In absence of response to antibiotics, a cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or post obstructive/radiation induced pneumonitis are also within the differential.
Multiple new soft tissue nodules within the anterior abdominal wall, likely related to injections.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 66 year-old female with a history of small cell lung CA, COPD, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, and paraneoplastic neurologic disorder who was initially admitted for chemotherapy and eventually transferred to the ICU on [**7-14**] for hypoxia, tachycardia, and mental status changes.
Originally, patient was going to be discharged after receiving chemotherapy and IVIG for her neurologic disorder, but had developed febrile neutropenia.
While receiving her course of antibiotics (Cefepime/Vancomycin/Metronidazole) for the neutropenia, she developed headaches in the setting of thrombocytopenia (Plt count 16).
On [**2102-7-12**], due to concern for intracranial hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, patient was ordered for transfusion.
Halfway through the transfusion, patient experienced desaturation and transfusion was stopped and labs for transfusion reaction were sent.
Chest x-ray at that time demonstrated interstitial infiltrates.
After midnight on [**7-13**], patient began experiencing increasing oxygen requirement and received 10mg IV furosemide, with a 300cc diuresis, and some improvement in her respiratory status.
She remained asymptomatic during this period, other than small amounts of hemoptysis.
At 8PM on [**7-14**], patient became febrile to 102 and tachycardic (while on Vancomycin [**7-3**], Cefepime [**7-5**], and metronidazole [**7-8**]), appeared dehydrated, and received 750cc IV fluids.
At 1:30AM on [**7-14**], the patient triggered for desaturation to 80s% with mental status changes.
She continued to have hemoptysis with progressively worsening anemia, with a hematocrit of 22.
Transfusion then was considered but was deferred due to unclear volume status, and question of possible TRALI with prior platelet transfusion.
Due to persistent hypoxia, diagnosis of PE was entertained, although thought unlikely as patient had been on low-dose fondaparinux for prophylaxis.
Patient complained of some jaw discomfort similar to her chronic angina, relieved with nitroglycerin earlier that morning.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm, normal axis and intervals, normal QRS norphology, no specific ST or T-wave changes.
CXR on transfer showed increased bilateral parenchymal interstitial markings, evolving left peri-hilar opacification, and persistent right-lower perihilar infiltrate, with no effusions.
Pt continued to be hypoxic, requiring nasal cannula and face tent,and continued to be hypotensive as well.
Details below pertain to her hospitalization prior to transfer to the ICU:  # Metastatic Ca of unknown primary and cervical subcutaneous soft tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer metastasis: Patient received carboplatin and etoposide.
# Fever - On HD#4 patient spiked a fever to 101.5.
She was asymptomatic, with exception of scant wheezes throughout.
Although temporally this was associated with Filgastrim, due to high risk of infection, patient was treated for HAP: started on Vancomycin (4), Levofloxacin(2d), then switched to Cefepime (2d) for pseudomonal coverage (days of AB on day of discharge)  to be most likely [**1-21**].
CXR from HD# 6 revealed a new left perihilar opacity, suggestive of PNA in comparison to CXR from [**5-30**].
Sputum Cx showed GPCs and GNRs.
This pain was described as soreness and improved with frequent patient repositioning to [**1-29**].
With PT and movement from OOB to chair, patient's pain had dissipated by HD#5 and she did not require prn oxycodone by HD#6.
# Lower extremity weakness/numbness - most likely [**1-21**] a paraneoplastic syndrome.
# CAD - ASA was continued at 162mg daily as were her statin, b-blocker, nitrates and ACE-I.
Nitrates changed to PM dose as transient episode of hypotension in AM on [**2102-7-1**] (HD#3).
# PVD - patient was continued on plavix, statin and aspirin.
No acute issues.
Admission ECG consistent with baseline.
# COPD - Patient was continued on nebs q6h.
#PPX - Fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H as needed for breakthrough pain.
At time of discharge, you had no pain on your medication regimen.
