She is transferred from [**Hospital1 882**] for management of acute on chronic renal faillure.
In [**Month (only) **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for back pain and incidentally found to have gallbladder stones.
She then was re-presented to [**Hospital1 **] with nausea, vomiting x6 episodes NBNB and diarhea, and renal failure thought to be secondary to dehydration.
ERCP was planned at [**Hospital1 112**]; however, this was cancelled secondary to renal failure.
Thinking she was suffering from poor forward flow in the setting of her volume overload she was restarted on her torsemide with worsening of her renal function.
The patient has never been dialyzed and has no acute indication.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Diffuse crackles noted ABDOMEN: Obese Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominal bruits.
The latter is attributed to the occurrence of lambda light chains as dimers whose serum [**1-18**]- life is approximately 3 times longer than that of monomeric kappa light chains.
Excess production of kappa or lambda light chains alters the kappa/ lambda ratio.
Alterations that fall outside the normal range are attributed to the presence of monoclonal light chains.
Measurement of free light chain concentration in serum is useful for diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease activity and following response to therapy of these disorders.
Chronic infection and chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as renal insufficiency, may be accompanied by a diffuse increase in both kappa and lambda free chains, but the kappa/lambda ratio remains within the normal limits.
The serum concentration of free light chains increases with age over 60 years; light chains may reach 50 mg/L in those 70-80 yrs of age; in these cases the kappa/lambda ratio still remains within normal limits.
Physicians, who are accustomed to the identification of clonal protein by electro- phoretic means, may order immunofixation in addition to free light chain immunoassay.
In rare instances, immunofixation may identify monoclonal light chain protein in the absence of abnormalities in the quantitative light chain immunoassays.

Radiology  A. Renal US INDICATION: Acute renal failure.
There is no hydronephrosis or evidence of nephrolithiasis.
Color Doppler analysis of the left kidney reveals abnormal arterial waveforms throughout the kidney well as involving the left main renal artery, specifically with evidence of to and fro flow, raising the possibility of reversal of flow in diastole.
Note that color Doppler analysis was limited overall as the patient had severe difficulty with breath holding.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited study with evidence of to and fro flow in the renal arteries on the left, raising the possibility of reversal of flow in diastole.
Overall, this finding is nonspecific, though raises concern for elevated renal parenchymal pressure.
[**2128-3-8**] CHEST PORT.
Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with relatively mild vascular congestion, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
C. CXR([**2128-3-11**]) A AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM: Decreased breath sound and CHF.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
Bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right side are associated with atelectasis.
There is increased kyphosis.
Mild vascular congestion has improved.
D. Skeletal survey ([**2128-3-10**]) INDICATION: 73-year-old female with MGUS and question lytic lesions of multiple myeloma.
SKELETAL SURVEY  CALVARIUM: There are multiple punctate lucent lesions within the calvarium concerning for myelomatous deposits.
THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE: On a background of diffuse demineralization, there is focal kyphosis within the upper/mid thoracic spine secondary to a compression fracture of a upper/mid thoracic vertebral body with approximately 70% loss of vertebral body height.
The hemithoraces demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
PELVIS: There are severe degenerative changes of the left sacroiliac joint.
RIGHT AND LEFT FEMURS: There are subtle lucencies within both femurs without cortical destruction which may represent myelomatous deposits versus osteopenia.
HUMERI: There are no lytic lesions concerning for myelomatous deposits.
Multiple punctate lucencies in the calvarium concerning for myelomatous deposits.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderately dilated LV with severe global hypokinesis.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation and likely pulmonary artery hypertension.
Evidence of pressure/volume overload.
Mild aortic and moderate aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 73-year-old female with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), s/p nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in [**2119**] with left solitary kidney, hypertension, diabetes, MGUS that presented with 1-month history of nausea and vomiting thought to be related to cholelithiasis with plan for initial plan for ERCP.
She subsequently went into acute on chronic renal failure with etiology unknown after extensive work-up.
HOSPITAL COURSE: # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has underlying renal disease and is s/p right nephrectomy in setting of renal cell carcionoma in [**2119**] with left solitary kidney.
The etiology of her renal failure was initially thought to be hypovolemia at the [**Hospital1 882**], but she was unresponsive to fluids.
No recent contrast exposure.
She was subsequently underwent diuresis with thought that poor forward output in setting of cardiomyopathy could be the etiology; however, this as well did not improve her renal function.
On admission, she displayed signs and symptoms consistent with uremia.
Renal US showed elevated renal parenchymal pressure.
MRI was going to be performed to rule out renal vein thrombosis, but the patient had a pacemaker.
Renal consultants suggested transfer to the CCU with placement of a SG catheter to assess volume status and possibly initiation HD or UF.
Given PA numbers as below, patient was thought to be euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic.
Work-up for myeloma was performed as described below.
She subsequently continued HD on the cardiology floor with fluid removal limited by hypotension at times.
She had associated pleural effusions with goal to be net negative with dialysis, which was possible with downtitration of carvedilol.
In addition, her hepatitis panel was negative, and PPD was 0 mm of induration for outpatient dialysis screening purposes.
She received vein mapping during hospitalization for potential future placement of fistula access on non-dominant left arm, which should be spared from blood draws, blood pressure measurements, or other procedures.
#  MGUS - The patient has a diagnosis of MGUS.
Heme/Onc followed patient in house and recommended above tests in addition to a skeletal survey, which suggested multiple punctate lucencies in the calvarium concerning for myelomatous deposits.
The issue of whether she has MGUS or perhaps myeloma remains moot.
Her labs showed stable anemia, no hypercalcemia.
In the setting of unexplained oliguric renal failure, cast nephropathy is a consideration, and ruling out myeloma should be considered on an outpatient basis.
Another consideration is if her cardiomyopathy is perhaps related to this process.
#  Non-ischemic chronic systolic and diastolic cardiomyopathy (Last EF 20 %): She did not appear to have an acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation on admission.
Her mild hypervolemia may be secondary to renal failure.
No ACEi/[**Last Name (un) **] was given in setting of renal failure and relative hypotension.
She was determined to be euvolemic to mildly volume up.
TTE showed mild symmetric LVH,  moderately dilated LV with severe global hypokinesis, diastolic dysfunction, dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation and likely pulmonary artery hypertension with evidence of pressure/volume overload and mild aortic and moderate aortic regurgitation.
# Hyponatremia: Most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia given CHF and volume overload.
Her volume status by SG catheter was as above.
TSH was normal, and cortisol was appropriately elevated in setting of acute illness.
Etiology is likely multifactorial with no mental status changes.
# Metabolic encephalopathy Patient was AAOx2-3 at times at [**Hospital1 882**] and [**Hospital1 18**].
Etiology likely multifactorial given uremia, narcotics, electrolyte abnormalities, acute illness with prolonged hospitalization.
# Macrocytic anemia Admission Hgb 11.1 and stable.
The differential is broad including primary marrow process vs. nutritional deficiency vs. anemia of chronic renal disease.
Iron and B12 studies were suggestive of iron deficiency for which oral iron with anti-constipation regimen was started.
# Cholelithiasis Patient was going to undergo ERCP at [**Hospital1 112**] for stone extraction at some point; however, ERCP deferred in setting of actue on chronic renal failure.
Abdominal US on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 882**] showing cholelithiasis with two gallstones within gallbladder neck.
Patient continues to have some abdominal tenderness but has remained afebrile with no leukocytosis suggesting against systemic infection.
Repeat RUQ US showed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Given concurrent transaminitis discussed below, there was a concern for a stone in the CBD, but the etiology of this issue is likely multifactorial.
She was able to take adequate PO intake without significant vomiting or nausea.
# Transaminitis OSH LFTs on [**2128-2-25**] showing ALT 58, AST 22, ALKP 188 with uptrend to ALT 143 AST 111 ALPKP 255 TBili 0.8 on [**2128-3-3**].
Non-hepatic causes such as thyroid disorder or rhabdomyolysis unlikely given TSH and CK.
# Hypertension She was continued on carvedilol, which was reduced from 6.25 mg to 3.125 mg given relative hypotension with dialysis.
#  Chronic pain - Primary pain generator is her back for which XR showed wedge compression fracture of an upper/mid thoracic vertebral body (age indeterminate).
# Code: Full.
Patient is NOT likely to survive cardiopulmonary arrest especially with such severe heart failure.
