# SOB: CXR c/w RLL pneumonia.
Patient with h/o esophageal strictures and aspiration, so likely aspiration pneumonia.
Her O2 status while on the floor improved and we gradually weaned her off oxygen, no fevers, no WBC elevation.
# Chest pain: Likely in the setting of cough and pneumonia, and has since resolved.
Unlikely ACS given that it lasted all day, two troponins negative, and no ischemic ekg changes.
Given hypoxia, PE is a possibility, though lower liklihood given pneumonia on CXR.
No CP while on the medicine floor.
# Dysphagia: Secondary to known esophageal strictures from radation tx for thyrood CA.
Overdue for dilation which she has every 6 weeks.
Unable to do dilation while in the hospital (current condition, O2 req) so we decided to place L PICC and begin TPN [**7-21**].
# Medullary/Papillary thyroid CA: S/p radiation c/b esophageal strictures.
Thyroid scan on [**7-11**] showed new areas of recurrence in the left thyroid bed.
No pending labs.
Medications on Admission: ALBUTEROL SULFATE - 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - [**1-23**] HFA(s) inhaled every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing ATENOLOL - 25 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily at bedtime may be crushed LEVOTHYROXINE [LEVOXYL] - 125 mcg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day No substitution.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 6138**] Home Care Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary- Aspiration Pneumonia, Esophogeal Stricture  Secondary- H/o Thyroid CA (Medullary, Papillary), HTN, Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain.
X-ray of your chest showed that you had a pneumonia.
We treated you with antibiotics.
We decided to start nutrition feeds through the vein in order to allow you to recover from the pneumonia so that you can tolerate the esophogeal dilation.
