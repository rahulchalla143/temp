Otherwise, he was asymptomatic and never became tachycardic or hypotensive.
His daughter, [**Name (NI) **], who is a GI physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 9012**] initially preferred to perform a colonoscopy first and would not consent to CTA with potential embolization as she was concerned about the IV dye load for his kidneys.
Access was obtained with a 16 gauge peripheral in the Left upper extremity and he already had a PICC line in place in his Right upper extremity from a previous admission.
Transplant surgery, GI, and IR were consulted in the ED and the patient had a CTA prior to arrival to the ICU which was significant for a cecal blush.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared comfortable and had no acute complaints.

Sclera anicteric.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Harsh systolic murmur at RUSB/LUSB.
CTAB without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Minimal tenderness over transplant in RLQ.
Ext: LE edema 1+ bilaterally.

Sclera anicteric.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Harsh systolic murmur at RUSB/LUSB.
CTAB without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Minimal tenderness over  transplant in RLQ.
Ext: LE edema 1+ bilaterally.
Tenderness over right medial/anterior thigh.
Contrast extravasation in the cecum, representing active GI bleed.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Conventional vascular anatomy, with extensive atherosclerotic plaque within the SMA, aorta, and iliac arteries.
Initial right colic and SMA angiography demonstrated very delayed appearance of a tiny focus of contrast extravasation within the ileocecal area, likely corresponding CTA findings.
No further extravasation was identified, suggesting that the source of bleeding had stopped.
As a specific source branch could not be determined, no embolization was performed.
The source branch could not be determined as bleeding had stopped, and no embolization was performed.
No evidence of active bleeding during the time of study.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year old male with past medical history of DM2 complicated by nephropathy s/p living related donor kidney transplant in [**2137**] with subsequent baseline Cr of 2, CAD s/p stents to LAD and Left circumflex, diastolic CHF with EF=65%, PVD, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension (45 to 55 mm Hg based on TTE in [**8-/2146**]), OSA on CPAP, history of C diff, chronic gastritis, and history of lower GI bleed 5 years ago s/p colonoscopy and successful clipping in NY presenting from his [**Hospital1 1501**] with multiple episodes of bright red blood per rectum consistent with a repeat lower GI bleed.
He was found to have bleeding angioectasia in the cecum which was clipped.
Lower GI bleed:  Patient with Hct drop to 23.6 from recent baseline of 29.
CTA showed cecal blush on admission, but IR was not able to embolize the bleeding vessel as it spasmed during the procedure.
A tagged red cell scan was negative for active bleeding the following day.
After stable Hct and no further bright red blood per rectum episodes, he was prepped for a colonoscopy which showed polyps in the whole colon diverticulosis of the transverse colon and sigmoid colon, Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, and Angioectasia in the cecum (endoclip).
# CKI s/p renal transplant:  The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 below his recent baseline of 2.
# CAD History: Patient was without chest pain, SOB, or other anginal equivalents on admission.
After colonoscopy and clipping of angioectasia in addition to stable hematocrit, his home aspirin 18 mg daily was restarted.
# Hypertension:  Patient's home labetalol and hydralazine were held on admission given his massive lower GI bleed.
Home labetalol was restarted after maintaining hemodynamic stability and Hct level s/p colonoscopy and angioectasia clipping.
# Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Home furosemide was held on admission given active GI bleed.
Home bupropion was held during his stay given history of coronary artery disease and hypertension.
# Vascular Surgery / Amputation: Patient is s/p right foot 4th and 5th ray amputations and right CEA endarterectomy with patch angioplasty during his recent admission from [**2146-11-18**] to [**2146-11-30**].
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:  Currently well controlled, but complicated by peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy.
# Repeat colonoscopy to remove polpys and assess rectum in the next 3 months (discharged back on home regimen of aspirin and plavix.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - Heathwood - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Final Diagnoses: Lower GI bleed Polyps in the whole colon Diverticulosis of the transverse colon and sigmoid colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Angioectasia in the cecum Acute anemia of blood loss Chronic renal insufficiency .
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes Hypertension coronary artery disease status post stent peripheral arterial disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had some imaging studies which gave us an initial idea of where the bleeding is coming from.
After your blood level remained stable, you had a colonoscopy which showed an abnormal vessel on the right side of your colon which was clipped.
