Additionally pt had a fall from bed today without LOC or head strike.
Pt's recent admission was for a similar presentation and s/p mechanical fall on stairs thought to be multifactorial due to dehydration and deconditioning and she was sent home with home PT.
She denies any pain in her legs but does report "tingling" everywhere in her legs with some subjective knee swelling.
Additionally, bowing of right ventricle suggestive of right heart strain and moderate bilateral pleural effusions (R>L).
CT Head showed no evidence of metastasis or intracranial process.
Pt soon had fever to 101.2.
She had no complaints other than continued tingling and weakness of her legs and thirst.
No pain or SOB.

Massive pulmonary emboli involving all lobar pulmonary arteries.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
No acute intracranial process.
No CT evidence of large intracranial mass.
Redemonstration of post-surgical changes in the left anterior ethmoidal sinus and orbit, with persistent expansile soft tissue in the left anterior ethmoidal region.
Recommend correlation with prior imaging and clinical history if available and possible MRI evaluation as previously suggested.
[**7-13**] Echo Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension  [**7-14**] MRI spine 1.
No evidence of bony metastasis in the cervical, thoracic or lumbar region.
No evidence of cord compression or an obvious intraspinal mass.
Gadolinium-enhanced images were not obtained which although slightly limit evaluation for a mass, no large intraspinal mass identified.
No abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
Bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of fluid in the pelvis.
[**7-14**] LENIs - No evidence of DVT  Discharge labs: [**2157-7-27**] 05:19AM BLOOD WBC-10.6 RBC-3.35* Hgb-9.8* Hct-30.1* MCV-90 MCH-29.3 MCHC-32.6 RDW-21.3* Plt Ct-258 [**2157-7-27**] 05:19AM BLOOD Glucose-94 UreaN-8 Creat-0.4 Na-133 K-3.6 Cl-100 HCO3-26 AnGap-11 [**2157-7-27**] 05:19AM BLOOD Calcium-8.1* Phos-3.5 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: 50 yo female with PMH notable for metastatic cecal adenocarcinoma now admitted with many pulmonary emboli and right heart strain along with concerning neurologic exam.
Active Issues =================== # Pulmonary emboli: Pt with many risk factors for PE including metastatic cancer, recent hospitalization, and deconditioning.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
With no evidence of clot burden in her legs, she was not believed to be a candidate for IVC filter placement.
Echo revealed Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
# Abnormal LE sensation/weakness thought secondary to conversion d/o: Pt reports new onset bilateral weakness, tingling and found to have weakness and diminished sensation on exam.
Concern for metastases compressing spinal canal or nerve roots.
MRI and CT of spine revealed no cord compression.
Neuro exam was inconsistent during hospital stay, so thought to be component of somatization.
Psych was consulted and believed pt fit criteria for conversion disorder.
# Fevers: High fevers in this asymptomatic patient may be due to her significant clot burden and underlying malignancy.
No evidence of occult infection by history, exam or chest imaging.
# Anemia: Recent slow downward trend in Hct starting in [**Month (only) **] from baseline of 36.
[**Month (only) 116**] have some component of anemia of chronic disease.
# Low UOP: Pt with low UOP during course of admission secondary to poor PO intake.
# Diarrhea: C diff negative, stool culture negative.
Loperamide given and diarrhea resolved.
SW consulted to provide pt with resources for depression and cancer Dx.
# Epistaxis: Pt noted to have epistaxis near end of admission requiring ENT to pack the nose.
ENT recommending MRI sinuses to evaluate h/o L ethmoidal fibrosarcoma, which did not show evidence of local recurrence.
Chronic Issues ======================== # Stage IV adenocarcinoma: Recently completed cycle 2 of FLOX palliative chemotherapy.
Continued pain and nausea mgmt.

Leg weakness 2.
Depression 4.
Metastatic colon cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you had weakness in your legs.
An MRI of your spine did not show any abnormalities and nerve studies were normal.
You were found to have blood clots in your lungs which is why you are on lovenox, which you will continue after discharge.
For your nosebleeds, you will need to follow epistaxis precautions for 2 weeks: - do not blow nose - sneeze with mouth open - no vigorous activity, straining, or heavy lifting x 2 weeks - do not place anything inside nose except medicine as advised (no fingers, tissues, q-tips etc.)
