On presentation to the ED, the patient reported having headache for several days.
At around 1720, patient had about 20 seconds of unresponsiveness, tremulousness and drooling that resolved spontaneously.
Her presentation was felt c/w meningoencephalitis.
While in the ED patient further decompensated, with GCS of E3V4M (13), AAO x2 but answering questions inappropriately, and became acutely agitated.
Past Medical History: Past Hematologic/Oncologic History: - [**3-/2127**] presented with severe abdominal pain.
- [**2127-4-4**] A CT scan revealed a large intra-abdominal mass and a subsequent CT-guided biopsy on confirmed presence of a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Her chemotherapy course was complicated by admissions for fevers due to bacteremia, line associated DVT, and bilateral  pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation.
- [**2127-5-15**], TEE demonstrated a tricuspid mass, and she was treated with antibiotics as well as Lovenox for question of septic emboli.
At that time, she also underwent a lower extremity ultrasound without evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
- [**2127-6-6**], noted to have a left-sided brachial vein deep vein  thrombosis and at that time, was switched from Lovenox to fondaparinux out of concern that she developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Given her history of lymphoma and the fact she had a re-staging PET-CT just prior to finding out she was pregnant, she was referred to the high-risk obstetrics group and was followed regularly throughout  her pregnancy.
At approximately 31 weeks into her pregnancy, she  was admitted with abdominal pain and possible preterm contractions.
Blood work at that time was concerning for recurrence of her lymphoma (LDH 641).
She then had an MRI, which  showed a 14-cm abdominal mass and upper abdominal adenopathy.
A biopsy of the mass eventually confirmed this to be consistent with her previous diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.
She delivered a baby girl on [**2128-6-10**] without complications.
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.
After starting  treatment she was briefly transferred to the ICU for development  of acute shortness of breath due to bilateral pulmonary emboli.
HIT testing was negative as was lower extremity ultrasound for evidence of DVT.
- [**Date range (3) 59602**] Admitted for Cycle 3 of ESHAP tolerated well, with enoxaprin held in late [**7-/2128**] [**12-23**] severe thrombocytopenia - [**Date range (1) 8258**] Admitted with poor PO intake, nausea and vomiting.
Found to have hypocalcemia and significant hypomagnesemia.
- [**2038-9-9**] was admitted for mobilization with cytoxan with plan for autoSCT in the future, discharged on [**Hospital1 **] neupogen - [**Date range (1) 59709**]:  admitted after a syncopal event, bilateral LE  U/S without evidence of DVT.
CTA showed small submental PE and thought to be new, but patient was not started on anticoagulation [**12-23**] ongoing thrombocytopenia.
Had stem cell mobilization and collection with placement of RIJ pheresis catheter.
On [**2128-10-27**], developed neck pain and arm swelling, with CT showing extensive right IJ thrombus and involvement of subclavian vein, with phlegmon extending down from C3 into the mediastinum, paravertebral and carotids spaces.
History of recurrent, catheter-related deep vein thrombosis as well as pulmonary embolism, as above 6.

She then had an MRI, which showed a 14-cm abdominal mass and upper abdominal adenopathy.
A biopsy of the mass eventually confirmed this to be consistent with her previous diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.
Due to the aggressive nature of her disease, it was decided to induce labor at 32 weeks in order to initiate chemotherapy.
She delivered a baby girl on [**2128-6-10**] without complications.
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.

History of recurrent, catheter-related deep vein thrombosis as well as pulmonary embolism, as above  Social History: Social History:  (per records) The patient is married.
She moved here from [**Country 2045**] 13 years ago and was working as a nurses aid at a nursing home prior to her diagosis and chemotherapy.
Family History: Family History:  (per records) Per records, no history of DM, CAD, HLD, HTN, cancer or other inherited disorders.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM Vitals:  97.5 105/75, 87, 100% on CMV FIO2 40% General: Intubated, not responsive to commands HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pinpoint pupils, bilateral white corneal opacity Neck: scattered small mobile cervical lymph nodes CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, soft systolic murmur LLSB Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally on anterior exam Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Intubated, does not follow commands, moving all extremities spontaneously, brisk patellar bilaterally, brisk right brachioradialis, uncertain left brachioradialis, neg babinski bilaterally.
CSF GRAM STAIN (Final [**2129-5-11**]): NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-5-11**] 12:25 AM FINDINGS:  There is essentially no change in comparison to the recent study, from only the day before with no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vessel territorial infarction.
No acute fracture is identified.
The visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses areclear.
IMPRESSION:  No change in comparison to the study of the day before, with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
These findings may represent either central atrophy or to underlying communicating hydrocephalus, perhaps related to underlying "aggressive T-cell lymphoma" (history provided for the MR study of [**2128-9-21**]) or its treatment, and should be closely correlated with clinical data.
Progressive mild ventricular dilatation compared to the prior study of [**2121**], but stable since the recent prior study of [**2129-5-11**].
No new significant interval change.
No evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
Several rounded opacifications are seen just beneath the liver.
Although these could represent collections of fecal material in the colon, the possibility of gallstones would have to be considered.
EEG Report ([**2129-5-15**]): PND  EEG Report ([**2129-5-14**]): This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed a slow and encephalopathic background, with occasional bursts of generalized slowing, throughout the recording.
This indicates a mild to moderate encephalopathy, largely unchanged over the last 2 days of recording.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, no epileptiform features.
There were no electrographic seizures.
Extensive ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
The Q-T interval has prolonged and ST-T wave changes are more prominent.
Marked FLAIR-signal abnormality the gyri recti of both frontal lobes, the caudate nuclei, left more than right, and deep white matter and subependymal regions, is most concerning for new lymphomatous involvement of these regions, although this is somewhat atypical, given there is only very modest corresponding leptomeningeal and parenchymal enhancement and no asscoiated abnormality of diffusion.
Other etiologies could include treatment-related abnormality, such as extrapontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination) or an acquired Wernicke's syndrome, occasionally reported with chemotherapy.
Acute viral encephalitis, as well as post-infectious demyelination, are also considerations, though the sites of involvement and the minimal enhancement and lack of diffusion abnormality would be unusual.
Progressive mild ventricular dilation when compared to the prior MRI in [**2127**].
This may be secondary to progressive central atrophy, which may be a post-treatment effect, or underlying communicating hydrocephalus, which could relate to lymphomatous involvement.
No diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement to specifically suggest meningitis.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
In the ED she was also given 1 mg ativan for concern for seizure activity.
She also has an MRV given concern for venous sinus thrombosis which was negative.
Given concern for the need for high dose methotrexate/dex the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-12**], patient was intubated and sedated and not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli.
She was initially given Mannitol for concern of cerebral edema, but after discussion with neuroradiology, the edema was considered mild, and mannitol was discontinued.
Given that the concern for her encephalopathy was due to CNS disease, her ABX were stopped on [**5-12**] per the ID consult team.
She was afebrile throughout the rest of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
She also had a high MTX level at 25, but after receiving aggressive IVF at 200 cc/hr, repeat was 0.6.
On arrival to the floor, she states that she has no complaints.
With PE significant for bradycardia and a flattended affect.
?s husband (pt was felt to be unable to understand the risks, benefits and alternatives to treatment), pt was taken for central line insertion (unsuccessful again [**12-23**] heavy clot burden) and the I/R team opted for placement of an abdominal port with concurrent removal of the femoral catheter.
