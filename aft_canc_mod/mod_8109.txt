She was resumed on heparin and coumadin for treatment of pulmonary embolism but then per plastics changed to Lovenox due to potential future debridements.
However she had increased bleeding from VAC and decrease in hematocrit requiring transfusion.
Lovenox was stopped, hematology was consulted for appropriate management and since past the first six weeks and no current evidence of DVT or PE she was placed on lovenox for DVT prevention.
Planned for continued antibiotics - meropenum for enterococcus, E coli, pseudomonas and vancomycin for corynebacterium and flagyl for Cdiff, all to continue until further instructions from infections disease.
Plan for follow up with plastic surgery and infectious disease as outpatient.
