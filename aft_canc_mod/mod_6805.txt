History of Present Illness: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain, found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED.
He initially presented for evaluation of abd pain, nausea, 3-4 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis in the last day to day and a half, and subjective fevers at home.
In the ED, his initial vitals were remarkable for tachycardia to 130s, SBP 90s; he was afebrile.
Because he had reported subjective fever and was hypotensive, broad spectrum Abx (vanc and zosyn) were started and, because of his ascites and known pancreatic CA, CT torso was performed.
Shortly thereafter, he had hematemesis x2 (~1L total) of mixed bright and dark red blood.
Heparin was then stopped, he was transfused two units of blood, and gen surgery and GI were consulted about bleeding and thoracics consulted about possible thrombectomy of PEs.
Surgery did not recommend any operative management for upper GI bleeding and GI recommended supportive care until morning, when EGD could be performed if pt stabilizes.
ROS: The patient denies any shaking chills, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Brief Hospital Course: 79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer status-post chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and malnutrition on TPN, who presented with weakness and abdominal pain, found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED.
# Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided intratumoral injections of TNFerade.
After discussion with the patient and his family given the new diagnosis of bilateral PEs, recent hematemesis, he initially chose to be made CMO.
His pain was treated with morphine as needed, his nausea with zofran and prochlorperazine prn.
When transferred to the floor, the primary oncology team and the palliative care team had another family meeting, reiterating that there was not further treatment for the patient's pancreatic cancer.
Possible etiologies included obstruction from his submassive PEs; sepsis, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis) source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding.
# Acute Blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: The patient vomited almost 1 L of blood in the ED.
General surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low sensitivity for this diagnosis.
# Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have bilateral PE.
This was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic cancer (Trousseau's syndrome).
Anticoagulation is contraindicated secondary to his recent massive hematemesis.
The patient developed cough and this was treated with tussinex.
In the ED his serum glucose was 363 and he had glucose in his urine, although no ketones.
# Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and received VNA-wound care services at home.
He had no anasarca on the floor.
His dysphagia is thought to be due to malnutrition-related oropharyngeal myopahty.
# Code: The patient was initally DNR/DNI on admission, but was made CMO given the worsening of his clinical status as above.

We found you had clots in your lungs.
We treated you with blood thinners but then you developed bleeding in your GI tract so we had to stop the blood thinners.
We believe the bleeding is from erosion of your tumor into your GI tract and no further interventions are indicated.
You are being given several medications for constipation.
