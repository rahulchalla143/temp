Her history of cervical cancer includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy; her last dose of chemotherapy was in [**2173**] - her radiation therapy has left her with multiple complications including radiation colitis, a right ureteral stricture, and cystitis.
Urology has been consulted for this stricture and had a nephrostomy placed last year; as a consequence, she has developed multiple urinary tract infections, including pan-sensitive E. Coli and Klebsiella.
She takes macrobid for urinary tract infection suppression.
Her urologist has been consulting for the possibility of a right nephrectomy in order to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections and as the definitive treatment for her stricture.
Her most recent admission in [**2174-5-15**] was for severe diarrhea - at times bloody - which was attributed to radiation colitis after colonoscopy was performed.
She was started on anti-spasmodics; she also had a urinary tract infection during that admission for which she was treated with ceftriaxone.
On the morning of this admission, she developed a fever to 102 - she had no other symptoms.
She has been anorexic for the past several weeks with decreased PO intake.
Denies dizziness or lightheadedness.
Denies cough, chills, sweats, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
In the emergency room, she was slightly hypotensive with BPs around the 90s - she received 2 L of fluid with improvement.
A troponin was checked which was elevated at .23 with no EKG changes representative of ischemia.
Floor HPI: Patient is a 66 year old female with a history of stage IV cervical cancer, currently inactive not on chemo-radiation, with history of nephrostomy tube for ureteral stricture with multiple prior admissions for urosepsis/UTIs with resistant GNRs who was admitted with fever and urinary tract infection.
She was hospitalized in [**2174-5-15**] for diarrhea - at times bloody - found to be [**3-17**] radiation colitis based on colonoscopy.
On the morning of admission, patient febrile 102 but asymptomatic otherwise.
Denies dizziness or lightheadedness.
Denies cough, chills, sweats, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Additionally she was found to have a 10 point hct drop and a bowel movement with maroon colored stools.
She was transfused 2 units PRBCs and she had no additional bloody bowel movements and her hct remained stable.
Per GI consult, when she was last seen in [**Month (only) 547**] decision was made to repeat Flex Sigmoidoscopy with electro-cauterization of bleeding sites of proctitis.
Given repeat episode of bloody diarrhea GI indicated she will have a Flex-Sig with cautery after patient transferred to the floor.
Patient and family frustrated with Nephrostomy and feel it is causing recurrent UTIs and sepsis, she would like it removed.
She was not treated with Vit-D/Ca in the past and now has new pelvic fractures.
Past Medical History: -Cervical cancer: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**], discovered after [**1-23**] post-menopausal vaginal bleeding/hematuria and was found to have  a cervical mass w/ invasion of the posterior bladder wall.

Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old female with a history of stage IV cervical cancer, not currently treated with chemo-radiation, with history of nephrostomy tube for ureteral stricture s/p radiation with multiple prior admissions for urosepsis/UTIs including resistant GNRs, also with history of radiation proctitis and GI bleeds who was admitted to MICU with fever and urinary tract infection concerning for sepsis also found to have GIB and 10 point hct drop.
# UTI- Chronic UTIs related to nephrostomy tube.
UCx on this admission did not grow a pathogen but given her complicated history with recurrent episodes of sepsis, indwelling nephrostomy bag and fever on arrival to the ED she was treated with Ceftriaxone.
She will also follow up with ID as an outpatient regarding change in suppressive antibiotics given recent UTIs with Macrobid resistance.
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia - Hct drop of 10 on admission from baseline and guiac positive stool in setting of patient with known radiation colitis/proctitis suggesting slow ooze from LGI track.
She had loose stools with clots following completion of procedure but hematocrit remained stable and without tachycardia or hypotension.
# Diarrhea: Patient with persistant loose stools following Flex Sig.
Diarrhea likely related to GI ooze from practitis/colitis and recent cautery procedure, though hct stable so not actively loosing blood.
She had no leukocytosis or fevers so C.Diff unlikely.
Did order C.Diff on morning of discarge though patient no longer having loose stools so could not give a sample.
Instructed patient to call her PCP or [**Date Range **] if loose stools restart.
# Headaches: Has been having hedaches for some time as an outpatient.
During admission with persistant bilateral frontal headaches, severe [**9-23**] which was refractory to APAP-Caff-Butalbital.
Spoke to outpatient H/O fellow who reports HAs have been increasing in frequency over past 2 months.
While rare for cervical cancer to metastasize to brain, favored caution and obtained CT Head with contrast to evaluate for a mass since patient cannot tolerate MRI.
Has documented allergy to contrast on her medical record though patient has had multiple CTAs in our system and never had a reaction.
# Troponin elevation - Likely demand from UTI and peri-sepsis.
Cardiology saw patient felt no acute ischemia/infarct and most likely demand in origin.
Patient denies and chest pain or SOB type symptoms.
Trops downtrended and she had no events on telemetry  # Hyponatremia: Hypovolumic hyponatremia, resolved after IVFs  # Stage IV cervical cancer - Chronic, inactive without current chemoradiation treatment.
S/p chemoradiation with ureteral stricture and colitis/proctitis.
Recent CT scan showed no recurrence.
# Known Pelvic Fractures: Appeared stable on imaging.
Has chronic pelvic pain due to this and is on hydromorphone at home for the pain.
Continued on opiates for pain control.
Given known osteoporosis and pelvic fractures would recommend Bisphosphonate therapy to outpatient providers.
# Pan Hypopituitarism.
Hx benign pituitary adenoma s/p resection many years ago.
Continued Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg PO/NG DAILY and PredniSONE 5 mg PO/NG DAILY  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow up final CT Head read: Prelim no masses - Consider bisphosphonates as an outpatient - Patient discharged without obtaining C.Diff sample given no more loose stools.
If patient begins having loose stools then would recommend C.diff testing - Patient will have outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Uro-surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] [**Name (STitle) **]: Outpatient nephrectomy and removal of nephrostomy tube - Outpatient Infectious Diseaseto decide suppressive therapy given last UCx resistant to Nitrofurantoin and risk of resistance with Cipro suppressive therapy - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures  Medications on Admission: ERGOCALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D2) - 50,000 unit Capsule - 1 Capsule(s)  by mouth qweek - No Substitution HYDROMORPHONE - 2 mg Tablet - [**2-14**] Tablet(s) by mouth every four  (4) hours as needed for pain LEVOTHYROXINE - 125 mcg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth daily LIDOCAINE-PRILOCAINE - 2.5 %-2.5 % Cream - 2.5grams topically to  PORT site as directed as needed for prior to accessing PORT NITROFURANTOIN MONOHYD/M-CRYST - 100 mg Capsule - 100mg Capsule(s) by mouth at bedtime OLANZAPINE [ZYPREXA] - 2.5 mg Tablet - [**2-14**] Tablet(s) by mouth Q6  hours and QHS as needed for anxiety, insomnia POTASSIUM CHLORIDE [KLOR-CON] - 20 mEq Packet - 2 Packet(s) by mouth twice a day PREDNISONE - 5 mg Tablet - one Tablet by mouth daily  Discharge Medications: 1. olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
