Admission Date:  [**2122-9-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-9-8**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness and numbness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 83 year old right handed woman s/p a recent R parietal hemorrhage ([**7-10**]) in the setting of coumadin therapy, and residual L sided weakness, who presents with new large R frontal and intraventricular hemorrhage.
She was eating breakfast on [**9-3**], when she suddenly developed slurred speech, L arm and leg weakness as well as numbness.
No complaints of headache.
ROS negative for recent illness.
She was d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-26**] to rehab with notable L homonymous hemianopsia.
HTN 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Breast cancer [**2114**] s/p lumpectomy, XRT and tamoxifen.
No chemotherapy.
No recurrence known.
Left hip replacement.
Recent diagnosis of CML after w/u of elevated WBC   Social History: Patient is a very active woman who lives with a family member but has been largely independent with most ADLs.
No evidence of head trauma.
Heart - RRR no m/r/g Lungs - diminshed breath sounds at bases bilaterally Abd - soft, NT/ND Ext - warm and well perfused.
Neuro: Not responsive to loud voice or sternal rub.
R gaze preference, but EOMI to dolls maneuver.
Minimal grimace to nasal tickle.
No gag or cough.
No spontaneous mvmts.
New large right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma with associated intraventricular hemorrhage and slight shift of midline structures leftward.
Small bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage in the frontal lobe regions.
Old hematoma site in the right parietal lobe.
There is extensive adjacent vasogenic edema, with extension of acute blood into the ventricular system, especially at the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
Increased acute blood is also seen extending into the subarachnoid spaces at the cerebral sulci bilaterally.
[**9-8**] CXR - Right lower lobe progressive consolidation, concerning for an evolving site of pneumonia.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to atelectasis or additional site of pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 year old woman with large R frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with diffuse intraventricular extension and also subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Neuro - The patient's R frontal hemorrhage (a second hemorrhage within 2 months), is most likely related to amyloid angiopathy.
Mild increase in edema and increased subarachnoid hemorrhage on [**9-4**] head CT. Seizure prophylaxis with Depakote was initiated (Dilantin allergy).
Sedation with Propofol was stopped on [**9-4**], but the patient remained minimally responsive throughout the hospitalization.
[**9-8**] CXR revealed right lower lobe pneumonia.
In addition to pneumonia on CXR, U/A c/w likely UTI.
Blood loss possibly due to increasing intracranial hemorrhage, GI losses, marrow infiltration related to CML, among other etiologies.
Given the patient's poor prognosis related to her large hemorrhage, once fever developed on [**9-8**], and there was new evidence of likely pneumonia and UTI, the family decided to transition to comfort measures only.
Medications on Admission: Atenolol  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: R frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
