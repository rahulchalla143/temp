She states that she has been having intermittent blurry vision for weeks.
She walked fine with minimal hip pain after her fall and made it to dialysis.
She had CT scans of her head and torso, and she was found to have a 2.5 by 2.9  parietal/occiptial mass with vasogenic edema.
She does have a history of Non-small cell lung cancer and the fact that she prefers to get her care here.
This is felt to be at least Stage IIIA, given presence of bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and large 7cm LLL mass.
= At that time felt not to be a surgical candidate = Recommended Rad Onc with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - recommended further eval with mediastinoscopy prior to commiting to either CyberKnife or external beam palliative radition.

surrounding vasogenic edema extending into the posterior superior right temporal lobe.
mass effect compressing the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and < 5 mm midline shift from the right to the left at the level of the septum pellucidum.
no fx - CT abd w/ contrast: no acute abdominal process.
- CT chest w/ contrast: 3.1 cm diameter partially calcified pleural based mass at the low posterior left lower lobe, at the site of previously dx lung cancer.
- renal is aware of patient, no need for urgent dialysis  XRAY [**2177-7-11**]: Four Views of lumbar spine: revela diffuse bone demineralization.
No evidence of Acute compression fracture, disc space narrowing or spondylolisthesiis.
There is mild low lumbar facet osteoparthropathy.
No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
Markedly rotated position and mild motion limit assessment of symmetry of structures.
No canal or foraminal stenosis.
Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery segment consistent with pulmonary hypertension with associated mild cardiac decompensation.
T3 (thoracic 3) vertebral body- mild anterior wedging and superior end-plate depression.
Correlate clinically for dedicated imaging.
Airspace opacity in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension.
Cardiomegaly and interstitial edema consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
CT Head w/o contrast [**2177-7-12**] 3.1 x 2.7 cm right parieto-occipital mass with extensive neighboring edema and moderate neighboring mass effect but no evidence for herniation.
CT Head with contrast [**2177-7-13**] A 3.1 x 2.8 cm mass centered in the right parieto-occipital region with avid peripheral enhancement and extensive surrounding vasogenic edema compatible with metastatic disease given the history.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical septal akinesis, apical anterior akinesis/hypokinesis, distal apical akinesis/dyskinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**7-18**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Stable 3.3 cm right parieto-occipital mass compatible with a history of metastatic lung cancer.
There continues to be some retrocardiac opacity that could be due to volume loss or infiltrate.
[**7-19**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Expected postoperative parietal craniotomy changes.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  60 yo woman with PMHx of [**Month/Day (2) 2091**] (on HD), CABG, HTN, HL, DM2 and NSCLC who presented from an OSH after a CT head showed a new 2.5x2.9cm mass at the parietal-occipital lobe junction.
# intracranial brain mass:  Ms. [**Location (un) 89345**] presented with new visual symptoms and a new isolated mass at the parietal-occipital junction, with surrounding vasogenic edema.
This likely represents a metastasis from her primary NSCLC.
She had an ECHO done which showed focal wall motion abnormalities c/w prior cardiac event.
She was given three doses of post-op Ancef.
Surgery was without complication.
Physical Therapy saw the patient and when the patient was out of bed she became orthostatic with SBP to 70/38.
#  Lung CA:  The patient had a CT torso obtained at OSH that showed stable disease in chest, with no disease in the abdomen.
As above, head CT showed new solitary brain lesion, likely metastatic.
# CAD s/p CABG [**75**] years ago c/b sternal wound infection:  EKG unchanged.
We obtained a pre-operative Echo which showed focal wall motion abnormalities c/w prior cardiac event.
Given the fact that her intracranial mass was going to be surgically resected, it was decided that IR placement of IVC filter was indicated, as anticoagulation would have to be avoided for a few weeks postoperatively.
# Type 2 DM: As per the patient, has not been taking any medications since starting HD.
During the hospitalization, the patient was given Dexamethasone, with associated elevations in blood glucose.
However, after her dexamethasone was increased, her sugars remained very elevated, and ultimately she was started on long acting Lantus 30 units daily, in addition to sliding scale while she was an inpatient.
