Hew as found to be pancytopenic and ultimately diagnosed with [**Location (un) 5622**]-chromosome-negative ALL.
Prior to the bone marrow biopsy, a broad differential diagnosis was considered including bone marrow suppression secondary to viral infection vs. malignancy (given the 90% lymphocytes).
Patient's anemia and pancytopenia were profound, and while in the ICU, he received pRBC to maintain a HCT > 21 and platelets to maintain platelets >50 given recent retinal hemorrhages.
Patient was anticoagulated with Lovenox given risk of clotting with asparaginase.
Patient's course was complicated by neurtopenic fever, hyponatremia, and mucousitis (please see below) but otherwise chemo was tolerated well.
Visual changes/retinal hemorrhage: Ophthalmology was consulted early in patient's admission and determined that his retinal hemorrhages were secondary to thrombocytopenia/newly diagnosed ALL.
There was no evidence of leukemic infiltrates.
Patient had no pain and visual changes resolved without further intervention.
Neutropenic Fever: Patient developed a fever and was initially started on cefepime and clindamycin (clindamycin for oral anaerobe coverage given mouth sores and possible dental cavity).
The GNR's speciated as CAPNOCYTOPHAGA SPECIES, which has been described in neutropenic patients with mouth ulcers.
Given capnocytophaga's sensitivities (and desire to decrease risk for c. dif), cefepime and clindamycin were discontinued and Zosyn was started.
On [**10-15**], patient  developed a drug rash that was most likely secondary to PCN component of Zosyn, and he was switched to Meropenem.
Mucousitis: Patient developed several very painful oral ulcers.
He also reported pain at the site of a dental cavity.
He received mouth care, acyclovir, fluconazole, and ultimately required a dilaudid PCA for pain control.
By the end of admission, ulcers had markedly improved and patient no longer required pain control.
Hyponatremia: Patient's labs were consistent with SIADH, which was most likely secondary to vincristine or MTX.
Skin findings: Patient had a violaceous patch on R knee after falling in a softball game prior to diagnosis but was very slow to resolve.
He was seen by dermatology who biopsied the lesion and determined there were signs of retained foreign body but no signs of fungal infection.
Constipation: Most likely secondary to vincristine and narcotics.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Complete Ertapenem (through [**10-21**]) - Follow-up final bone marrow results to assess for complete remission - New PCN allergy (rash while on Zosyn)  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
You experienced mouth ulcers and a bacterial infection in your blood, both of which have improved.
On [**2107-10-18**], you had a bone marrow biopsy which will help us know if you are in a complete remission.
If you have any fevers (even low fevers), worsening rash, worsening redness or pain at your PICC insertion site, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any other new symptosm that concern you, please call our office immediately.
