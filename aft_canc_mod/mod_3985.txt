No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
FINDINGS: This is a limited study obtained without contrast as described above.
There are postoperative changes seen in the left posterior temporo- occipital region with areas of blood products in this region.
In addition, small areas of blood products secondary to metastases are seen in the right posterior temporal region.
A small subdural hematoma is seen on the left side appears to which it is postoperative in nature.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Postoperative changes as described above.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 3905**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3906**] Approved: SAT [**2106-10-30**] 11:22 AM ************** MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2106-10-28**] 5:25 AM  MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  Reason: L and R parietal lobe tumor Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old man with h/o metastatic melanoma left parietal lobe and right parietal lobe.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: L and R parietal lobe tumor CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of metastatic melanoma, for further evaluation.
FINDINGS: Again hyperintense/enhancing lesions are identified in the left temporal-occipital lobe and also in the right posterior temporal lobe.
Overall appearance of the lesion has not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
There is surrounding edema seen.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearances of bilateral cerebral masses in temporal- occipital regions, left greater than right side compared with MRI of [**2106-10-18**].

[**First Name (STitle) 3905**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3906**] Approved: SAT [**2106-10-30**] 11:24 AM ****************** CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval interval changes  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 yo M s/p craniectomy w/ mass resection [**10-28**] continued change in MS and word finding difficulty REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval interval changes CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with craniectomy with mass resection.
There is some increased low density seen in this region secondary to edema.
Subtle hyperintensity due to hemorrhagic metastasis is also seen in the right posterior temporal region, unchanged.
Since the previous study, there is slight increase in the subdural collection seen in the left frontal region which appears to be a postoperative subdural collection.
There is slight mass effect also seen on the adjacent sulci.
There is minimal midline shift also identified.
IMPRESSION: New since the previous study is slight increase in size of the left-sided subdural collection which now measures approximately 11 mm with mass effect on the adjacent sulci and slight midline shift.
No new areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen.

FINDINGS: There is enhancement along the anterior left temporal surgical bed that may represent residual tumor focus or could be in the clinical spectrum of postoperative change.
A left hemispheric subdural fluid collection measuring at most 1.5 cm from the inner skull is unchanged.
A 2mm right hyperintense temporal lesion is noted, unchanged (14,14 / 15,10).
A 2 mm hyperintense right temporal lesion (14,22 / 15,18) is again visualized and likely represents a metastatic focus.
A subcentimeter hyperintense focus in the right temporal lobe (14, 14) also likely represents metastatic focus.
A left temporal/parietal wedge- shaped area demonstrtates restricted diffusion, consistent with acute infarction.
Acute infarct in the left temporal/parietal lobe 2.
Enhancement along the anterior portion of the left parietal lobe may represent post op changes or residual tumor.
Rule out post operativ  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old man with subdural evacuation on the left.
Rule out post operative hemorrhage and midline shift.
CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post subdural evacuation on the left, rule out post-operative hemorrhage or midline shift.
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There are previous post-operative changes in the left posterior temporal occipital region with new left tempoaro occipital post- surgical changes noted.
There is increased hypodensity in the left frontal lobe (2A, 14).
There is slightly increased pneumocephalus in this area when compared to prior.
IMPRESSION: There is subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation and increased hypodensity in the left frontal lobe that raises the possibility of infarct.
On [**10-28**] he went to the OR for craniectomy, left parietal tumor excision.
On POD#1, the morning of [**10-29**], he was more aphasic, and a repeat CT demonstrated increased edema causing 7mm MLS; dexamethasone was increased and he remained in the ICU.
On POD#4, the pt was noted to be increasingly somnolent, and MRI this day, [**11-1**], demonstrated post-surgical changes including left temporoparietal craniotomy with wedge-shaped infarct within the left parietal lobe.
Stable appearance of left hemispheric subdural hemisphere with associated 1.1-cm midline shift.
Post-op he regained his alertness, but remained aphasic with difficulty finding words.
Routine post-op CT showed the loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation and increased hypodensity in the left frontal lobe; ?
new bleed R occipital lobe.
