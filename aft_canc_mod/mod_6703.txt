Admission Date:  [**2126-12-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-8-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lactose / Pollen Extracts / Acetylcysteine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 72 yo F with SCC of the throat s/p layrngetctomy preseting with respiratory distress at home.
Her prosthesis was changed due to leaking with an indwelling advantage 10.0 mm tracheoesophageal puncture voice prosthesis.
After receiving her acetylcysteine neb, the son reports the patient looked pale, and complained of diffuse pruritus.
She quickly became altered, appearing confused and not responding appropriately to questions.
[**Name (NI) **] son brought her to her bedroom for humidified oxygen, but patient became agitated and "itchy".
Breathing became worse, and her son removed the laryngotomy tube to look for mucus plug, which was absent.
By the time EMS arrived, the patient continued to be SOB and disoriented.
Of note, the patient has recently been hospitalized for multiple episodes of mucous plugging and shortness of breath.
On [**2126-12-12**] she had XRT that had to be aborted when she developed severe respiratory distress and taken to [**Hospital1 3597**] ED.
She had a code blue from a mucous plug and improved once a large mucous plug had been suctioned from her airway and she was discharged home.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care, where CT Chest revealed effusion with evidence of profound lung and nodal metastatic disease.
Past Medical History:  - Metastatic squamous cell cancer of throat.
Recurrence in [**2125**] and underwent resection and multiple repeat resections including and modified radical neck dissection 9/[**2125**].
She is now known to have recurrence in the mediastinum, trachea, and the floor of the  mouth, as well as multiple pulmonary mets from PET evaluation in [**2126-9-4**].
- GERD - Osteoporosis  Social History: Denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.
Sublingual leukoplakia occupying most of right sublingual space/ ventral surface of tongue.
Stoma 2cm above jugular notch, without erythema or exudate.
No cervical or supraclaviuclar LAD noted.
Lungs:  CTABL without WRR Cardiovascular: I/VI pansytostlic murmur across precordium.
NT/ND Extremities: Trace edema b/l.
No focal deficits in strength.
No cerebellar defects noted.
No definite opacity to suggest pneumonia, though a superimposed process at the right base cannot be entirely excluded.
A trace amount of barium was seen leaking through the prosthetic which was consistent with what was seen at the bedside.
No liquid was observed entering the trachea / airway and there was no evidence of a fistula at any other location.
- SUMMARY: The exam today confirmed the trace amount of a leak seen at the bedside yesterday and earlier today on exam, but this is likely accounted for by recent placement of the TEP and no liquid was entering the airway.
She is able to voice adequately but we will need to ensure frequent care of her stoma as she accumulates dried secretions quickly which will impact her respiratory status.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 80015**] presented with mental status changes and respiratory distress.
Of note, there was concern for possible tracheoesophageal fistulas in addition to the known tract for the tracheoesophageal prosthesis.
Speech and swallow performed a bedside evaluation that revealed a small fluid leak around the prosthesis but no other obvious fistulas.
The patient's symptoms including delirium resolved.
8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: [**1-5**]  Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath, wheeze.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma of the throat   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
It is unclear whether this was actually an allergic reaction or from increased secretions and mucus.
Regardless, you can just use the albuterol nebulizer treatments as needed for shortness of breath.
