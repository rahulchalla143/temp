In addition, he noted that he has episodes of lightheadedness in the morning when he sits up in bed.
Pt has a chronic cough and has DOE at baseline that may be slightly worsening over the last 2 weeks.
ROS was negative for chest pain, chest pressure, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, jaw pain, arm pain, numbness or tingling, orthopnea, PND, URI symptoms, dizziness, syncope, abdominal pain, diarrhea, joint pain, myalgias, increased sputum production .
Hypoxemia and severe emphysema.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2178**], treated with chemotherapy at [**Hospital1 4601**].
Pulmonary hypertension from longstanding emphysema and COPD.
He has had no recent travel.
- ETOH: 4 ounces of gin per day - Illicit drugs:  None  Family History: His family history is significant for his father passing away at the age of 84 from a myocardial infarction and had a history of prostate cancer, and his mother passing away at 75 from leukemia; she had no cardiac or pulmonary problems.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No pulsatile liver, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is patchy right base opacity which may in part relate to overlying structures, though is more prominent than on the prior study, underlying consolidation from infection or aspiration is of concern.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Cardiology A. Prelim Right Heart cath ([**2182-3-19**]) BRIEF HISTORY:   75 year old male with history of severe copd with worsening RV function.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:  PROCEDURE: Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 13mmHg at baseline with minimal change with 100%FiO2 and nitric oxide.
There was severely elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of PASP of 77mmHg with minimal change with admistration of 100% fio2 or nitric oxide.
There was mildly reduced cardiac index at baseline of 1.93L/min/m2 with mild improvement with introduction of 100%fi02 and nitric oxide.
Severe pulmonary artery hypertension not responsive to inhaled vasodilators.
Severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
Elevated PCW consistent with mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
B. ECHO ([**2182-3-20**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with global hypokinesis and pressure-volume overload of the left ventricle.
At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 75-year-old man with severe COPD and new diagnosis of right sided heart failure presents with weakness and low BP secondary to hypovolemia responsive to fluid resuscitation in setting of URI.
Right heart cath showed severe pulmonary artery hypertension not responsive to oxygen or inhaled vasodilators and severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure with mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
# Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia: Patient presented to the ED with low BP and positive troponin (0.39) in setting of renal failure.
He was transferred for concern of cardiogenic shock; however, his blood pressure was responsive to fluid resuscitation.
Given labile blood pressures in the ER, he was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.
CXR is not remarkable for severe fluid overload.
His presentation is consistent with volume depletion in setting of possible URI.
Given his presentation, it is possible but less likely that he had an acute coronary event leading to worsened CO.
He may have had some component of demand given hypovolemia with cardiac biomarkers trending downward with fluid resuscitation (CK-MB 15 to 9, Trop 0.39 to 0.31).
During hospitalization, his blood pressure trended to SBP 90s without signs/symptoms of end-organ perfusion with associated tachycardia to low 100s.
To explore his hemodynamics, a right heart catheterization was performed showing  severe pulmonary artery hypertension not responsive to inhaled vasodilators in addition to severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure and mild LV diastolic dysfunction (see attached report for full details).
He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] (heart failure) and pulmonary medicine.
# Severe Emphysema: Pt has long history of tobacco use and has been diagnosed with COPD since [**2175**].
During hospitalization, he had no increase in oxygen requirement or change in the nature of his symptoms.
# Acute on chronic renal failure Patient's true baseline Cr unknown but may be around 1.1- 1.4.
He presented in acute renal failure with Cr 2.1 secondary to pre-renal azotemia that was responsive to fluid resuscitation.
No signs or symptoms of withdrawal during hospitalization.
Oxygen Continuous Oxygen 3L NP for O2 sat < 88% on RA 2. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheeze/sob.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury Hypovolemia Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had weakness at home and low blood pressure that we think was due to dehydration from the torsemide.
We found that you have elevated blood pressures in your lungs that is not reversible with medicines.
Please weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Also call for decreasing weights and feelings of fatigue or lightheadedness.
