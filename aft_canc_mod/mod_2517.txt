CXR: FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright" with excessive lordotic positioning, as compared with studies dated [**2170-4-11**] and [**2169-2-21**]; the overall appearance has not much changed.
The lung volumes remain low with bibasilar vascular crowding, but no focal airspace process.
Allowing for these factors, the heart is top normal in size with only equivocal upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution, but no overt CHF or pleural effusion.
