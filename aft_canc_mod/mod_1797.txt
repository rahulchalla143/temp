She was admitted to the ENT service for right vocal cord injection performed on [**2191-3-15**]; she was noted to have progressive odynophagia and dysphonia, believed to be from right cervical mass pressing on vocal cord.
Her symptoms were so severe that she had poor oral intake and was coming in for IV fluids.
She was intubated [**2191-3-15**] and had injection of the right vocal cord; at that time she was noted to have candidal laryngitis and esophageal laryngitis.
After the procedure yesterday, she had improvement in her voice and decreased odynophagia.
In particular, she has dyspnea on exertion, and her odynophagia has returned.
She denies chest pain.
It was favored that this may be aspiration pneumonitis or mucous plugging.
Patient had continuing respiratory distress despite multiple nebs.

The right ventricular cavity appears dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-3-17**], LV systolic function appears more vigourous (in the setting of increased tachycardia and more pressor support).
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 58-year-old woman with metastatic SCLC admitted to ENT service for injection of right vocal cord, was symptomatically improved after procedure.
She had worsening tachypnea and was initially transferred to the hospitalist service prior to transfer to the MICU for hypotension and respiratory distress.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure Thought to be related to poor lung reserve from SCLC and surgery, as well as a new LLL pneumonia that was presumed to be aspiration related.
#STEMI: On the day prior to her death she was noted to have ECG changes consistent with an ST elevation MI.
Treated likely pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, micafungin, voriconazole and zosyn.
Echo was obtained to assess heart function, which showed global hypokinesis with LVEF of 25%.
A subsequent echo confirmed severe RV hypokinesis.
# SCLC: Widespread disease; patient now with poor functional status, unable to meet her nutritional needs.
