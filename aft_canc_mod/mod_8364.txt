In ED, she was found to have guaiac + black stool with HCT =19.
On arrival she was HD stable, but had one episode of frank melena.
She remained HD stable overnight without further melena.
A repeat non-contrast head CT was done, which was c/w new metastatic lesions.
Today neurosurgery and radiation oncology both recommended MRI to further characterize lesions give h/o multiple emboli.
Currently she has no complaints.
Small cell lung CA diagnosed [**10-28**] during admission for cough/fatigue/wt loss.

HTN 5.
Anemia 6.
GERD 7.  h/o guaiac + black stool: colonoscopy [**12-28**] with hemorrhagic ulcers in cecum c/w ischemia vs emoli, AVM, internal.
CVA [**12-28**] - multiple emboli in bilateral occipital lobes, the right basal ganglia and both cerebellar hemispheres 9.
Mother - died of stomach CA   Physical Exam: PE: 97.9, 140/70, 98, 140/70, 97% RA gen: well appearing, pleasant, responds to questions appropriately heent: mmm, OC clear, neck supple lungs: scattered rhonchi with wheeze, poor air movement throughout cv: rrr, no m abd: soft, thin, nt ext: w/wp, no edema neuro: A+O x 3, CN II - XII intact, motor strength symmetric [**5-29**] all extremities, no Babinski, poor finger to nose/rapid alternating movement  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
Within the right and left cerebellar hemispheres, there are two foci of increased density, which are well circumscribed, and likely represent metastatic foci.
These measure approximately 12 mm on the right and 10 mm within the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Additionally, there is a third lesion within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe, which measures approximately 12 mm.
The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
Within the occipital lobes bilaterally, there is focal encephalomalacia from prior infarct.
No lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified within the visualized osseous structures.
These are consistent with new metastatic foci, which were not previously seen on the prior study.
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.

New brain lesions  She has a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, and was found on CT to have potential new brain metastases.
This was confirmed by MRI, which demonstrated 4 brain metastases with edema, but no mass effect.
Her goals of care and code status were discussed during this admission, and - in light of this evidence of her further progressed disease - she and her family decided together that she is DNR/DNI, and that she wants no further invasive/aggressive treatment.
Specifically, no further chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any other aggressive treatment.
GIB  She has a history of GI bleeding in the setting of cecal ulcers and AVM.
She presented with significant GI bleeding with Hct of 19 in the context of supratherapeutic INR of 11.
She was managed in the ICU with Vit K, FFP, and supportive blood transfusions.
She thereafter remained hemodynamically stable, had no further GI bleeding, and her Hct remained stable.
The risks of recurrent embolic stroke were outweighed by the benefit of holding her coumadin in the setting of active GI bleeding and new hemorrhagic brain metastases.
Advanced stage Small Cell lung cancer 2.
Brain metastases - on decadron; no XRT 3.
GI bleeding, resolved 4. history of cecal ulcers, avm 5.
History of embolic stroke - no further anticoagulation secondary to brain metastases and GI bleeding   Discharge Condition: fair  Discharge Instructions: Call your doctor for any rectal bleeding/blood in stool, or any new weakness, numbness, difficutly speaking or swallowing, or any other concerns.
