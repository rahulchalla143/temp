She was seen in clinic Monday [**5-10**] and was found to have superficial phlebitis of the left lower leg, which responded to heating pads.
She now has worsening lower extremity pain now in the medial thigh, which was so severe that she felt like she was going to pass out.
She presented to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, where an ultrasound showed new DVT, and she was started on heparin 1400/hr.
No CT chest was performed; Head CT was negative, no rectal recorded.
CTA showed Large bilateral PE, Saddle embolus at pulmonary artery; may also be clot extending into right ventricle, right atrium but difficult to tell due to motion.
ROS: negative for blurry vision, headache, SOB, cough, rash Stable nausea, vomiting, diarrhea from chemotherapy.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Metastatic jejunal adenoCA HTN DM2 HLD  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - Early [**2189**]: Began experiencing vague abdominal discomfort, bloating, intermittent nausea/vomiting, and weight loss from poor PO intake.
- [**2189-3-21**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for SBO after MR enterography revealed dilatation of the proximal small bowel with a transition point in the mid-jejunum.
Just distal to the transition point, there was evidence of intussusception with a 2 cm stretch of circumferential bowel wall thickening concerning for a mass lesion.
Pathology revealed a 2.7 cm x 2.1 cm x 1.1 cm poorly-differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis propria into the subserosa (pT3).
There were six lymph nodes available for examination, four of which demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma (pN2).
There was evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
There was no perineural invasion.
PET CT showed questionable increased uptake in portal lymph node.
- [**2189-6-9**]: Underwent repeat laparotomy to evaluate rising CEA for possible wide excision of small bowel mesentery.
Intra-operatively, was found to have multiple small deposits along the small bowel mesentery, pathology of which confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma.

ABDOMEN: obes abdomen, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no obvious deformities.
CT Head ([**2190-5-16**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Evaluation for metastasis is limited and would be better performed with a contrast MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9304**].
CT Chest ([**2190-5-16**]):  IMPRESSION: Extensive pulmonary emboli involving all lobes with a saddle embolus across the main PA with signs of right heart [**Year (4 digits) 16089**].
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis with apical sparing (positive [**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign for acute RV [**Last Name (un) 16089**]/pulmonary embolism).
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Saddle PE and PE's: Her main risk factor for PE is her malignancy.
She was commenced on a heparin gtt at [**Hospital 1562**] hospital after presenting there with LE pain and a brief episode of lightheadedness.
On 5/14am, she became hypotensive and presyncopal, requiring a dopamine gtt and arterial line placement; cardiology was reconsulted and systemic TPA was given, with a plan to pursue catheter based thrombolysis only if systemic thrombolysis failed.
There was discussion of whether the patient would benefit from IVC filter, in the event that she becomes thrombocytopenic with chemo and is unable to continue treatment.
CHRONIC ISSUES:  # jejeunal adenocarcinoma with peritoneal mets: She is on palliative chemotherapy with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab.
You received clot-busting medication and you did not experience bleeding complications.
