The night prior to admission ([**6-12**]) he started having three episodes of bloody diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping.
The day of admission he had another episode of large bloody diarrhea.
He went to dialysis and finished his full session, but was somewhat hypotensive with BP<90, so was referred to the ED.
During dialysis patient felt lightheaded and had low blood pressure.
He underwent a CTA of his abdomen which showed a 2.8cm hyperenhancement in the wall of the proximal transverse colon concerning for malignancy.
He was prepped and GI did a colonscopy which showed a mass in the distal ascending colon as well as multiple polyps.
He has has serial Hcts and was tranfused second unit of pRBC in the ICU.

NECK: Supple, no cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy LUNGS: Good air movement, resp unlabored, crackles in the [**11-30**] of lower lung fields.
HEART: No JVD, RRR, diminished heart sounds, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses, +BS EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused, no edema SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
Enhancing mass in the cecum with associated wall thickening and features to suggest ulceration c/w new malignancy.
No intraluminal contrast extravasation to suggest active GI bleeding.
Multiple rim-enhancing hepatic lesions concerning for metastatic disease.
Proctocolitis involving rectum and sigmoid colon, could reflect inflammatory or infectious pathology.
A ulcerated 2-3 cm mass with stigmata of recent bleeding of malignant appearance was found in the distal ascending colon; appeared more proximal than seen on CT.
Pathology: GI Biopsy: [**2168-6-14**]: Report Pending  Brief Hospital Course: 86 year-old male with ESRD on HD (MWF), HTN, DM2, dCHF presented with hypotension in the setting of multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea.
# GI Bleed: Patient presented with blood pressures in the 70s systolic in the setting of acute GI bleeding.
He then had CTA abdomen which showed an enhancing mass in the cecum with features suggesting malignancy.
He was prepared for colonoscopy which showed ulcerated 2-3 cm mass in the distal ascending colon with stigmata of recent bleeding of malignant appearance.
In the MICU patient received another unit of transfusion for low hematocrit.
However he continued to be hemodynamically stable and did not have any more bloody stools.
Before being transfered to the floor patient received an extra session of dialysis for desaturating in the low 90s in the setting of being volume overloaded.
On the floor patient continued to have stable blood pressure with no blood in the stool.
Given patient's stable condition, the family along with different teams involved decided to discharge patient with GI and primary care follow up for outpatient malignancy work pending the results of the GI biopsy.
# Anemia: Patient anemia is most likely from anemia of CKD worsened with acute GI bleeding.
# Chronic Hypertension: Per patient's family patient has history of HTN but was discontinued from oral hypertensives by PCP few months ago because of feelings of lightheadedness and low blood pressure post dialysis sessions.
# Liver lesions: Given presence of ulcerated mass on colonoscopy, the liver lesions are concerning for metastatic cancer.
# ESRD on HD: On MWF schedule.
He was dialyzed on [**6-14**] and [**6-15**] with removal of total 4L fluids because of increasing weight and desats to low 90s.
# Diastolic CHF: LVEF 55% with Grade II diastolic dysfunction in [**2165**].
As above, patient had desats to low 90s in the setting of volume overload from blood transfusions and IVF.
Patient did not complain of any chest pain or SOB and after his dialysis sessions, he was successfully weaned off of O2.
His aspirin was discontinued due to GI bleeding and possible upcoming procedures.
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable.
Continued Lipitor .
# BPH: Stable.
End Stage Renal Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
