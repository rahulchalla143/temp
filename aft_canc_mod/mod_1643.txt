10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..  CXR: [**2155-8-23**]: The current study demonstrates no distinctive evidence of pneumothorax.
Right basal opacity is unchanged, but there is significant improvement of the left basal aeration consistent with partial resolution of atelectasis.
There are significantly progressed bibasilar consolidations, in particular in the right lower lung that might be consistent with interval development of aspiration given the rapid change, atelectasis, would be other possibility, although appears to be less likely radiologically.
Rapidly developing infection should also be considered.
On the other hand, there is improvement in the left upper lung aeration consistent with resolution of atelectasis.
