When compared to prior, there has been significant interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions which are now moderate in size.
Underlying airspace disease is also possible.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions since prior exam with possible underlying airspace disease not excluded.
EKG [**2120-4-4**] low voltage, SR at 90bpm no ST changes prior ECG without such low voltage in lateral precordial leads .
The pericardium demonstrates no evidence of effusion.
Small left pleural effusion is decreased in size compared to the most recent prior examination.
There has been interval resolution of right-sided pleural effusion.
A 6 mm nodule in the right lung base is present (series 2, image 1).
Additional nodularity within the right lung base measuring approximately 10 mm (series 2, image 10) and 6 mm linear density within the right lung base (series 2, 8) represent atelectasis versus infectious process.
Pleural-based nodularity at the left lung base measures approximately 6 mm.
There is moderate intrahepatic bile duct dilation predominantly involving left lobe of the liver with new pneumobilia compared to [**2120-3-6**], which may be secondary to hepaticojejunostomy.
A 12-mm enhancing focus in the right lobe of the liver demonstrates arterial enhancement and is isodense on the venous phase and may represent enhancing metastasis versus perfusion abnormality.
Hypodense area involving the right and left lobes of the liver extending from the porta hepatis to the periphery is new since most recent prior examination and may represent infiltrative tumor or metastases versus perfusion abnormality.
The spleen and bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
The upper poles of bilateral kidneys demonstrate thinned cortex similar to [**2120-3-6**] and may represent prior ischemic injury.
Persistent thrombus of the main portal vein, right and left portal veins, the upper portion of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein is again noted.
There is mild calcification at the origin of the celiac artery.
There is minimal irregularity of the common hepatic artery.
The SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and bilateral renal vessels appear unremarkable.
There is stranding of the mesentery which may represent edema versus tumor involvement.
There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
Pelvic lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathology.
There is mild anasarca.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy are identified.
Bilateral pigtail catheters in appropriate position with resolution of right and improved small left pleural effusion.
6 mm nodule at the right lung base.
Additional nodular densities within the right lung base may represent atelectasis or infections.
Moderate intrahepatic bile duct dilatation especially in the left lobe, not significantly changed from [**2120-3-6**].
New pneumobilia within the left lobe of the liver may be secondary to hepatojejunostomy.
Persistent occlusion of main portal vein, right and left main portal veins, upper portion of the SMV and the splenic vein.
Large area of low density involving the right and left lobes of the liver extending from the porta hepatis to the periphery may represent infiltrative tumor or metastases versus perfusion abnormality.
Small enhancing focus in segment VI of the right lobe of the liver measuring 12 mm may represent enhancing metastases versus perfusion abnormality.
Stranding of the mesentery may represent edema versus tumor infiltration.
Mild anasarca.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CON MRI Abdomen FINDINGS: The previously noted bilateral pleural effusions have resolved.
There is small volume ascites.
There is persistent portal vein occlusion with nonenhancing thrombus seen extending into the right anterior, right posterior,left and main portal vein.
No evidence of thrombus enhancement to suggest tumor thrombus.
There is persistent biliary dilatation, more pronounced in the left hepatic lobe.
This biliary dilatation has progressively increased over interval studies over the last 12 months.
There are significant peribiliary varices, secondary to the portal vein occlusion, which may be contributing to some stenosis at the level of the hepaticojejunostomy (1002:62).
There is pneumobilia (6:11), which suggests patency of the hepaticojejunostomy, however.
On the post-contrast images, there is perfusional abnormality involving the left hepatic lobe.
No evidence of a concerning mass-like hepatic lesion to suggest a metastasis.
There is abnormal soft tissue, however, encasing the celiac axis and involving the SMA.
This soft tissue extends along the proximal SMA as an abnormal soft tissue cuff (1002:65).
Narrowing and encasement of the celiac trunk is best appreciated on image (1001:50).
Incidental note is made of small Tarlov cysts in the lower sacrum (4:22).
No concerning marrow abnormality identified in the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Signal change in the liver following contrast likely reflects perfusion changes secondary to chronic portal vein thrombosis.
No evidence of metastatic tumor to the hepatic parenchyma.
Abnormal soft tissue encasing the celiac axis extending inferiorly to involve the SMA resulting in vessel narrowing.
These features are highly concerning for local tumor recurrence.
Progressive, predominantly left-sided intrahepatic biliary dilatation with prominent peribiliary varices .

HOSPITAL COURSE #pleural effusions/dyspnea - reaccumulation of pleural fluid in setting of known portal vein thrombosis with recurrent transudative ascites and pleural effusions.
Left pleural effusion is new this admission.
IP was consulted who originally placed bilateral pigtails with a massive amount of drainage on a daily basis from both.
She was tried on steroids empirically without resolution of drainage.
The etiology of her pleural effusions is unknown.
Due to her portal hypertension, it was presumed secondary to hepatic hydrothorax, but throughout her admission we noted that she had minimal to no ascites and yet would put out 4-5 liters daily from the pleural space.
Renal, cardiac and liver disease were ruled out.
The pleural and ascitic fluid from previous taps over the last few months have all consistently been extremely transudative without any evidence of malignancy.
When her pancreatic cancer was found to have reoccurred via MRI (done to better evaluate her portal vein thrombosis ?bland thrombus vs tumor thrombus), we felt that her effusions might have been related to a capillary leak paraneoplastic process, because after starting chemotherapy her effusions slowed.
# stage IIB pancreatic adenocarcinoma ??????
CA [**27**]-9 had been rising as an outpatient for the past few months, without clear evidence of a recurrence.
Finally MRI of the abdomen was done which showed a suspicious soft tissue mass in the resection bed.
# hypotension/volume status - A major issue and the main driver of her lengthy hospitalization.
We were unable, through any intervention (colloid or crystalloid), to improve her volume status without causing significant pleural output into both lungs.
She was placed on an octreotide drip for possible hepatorenal syndrome (noted due to orthodeoxia when standing, however after further analysis we noted that her orthodeoxia was more likely due to hypoperfusion because of extreme orthostasis (sbp in the 40s while standing)).
Cardiology, interventional pulmonary and liver were all consulted, who all agreed that her orthostasis was due to severe hypovolemia, so she was uptitrated to max dose florinef, salt tabs and midodrine.
After taking these medications, she was able to stand without symptomatic hypotension and walk with minimal assistance.
Still pt appears dry on exam and history c/w volume depletion (recent diarrhea and limited mobility/access to PO intake).
She was volume resuscitated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with resultant worsening of her pleural effusions.
#pancreatic insufficiency - diabetes and enzyme deficiency.
Issues with hyperglycemia when on steroids requiring aggressive uptitration of her insulin regimen.
When off of steroids and after starting octreotide (an inhibitor of pancreatic function) she developed severe symptomatic hypoglycemia requiring discontinuation of her insulin.
She also had large volumes of diarrhea due to her pancreatic enzyme deficiency s/p whipple.
Has had asictes requiring taps over the last several months but no ascites on presentation.
Liver was consulted who felt that she should not have portal hypertension without cirrhosis, however her cirrhosis workup was negative and she has known Grade II esophageal varices.
We attempted to find an intervention to remove/lyse this clot, however in discussion with many different services found no options (the clot was present for too long to be lysed with TPA via IR, and would require an open abdominal surgery with reconstruction via vascular/transplant).
Transitional Issues - Please continue to drain 500-1500cc of fluid from the pleurex catheter as needed for comfort.
7. loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
9. opium tincture 10 mg/mL Tincture Sig: Four (4) drop PO every four (4) hours as needed for constipation.
12. diphenoxylate-atropine 2.5-0.025 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for diarrhea.
13. insulin Please see attached Insulin Sliding Scale   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] at the [**Doctor Last Name 1263**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pleural effusions s/p pleurex catheter placement Portal vein thrombosis Pancreatic cancer (recurred) Orthostatic hypotension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for shortness of breath and found to have a reaccumulation of the fluid around your right lung as well as a new fluid collection around your left lung.
