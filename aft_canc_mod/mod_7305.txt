This morning her pain was [**6-14**] which was of the same quality but did not resolve with nitroglycerin.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED where she did not have ECG changes or positive biomarkers.
Of note patient reports baseline SBP is in 80s and at times requires fluid boluses as an outpatient for poor PO intake with chemo.
Given significant cardiac history, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and brought to the cath lab.
Cardiac cath showed stable configuration of the native and bypass vessels, with no new lesions.
Of note, patient had a screening colonoscopy in [**2106-12-4**] which found a colonic polyp but no intervention undertaken at that time.
She was taking lactulose for prep and was having significant clear diarrhea from it.
4 months ago she developed diarrhea and stopped the laxatives without improvement.
She was seen at an OSH for this diarrhea and was told it was likely viral and that it would resolve with conservative measures.
She has previously had problems with GI bleeding (red blood in toilet bowl), most recently 1 month ago, but not recently.

CAD s/p CABG 3.
?seizure disorder 4.
5. h/o peptic ulcer 6.
Chronic neck and back pain from herniated discs  Social History: Social history is significant for the presence of current tobacco use - previously 5ppd ([**8-14**]) years ago - now less but patient cannot quantify.
Family History: There is significant family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death in multiple family members  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.6, BP 98/52 on 5.0 mcg/kg/min of dopamine, HR 63, RR 23, O2 100% on 3L NC Gen: WDWN middle aged female in NAD, resp or otherwise.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with nondistended JVP CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
III/VI systolic murmur at the base.
no radiation to carotids.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no new critical coronary disease.
The LMCA had no obstructive coronary disease.
The LAD had minimal coronary disease.
The LCX had diffuse disease with a 70% stenosis in OM1 with stenosis in a small distal part of the vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed low systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 67 mm Hg off of dopamine with IV fluids wide open.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Patchy airspace disease at both lung bases posteriorly (left greater than right).
An element of aspiration in posterior lobes cannot be excluded.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
2 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
ECHO [**2107-3-30**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with post-op state however early right ventricular volume overload cannot be excluded (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CAD: Patient was taken to cath lab because history suggestive of unstable angina given her significant history and symptoms similar to known angina.
Cardiac cath did not demonstrate any significant new lesions.
Her ECHO was repeated and showed EF>55 and abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with post-op state however early right ventricular volume overload cannot be excluded.
Chest pain: Likely due to her know chronic stable angiina.
Patient ruled out for ACS by cardiac cath, PE by negative CTA of chest, and no indications of pericarditis by EKG and ECHO.
Repeat ECHO showed preserved EF and no gross wall motion abnormalitis.
It does not seem that she was adequately volume resuscitated and by history and physical she is likely volume depleted, and likely chronic.
She was discharged with SBP 80s, and patient knows to continue holding her BP medications for any hypotension.
No active issues but chemotherapy treatment may be contributing to patient's poor PO intake.
Chronic neck and back pain She was initially several doses of dilaudid based on patient's account of home medications.
