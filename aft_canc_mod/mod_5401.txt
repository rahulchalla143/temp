Was here to have pleurex catheter placed but was having abdominal pain, fevers, and nausea and was sent to the ED.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Bipolar HTN Past Surgical History; TAH Appendectomy  Social History: Married, lives with husband and son, drinks one glass of wine per day, former smoker   Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: In ED 97.4, 94, 86/54 to 149/71 96% 3L NC NAD RRR decreased Breath sounds in bases R>L Abdomen soft, obese, nondistended, no tympany, Midline incision inferior to umbilicus well healed with 2 small incisional hernias.
EXT: warm and dry   Pertinent Results: JP drain fluid  GRAM STAIN (Final [**2123-4-7**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Dilated loops of small bowel up to 3.5 cm, with air-fluid levels, and transition point in small ventral hernia in the midline lower abdomen, after which bowel loops are decompressed, and contain no oral contrast.
This appearance is concerning for small-bowel obstruction, although the presence of gas within the colon and rectum suggests that it may be an early obstruction, or a partial obstruction.
Heterogeneous 6.3 x 2.5 cm fluid collection posterior to the right hepatectomy resection margin could represent post-surgical change and material such as Surgicel, although it is difficult to exclude abscess formation.
Increased size of multiple hypodense lesions within the liver concerning for progression of metastatic disease.
Unchanged appearance of ill-defined hypodense lesion within the spleen.
Large right pleural effusion and right lower lobe atelectasis Small left pleural effusion.
An abdominal CT was done showing dilated loops of small bowel up to 3.5 cm, with air-fluid levels.
Point of obstruction appeared to be a ventral hernia in the lower abdominal wall.
A heterogeneous 6.3 x 2.5 cm fluid collection posterior to the right hepatectomy resection was noted.
There was increased size of multiple hypodense lesions within the liver concerning for progression of metastatic disease and small-volume ascites.
A large right pleural effusion and right lower lobe atelectasis with a small left pleural effusion was noted.
She remained on O2 nasal cannula with diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes.
The pleurx catheter was removed on [**4-14**] due to persistent leaking at the connection site to the pleuravac.
On [**2123-5-4**] a talc pleuradesis was performed on her right lung with follow-up CXRs with no PTX and stable pleural effusion.
Most recent Chest xray on [**5-7**] shows: the bilateral moderate pleural effusions are unchanged with associated right lower lobe atelectasis.
WBC was 17 on admission with downward trend to 11.
She had a UTI with a resistant strain of E coli.
There was also concern for urinary retention.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**] team was consulted regarding possibility of repairing ventral hernia.
Given bile leak, infection and effusion repair was deferred at this time.
The plan was for her to go to rehab facility for further rehab, as she is requiring assistive devices and has increased O2 requirements with activity.
