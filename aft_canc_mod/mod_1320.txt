The patient had 3/10 chest pain and abdominal pain for several hours prior to presentation.
The patient reports that his CP is associated with stretching and positional changes.
His abdominal pain is gasy and periumbilical - currenlty absent.
A CT was done that showed a large pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade.
Cardiology was called and an ECHO was done which showed a new localized pericardial effusion with RA collapse and a small RV.
The CT also showed worsening metastatic disease.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He has been just recently starting to do physical therapy and ambulating after his recent stroke and ambutation.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: - CVA on [**7-/2195**] of R MCA territory on Coumadin then transitioned to Lovenox - [**8-/2195**] presented with cold RLE, underwent angioplasty which failed, and then underwent superficial femoral artery to dorsalis pedis bypass graft with non reversed saphenous vein, venous angioscopy with valve lysis, venovenostomy on [**2195-8-21**].
- Mediastinal lymphadenopathy confirmed to be metastatic adenocarcinoma by biopsy, unclear primary.
- Prostate cancer status post XRT in the [**2178**] - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - Cholecystitis s/p cholecystectomy - Colon polyps - Varicose veins - Gallstones - h/o kidney stones - chronic back pain - ?
Says that his brother and sisters had cancer but that he is not sure of what type, that there is a lot of diabetes in his family.
His father died of prostate cancer at the age of 65 and his mother died of some sort of abdominal cancer; however, they are not sure exactly what type of cancer this was.
Very sad and depressed about new diagnosis HEENT: Sclera anicteric.
PERRL, Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Distant heart sounds.
Mild crackles at bases.
Bronchial breath sounds over RUL.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Large right-sided pericardial effusion with moderate compression of the right ventricle.
Worsened metastatic disease including enlargement of subclavicular, mediastinal, right hilar lymph nodes and enlargement of multiple pulmonary nodules including spiculated lesion within the right lung apex.
New small right greater than left pleural effusions.
Multiple low dense liver lesions, too small to characterize.
Recommend dedicated liver evaluation with either CT or MRI.
Multiple hypodense lesions within the kidneys bilaterally, incompletely characterized.
Sustained RA diastolic collapse, c/w low filling pressures or early tamponade.
RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
[**2195-10-17**] 01:10AM   GLUCOSE-110* UREA N-23* CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-13 [**2195-10-17**] 01:10AM   WBC-9.9 RBC-3.24* HGB-8.9* HCT-27.9* MCV-86 MCH-27.4 MCHC-31.7 RDW-18.0*  Brief Hospital Course: Pericardial effusion: Pericardial effusion is most likely secondary to malignancy given his history of adenocarcinoma and also his subclinical presentation.
He had a pericardiocentesis with drainage of 400cc of bloody fluid.
He remained hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.
His lovenox was initially held during the first day of admission, however a repeat echo demonstrated resolution of pericardial effusion and thus his lovenox was restarted.
His repeat [**Month/Day/Year 461**] showed the resolution of tamponade physiology and a very small pericardial effusion.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma: Patient has previously undergone extensive work-up with FNA by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that showed a metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary.
The pathology from this  lesion was positive for cytokeratin but negative for PSA, PSAP, and TTF1, consistent with metastatic carcinoma but not supportive of prostatic origin.
PET scan on [**2195-7-29**] showed marked uptake within supraclavicular pretracheal and precarinal mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as minimal FDG uptake in the distal esophagus.
Per consultation with Oncology, chemotherapy deferred at this point given poor performance status.
UTI:  He was found to have a UTI during this hospitalization.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion with tamponade Metastatic adenocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a cardiac tamponade, a collection of fluid around your heart.
You were treated with a pericardiocentesis or draining of fluid from your heart.
You were diagnosed with a urinary tract infection.
You should call Dr.[**Name (NI) 25445**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] if you are experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or worsening pain that you are unable to manage at home.
You are being discharged with prescriptions for Roxanol (morphine) and Ativan which can be used for emergency pain and anxiety relief as needed at home.
