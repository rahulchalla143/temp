Admission Date:  [**2141-6-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-3-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Labetalol / Felodipine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: Refractory right hip pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intramedullary nail stabilization of right femur [**6-8**]  History of Present Illness: This is a 54 year old male with pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**2136**] s/p total pancreatectomy, CCY, splenectomy; solitary recurrence in liver in [**2137**] s/p RFA/hemihepatectomy; second liver recurrence in [**2139**] s/p RFA; T5 metastasis induced cord compression in [**2139**] s/p partial vertebrectomy and XRT; refractory to treatment with cycles gemcitabine, erlotinib, and capecitabine; presenting now with severe refractory right hip pain related to a right femur met.
He was scheduled to have an outpatient right femur stabilization procedure to help his pain on [**6-7**] but the pain became too much to bear at home and he required admission for pain control.
At home he takes oxycontin 140mg TID and Dilaudid 8mg q3 PRN pain which has not been enough to maintain his comfort.
He has no other complaints and is clearly uncomfortable precluding a thorough history.
He had a recent admission for similar hip pain from [**Date range (1) 27916**] during which time his pain meds were titrated up.
He remains weak, but denies any bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anesthesia.
He denies fever, rash, URI symptoms, cough, new abdominal pain, or vomiting/diarrhea.
He was clearly uncomfortable and given IV Dilaudid with minimal effect on his pain.
Leukocytosis to 20 was noted on laboratory studies, with a negative infectious review of systems.
It was felt that this represented stress demargination from severe pain.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Incidental finding of dilated pancreatic duct in [**3-/2136**] after undergoing routine CT imaging for work-up of myeloproliferative disorder.
Pathology demonstrated an intraductal carcinoma with an invasive component measuring 8mm, T1N0Mx, without lymphovascular invasion or positive surgical margins.
% lymph nodes were removed and did not involve carcinoma.
-In [**11/2137**], he developed recurrent disease in segment VI of the liver, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation.
In [**7-/2138**], he underwent right hepatectomy pathology demonstrated almost completely necrotic 2.8 cm focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
-In [**6-/2139**], he developed recurrence disease at the resection site within the right lobe of the liver and underwent radiofrequency ablation again.
-In [**11/2139**], he developed upper back pain and was found to have large destructive metastatic disease at T5 causing compression of the spinal cord.
Biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of pancreatic origin.
-In [**12/2139**], he underwent T5 vertebrectomy and posterior lateral arthrodesis T2 through T8 with local autograft and completed radiation therapy in [**1-/2140**] involving the T3 through T7 area.
-In [**2-/2140**], PORT was placed and he was started capecitabine and oxaliplatin on clinical protocol which was complicated by development of severe enteritis and colitis.
-In [**5-/2140**], he started gemcitabine and erlotinib and completed a total of eight cycles until new disease was demonstrated in the twelfth rib with increased FDG avidity of widespread osseous metastatic disease.
The patient continued to have evidence of worsening metastatic disease involving the bones.
The patient has not received further Zometa in the setting of renal insufficiency.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old male with pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**2136**] s/p total pancreatectomy, CCY, splenectomy; solitary recurrence in liver in [**2137**] s/p RFA/hemihepatectomy; second liver recurrence in [**2139**] s/p RFA; T5 metastasis induced cord compression in [**2139**] s/p partial vertebrectomy and XRT; refractory to treatment with cycles gemcitabine, erlotinib, and capecitabine; presenting now with severe refractory right hip pain related to a right femur met.
The patient has a known right femur met that is the likely cause of his pain.
He was scheduled to have an orthopedic procedure as an outpatient on [**6-7**] to help stabilize the femur with the goal of helping to improve his pain; however, his pain became too much to bear at home on his oral pain regimen and he required admission for IV pain control.
He was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 27916**] for pain control related to this same pain in his right leg/back which required Dilaudid PCA.
The ortho/oncology service was consulted and recommended right femur plain films which ruled out pathologic fracture.
He was taken to the OR on [**6-8**] for intramedullary nail to stabilize his femur with a goal of improving pain and preventing pathologic fracture.
His post-op course was complicated by delirium in the PACU secondary to poor pain control which required a brief ICU stay.
He was started on a Dilaudid drip in the ICU and his delirium quickly resolved.
He will need to remain on anagerlide given his high risk for clot with essential thrombocytosis.
His blood pressure remained elevated up to 190s systolic likely secondary to acute pain.
He was continued on verapamil 240mg daily and hydralazine 25mg was administered q6 PRN for BP>180 as the patient had an allergy documented to labetalol.
Likely due to stress reaction from acute pain as patient has no signs of underlying infection.
He also has essential thrombocytosis which is associated with increased WBC counts in situations of inflammatory stress.
Blood and urine cultures remained negative and several CXRs showed no evidence of pneumonia.
