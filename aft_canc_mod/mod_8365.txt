He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fevers.
He does have some right lower quadrant pain which he reports is chronic.
He denies any melena or hematochezia.
He had no episodes of bright red blood per rectum in the ER.
Prostate cancer status post radiation therapy complicated by radiation proctitis.
Admission for lower GI bleed in [**2177-11-10**] which he had coloscopy which showed diffuse diverticulosis with no sign of active bleeding but positive radiation proctitis.
He had an admission in [**2179-11-11**] in which he had decreased hematocrit down to 23 and guaiac positive stool and Troponin of 2.1.
However by CKs he was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He has a gait disturbance secondary to microvascular cerebral disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency baseline of 1.5.
Congestive heart failure EF 30 to 40%.
Neck is supple with no JVD or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory - soft, bibasilar rales with decreased breath sounds in left upper lobe.
Abdomen with positive bowel sounds, mildly distended with right lower quadrant tenderness.
Extremities - 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute with left axis deviation and early R wave transition.
Q waves in II, III, aVF, V5 and V6 which are old with new T wave inversion in V4.
Transthoracic echo done on [**2179-12-13**] showed EF 30 to 40% with mild symmetric LVH.
Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease.
No evidence of CHF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old white male who was admitted for an episode of bright red blood per rectum.
Did not have any episodes during this admission.
If he had any active bleeding it was decided he would go for a tagged red blood cell scan or an angiogram.
During that procedure it was discovered that he had diverticulosis of the colon and angiectasias in the rectum.
Also discovered was a mass in the proximal ascending colon which was biopsied.
He also had polyps in the ascending colon which were removed.
It was felt that the mass found in the proximal ascending colon was most likely to be adenocarcinoma.
Hematology / Oncology was then also consulted and recommended he have surgery if the family wished for it or palliative care.
Surgery felt that he was in danger of bleeding without intervention.
There were no complications during the actual procedure.
On postoperative day one the patient complained of substernal chest pain and shortness of breath.
The wound site had some drainage of serous sanguinous fluid but was controlled with dressing.
Cardiac - The patient developed substernal chest pain postoperative day one of his surgery.
He had shortness of breath.
The EKG was suggestive of an anterior septal injury.
The pain was slowly responding to medical treatment; however, the ST segments remained elevated after the onset.
He had probably a previous myocardial infarction in the inferior part of his heart resulting in low EF.
Because of his surgery he was not given any IIb or IIIa antagonists.
The EEG had shown ST elevations in V2 were very prominent.
Prior EKG had not showed ST elevations V1 through V4.
He has also had acute inferior leads but that is from an old MI.
It was felt that he had an anteroseptal MI and was brought to cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization revealed left main coronary artery with ulcerated 90% thrombotic stenosis which included the ostium of the LAD.
The LAD had an ostial 90% with moderate calcifications.
The right coronary artery was the nondominant vessel with moderate severe diffuse disease.
The aortic balloon pump was placed because of hypotension after the first dye injection.
He was intubated in the setting of hemodynamic instability.
He also had a type I dissection when the first diagonal was engaged.
He was given fluids for low blood pressure.
He had an episode of atrial fibrillation which he was cardioverted twice; however, it had no effect and was given IV Metoprolol.
He became slightly hypertensive to the Metoprolol but never had a hypertensive crisis.
He had periods of atrial fibrillation but would convert after given 10 mg of Metoprolol.
It was felt that he was in congestive heart failure and had persistent pleural effusions particularly on the left side.
He initially was continued on heparin for his atrial fibrillation; however, because he is not a good candidate for chronic anticoagulation, the heparin was discontinued and he was not started on Coumadin.
Pulmonary - He was initially intubated because of the hypotensive episode during the cardiac catheterization.
However he had secretions and sputum cultures grew out gram negative rods which were never speciated because of mixed flora.
He was started on Ceftazidine which was renally dosed and then because he had a temperature spike through that he was started on Levaquin.
Actually he became afebrile.
He had a poor cough effort and was given chest PT which improved his secretions clearance.
He also had some expiratory wheezes and was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
He responded well to it and did not have any other further episodes of wheezing.
The other issue was his congestive heart failure which caused pleural effusion.
Infectious Disease - He had a temperature spike and felt to have pneumonia secondary to his ventilator experience.
He was then just converted to Levofloxacin after he became afebrile.
His white count remained elevated between 13 and 16; however, no new source of infection was found.
This is most likely secondary to his over diuresis and a prerenal azotemia.
He had one episode during the acute chest pain which he received two units of blood.
Acute myocardial infarction.
