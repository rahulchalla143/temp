MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-2-10**] 12:32 AM IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions of varying sizes throughout the brain, the largest in the left occipital lobe and the left frontal lobe.
The pons and right cerebellar hemisphere are also involved.
These are consistent with metastatic disease and the location of these lesions increases the likelihood of leptomeningeal disease.
Probable metastatic lesion within the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction of the left occipital lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema.
MRI is recommended for further evaluation of this lesion including evaluation for cryptogenic lesions.
Probable left frontal extra-axial meningioma.
