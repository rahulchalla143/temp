Admission Date:  [**2196-10-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-12-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Pituitary tumor  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transphenoidal pituitary tumor resection  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hx of recurrence, who was recently found to have new brain metastatic lesions and a pituitary tumor.
He is in today for a transphenoid pituitary tumor biopsy.
Briefly, pt presented initially to [**Hospital 29684**] Clinic on [**9-19**], [**2196**] with complaints of eye pain, eye lid droop and left eye blurry vision for 1 month.
A brain MRI showed [**2-13**] lesions in the brain consistent with brain metastasis (left inferior cerebellum, left anterior ethmoid).
A pituitary tumor with size of 1.8 x 1.3 cm was also found, which seemed to displace the optic chiasm superiorly and may be involving the adjacent right cavernous sinus.
Besides vision change, pt also endorsed fatigue and low energy level, as well as polydipsia and polydipsia.
Otherwise, he denied HA, no visual field defect, no nausea, vomiting, no focal weakness.
no coordination difficulties, no backaches, no sensory loss, no muscle cramps, no slurred speech, no other pain, no abnormal sensation, no joint aches, no uncontrolled movements.
No heat or cold intolerance.
Metastatic renal cell cancer in [**2181**].
He is status post left nephrectomy, but then had a recurrence in his contralateral kidney, spine and thoracic cavity, which was detected in [**2192**].
He was then placed on a Pfizer study medication for two years, but was discontinued in [**2194**] because of a cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
EXTREMITIES:  mild edema bilaterally.
He does have some chronic skin changes consistent with venous stasis.
Eyes, there is some mild puffiness around the left eyelid with some slight swelling.
No erythema or tenderness.
There was no nystagmus bilaterally.
Neck was soft and supple.
The patient actually could close his eyes very well and raise them well without any difficulty.
There is no evidence of any weakness at all in the facial nerve.
Sensation was intact to light touch, temperature, joint position sense and vibration throughout.
Pertinent Results: MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2196-10-12**] 8:14 AM Reason: pre-op assessment for surgery planning and localization Contrast: MAGNEVIST  FINDINGS:  The enlarged pituitary gland, with macroadenoma, two left cerebellar lesions, the largest measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm and abnormal increased signal in the left anterior ethmoid and frontal sinus are demonstrated.
POSTOP HEAD CT CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2196-10-12**] Reason: Assess for new bleed  IMPRESSION: 1.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Interval development of a small locule of air in the hyperdense cerebellar lesion, of uncertain clinical significance.
No other interval change from the previous study.
Multiple new diffusion abnormalities with evidence of slow diffusion, including the high right frontoparietal junction, bilateral occipital lobes, bilateral thalami, and a small infarct of the brainstem.
Differential diagnosis includes embolic infarcts, reversible encephalopathy or seizure related diffusion changes.
Left cerebellar and left ethmoid metastases are unchanged.
A second small left cerebellar metastasis is suspected on this exam.
This is likely related to retained gadolinium, or less likely from leptomeningeal disease.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2196-10-15**] 8:42 PM  Reason: evaluate for new bleed following fall  IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the brain compared to the previous examination, including redemonstration in the sellar/pituitary soft tissue mass as well as bowing in the medial wall of the left orbit.
EEG [**2196-10-14**] IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow background consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology, or consistent with diffuse and bilateral subcortical dysfunction.
The low amplitude beta activity could represent the  intercurrent use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
No evidence of ongoing epileptogenesis was seen.
CT showed no ICH.
EEG showed no seizure activity.
MRI showed several masses and concern for leptomeningeal enhancement.
GI was consulted, who performed an EGD and saw no signs of active bleeding.
It was thought most likely to be swallowed blood, but since he had signs of gastritis he was started on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
They felt that his UOP and labs were acceptable on [**10-21**] and that he was safe for discharge.
Plastics removed the nasal stents the morning of discharge without difficulty.
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
