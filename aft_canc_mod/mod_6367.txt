She reports blurred vision, decreased hearing on right side, and unsteady gait, walks with a walker at home.
She denies any n/v or dizziness.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: She has a history of dermatomyositis and non-small cell lung cancer, left deep vein thrombosis, and right  breast cancer.
Past Surgical History: She had a right mastectomy for her breast  cancer and a wedge resection of the lower lobe of the left lung for adenocarcinoma.
Family History: Her mother is alive but she has a history of deep vein thrombosis and diabetes.
Her father died at the age of 41 from a myocardial infarction.
She has 2 sisters; one has breast cancer but she is alive.
Her brother died at age 49 from a myocardial infarction.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Accounting for differences in head angulation and positioning, there might be slight if any interval decrease in enhancing right cerebellar lesion .
No new lesions are identified.
There is no evidence of acute ischemia.
IMPRESSION: Slight, if any, interval decrease in the size of the right cerebellar enhancing lesion abutting the transverse sinus.
No new lesions are seen.
MRI Head [**6-13**]: FINDINGS: Post-surgical changes are seen following resection of a right cerebellar lesion, with postoperative hemorrhagic products seen within the surgical bed.
There is a tiny amount of residual enhancement seen along the lateral margin of the resection bed (13:5).
Additionally, a rim of slow diffusion at the surgical bed likely relates to post-surgical changes.
A small amount of right subdural fluid/blood also is likely post-surgical.
There is no evidence of an acute infarct.
There is fluid in bilateral mastoid air cells, right more severe than left.
Post-surgical changes in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with hemorrhagic products, as well as a small amount of subdural fluid/hemorrhage overlying the right cerebral convexity.
Tiny amount of residual enhancement is seen along the lateral margin of the resection bed.
Postoperative changes within the right posterior fossa and right cerebellar hemisphere with air and edema are stable.
Small amount of air overlying the right frontal lobe, as well as scattered throughout the sulci in the left frontal lobe are slightly decreased in extent from prior study.
There is no evidence of a new acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
The size of the ventricular system is stable, without evidence of new hydrocephalus.
Periventricular white matter low attenuation is unchanged.
Right mastoid opacification is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Stable right occipital craniectomy changes, without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 67F s/p radiation for brain mass with progressively worsening weakness and headaches.
An MRI shows small area within tumor suspicious for abscess.
On [**6-13**], she went to the OR for occipital craniotomy for mass resection.

?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
?New onset of tremors or seizures.
?Any confusion or change in mental status.
?Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
?Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
?Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**5-23**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
