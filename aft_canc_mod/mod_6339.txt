Admission Date:  [**2126-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-12-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS Bronchoscopy 3 LPs Bone Marrow Biopsy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma diagnosed on [**6-/2126**] on day 15 of cycle [**5-24**] of MR-CHOP.
He was recently admitted between [**2126-10-25**] and [**2126-11-3**] for febrile neutropenia.
During that admission he underwent chest CT which showed a left lung nodular interstial pattern predominantly in the left upper lobe and persistent, but improved opacity of the right lung compared to [**Month (only) 359**].
He was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, levfoloxacin and voriconazole for febrile neutropenia until his counts returned and was discharged on levofloxacin and voriconazole which were discontinued on [**11-8**] and he was started on fluconazole and bactrim.
The patient reports that he was feeling well at home until [**2126-11-22**] when he developed fevers to 101.8 at home with worsening fatigue.
The fever was not associated with any localizing symptoms at that time.
He was not experiencing nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.
He was initially admitted to the [**Month/Day/Year 3242**] service for his fevers on [**2126-11-23**].
Chest CT performed on the day of admission showed a new interstitial infiltrate in the right upper lobe on a background of predominantly upper lobe emphysematous change compared to the CT of one month prior which was felt to be concerning for atypical infection.
At 1:15 AM on [**2126-11-25**] the oncology moonlighter was called for 20 minutes of right sided sqeezing chest pain while in bed.
Not associated with nausea, vomiting or shortness of breath.
EKG was without ischemic changes.
Repeat CXR showed right sided opacity which was new compared to [**2126-11-15**].
He triggered again at 5 PM for hypotension to the 90s systolic with persistent fevers.
Pressures improved to baseline of 100s without fluid bolus.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he reports that he continues to have fevers and right sided chest pain which is worse with inspiration.
He has a mild dry cough but no sputum production.
No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria or leg pain.
Stage 4b diffuse large B-cell lymphoma diagnosed in [**7-/2126**] after he was admitted to the ICU with pericardial effusion s/p pericardial window for tamponade physiology.
Strep viridans bacteremia - 1 bottle; PICC-associated?
Nephrolithiasis s/p cystoscopy 7-8 years ago 6. s/p amputation of right 2nd digit after electrical accident 45 years ago The patient presented to an outside hospital in [**6-25**] with a 30-pound weight loss over the prior 6months.
He was found to have a soft tissue mass in the cardiac ventricles involving the myocardium and extending into the interatrial septum.
In addition, he was noted to have multiple pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions, a pericardial effusion, large bilateral adrenal masses, and diffuse soft tissue masses involving both kidneys.
A renal biopsy revealed involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
He has a history of smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years until just prior to his diagnosis of lymphoma in [**2126-6-18**], when he quit due to symptoms of profound weakness.
His mother died in her 70s from diabetes and heart disease.
HEENT: conjunctiva pink, sclera anicteric, L pupil dilated compared to right but both pupils reactive, CN VI palsy on left eye, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, non-tender; no LAD appreciated Pulm: CTAB posteriorely Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS, no organomegaly appreciated Extremities: Warm and well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no calf tenderness Skin: No rashes Neuro: CN VI palsy on left.
Areflexia in LE.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2126-12-18**] EEG - IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal routine portable EEG in the awake and sleeping states due to the modest slowing of the background and infrequent bursts of generalized theta slowing.
These findings suggest excessive drowsiness or a mild encephalopathy due to metabolic abnormalities, medications or infection.
There are no clear lateralizeded or epileptiform features.
[**2126-12-13**] MRI/MRA head and neck IMPRESSION: No significant change or new findings compared with [**2126-7-18**].
MRA NECK: The 2D time-of-flight MRA of the neck vessels demonstrates no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: Slightly motion limited 2D time-of-flight of the neck demonstrates no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates no evidence of stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
COMMENT: Mild soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells.
[**12-12**] - CT head - IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or change from [**2126-7-28**].
Final Attending Comment: There is new fluid in the inferior mastoid air cells bilaterally.
No evidence of bowel perforation or obstruction.
Although evaluation of the previously identified bilateral renal and adrenal infiltrative masses is quite limited without intravenous contrast, these appear to have improved since prior as, for example, the adrenal glands demonstrate interval decrease in size.
Small left pleural effusion with at least some of the left lower lobe demonstrating complete volume loss.
Cholelithiasis and bilateral nephrolithiasis.
Persistent small-to-moderate ascites.
Again, there is no evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
Right apical opacification persists, unchanged.
Similarly, the opacification at the left base is again seen, most likely consistent with a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
New interstitial infiltrate in the right upper lobe on a background of predominantly upper lobe emphysematous change compared to the CT of one month prior.
This may represent atypical infection and clinical correlation is recommended.
Partial interval resolution of right upper lobe anterior opacity.
Enlarged right hilar lymph node measuring up to 10 mm in shortest axis diameter, likely reactive.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis, partially imaged.
T8 wedge deformity consistent with compression fracture, age  indeterminate.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities .
2 Views of pelvis [**2126-12-26**]: There is no fracture or abnormal alignment.
There is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion although evaluation is somewhat limited by overlying bowel gas.
There is mild superolateral joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis consistent with mild osteoarthritis.
CT pelvis [**2126-12-27**]: FINDINGS: There is a linear lucency in the posterior left iliac bone compatible with previous bone marrow biopsy aspiration tract.
There is no evidence of focal bone lesion, fracture or mass.
There is mild sclerosis in the acetabulum bilaterally compatible with degenerative change.
There is degenerative change in the lumbar spine with small amount of gas seen at the L4-5 disc space.
The common iliac arteries are dilated measuring 2.8 cm on the right and 2 cm on the left without gross change since the previous study.
There is no evidence of bulky adenopathy or ascites.
There is a small soft tissue density seen overlying the skin of the right buttock probably external to the patient.
There are small dependent bladder calculi.
A tiny focus of gas is seen in the bladder which may be due to recent instrumentation.
Prostate calcification compatible with BPH.
IMPRESSION: No suspicious focal bony lesion or fracture is identified.
CT head without contrast [**2126-12-30**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or significant change from prior study.
No acute intracranial abnormality and no significant change in the overall appearance of the brain since the recent [**2126-12-13**] study.
Mild atrophy and evidence of old lacunar infarct involving the left basal ganglia.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Peripheral filling defect and decreased compressibility of right superficial femoral and popliteal veins, consistent with chronic thrombus that has recanalized since the prior study in [**2126-10-19**].
On the left, normal flow, but decreased compressibility in the left popliteal vein, suggesting the possibility of a small amount of chronic thrombus.
No acute DVT identified in either leg.
No evidence of metastatic disease.
Mild narrowing of the left L3/4 neural foramen without evidence of nerve root impingement.

ICU course: On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] there was no evidence of end organ dysfunction and the patient was making good urine output.
He was noted to have a right upper lobe infiltrate with worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension.
He was felt to have pulmonary process based on CT scan/ CXR.
Given that he was immunocompromised, it was felt he would benefit from bronchoscopy for tissue specimen especially to evaluate for fungal infection.
Bronchoscopy revealed no organism growth.
He then underwent VATS procedure with thoracic surgery which was complicated by a penumothorax which resolved with a chest tube.
Pathology from lung tissue showed organizing pneumonia, however given that no organisms were growing on culture patient was started on steroids for possible BOOP.
# AFB cx positive: His tissue biopsy from his lung was positive for AFB on [**2126-12-22**].
# Neuro ??????
The patient had waxing & [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with intermittent confusion/confabulation/hallucinations.
He had bilateral upper & lower extremity weakness and weakness greater on the right than his left.
His strength is improving and his weakness is likely related to his long hospital and ICU course.
His weakness has improved during the course of his hospitalization but his lower extremities have lagged in terms of gaining back strength.
He has no LE reflexes and in hyporeflexive in the UE.
A MRI of the lumbar sacral plexis showed no metastatic disease, unremarkable appearance of the sacral plexus, and mild narrowing of the left L3/4 neural foramen without evidence of nerve root impingement.
MRI/MRA neck as above without acute pathology.
Lumbar puncture x 2 negative for meningitis, including lymphomatous meningitis.
Neuro-optho was consulted  on [**12-18**] and they diagnosed him with Horner's syndrome.
An EEG was done which showed no seizure activity.
The patient had dysphagia and was on TPN but his diet was advanced on [**2125-12-19**] by speech and swallow.
Neurology and opthomology were consulted and he was found to have a new left CN VI palsy.
The following day he began to experience nausea, emesis, and headache and a repeat CT head was negative.
The emesis still occurs occasionally and was felt to be secondary to his double vision.
Neuro-onc was consulted on [**2127-1-8**] and believed the CN VI palsy was traumatic and likely secondary to his fall.
He should follow up with opthomology as an outpatient as he may benefit from prism glasses or corrective surgery.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: He had intermittent atrial fibrillation which apparently is a new diagnosis on this admission.
He was on low dose metoprolol IV and remained in normal sinus rhythm without any hypertension.
He has anticoagulation with lovenox for history of DVTs.
# Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
He was on bactrim prophylaxis and acyclovir 400mg TID was started as the patient developed lesions on the shaft of his penis found to be HSV2.
It was unclear if this was due to medications or due to cancer involvement of his bone marrow.
He received neupogen on [**2127-1-10**] and his counts began to rise and he is no longer neutropenic.
#Back pain: In early [**Month (only) 404**] he began complaining of severe lower back pain.
His iliac crests are prominent given his weight loss and his back pain was thought to be secondary to pressure on these bones as well as sleeping on the soft hospital beds.
However, due to the severity of the back pain he received plain films of his back and a CT scan of his back both of which were overall negative.
A bone scan was then done as there was concern for either osteomyelitis or recurrence of his cancer.
We expect that his back pain will improve with change in mattress.
He was continued on lovenox which was held on occasion for procedures.
On [**2127-1-10**] he was complaining of pain in his right leg after physical therapy.
LENIs were done and showed evidence of old DVT but no evidence of acute DVT.
