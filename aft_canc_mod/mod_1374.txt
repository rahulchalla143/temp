Patient reports that at her baseline she removes ~200 cc of pleural fluid through the Pleurex catheter every 2 days and it is never bloody.
However, yesterday she had 250 cc and today 100 cc of bloody fluid.
Reports increased LE swelling X [**2-3**] wks, recently started on Lasix+Zaroxolyn for that.
No other complaints.

No pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral loculated pleural effusions.
Progressive liver metastases, and probably osseous metastases.
[**2180-10-16**]: Portable Chest - Increasing interstitial pattern on the left lung.
Small apical pneumothorax associated with right chest tube.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is  moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is a long (at least 8-8 cm long) echodense structure in the IVC suggestive of tumor or thrombus.
Stenosis of the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava with appearances of extrinsic compression.
No filling defect in the right common iliac vein or inferior vena cava.
Although, the inferior vena cava is stenotic superiorly, there was no opacification of collateral veins and there was free flow of contrast into the right atrium.
Numerous atypical lymphoid lymphocytes.
Rare mesothelial cells.

Shortness of breath/Pleural effusion: Patient is a 43 year old female who was originally admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for symptoms of increasing shortness of breath and bloody discharge from her pleurex catheter.
Given increasing blood effusion, it was thought that the patient's symptoms were most likely attributable to local progression of her malignancy.
Despite no additional bloody output form the catheter, the patient continued to report ongoing shortness of breath, again unfortunately likely due to local progression of her known malignancy.
The patient had a number of plain films performed which demonstrated increased interstitial markings, likely representing edema vs. lymphangiectasia.
Unfortunately, through the course of her admission the patient continued to have worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.
The patient passed away from respiratory failure on [**2180-10-21**].
Hypotension: The patient was additionally noted on admission to be hypotensive with SBP in the 70s, which was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia and malnutrition.
The patient did not appear to be septic as she was afebrile without any leukocytosis, elevated lactate, or obvious source of infection.
The patient was given small boluses of fluid as needed, but aggressive IV hydration was avoided given the patient's gross anasarca.
The patient had undergone an echocardiogram that was first interpreted to reveal an echogenic intrluminal mass, thought to represent thrombus.
Review of the study and ultimately a venogram revealed instead extraluminal compression of the IVC, likely from her metastatic disease.
Given the patient's poor prognosis and rapid deteriation, as described above, the patient was ultimately made CMO.
# ARF: On admission the patient demonstrated an elevated creatine, increased from 0.5 to 1.5 after starting diuretics.
This was thought likely to represent renal failure from a prerenal etiology and improved with volume resuscitation.
Metastatic Breast Ca: As above, the patient on admission was known to have widely metastatic breast cancer.
Given her rapid clinical deteriation throughout her admission, it was deemed that additional chemotherapy was not appropriate as toxicity would far outweigh any benefit.
She was made DNR/DNI, ultimately CMO per her request, and allowed to pass with minimal to no distress.
