Pt was hospitalized [**Date range (3) 36625**] with worsening pain in buttocks, back and LE.
LENIs revealed LLE DVT thought [**2-10**] the patient coming off of enoxaparin and multiple subtherapeutic INRs on warfarin.
Back pain was thought to be due to spinal metastases, so the pain service was consulted and recommended  pain augmenting medical regimen as listed below.
He was discharged on enoxaparin for his LE DVT and represented on [**2169-1-19**] with worsening LE pain and swelling.
This was felt to be due to clotting around his IVC filter so he was taken by IR on [**1-20**] for catheter thrombectomy of IVC with small amount of local tPA with mild clot lysis after IVC-gram revealed complete thrombosis of IVC filter with thrombus extending to iliacs bilaterally.
Plan was then made for continuous localized IV tPA to IVC since pain and swelling were not much improved.
During his stay he also developed worsening hematuria while on heparin gtt requiring 1 unit PRBC transfusion.
Urology was consulted and felt that the patient may need CBI while on tPA but there was no absolute contraindication and no acute need for cystoscopy.
Of note he was also started on ciprofloxacin for dysuria and UTI with Ucx growing E.Coli.

[**2169-1-6**] LE Doppler: Noncompressible DVT in the left CFV, almost  occluding the lumen.
Noncompressible clot in left greater saphenous vein.
No DVT on right.
Prior study in [**2168-5-4**] demonstrated bilateral clots.
No significant change is seen.
No epidural abscess identified or new epidural mass seen.
[**2168-12-6**] MRI L-spine: Numerous metastatic tumor deposits, with possible small epidural lesions seen anterior to the thecal sac at the L4 and L5 levels, versus distended epidural veins secondary to a moderate posterior disc protrusion at L4-5.
[**6-/2168**] Bone scan: Widespread metastatic disease in multiple ribs, right iliac crest, and vertebra L4.
Noncompressible deep venous thrombosis in left common femoral vein almost occluding the lumen.
No clot demonstrated distal to superficial femoral vein.
No evidence of DVT on the right.
Extensive occlusive thrombus from the common femoral veins bilaterally, involving external and common iliac veins on both sides and IVC to the level of the renal veins.
There is complete thrombosis of an IVC filter.
Mechanical suction thrombectomy and pulse-spray bolus thrombolysis with partial improvement and better results on the left than on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo male with hx of metastatic prostate CA to bone, hx of recurrent DVT and PE s/p IVC filter, OSA who presents with worsening LE pain and swelling.
On [**1-20**] he had a thrombectomy and local administration of TPA to the clot burden, with minimal result.
After the second attempt, a small patency through the femoral veins and into the suprarenal IVC was created, with resolution of the patient's leg pain and swelling.
He had some hematuria during this admission which had resolved by the time the patient was on lovenox.
He did not require a foley catheter or continuous bladder irrigation.
His pain was well-controlled after the procedure, and he was sent home on a minimally changed pain regimen.
