A few days later she develope large volume, non-bloody dairrhea that was associated with some lightheadedness.
Reports poor appetite but states she was drinking lot of water and trying to eat salty foods; however this was limited by worsening mucositis over the past few days.
Due to concern for dehydration and contniued diarrhea, the patient was admitted directly from the oncology clinic.
CXR revealed likely pulmonary edema with worsening bilateral pleural effusions and possible retrocardiac opacity.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1617**] was previously treated for breast cancer in the late [**2153**].
At that time she was diagnosed with a left-sided infiltrating ductal carcinoma on [**2160-7-30**].
Repeat biopsy showed persistent DCIS, and she underwent left mastectomy on [**2160-9-20**].
Since that time Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] was also diagnosed with a left renal cell carcinoma and underwent partial nephrectomy in 03/[**2178**].
Her medical course has been complicated by coronary artery disease status post MI in [**9-/2179**] and atrial fibrillation.
More recently, a CT of the chest noted ground-glass abnormalities, raising concern for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
This has not been biopsied or formally diagnosed.
In [**2-/2182**] liver function studies were noted to be elevated, and liver ultrasound and abdominal CT showed numerous lesions in the liver.
CT-guided core liver biopsy on [**2182-2-25**] showed metastatic breast adenocarcinoma staining positive for mammoglobin, negative for GCDFP, ER, and PR.
PET scan performed on [**2182-3-6**] showed numerous heterogeneous liver lesions, sclerotic lesions in the left anterior rib and right ilium that were FDG avid and concerning for metastatic foci, and FDG avid left pelvic side wall lymph node.
On [**2182-3-20**] mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast showed a 1.9-cm right breast nodule.
Pathology from a core breast biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma grade I that was HER-2/neu negative and ER/PR positive.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**], therefore, appears to have a new right breast tumor that is ER/PRpositive, HER-2/neu negative, and liver metastases that are ER/PR negative and HER-2/neu positive.
Also had L thoracocentesis in [**5-11**] with malignant cells (adenocarcinoma) on cytology.
History of left-sided breast cancer as discussed above, metastatic to 2.
History of renal cell carcinoma status post partial left nephrectomy, 03/[**2178**].
Coronary artery disease status post MI [**2179-9-11**] with PCI x2.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diet-controlled diabetes mellitus.
History of lung imaging abnormalities concerning for BAC.
History of a right ovarian dermoid cyst resected at age 32.
History of TMJ syndrome.
H/o C.difficile infection.
She denies tobacco or alcohol use, although, admits to a history of secondhand tobacco exposure as a child.
The patient's son is currently being treated for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Her mother died of a stroke at 61 years and father died of congestive heart failure at 78 years.

CARDIOLOGY: TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RADIOLOGY: LLE U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Mild left pleural effusion has increased.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is mild pulmonary edema.
There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: In short, Ms [**Known lastname 1617**] is a 76F with h/o metastatic breast CA C1D15 of navelbine/herceptin admitted with diarrhea and weakness, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in septic shock, expired [**2-4**] overwhelming GNR bacteremia.
# Septic shock: overwhelming GNR bacteremia w cardiogenic/distributive/hypovolemic components in the setting of febrile neutropenia.
DDx for the infection included the gut (given diarrhea) vs the lung vs other.
TTE revealed decreased LVEF confirming the suspicion of acute heart failure in the setting of sepsis.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Hypoxia progressed relatively rapidly in the setting of receiving IVFs, CXR with evidence supporting pulmonary edema.
Furthermore, pt's known malignant pleural effusion appears to be worsening and is also likely contributing.
No known aspiration events.
Given neutropenia and other vitals concerning for sepsis, infection also remains on differential.
Treated for sepsis as above.
# Hyponantremia: Na 120, improved to 130 w fluid resuscitation.
Does have prior h/o hyponatremia.
# Diarrhea: Possibly infectious etiology given neutropenia vs could be [**2-4**] chemo.
Given refractory hypotension in the setting of sepsis, possibly developing ischemic colitis.
# Pancytopenia: likely [**2-4**] chemotherapy - neutropenic, anemic w underlying combined iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
No evidence of hemolysis.
# Metastatic breast CA: With known mets to liver and likely to lung and bone based off of PET scan and pleural fluid cytology.
# Atrial fibrillation: INR supratherapeutic on admission.
Afib w RVR on transfer to ICU in the setting of hypovolemia, sepsis and pressors.
