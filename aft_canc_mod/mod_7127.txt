Pt was tolerating POs but noted mild decrease in appetite.
She denied chest pain, palpitations but did note one episode of shortness of breath.
The patient has a history of GIB in past while on coumadin for anticoagulation and has had an extensive negative workup for a source of the bleed.
Labs have revealed an iron deficiency anemia and intermittent guaic positive stools but EGD x2(98/99) have revealed only gastritis and a single non-bleeding diverticulum in middle third of esophagus.
Bleeding thought to be secondary to small AVM (although never visualized) and empiric estrogen, ex-lap/intraop enteroscopy have also been entertained in the past.

Peripheral vascular disease with nonhealing LE ulcers.
Cerebrovascular disease.

A/P  52 yo female with h/o aortic valve endocarditis s/p replacemnet, CVA, Hep C, chronic leg ulcers, and history of multiple GI bleeds with (-) workup presents with BRBRP.
On [**7-7**], she was given 4 U FFP before undergoing an EGD which showed a hiatal hernia and schatski's ring, but no source of bleeding.
During the limited study, a sigmoid polyp was found but no removal was completed secondary to the excessive stool.
She refused to drink more go-lytely for a repeat colonoscopy so she underwent a pill endoscopy on [**7-9**] which showed bright red blood and clots in stomach; no active bleeding site was found from esophagus to cecum.
It showed a single non-bleeding diverticulum in the middle third of the esophagus and erythema associated with gastritis.
No source of bleeding was identified.
Her hematocrit remained stable during this time and she had no bloody stools after [**2061-7-6**].
The risks of further GI bleeding versus the need for anticoagulation were weighed and it was decided that she needed anticoagulation so her coumadin was held and she was started on heparin.
Her lasix was held secondary to her gi bleed and dehydrated state.
On [**7-9**], she received IVFs plus IV antibiotics plus 4U FFP and developed some pulmonary edema and shortness of breath.
She was treated with 20 mg IV Lasix x 2 and the edema and shortness of breath resolved.
