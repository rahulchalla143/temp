There is minimal flow within the popliteal vein.
IMPRESSION: Deep venous thrombosis extending from the left distal common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
Continued low lung volumes with probable effusion and atelectasis at the left base.
Mild prominence of interstitial markings is consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
CT [**Last Name (un) **]/PELVIS W&W/O C	Study Date of [**2174-11-25**] 6:13 PM Within the lung bases, again seen are small bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
A focus of hyperdensity within the stomach (4b:109) is seen on post-contrast imaging.
No abdominal free air, free fluid or lymphadenopathy is seen.
Within prostate gland, there is a 2.1 x 1.8 cm (4B:187) hypodensity with some peripheral rim enhancement within the right lobe concerning for possible abscess formation.
No free air or free fluid is seen.
Known left femoral venous clot is again seen.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
New hypodensity in right prostate gland concerning for abscess formation.
Left femoral DVT as previously seen.

IMPRESSION: Increased moderate left and mild-to-moderate right pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis and increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia.
XR TOE(S), 2+ VIEW LEFT	Study Date of [**2174-11-30**] 11:43 AM FINDINGS: Mild degenerative changes at the first interphalangeal and metatarsal phalangeal joint with small osteophytes.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions, fractures, or radiopaque foreign bodies.
Marked soft tissue swelling at the great toe and the dorsum of the foot.

Sinus tachycardia.
Possible Q waves in leads III and aVF and V1-V4.
Consider interval anterior and inferior myocardial infarction.
There are Q waves in leads V1-V3 with ST segment elevation suspicious for an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Comparison with the previous tracing of [**2174-11-25**], is difficult because of the marked baseline artifact at that time but it seems very likely that the right precordial lead ST segment elevation is new.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 64819**] is a 55yo M w/hx of CP and AML s/p MUD Allo-SCT [**5-26**] complicated by GVHD of the skin and mucous membranes with a hx of GIB who presented with a left lower extremity DVT and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension sepsis and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics as treatment.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed possible prostatic abscess and this was later confirmed on prostatic ultrasound.
He was transferred to the floor on [**11-27**] and remained afebrile and worked with PT with his mobility improving on transfer to rehabilitation on [**12-6**].
# Sepsis and prostatic abscess: Mr [**Known lastname 64819**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever to 102.1F on [**11-25**] and became hypotensive requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**11-25**].
He was initially placed on stress dose steroids due to risk of adrenal insufficiency as he is on chronic prednisone.
His HCT dropped slightly in the setting of intravenous rehydration, but he did not have hematochezia, melena or hematemesis.
CT-abdomen/pelvis [**11-25**] showed a new hypodensity on the right prostate gland concerning for abscess in addition to a filling defect in the LV in keeping with clot.
Follow-up urine cultures were negative and he was changed from vanc/pip/tazo to naficillin 2g q4 on [**11-29**] in addition to high-dose trim/sulfa to cover for prostate abscess.
Prostatic abscess was confirmed on prostatic U/S on [**12-2**].

#  DVT: Mr [**Known lastname 64819**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a unilateral swollen left leg and a doppler U/S on [**11-24**] showed deep venous thrombosis extending from the left distal common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
His left leg edema improved with elevation and oral furosemide was commenced.
# AML s/p allo SCT with Chronic GVHD: Stable.
We continued acyclovir, fluconazole for prophylaxis and immunosuppression for GVHD with cyclosporine, dexamethasone+tacro swish and spit, prednisone, restasis and tacrolimus lip ointment.
#LV thrombus: CT Abdomen/pelvis on [**11-25**] was concerning for LV thrombus and an echocardiogram on [**11-25**] showed LVEF 45-50%, mild regional LV systolic dysfunction, focal apical LV akinesis with an intracavitary thrombus 1.8 x 1.8.

He underwent EGD showing erosive esophagitis without active bleeding (at OSH in NH).
CTA of Abdomen & Pelvis on [**11-8**] was notable for possible cecal AVM without acute active bleeding.
Subsequent colonoscopy on [**11-9**] revealed moderate diverticulosis and small clean-based shallow ulcer in the rectum without signs of active bleeding.
A possible new clot was seen in stomach on CT-abdomen/pelvis of [**11-25**].
He had no melena or hematochezia.
