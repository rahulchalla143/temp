Further review of his history raised the possibility of an upper GI bleed, as it was determined he had been taking high doses of NSAIDs for his abdominal pain, and had unclear history of melanotic stools and/or blood-tinged emesis.
Extensive hepatic lesions (presumably HCC) with extensive mesenteric root, porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as mesenteric/omental implants and possible pancreatic and mesenteric vein invasion as described above.
Nonhemorrhagic ascites.
No areas of active hemorrhage within the mass lesions or along the course of the bowel are present.
Gastroesophageal varices.
Nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
New bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning for metastases.
Given the size and distribution of his hepatic lesions, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was determined to be not eligible for surgical resection.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also received an esophago-gastric endoscopy to evaluate his suspected upper GI bleed, anemia, and abdominal pain.
This study revealed the following: - [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] B distal esophagitis, 2 cords of small esophageal varices without red whale signs left undisturbed, irregular GEJ with 2 tongues of salmon like mucosa left undisturbed.
- Diffuse mild to modorate erythema with deformed antrum and pyloric area.
One small 1cm clean based ulcer with surrounding edema and erythema left undisturbed.
Retroflex view revealed a moderate hiatal hernia, hiatus ~3cm.
- Duodenitis and one small <1cm superficial clean based ulcer in the duodenal bulb left undisturbed, normal second portion.
The etiology of his anemia was determined to be a combination of hepatic lesions/HCC as well as upper GI bleed, possibly secondary to NSAID use.
His liver lesions and clinical case was discussed during a multi-disciplinary hepatic tumor conference.
