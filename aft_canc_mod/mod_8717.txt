A post-operative chest x-ray revealed a small L apical pneumothorax which was not unexpected given that the pleura had been breached during surgery.
Subsequent x-rays confirmed that the pneumothorax was stable, and on POD#3, it was found to have decreased in size.
All were negative for an acute myocardial infarction.
On POD#1, the patient was ambulating without assistance.
At this time, the patient was noted to have some hoarseness.
There were no untoward events and the team and records confirmed that the intubation was easy and atraumatic.
It was found that he had a right-sided paralysis of his true vocal cord.
A conversation with the patient revealed that the vocal cord injury was long-standing and was thought to have been incurred during a tonsillectomy when the patient was a child.
A swallow evaluation revealed no signs of aspiration, and the patient's hoarseness resolved fully on POD#3.
