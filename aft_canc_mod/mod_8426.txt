Retrocardiac opacity compatible with pneumonia or atelectasis 2.
Prominence of the right hilus may be secondary to low lung volumes or hilar opacity.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Infiltrative soft tissue mass surrounding the retroperitoneal region, including the aorta, IVC, and presumably the ureters.
This is likely secondary to lymphoma and would be expected to be the cause of the patient's bilateral renal obstruction.
Ground-glass opacities seen within the right upper lobe and right middle lobe suggestive of atypical infection.
The typical consolidations seen with bacterial pneumonia are not evident on this examination.
Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate in size, slightly greater on the right and on the left, with associated atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Complete resolution of left hydronephrosis.
Near-complete resolution of right hydronephrosis with only minimal residual hydronephrosis noted.
[**2147-7-19**] Cardiovascular ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
3.6-cm lymph node in the left external iliac chain has features concerning for a necrotic lymph node with probable secondary infection (suppurative lymph node).
An 1.8-cm lymph in the left common iliac chain has similar characteristics, and also is concerning for a suppurative lymph node.
Edema and swelling of the left iliacus and obturator internus muscles is suggesting of an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process.
Compression of the left external iliac artery and vein due to the enlarged external iliac chain lymph node without evidence of thrombus or occlusion.
[**2147-7-21**] Radiology US UPPER EXTREMITY, SOFT TISSUE NODULE IMPRESSION: Multiple subcutaneous soft tissue nodules in the right and left upper extremity, suggestive of lymphomatous deposits/ lymph nodes in the soft tissues.
No new lesion identified, and no distal lymphadenopathy in the thigh.
Diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue swelling and edema is nonspecific but may represent lymphedema or cellulitis.
Fluid tracks along the superficial fascia, but this is unlikely to represent fasciitis given the lack of fascial enhancement.
Mild inter- and intramuscular edema representing mild myositis.
Diffuse patchy bone marrow signal abnormality likely represents red marrow, but osseous lymphomatous involvement is not excluded especially in the intertrochanteric regions bilaterally.
Hematoma with early organization.
No evidence of lymphoma.
[**2147-7-27**] Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION:  No findings to suggest pulmonary infection with unchanged prominent lymph nodes as above.
Decreased size of left retroperitoneal lymph node conglomerates and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Right nephrostomy tube and left nephroureteral stent appropriately positioned with interval resolution of bilateral hydronephrosis.
Mildly dilated left interpolar to lower pole calices, likely as a result of caliectasis.
No left UPJ obstruction.

CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2147-7-21**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
Cryptosporidium/Giardia (DFA) (Final [**2147-7-21**]):       NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.
Precordial T wave inversions of uncertain significance.
Since the previous tracing of [**2147-7-28**] ventricular premature beat is not seen, the  lateral T waves are improved, early precordial T wave abnormalities persist.

# Follicular Lymphoma: Final pathology showed follicular lymphoma, follicular growth pattern, cytological grade 1 of 3.
New subcutaneous nodules were concerning for lymphomatous transformation, supported by increasing LDH.
Pt had an excisional biopsy of R upper extremity subcutaneous nodule by general surgery on [**2147-7-25**], but these only showed organizing hematoma, perhaps from prior drug use.
Choices for treatment were initially limited by Pt's profound obstructive renal failure.
[**2147-8-12**] CT abdomen showed interval improvement in retroperitoneal masses and improvement of bilateral hydronephrosis.
# Healthcare associated pneumonia: Patient presented with fever and infiltrate on CXR.
Pt was treated with vancomycin and pip/tazo 4.5g iv q6h d1 = [**7-10**] for full 8 day course with complete resolution of symptoms and radiographic resolution on repeat CXR.
# Acute renal failure/obstructive uropathy: Pt presented in profound obstructive renal failure with Cr 10.6 and potassium 8.6.
Repeat renal ultrasound showed complete resolution of L hydronephrosis and almost complete resolution of R hydronephrosis.
R nephrostomy was capped on [**2147-7-27**], On [**2147-8-21**], pt had IR evaluate the nephrostomy tubes via nephrostogram which showed no obstruction of R or L ureter, the nephrostomy tube and stents were removed without complication.
Patient placed on macrobid 100 mg twice per day with instruction to take thru [**2147-9-7**] # Hyperkalemia - Secondary to the acute renal failure, treated with Kayexalate, insulin, and calcium gluconate prior to initiation of HD.
No e/o EKG changes.
K at time of discharge 5.5  # Altered mental status.
Differential diagnosis: uremia, hypoglycemia (although she was quite sleepy prior to getting insulin in the emergency room), accumulation of drugs including klonopin and dilaudid that she had been receiving due to her renal failure.
# Chronic back pain / abdominal pain with possible radiculopathy.
# Anxiety / agitation: Very labile behavior with hypothesized underlying personality disorder per psych.
Pt was started on divalproex 250 mg PO BID, olanzapine 5mg po tid standing per psychiatry; clonazepam 1 mg PO TID for anxiety and lorazepam 1mg po tid prn.
# Normocytic Anemia: Hct initially downtrending, hemolysis labs negative.
Likely related to underproduction in setting of underlying lymphoma/renal failure.
Iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
No evidence of bleeding.
Patient will follow up with PCP and pain specialist.
# Disposition issues: Pt was homeless prior to admission.
Patient has been barred from several shelters/rehabs due to issues with continued heroin abuse and altercations w/ other residents.
She will also meet with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12967**] for pain management.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -needs continued chemotherapy for treatment of lymphoma -will need outpatient hepatology follow up for active hepatitis C -will need referral to drug abuse cessation program -taper pain medications -taper sedatives including lorazepam, clonazepam  Medications on Admission: Dilaudid 2-4mg PO q3h prn pain.

If you are going to smoke, you must remove this patch due to risk of cardiovascular complications and death.
Disp:*4 4* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: pneumonia hyperkalemia, now resolved obstructive renal failure, now resolved follicular lymphoma  Secondary: hepatitis C heroin use chronic back pain   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital because you had leg swelling and shortness of breath.
You were found to have a large mass in your abdomen, later discovered to be follicular lymphoma, a type of cancer.
This mass compressed both of your ureters and caused your kidneys to fail.
Your left kidney did not show much improvement in function, likely due to the chronic nature of the urinary obstruction.
Your left leg and abdomen remain swollen, likely due to blockage of lymphatic drainage systems by your cancer.
Changes to your medications: To treat your pain, the following changes were made: Dilaudid 4 mg every 4-6 hours to treat pain Methadone will be dispensed at methadone clinic Gabapentin 300 mg three times per day **Do not take these medications while driving or drinking alcohol or using recreational drugs as these will cause sedation and possible death if used in combination **Please take stool softeners while taking narcotics because this can cause constipation**  For smoking cessation, please take: Nicotine patch 14 mg, replace once daily ** Do not take nicotine patch with cigarettes due to cardiovascular risk and possible death.
