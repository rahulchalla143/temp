The patient presented to her primary care provider on the day of admission for shortness of breath and was found to have an abdominal mass.
Her primary care physician sent her to the Emergency Room where she was found to be tachycardic and dyspneic but with normal oxygen saturations.
She had an urgent computed tomography angiogram of the chest which demonstrated large bilateral pulmonary emboli in both pulmonary arteries and a question of pulmonary infarction.
She was also found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis.
She remained hemodynamically stable and was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further heparinization and treatment of the pulmonary emboli and diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient denies any history of blood clots, malignancy, recent inactivity or recent travel.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed her temperature was 98.8, her blood pressure was 110/48, her pulse was 99, her respiratory rate was 22, and she was saturating 99% on nonrebreather.
In general, an overweight female who complained of dyspnea and who was tachypneic.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic but regular.
Prominent P2 pulsation and right ventricular heaves.
No murmurs or rubs.
Chest revealed slightly diminshed breath sounds in the left lower lung.
The abdomen was obese and soft.
Tenderness to palpation in the right suprapubic area with a large firm suprapubic mass.
No rubs or gallops.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Moderate acetone.
Urinalysis revealed small blood, greater than 100,000 glucose, and ketones of 150.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 104.
A 1-mm ST elevations in V1 through V2.
A 1-mm ST depressions in I.
No cardiomegaly, but near obliteration of the anterior space.
A computed tomography angiogram of the chest and computed tomography of the pelvis revealed filling defects bilaterally in the mid pulmonary artery, a small opacity in the left lower lung, question of pulmonary infarction, small mesenteric lymph nodes, and enlarged fibroid uterus (measuring 11.4 cm X 11.7 cm).
No free fluid or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
No osseous lesions.
BILATERAL PULMONARY EMBOLI ISSUUES:  Despite the patient's syncopal episode in the Emergency Room, the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of the hospital course.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2111-10-30**], which demonstrated good overall left ventricular systolic function with an EF of greater than 55%, mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with severe global right ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient did have a transvaginal ultrasound of her pelvis, which demonstrated a fibroid uterus with normal right ovary.
The patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis upon presentation, which is known to be a risk factor for thromboembolic disease.
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS:  The patient has a history of glucose intolerance, but was found upon presentation to be in diabetic ketoacidosis.
She has had elevated A1Cs in the past, and was very dehydrated at the time of presentation, although she denied polyuria.
The patient was initially treated with an insulin drip with closure of her anion gap and then started on subq insulin.
