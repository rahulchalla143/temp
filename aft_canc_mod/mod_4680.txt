Previously described right apical and right medial base pneumothoraces are likely still present.
Diffusely increased interstitial markings in the left lung are again seen, as is some increased retrocardiac density.
The extent of the diffuse left parenchymal opacity and the right lung changes.
Moderate right pleural effusion, right pneumothorax (chest tube in place) and moderate right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
Diffuse left lower and upper lobe ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening and multifocal opacities.
Differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and/or asymmetric edema.
She was extubated in the operating room, monitored in the PACU overnight for hypovolemia manifested by hypotension requiring low dose pressors for support.
She did well until [**2138-9-14**] when she developed respiratory failure transferred to the SICU for intubation and bronchoscopy with BAL.
CCT was done and revealed left-sided pneumonia.
Her volume status improved over the next 24 hrs and she wean off pressors.
She de sats to 88-90% with activity and would benefit from intensive pulmonary rehab.
