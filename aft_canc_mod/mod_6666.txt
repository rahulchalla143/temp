Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system reveals severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA is short and small with diffuse disease.
There is faint collateral flow filling the vessel retrograde via the RCA.
The LCx artery is diffusely disease and gives off 2 OMs with up to 50-60% disease.
Resting hemodynamic measurements reveals low cardiac output (2 liter/min/m2), elevated biventricular filling pressure with RVEDP of 21mmHg and LVEDP of 30mmHg, and pulmonary hypertension with a PA systolic pressure of 68mmHg.
Left ventriculography reveals low systolic ejection of 25% with anteriorbasal hypokinesis, anteriolateral akinesis and apical dyskinesis.
No significant left ICA stenosis (graded as less than 40%).

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Conclusions Prebypass  1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 20%.
3.There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-12-19**] 2:13 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval for pleural effusions  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 69 year old woman CABGx4 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for pleural effusions HISTORY: CABG times four, evaluate for effusions.
There is moderately severe cardiomegaly, unchanged.
There is some increased retrocardiac density, but this has improved compared with [**2139-12-15**], as left hemidiaphragm is now visible.
There is minimal upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
There is minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, without frank consolidation.
No right-sided effusion is identified.
No gross left-sided effusion, though small effusion would be difficult to exclude on this view.
Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 17358**] required a cardiac cath following a positive stress test.
On [**12-8**] cardiac cath revealed severe three vessel disease with both systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
She remained intubated and required multiple pressors for several days.
She also had an episode of atrial fibrillation on this day and amiodarone was started.
