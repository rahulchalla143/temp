Admission Date:  [**2153-8-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-8-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-5-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**] Chief Complaint: variceal bleed   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Upper GI endoscopy with variceal banding Femoral central venous catheter placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old man with hx of known cirrhosis, complicated by esophageal varices and HCC, recently placed on home hospice, presenting today for hematemesis.
He was reportedly feeling tired and nauseated all day and had 3 small episodes of bloody and black hematemesis.
Reported feeling significantly worse later during the day, experienced large volume hematemesis at home, after which he called EMS himself.
He had another episode of hematemesis 800cc bright red with black clots in the ED.
He was noted to be just mildly encephalopathic, but mentating well enough to confirm that he would want intubation in the temporary setting to protect his airway for upper endoscopy.
When preparing to do an IJ, pt had another large volume hematemesis.
Pt was intubated with racuronium and etomidate; racuronium was used in the setting of elevated K to 6.8.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx: -[**2150-11-19**]: resection of 4x4x3.8cm liver lesion in segment 5.
Pathology consistent with HCC.
No lymphovascular invasion -[**2151-5-20**]: resection of 1.8cm lesion in segment 5 -[**2152-2-14**]: chemoembolization of a branch of right hepatic artery with taxotere and embospheres for two right lobe lesions measuring 1.5 and 0.5 cm along with microwave ablation of the 1.5cm lesion -had been on transplant list when MRI [**2152-8-11**] showed 2.4 x 4.3cm  lesion in segment 8 and thrombosis of a portal vein branch.
Underwent biopsy of the lesion which revealed a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor embolus in the portal vein branch.
However, pt had anemia (despite d/c-ing internferon and ribavarin), making him ineligible from study -began radiation in [**11/2152**] and finished 01/[**2153**].
Episodes of anemia secondary to GI bleeding.
EGD and colonoscopy performed, revealing esophageal varices, hemorrhoids  and mild portal gastropathy.
Other Past Medical History: - HTN - ?
CHF - Hepatitis C as above, felt to be obtained on the job due to numerous episodes of bleeding and other injury.
- h/o back spasms for which he takes narcotics.

# Goals of Care Patient was admitted with hematemesis due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to bleeding varicies status post variceal banding.
# Variceal Bleed Pt was admitted with hematemesis secondary to variceal bleed and underwent emergent upper endoscopy with variceal banding while in the ICU.
Patient with known history of HCV cirrhosis, complicated by variceal bleeding in the past, and last banded in [**11/2152**], per son.
# Hyperkalemia Likely due to constipation, and also likely due to acute kidney injury.
No significant acidemia on VBG.
No EKG changes.
# Acute Renal Failure Likely prerenal etiology in setting of large volume upper GI bleed.
However, as patient has elevated lactate, hypoperfusion may have been severe enough for acute kidney injury to be due acute tubular necrosis.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis Likely due to lactic acidosis, though etiology unclear.
Possibly due to hypoperfusion from gastrointestinal bleed.
However, as patient has elevated WBC count, sepsis also possible.
Per son, patient may also have GI obstruction evidenced by constipation.
#Hyponatremia - Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of hypoperfusion/decreased effective circulating volume.
#HCV Cirrhosis Patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma, complicated by portal vein thrombosis, esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy.
Prior to intubation, patient mildly encephalopathic and reportedly had not stooled for 36 hours prior to admission.
#Leukocytosis Infectious etiology broad in this patient with HCV cirrhosis with variceal bleed, and status post intubation.
Patient has been afebrile and hemodynamically stable since admission.
He may have had a primary pneumonia, or may have had an aspiration event.
As concern for intestinal obstruction, may consider infectious GI complication or perforation, but no evidence of sepsis.
No further treatment or evaluation as the patient was made CMO.
6. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for back spasm.
