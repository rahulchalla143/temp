She has a complicated history of urothelial carcinoma which after nephroureteral resection was shown to recur in liver and ?rectus sheath for which she received 5 cycles cisplatin/gemcitabine starting [**12-28**].
Of note she has had profound leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia with chemotherapy.
Since last round she has become increasingly weak, confused, with worsening RLQ pain and RLE thigh pain, she also had some shaking of her UE bilaterally Tuesday night into Wednesday.
In ED she was found to be febrile, pancytopenic, profoundly thrombocytopenic with hypotension and tachycardia.
She was admitted to MICU for AMS and possible CNS infection.
Head CT scan completed which revealed no evidence of metastatic disease or bleed.
CT abdomen showed ?fluid collections concerning for possible abscess.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up/management and ?IR guided drainage of abdominal fluid collection.
She knew the vice president of the USA and could spell WORLD backwards but demonstrated poor concentration only getting [**1-22**] in serial 7s.

There are bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**8-7**] CT guided IE drainage: IMPRESSION: Technically successful CT-guided drainage of fluid collection in the right psoas.
The contents appeared to represent primarily hemorrhagic products so the collection is likely to represent a subacute or chronic hematoma, although superinfection would be a consideration.
[**2135-8-7**] 5:00 pm ABSCESS GRAM STAIN (Final [**2135-8-7**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
CULTURE (Final [**2135-8-10**]):    NO GROWTH.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-8-9**]  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-7**], the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially decreased.
There also appears to be decreased pleural effusions with a thick band of atelectasis at the bases.
No definite acute focal pneumonia, though an area of increased opacification at the right base, most likely reflecting atelectasis and crowding of vessels.
LUNG (V/Q) SCAN Study Date of [**2135-8-9**] Low probability of pulmonary embolism.
Ventilation images demonstrate central clumping consistent with airways disease.
There is also patchy aeration at the bases, likely reflecting atelectasis as seen on chest radiograph.
Perfusion images show subsegmental perfusion defects at the lung bases corresponding to areas of decreased ventilation.
Lung perfusion is otherwise normal with no unmatched perfusion defects identified.
VENOUS DOPPLER/DUPLEX ULTRASOUND BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2135-8-9**]  IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity.

#Sepsis: Patient initially treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn, initially briefly requiring Levophed; likely source was thought to be abdominal abscess seen on CT abdomen however patient underwent IR guided drainage of the cyst and cultures were negative and the fluid collection was felt to NOT represent an abscess.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted regarding both care of her chronic malignancy as well as possible neupogen to improve her cell lines, they did not recommend Neupogen.
They felt the leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was secondary to  chemotherapy (most recent dose of Carboplatin/Gemcitabine was [**2135-7-14**], 3wks prior to admission) and sepsis - both causing supression of her bone marrow.
HER PLATELET COUNTS AND WBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE CHECKED AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AT THE [**Hospital1 1501**] to ensure they are continuing to head in the right direction.
#Urethelial Carcinoma: Pt w h/o aggressive malignancy s/p chemotherapy and right nephrouretectomy, with evidence of abdominal metastasis.
However, LE dopplers were negative for DVT here and V/Q scan was low probability, so since she had received 6 months of treatment for her first episode of DVT (arguably known source - CA), she was changed to prohylactic dose of Lovenox.
However, if her bleeding risk increases (i.e.
if she becomes thrombocytopenic again), this may need to be reconsidered.
#Pain: Pt w abd chronic pain [**1-19**] malignancy and resections, on chronic narcotics as an outpatient.
Pain was exacerbated by IR drainage (see above), and pain was refratory to 5mg Oxycodone tabs, so pt was started on Morphine SR to improve basal control.
After her ICU stay and severe illness, she is very weak and deconditioned and will require [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation before returning home.
5. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever >100.4.
7. sodium chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-19**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed for dry nose.
11. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
12. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] Care & Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital6 7472**] with sepsis (severe infection).
You were found to not have any evidence of blood clots in your legs or your lungs so the dose of Lovenox was decreased to 30 mg per day in order to prevent further blood clots from forming.
