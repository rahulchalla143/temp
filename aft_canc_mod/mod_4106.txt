She was reviewing the pathology slides today with her oncologist in clinic and was told that there was evidence of metastatic disease in the spleen.
In the ED she complained of mild LUQ pain.
She underwent endometrial biopsy, which  revealed high-grade malignant tumor concerning for carcinosarcoma and a pelvic ultrasound revealing an echogenic area within the cavity measuring 4 x 4 x 4 cm.
Pathology revealed carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor) and cervix with squamous metaplasia.
PT1a (Stage IA) 10% myometrial invasion, cervix negative, ovaries and  fallopian tubes negative, tN0, 0 out of 9 pelvic lymph nodes, and 0 out of 4 paraaortic lymph nodes positive for metastasis.
No definitive foci of lymphovascular invasion identified.
- On [**2135-9-5**], started carboplatin AUC 5 and Taxol 175 for Cycle 1 which was complicated by Taxol-associated myalgias and orthostatic hypotension (brief hospitalization, without LOC).
- On [**2135-9-23**] Seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding vaginal spotting, thought to be secondary to healing at suture site.
- On [**2135-9-26**], continued [**Doctor Last Name **] AUC 5 and decrease Taxol to 150mg/m2 for cycle 2 for C1D15, ANC 730 - On [**2135-11-14**] received cycle 3 [**Doctor Last Name **] 4 and Taxol to 135mg/m2 with neulasta on day 3 after deferred 4 week due to persistent neutropenia - [**2135-12-12**] C4D1 Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **] - [**2136-1-16**] C5D1 [**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol  Past Medical History: Hypertension, Osteoarthritis, history of urate and calcium stones, status post multiple lithotripsy, Thyroid cancer in [**2122**] with recurrence status post radical neck dissection (Of note, she had an MSSA surgical wound infection in the setting of her radical neck dissection) and complicated by thoracic duct injury status post clip placement, [**7-15**] negative colonoscopy (history of polypectomy in [**2131**]).
Past Surgical History: Gastric bypass in [**2125**] at [**Hospital3 **] with 135-pound weight loss (a 40-pound weight gain since menopause), thyroidectomy ([**Hospital1 1774**]), radical neck dissection for recurrent disease ([**Hospital1 1774**]), left total knee replacement in [**2130**] complicated by bacteremia and joint infection with recurrence after six weeks of antibiotics resulting in spacer placement and replacement of the joint again in [**2132**], tonsillectomy at age 5, carpal tunnel bilaterally in [**2122**], cholecystectomy, umbilical hernia repair  Social History: Denies tobacco and drug use.
She works in retail and has 6 grandchildren   Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: 98.1 74 94/64 16 97 RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: soft, mildly tender to palpation in the LUQ, no hernias or masses, well-healed midline incision Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused   Pertinent Results: CXR [**3-1**]: new left-sided effusion with possible underlying atelectasis or airspace disease CT Abd/Pel [**3-1**]: enlarging complex ascites, hemorrhage without clear source of bleed; rapid progressive metastatic disease in pelvis, liver, splenectomy bed, stomach, mesentery, peritoneum CTA [**3-2**]: no active extravasation, loculated fluid, large complex masses in splenectomy bed, pelvis, omentum, peritoneum Abdominal XR [**3-4**]: no e/o obstruction, contrast in colon, pleural effusion CXR [**3-4**]: substantial L pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, low lung volumes CXR [**3-5**]: no PTX, substantial decrease in L pleural effusion GIB study [**3-6**]: no evidence of active bleeding within the splenic resection bed CTA [**3-6**]: Acute pulmonary Emboli in RLL and RUL, new nodular opacity in R apex concerning for early PNA.
Extensive metastatic dz in abd, perihepatic ascites CXR [**3-7**]: PICC in place, L effusion returned CXR [**3-8**]: L effusion   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] is a 53yo woman with a history of metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma who was admitted from the emergency room to the ICU for hypotension secondary to hemorrhage into splenectomy bed lesion.
It was decided that she would be receive a fentanyl patch daily and oxycodone as needed for breakthrough pain.
Due to concern for bleeding from her splenectomy bed, interventional radiology was consulted and recommended a repeat CT scan in arterial phase to identify potential vessels to embolize.
On hospital day 2, after receiving renal-protective bicarb infusion given her Cr 1.5, a CTA abdomen showed no active extravasation.
During transfusion, her tachycardia improved to the 90s and her urine output improved.
However, her hematocrit still continued to trend downwards and per ACS recommendations, we did order a tagged red cell scan, which showed no evidence of an acute bleed.
A FeNa was 0.3% consistent with pre-renal acute kidney injury, likely caused by a combination of IV contrast and anemia.
# Pleural effusion: Chest x-ray in the emergency room showed a new left-sided pleural effusion.
Given the inability to wean her from oxygen and dyspnea on exertion on hospital day 4, a repeat chest x-ray was performed which demonstrated a substantial L pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, and low lung volumes.
Post-procedure chest x-ray desmonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax.
However, she had a desaturation to 85%/RA prompting an evaluation with CT scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
Given her poor kidney function and creatinine of 1.8, we pre-hydrated her with sodium bicarbonate to prevent worsening nephropathy.
Her CTA showed Acute pulmonary Emboli in the Right lung vasculature, new nodular opacity in Righ apex concerning for early pneumonia.
Extensive metastatic disease in her abdomen and perihepatic ascites.
# Pulmonary Embolism: Lovenox 80mg SC daily was started after diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
# Right apex pneumonia: Given the fact that Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] was newly diagnosed with this while in house, it was treated as a hospital acquired infection with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin.
# Nausea: On hospital day 3, she had persistent nausea, for which she received IV zofran, phenergan, and ativan.
# E. coli UTI: In the ICU, she was started on bactrim due to a urinalysis with positive nitrites.
She was then started on ceftriaxone for her urinary tract infection.
Her final blood cultures were negative and her ceftriaxone was discontinued on [**2136-3-7**]  # Metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma: In the emergency room a CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated enlarging complex ascites, hemorrhage without a clear source of bleeding, and rapid progression of metastic disease in pelvis, liver, splenectomy bed, stomach, mesentery, and peritoneum compared to a CT scan performed a week prior.
She was seen by the Atrius palliative care consult on hospital day 2, who provided recommendations for pain control.
However, after the 2nd family meeting, it became apparent to the patient and her family that she would not get better and wold not be a candidate for palliative chemotherapy.
# 1st degree heart block: While in the ICU, her troponin increased from 0.05 to 0.18.
EKG showed 1st degree AV block without any ST changes.
She was maintained on telemetry on the floor with no events.
She did have sequential compression devices and received intravenous pepcide for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
She also received an aggressive bowel regimen for constipation and this has continued for comfort measures.
