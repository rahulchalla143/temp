Per medical records, patient c/o progressive right lower extremity weakness with painful leg spasms x 2- 3mths.
At his nursing home, 2 days prior, he was noted to have cloudy/ foul smeeling urine and was dx with pansensitive citrobacter UTI, and started on ciprofloxacin.
This afternoon, he had witnessed tonic clonic seizures x 2 lasting less than 2 min each at NH.
He was initially brought to an OSH and sent to [**Hospital1 **] for neurologic evaluation.
His exam was notable for poor attention and confusion with initial labs revealing leukocytosis to 24.9 with grossly positive U/A.
Due to recent seizure activity, he was placed in a c- collar and cleared with a CT c-spine with clinical exam.
Neurology evaluated patient in ED and felt that most of his symptoms were due to his underlying infection.

T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No acute fracture.
CT Head Without Contrast ([**11-2**]) (REPORT FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL): Chronic-appearing bilateral lacunar infarcts with no intraparrenchymal hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections.
No mass effect or midline shift.
Lower Extremity U/S ([**11-3**]): Acute DVT involving right posterior tibial veins.
EEG ([**11-4**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the slow 8 Hz posterior predominant rhythm which may be seen in generalized encephalopathy such as due to medications, ischemia, or toxic/metabolic etiologies, as well as medication effect.
There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features noted.
Two heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the left parietal lobe subcortical white matter, the larger one measuring 3.2 x 2.8 x 3.9 cm with mild-to-moderate surrounding edema without significant mass effect.
Other etiologies such as inflammatory or subacute infarction are less likely given the thick rind of tissue in the periphery.
Patent major intracranial arteries without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 2 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram.
Mild atherosclerotic disease involving the Basilar, internal carotid, and the MCA branches without flow-limiting stenosis.

Tonic-Clonic Seizures: On admission there was report of a history of seizure disorder with recent witnessed epileptic activity in setting of likely infection and medication known to lower seizure threshold.
The patient was confused on arrival to the ED which was attributed to a post-ictal state with CT scan at OSH showing no evidence of stroke and no significant metabolic derangement on laboratory testing.
As part of the patient's seizure workup, an MRI was ordered which revealed two heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the left parietal lobe, with suspicion for a malignant glioma.
An EEG revealed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy but no epileptiform activity was noted.
The information was presented to the patient and given the progressive nature of his Parkinson's disease and debilitated state he chose not to undergo any further evaluation of the brain lesions.
Right Lower Extremity DVT: Several days into his admission, the patient developed right lower extremity erythema and swelling.
A lower extremity ultrasound was performed and revealed a right posterior tibial vein thrombosis.
Repeat ultrasound revealed presence of the thrombosis in the right peroneal and right popliteal veins in addition to the original location.
Post-procedure evaluation did not reveal any hematoma or venous hum at the site.
Urinary Tract Infection: The patient was admitted two days into a course of Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection that was culture positive for Citrobacter, which was pan-sensitive.
Given the neurological complications associated with Ciprofloxacin in the elderly, the patient was switched to Ceftriaxone.
The patient subsequently failed to void, was started on Tamsulosin for presumed BPH and the foley was replaced.
Two days later the patient failed to void once again and was found to have 700 cc of urine on bladder scan.
Given the patient's urinary retention observed as an inpatient, it is likely that this contributed to the development of his urinary tract infection.
Aspiration Risk: The patient was evaluated by speech and swallow in the ICU and was started on a dysphagia diet and nectar-thickened liquids due to high aspiration risk.
Right-sided Weakness: The patient reported chronic right-sided weakness on presentation that most likely represented an old neurologic deficit from his prior CVA that was exacerbated by worsening malnutrition and acute illness.
The patient was continued on Sinemet although it seemed unlikely that Parkinson's disease was a major contributor to this particular problem.
Parkinson's Disease: The patient was admitted on Sinemet for his Parkinson's disease of unknown duration.
The patient had masked-facies and bradykinesia with some cogwheel rigidity of the upper extremities on examination.
The patient reported a new cough that was concerning for a possible aspiration event.
A chest x-ray revealed a patchy left lower lobe opacity that was possibly increased over an outside film scanned into the [**Hospital1 18**] system and likely represented atelectasis vs possible early infectious infiltrate.
Given the location of the infiltrate on chest x-ray, there was low suspicion for an aspiration event but one could not be ruled out definitely.
Given his poor oral intake, the patient was continued on intermittent fluids on the floor.
Iron studies were ordered and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (calTIBC 142, Ferritin 894, TRF 109) which was consistent with the patient's underlying disease process.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 6598**] Manor Extended Care Facility - [**Location (un) 6598**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Seizures Brain tumor (likely malignant glioma but there is no tissue diagnosis) .
Secondary Diagnoses: Parkinsonism Hypertension Anxiety   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Also, on admission to the hospital you were being treated for a urinary tract infection with an antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin.
As this medication can be associated with neurological side-effects in elderly individuals, you were changed to another antibiotic called Ceftriaxone.
This medication will help prevent urinary retention.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with your outpatient physicians as you feel appropriate.
