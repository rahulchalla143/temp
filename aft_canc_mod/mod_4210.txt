Admission Date: [**2151-6-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2151-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-5-13**]        Sex:  M  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 84751**] is a 64-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted to begin cycle II, week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy.
His oncologic history began in [**2150-3-15**] with hematuria with subsequent workup revealing a right renal mass.
Pathology revealed a 10-cm tumor [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade [**4-15**] with invasion of the adrenal gland.
There were no regional lymph nodes, distant mets, extension into the renal artery or vein noted.
He underwent attempted resection of that nodule on [**2150-8-4**] complicated by V-fib arrest during anesthesia induction which required resuscitation.
One week later, he had a left lower lobe wedge resection with pathology consistent with clear cell carcinoma metastatic to the kidney.
Followup imaging in [**2150-10-13**] demonstrated multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Pre IL-2 brain MRI revealed 3 small brain metastases.
Repeat torso CT showed increase in pulmonary nodules and he began cycle 1, week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy on [**2151-2-25**].
He received 13 of 14 doses week 1 and 11 of 14 doses week 2 with course complicated by lethargy and acute renal failure.
Followup CT scans revealed disease regression in the lung.
Followup brain MRI revealed stability of the right cerebellar lesion, improvement in the occipital lesion and resolution of the frontal lesion.
He began cycle II, week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy on [**2151-5-17**], receiving 12 of 14 doses with course complicated by hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine, blood pressure support and neurotoxicity.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation; chronic renal insufficiency; BPH; Bell's palsy bilaterally; gout; right inguinal hernia repair in [**2141**]; heel spur; metastatic kidney cancer as above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well appearing male in no acute distress.
LYMPH NODES:  No cervical, supraclavicular or bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema.
During this week he received 5 of 14 doses with doses held due to shock and development of rapid atrial fibrillation.
On treatment day #1 after his first dose of IL-2 he became unresponsive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60's.
At that time, he was found to be bradycardic in the 30's to 40 which improved to the 50's, normal sinus brady with improved blood pressure.
He had no ischemic changes noted on EKG.
Shock was attributed to capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy.
He was essentially given 1 dose of IL-2 daily with recurrent hypotension after each subsequent dose.
On treatment day #5 he received his fifth dose of IL-2 at 8:00 a.m. and later that day developed rapid atrial fibrillation to the 200's with systolic blood pressure of 60 despite Neo-Synephrine blood pressure support.
He was given IV digoxin without response.
Given continued hypotension and rapid atrial fibrillation, he was transferred to the ICU where he was treated with IV metoprolol and he converted to sinus rhythm in a short time.
He was noted to be restless consistent with toxic encephalopathy.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.7, improved to 3.4 at the time of discharge.
He had associated oliguria and metabolic acidosis, improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
IV fluids were continued given evidence of acute renal failure.
He had no transaminitis or hyperbilirubinemia noted.
He had no coagulopathy, myocarditis or thrombocytopenia noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post cycle II, week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock, acute renal failure, toxic encephalopathy and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 84751**] will return to the clinic in 4 weeks after CT scan to assess disease response.
