Per the family, he was walking down the street and had a wittness loss of consciousness.
He later had another episode of VT at 12:40 and an amiodarone gtt was started.
A R femoral line was placed, he was given 1L IVF and had a head, chest, abdomen CT done without contrast.
He was given 1mg Atropine for bradycardia to 35During transfer to the floor, he became bradycardic.
CT scan showed a sternal fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

Diabetic Nephropathy - Chronic kidney disease stage IV, baseline creatinine 3.0 6.
Atrial Fibrillation - on Coumadin 7.
Prostate cancer - T1C, NX, [**Doctor Last Name **] score 5+5, s/p XRT [**2107**]   Social History: Unable to obtain as patient is intubated and sedated.
Per OMR, there is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple, JVP unable to be assessed due to cervical collar.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
CXR ([**2117-1-16**]): Cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
Pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion, partially imaged.
Consider MRI for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Non-contrast head CT ([**2117-1-16**]): NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation abnormality.
Intracranial carotid artery atherosclerotic calcifications are moderate-to-severe.
Mucosal secretions within the nasal passages, nasopharynx, and opacification of the ethmoid sinus air cells are noted, at least partially related to recent intubation.
There is mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses, mild in degree.
There is no fracture.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and cerebral sulci is likely related to age-appropriate atrophy.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
Sinus disease, as noted above.
Mildly displaced transversefracture of the mid sternum likely involves the medial aspect of the anterior left third rib with associated substernal anterior mediastinal hematoma.
Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
1.9 cm right renal hypodense lesion, likely a complex cyst.
Gallbladder wall edema and trace perihepatic ascites, likely related to heart failure.
ECHO [**2117-1-18**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls, distal anterior wall and distal lateral wall.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified (but pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is suggested).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-1-6**], left ventricular function has further deteriorated and the right ventricular cavity is more dilated with new free wall hypokinesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p cardiac arrest.
# CARDIAC ARREST: There was little information about the events of the hours that preceded his admission.
We know that he had a witnessed syncopal episode; he may have been in asystole at an OSH.
He underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol at [**Hospital1 18**], which was complicated by persistent bradycardia to the 20's.
Based on his EEG result, non-arousal, and lack of brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the ventilator, Neurology suggested that meaningful recovery from the neurological standpoint is very unlikely.
# ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Neurology was consulted on admission and patient was placed on a 48 hour EEG per protocol.
P er examination, the patient demonstrated no brainstem function, save for a respiratory rate that exceeded the ventilator settings.
Over the next few days, he did demonstrate the presence of a gag reflex as well as a questionable R-sided pupillary constriction and corneal reflex, but despite being off pressors and sedation, he did not exhibit further cortical function.
His chest CT demonstrated mild pulmonary edema.
He remained intubated with stepwise decrements in his degree of pressure support.
# ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Patient with known CKD, baseline Cr 3.0.
On admission, patient was anuric, likely due to ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion despite receiving several liters of IVF's at the OSH and in the ED.
Given that his his UOP improved and his electrolytes were stable off CVVH, and because of his poor prognosis, CVVH was discontinued.
# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40% in [**12-15**], down to 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**2117-1-18**], likely further impaired by the cardiac arrest.
Patient with mild pulmonary edema on chest CT, but intubated since admission.
# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis & grossly positive U/A, but elevated WBC may also be due to stress response to cardiac arrest.
Sputum cx was positive for Moraxella & blood cultures demonstrated coag negative staph.
