Her EKG showed no persistent abnormalities.
While this is a slightly abnormal result, pt does not have any evidence of CSF infection, and it is reassuring that her mental status has cleared, and the cultures are negative.
These results were discussed with a Neurology attending on call, and agreed that while results are mildly abnormal, are not of significant concern.
It is possible that pt may have had a recent viral infection vs a seizure while sedated from overdose, which may have led to this result.
This is not a contraindication for discharge to inpatient psychiatric care, and would not be a contraindication to ECT if otherwise indicated.
