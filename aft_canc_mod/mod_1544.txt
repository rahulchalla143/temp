In brief, she was in her usual state of excellent health until 1 month PTA when she developed a diarrheal illness (nonbloody) for a week with fevers, night sweats, and fatigue.
This diarrhea resolved on antibiotics but she had persistent nightly fevers and progressive fatigue.
A week and a half ago, she again saw her PCP who felt she had sinusitis due to complaint of fatigue and HA.
Prior to admission, she developed new sharp left flank pain and presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital ED.
She also received diclofenac prior to labs for flank pain.
At this time she is anxious about her new diagnosis but has no localizing complaints.
She endorses un-quantified weight loss, night sweats x 1 month, nightly fevers x 1 month, and new left flank pain.
She has no HA, vision changes, numbness, tingling, bleeding, bruising, or other complaints.
She had no HA, vision changes, numbness, tingling, bleeding, bruising, or other complaints.

Discharge physical exam: 97.9, 152/86, 97, 20, 98% RA GEN:  well-appearing elderly woman in NAD HEENT:  MMM, no OP lesions CV:  RRR, no MRG PULM:  CTAB b/l, no crackles or wheezes ABD:  BS+, soft, palpable spleen; no hepatomegaly LIMBS:  Mild 1+ pitting edema both ankles up to [**1-4**] of tibia, mildly worse on right (stable) SKIN:  No rashes or skin breakdown or bruises.
No free fluid.
Red blood cells are decreased in number and show moderate to severe anisocytosis and mild poikilocytosis.
Polychromatophils are frequently seen, and rare nucleated RBCs are also seen The white blood cell count appears increased and dominated by an immature blast population, that has a high N:C ratio, bluish, scant, agranular, vacuolated cytoplasm, irregular nuclear contours and sieve like chromatin with 2-3 nucleoli.
Touch preparations are generous and are used for bone marrow aspirate descriptions.
It consists of a marrow with a cellularity of 90%.
The dominant cell population (80-90%) is immature blasts as described above.
Erythroid and myeloid precursors within this sparse cell population mature normally.

Her stay was complicated by hyperglycemia and hypertension.
She required to be in the ICU for insulin drip for hyperglycemia in setting of dexamethasone in addition to hypertension for which antihypertensives were added/uptitrated.
# Precursor B-ALL [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] Chromosome: Initial concern for leukemia based on peripheral blasts.
EKG was monitored and there was no QTc prolongation throughout hospital course and multiple periodic EKGs.
Omeprazole 40 mg daily was started in the setting of taking steroids in house but this was switched to randitine on discharge because ranitidine is less potent than PPI and acid suppression can inhibit dasatinib absorption.
She developed hypoglycemia down to 40's and 60's on 2 occasions which were symptomatic and one drop to 60s that was asymptomatic.
Per patient she did not have hypoglycemia previously.
She was discharged on insulin NPH 70/30 @ 35 units qAM, metformin 500mg po BID with breakfast and dinner, glyburide 10mg with breakfast and 5mg with dinner, and no sliding scale.
She will have a follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient for further titration.
# Hypertension - BP was elevated as high as 190s, Likely [**2-3**] steroid use.
No recurrence of this, so she was discharged without allopurinol.
# Thrombocytopenia ??????
No active signs of bleeding, no abrupt Hct changes.
# Elevated liver enzymes: could be medication effect, possibly aztreonam, which she was on from [**Date range (1) 30278**] for neutropenic fever.
# neutropenic Fever: [**4-15**] developed fever in setting of neutropenia and aztreonam was started.
# L-sided abdominal pain: Likely [**2-3**] splenomegaly from ALL.
Relieved with low dose oxycodone prn  # H/o breast CA: early stage breast cancer s/p lumpectomy, XRT, right sided LND and tamoxifen x 5 years.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Precursor B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive Tumor lysis Diabetes Hypertension Anemia Thrombocytopenia Hypofibrinogenemia Slightly elevated liver enzymes   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As you know you were transferred from outside hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] given the concern for acute leukemia.
