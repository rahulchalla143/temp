[**2114-5-28**] cardiac catheterization with stenting of RCA   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 77625**] was involved in a motor vehicle accident [**2-20**] and on a CT scan an incidental 3-cm lesion involving the left lobe of the segment 4B was found.
A PET scan showed + right upper lobe nodule.
Family History: Mother had myocardial infarction in her 70s.
Father had myocardial infarction in his 70s and had an unknown type of cancer.
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; see synoptic report #1. b.  Immunostains of the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, and negative for cytokeratin 20 and HepPar1, with satisfactory controls.
Mild chronic cholecystitis.
No calculi present.
Liver, segment 4A, resection (R-U): a.  Hepatocellular carcinoma, well-differentiated; see synoptic report #2. b.  Immunostains of the tumor cells are diffusely and strongly positive for HepPar1, with satisfactory controls, supporting the diagnosis  Imaging: [**2114-5-24**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
[**2114-5-28**] Cardiac cath: Selective coronary angiogrpahy in this right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary disease.
The LAD had minimal luminal irregularities.
The RCA had a 99% mid vessel stenosis and an aneuysm of the ostium which was present at baseline.
Resting hemodynamics revealed nromal systemic blood pressure.
[**2114-5-28**] echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior akinesis and inferoseptal and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is mildly elevated.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate focal left ventricular dysfunction consistent with CAD.
Mild right ventricular dilation with preservation of apical motion (base less well seen), mild pulmonary hypertension, and septal flattening.
Cannot rule out pulmonary embolism.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-4**], the focal wall motion abnormalities and right ventricular findings are new.
He had an epidural in place which was held due hypotension.
He had 2 chest tubes in place as well as an abdominal JP drain.
On POD 2 ([**5-26**]), he was doing well and his pain was well controlled with the epidural/PCA and chest tube #1 was removed and the 2nd chest tube was placed to bulb suction.
Overnight he had acute mental status changes with increased O2 requirements and respiratory distress.
EKG showed new Afib and Lopressor was given with no change.
CXR demonstrated increased left lung opacity.
Cardiac enzymes revealed increased troponins with new ischemia on EKG.
Lower extremity US which were negative for DVT and a bronchoscopy which was clear.
Overnight he had a acute change in neurological exam where he was only moving his LUE to sternal rub and not moving his RUE and had R pupil > L pupil.
A stat head CT was done which showed no evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
CXR showed Asymmetrical interstitial edema affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right.
The CT was d/c'd without incident.
CXR on [**6-3**] showed persistent right-sided moderate-to-large pneumothorax, unchanged and left-sided effusion and left basilar atelectasis persisted.
Vicodin was used for pain with break thru dilaudid.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Cardiac rehab post MI (STEMI)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hepatoma Right upper lobe carcinoma s/p STEMI with RCA stent placement [**2114-5-28**]   Discharge Condition: Stable/good   Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr[**Name (NI) 670**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you have fevers > 101, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, yellowing of skin or eyes, shortness of breath, chest pain,inability to eat or take medications.
Monitor incision for redness, drainage or bleeding No heavy lifting.
No driving or alcohol while taking pain medication  Followup Instructions: -Follow up with Oncology, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/Dr.
