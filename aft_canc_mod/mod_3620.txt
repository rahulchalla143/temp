M with multiple episodes of pericarditis presenting with CP.
The patient states that he awoke from sleep several times the evening prior to admission with severe aching substernal chest pain.
He describes associated shortness of breath and episodes of chills and sweats.
The patient took 2 percocet with improvement in the pain to [**2111-5-18**] and then 2 more percocet with improvement in the pain to [**3-24**].
The patient's pain resolved in the ED 12 hours after it began.
This is identical to the patient's prior episodes of chest pain associated with pericarditis except today's episode is not as severe.
The interview consisted of a strenuous workout.
During that admission, the patient presented with CP radiating to the back, diaphoresis, N/V and abdominal pain with some hypotension.
The patient had no echo and cath signs suggestive of tamponade with small-moderate sized effusion.
Extensive work-up of for a source of pericarditis, including rheumatologic, infectious and malignant is ongoing and thus far negative (including pericardial fluid negative for AFB, viral cultures or malignant cells).
He underwent bedside echocardiogram with verbal report of small pericardial effusion, elevated RA pressure but no tamonade.
The patient had a CXR with a question of left lower lobe pneumonia and he received levofloxacin 500mg IV.
Family History: There is no family history of pericarditis.
He has a first cousin with a diagnosis of lupus, otherwise no other rheumatological diseases.

A tiny left apical pneumothorax persists that has slightly decreased in size since the prior examination.
There is an interval decrease of the right pleural effusion associated with improved aeration of the right base.
There is a minimal right basilar atelectasis present.
No new focal opacities are seen.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, grossly unchanged since the prior examination.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
Relatively echogenic region within the interpolar left kidney appears to correspond to an area of normal cortex seen on CT in association with a duplicated collecting system on the left side.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
Mild global LV hypokinesis.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No RA or RV diastolic collapse.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %).
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-17**], the small echolucent pericardial effusion has become a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion that is echodense, largest posterior to the left ventricle.
There is severe tethering of both the left and right ventricular epicardium resulting in mildly depressed function.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade, but effusive/constrictive process is suggested.

Patient has a history of recurrent pericarditis and now presents with chest pain similar to previous episodes.
Echo showed no signs of tamponade, but showed small to moderate effusion and constrictive process.
Pt was seen by rheum on previous admission and extensive workup was positive only for mildly elevated RF and SSA anitbodies.
Pericardial fluid was found to be positive for peptostreptoccocus and 1+WBCs.
Echo showed pericardial effusion and constriction.
His creatinine became elevated and his toradol was dc'd.
He remained afebrile and was discharged to home on POD #7.
