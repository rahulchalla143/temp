# Hypercalcemia - Etiology unknown.
Causes of hypercalcemia with a low PTH include malignancy, Vitamin D excess, increased bone turnover, thiazide diuretic use and Milk Alkali syndrome.
Primary adrenal insufficiency can also cause a hypercalcemia [**1-5**] decreased vascular volume and calcium clearance.
Given pt's h/o malignancy, hypercalcemia of malignancy cannot be excluded.
Some solid tumor malignancies can produce a PTH related peptide.
# Non gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely a renal tubular acidosis secondary to Fanconi-like syndrome due to tenofavir use.
# Anemia - 34.3 at time of initial admission [**11-1**], now 25.7.
Likely this is patient's baseline as he had been hemoconcentrated in setting of nausea, vomiting and minimal PO intake.
# Hyponatremia: Recently started on steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
# Renal failure: improved from last admission with creatinine 1.8.
Still with renal failure and known proteinuria diagnosed on last admission.
Unclear etiology of intrinsic renal failure.
# AIDS: Discontineud tenofavir and started on abacavir/lamivudine combo pill.
