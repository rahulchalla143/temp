In [**2119-1-12**] pt underwent L3L4 laminectomy for epidural abcess.
Pain recurred after discontinuation of 6 week post-op course of antibiotics (organism and Abx unknown at this time).
Pt apparently admitted to OSH for similar back pain prior to transfer.
Pt was prepared for discharge at OSH, but then collapsed, became lethargic, was found to be in flutter vs fib w/ RVR, with WBC of 40, and producing copious dark stools.
Sequence of events and chronicity not entirely clear.
3 peripheral IVs were placed.
Tachycardia did not resolve with fluids--interpreted as flutter with variable block.
NSGY eval in the ED for low back pain as they thought he had a laminectomy in [**2121-1-12**] for epidural abcess, if fact, laminectomy was in [**2118**].

Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2418**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Blood Cultures [**Date range (1) 34617**] - No Growth .
Abnormal STIR hyperintense collection within the ventral epidural space tracking along the posterior margin of the L5 vertebral body and sacrum resulting in complete effacement of the ventral sac with abnormal clumping of the nerve roots at these levels.
Given the patient's clinical history and adjacent right-sided paravertebral collections, findings are suspicious for epidural phlegmon or abscess.
Limited evaluation of multilevel degenerative disc disease with disc bulges as detailed above.
Slightly elevated signal within multiple endplates and discs are likely degenerative, but underlying discitis/osteomyelitis cannot be excluded by this limited imaging.
There remains high clinical concern, repeat MRI with increased sedation or correlation with nuclear scintigraphy exam should be considered.
MRI Left Foot [**2121-6-21**] Dorsal dislocation of the second metatarsophalangeal joint, extensive, loculated and enhancing fluid collections centered at the second  metatarsophalangeal joint, extending proximally to the second metatarsal base and first tarsometatarsal joint, consistent with the second metatarsophalangeal septic arthritis and associated abscesses in the more proximal forefoot.
Mild edema in the distal second metatarsal without definitive changes of osteomyelitis.
No valvular vegetations, abscess or pathologic regurgitation seen.
[**2121-6-27**] CT head IMPRESSION: Small vessel ischemic disease, no sign of abscess.
[**2121-6-29**] MRI Shoulder INDICATION: 55-year-old man with history of MRSA of right shoulder, question septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.
FINDINGS: There is a massive effusion extending through a torn rotator cuff from the joint to the subdeltoid/subacromial bursa and subscapularis recess containing debris and septations.
There is marked edema within the head and neck of the humerus as well as the glenoid with loss of cortical definition.
A focal area of T2 hyperintensity measuring 12 (AP) x 12 (TV) x 16 (CC) mm with thick peripheral enhancement (series 15:25) located in the proximal humeral metadiaphysis is consistent with an intraosseous abscess.
There is edema within the muscles of the rotator cuff, especially the subscapularis muscle.
A peripherally enhancing 12 x 8 mm abscess (series 13:38) is seen in the subscapularis muscle.
While not dedicated to evaluation of the rotator cuff, there is a complete tear of the supraspinatus tendon, as well as tears of the infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons.
There is a tear of the superior labrum (series 11:16).
Complex fluid collection in the shoulder joint communicating with the subacromial/subdeltoid bursae and subscapularis recess with diffuse marrow edema and loss of cortical definition of the humeral head, proximal humeral metadiaphysis and glenoid.
Small intramuscular abscess within the subscapularis muscle.
Overall, the findings are concerning for osteomyelitis, interosseous abscess, and septic joint.
Blood cx showed MRSA bacteremia on [**2121-6-17**].
TTE and TEE without vegetation.
Pt also developed back pain and L toe pain which were felt to be likely seeded from MRSA bacteremia.
He was electively intubated for MRI, which showed epidural abscess.
MR of the foot also showed septic arthritis.
Podiatry did an incision and drainage at the bedside which he tolerated well.
After these procedures the patient had occasional temperature spikes.
MRSA sepsis has cleared with foci of infection in left foot, pelvis, lumbar spine, and right shoulder.
MR shoulder showed osteomyelitis, septic joint and interosseous abscess.
Orthopedics did a tap of the shoulder that was dry, and their assessment was that there was no discrete abscess that would benefit from an open shoulder washout.
DVT Right UE: presented with a painful and increasingly swollen elbow.
Pt states pain is improving, but clinically edema is worsened.
CT elbow showed small (<1cm) fluid in biceps and small joint effusion without osteo.
Clinical suspicion high for clot given degree of swelling on exam.
Repeat u/s [**6-26**] showed brachial vein clot with 8x10cm complex cyst in shoulder, concerning for an abscess.
He has a history of MRSA in the joint with chronic swelling.
MRI showed osteomyelitis, septic joint and abscess.
Guiaic positive stools: Guiaic positive but not melena, especially considering that Hct has [**Doctor First Name **] stable despite large amounts of dark stool.
Anemia: Patient had iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation/disease.
Pt reticulocyte count 3.9%, corrected retic index ~1%, which is not appropriate with his anemia and consistent with this diagnosis.
The patient had guiaic positive stools and the original plan was to perform an EGD and colonoscopy, however the patient declined the procedure.
He was informed of the risk that he was undertaking of continued bleeding from declining the procedures.
Tachycardia: Atrial tachyarrhtymia.
Hemodynamically tolerating elevated rate.
Rate not indicative of intravascular depletion.
Corrected to normal sinus rhythm after sepsis resolved.
Hypoalbuminemia: urine negative for protein, probably not a liver synthesis problem as [**Name (NI) 3539**] not elevated and only slight INR increase.
Poor dentition: has ~3 teeth, very loose and discolored.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw weekly BUN, creatinine, CBC with differential to monitor renal function and treatment response to vancomycin, and platelets to monitor for acute marked drop from lovenox.
MRSA controled and no evidence of bacteremia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a MRSA infection in your blood.
MRSA is a bacteria that can cause severe infections, and is difficult to treat because it is resistant to many antibiotics.
As a result of this you also got MRSA infections in your foot, shoulder, pelvis and lumbar spine.
This is concerning for a possibly bleed in your stomach or bowels.
You also developed a clot in the vein of your right arm.
As a result of this you had swelling and pain your right elbow.
When you came from the outside hospital your heart was beating in an irregular rhythm - atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, tremors, abdominal pain, swollen red joints, dizzyness or any other symptom that is concerning to you, please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.
