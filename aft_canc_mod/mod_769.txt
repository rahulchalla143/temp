The patient noted painless hematuria and clots beginning of [**Month (only) 958**] He had a TUR at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] where a bladder tumor was noted.
He has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in evaluation for a possible cystectomy and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for medical oncologic  opinion of the angiosarcoma.
Most recently he had a bone scan in [**4-12**], which showed increased tracer activity in L5-S1 region, likely representing degenerative changes.
CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis [**4-12**], shows  a infrarenal aortic aneurysm, measuring 4.2 x 4.8 cm, asymmetric  inferior bladder wall thickening, and multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring 5 mm in the right middle lobe.
He presents for cystoprostatectomy.
Past Medical History: Prostate carcinoma Heartburn Asthma Appendectomy No tuberculosis noted COPD: FEV1 58%    Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 19000**] is retired.
There are no consolidations.
There is mild blunting of the right CP angle, likely reflecting a small effusion.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral upper lobe nodules, more conspicuous than on prior studies.
There is no focal infiltrate.
Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are incompletely evaluated due to exclusion of the costophrenic angles bilaterally.
Cardiomegaly and improving congestive heart failure.
Bibasilar atelectasis and probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19000**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cystoprostatectomy on [**2198-6-19**] (please see dictated operative report for details) without adverse events.
Given the large fluid requirement and his history of COPD, patient remained intubated overnight.
He was given both normal saline and 2 units of PRBCs with no kidney response (24 hour total of 304 cc) and he remained in aneuric failure despite receiving >5000cc of fluid over 24 hours.
Nephrology consult was obtained and the worry was that the patient was in aneuric renal failure vs. outflow obstruction.
No evidence for hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
No evidence for urinoma.
Small amount of intraabdominal ascites as well as inflammatory stranding along the pararenal fascia and within the right lower quadrant at the site of the ureteroileal loop anastomosis.
These changes are most likely secondary to recent postoperative state.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lung base compressive atelectasis.
Urinalysis was consistent with acute tubular nephritis with aneuria, and creatinine continued to rise.
Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted over existing right IJ to monitor fluid status and cardiac function.
He developed progressive non-anion gap acidosis and bicarbonate infusion was started to control acidemia.
He spiked fevers to 101.6 on post operative day 6.
Blood, urine, sputum cultures were obtained and sputum culture showed pseudomonas aureginosa presence.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezing.
