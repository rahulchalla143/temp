Biliary Tree: Two 10 mm piston-like stones that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
There was post-obstructive dilation of the mid and distal CBD to 12 mm with a mild dilation of the upper CBD and CHD to 8-9 mm.
Two large 1 cm stones and a copious amount of small stones, stone fragments, and thick sludge were extracted successfully using a 9-12mm Rx balloon catheter.
Multiple stones were seen in the gallbladder.
