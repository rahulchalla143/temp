NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2102-6-17**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2102-6-17**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Low lung volumes, and cardiomegaly, with bibasilar atelectasis.
EGD Findings: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 5 cords of grade III varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous granularity, erythema and mosaic appearance of the mucosa were noted in the whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with Portal hypertensive gastropathy.
But no gastroesophageal varices noted near GE junction.
There are several non-dilated loops of air-filled small bowel.
Liver demonstrates lobulated contour, compatible with patient's known history of underlying cirrhosis.
There is possible enhancement of the thrombus, suggestive of tumor thrombus.
The liver is of heterogeneous enhancement.
Multiple hepatic hypodensities are present.
Ill-defined areas of hypodensities in the liver may represent infarction or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
Bowel wall edema of the cecum and ascending colon may reflect third spacing, infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic causes.
Small bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
There are no pneumothoraces.
There is some atelectasis and low lung volumes at the lung bases.
There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 71yo male with hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented with acute variceal bleed initially requiring intubation and [**Last Name (un) **] placement that has since resolved.
# Variceal bleed:  Presented with hematemesis and initial EGD was without a clear lesion for intervention but suspected to be a variceal bleed.
Repeat EGD showed 5 cords of grade III varices in the lower third of the esophagus and 4 bands were successfully placed.
Patient was transfused a total of 2 units of PRBCs and since then blood counts remained stable and he has had no further melena.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed a portal vein thrombus, and therefore was determined not to be a TIPS candidate.
He was insufflated with quite a bit of air during his endoscopy with rising bladder pressures, relieved by placement of rectal tube and decompression of abdominal gas.
Patient spiked a fever during his stay and diagnostic paracentesis initially grew coag-negative staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Repeat CT was performed which showed no signs of perforation so patient was empirically started on fluconazole for a total of seven days and zosyn for 48 hours.
Therapeutic paracentesis the following day revealed only small pockets of fluid.
Patient remained afebrile and without leukocytosis for the remainder of his stay.
# Hep C cirrhosis complicated by ascites and esophageal varices.
Hep C viral load was 1.6 million and Hepatitis B serologies were negative.
Given no history of encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ciprofloxacin, lactulose and rifaxamin were not initiated at this time.
# Possible hepatocellular carcinoma - Patient had CT scan which revealed multiple irregular hepatic hypodensities and portal vein thrombosis, likely from associated tumor.
Patient will require further imaging with MRI/MRCP and discussion of possible treatment of his likely hepatocellular carcinoma  # s/p intubation: Patient intubated at outside hospital for airway protection in the setting of GI bleed.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Further workup and management of his hepatocellular carcinoma will need to occur in [**Location (un) **] - Consider initiating diuretics if required for volume overload/blood pressure control - Fluconazole course will end on [**6-20**] and sucralafate will end on [**6-25**] - The hepatology attending on service was [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD whose telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111934**] and address is [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]  Medications on Admission: - amlodipine 10mg daily - atenolol 100mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 111935**], You were admitted to the hospital after vomiting blood and losing consciousness.
We found that the bleeding was coming from the esophagus and the stomach and we controlled the bleeding with banding of the blood vessels.
We also performed a CT scan that showed some fluid in your abdomen and areas of the liver concerning for liver cancer.
You will need to discuss further treatment for your possible liver cancer as well as repeat endoscopy to evaluate the the blood vessels in your GI tract.
