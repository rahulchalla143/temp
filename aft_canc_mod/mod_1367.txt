Admission Date:  [**2172-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-8-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 84F h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma, CHF (EF 45-50%), HTN, SIADH who presented s/p fall and taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 620**] on [**8-16**] where she was noted to have a change in mental status, dysarthria, and SOB.
Laboratories revealed hypercalcemia (14-15) and ARF (Cre 1.5; b/l 1.0), for which she was given calcitonin and IV fluids.
She was also found to have a LUL infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.
Head CT was negative for bleed but CT scan of the C-spine showed a C7 compression fracture (unclear if old or new).
On arrival, she was noted to be in hypertensive urgency with SBP's in the 200's, started on a nitro gtt, and admitted to the MICU.
Her hypercalcemia was treated with calcitonin, IVF's, and lasix and is improving (currently 10.0).
The etiology of her hypercalcemia is unclear at this time, ?milk alkali syndrome vs. vitamin D toxicity vs. malignancy.
Abdominal U/S and CT revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes, likely a recurrence of her Hodgkin's disease.
Her renal failure appears to be secondary to prerenal and hypercalcemia and is responding to gentle IV hydration and correction of her hypercalcemia (decreased from 2.8 to 2.3 currently).
The patient was seen by neuro for evaluation of her mental status changes, thought to be toxic / metabolic secondary to infections (UTI, PNA) and hypercalcemia rather than CVA.
She continues to have mild dysarthria, SOB, and occasional nausea without vomiting.
She continues to have low grade fevers and hypertension.
Past Medical History: * Hyponatremia secondary to SIADH * confusion not otherwise specified * bronchitis * hypertension * osteoarthritis * anemia * Hodgkin's disease (s/p ABVD x 6 cycles, pelvic XRT [**2165**]) * renal lesion on CT scan by report * hypercholesterolemia * hypomagnesemia * hypokalemia.
* CHF (EF 45-50%) * COPD  Social History: The patient lives alone.
She occasionally uses alcohol and on further questioning reports that she drinks Vodka and cranberry juice every day but denies any history of alcohol withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens.
