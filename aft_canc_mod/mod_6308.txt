History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] with lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma complicated by aplastic anemia secondary to fludarabine based therapy, h/o colon cancer s/p colectomy, and HTN who has had multiple recent admissions for bleeding from colostomy secondary to thrombocytopenia and recurrent infections (most recently resistant pseudomonas right groin abscess) who presentes today with GI bleeding and fever.
She presented to [**Hospital 16843**] hospital with 200 cc of BRBPR in the setting of undetectable platelet levels.
For her fever, she was given zosyn and imipenem and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
A CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity.
She was also given 2L NS for dehydration.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient reported intermittent non-productive cough for months.
She remained stable, and was called out to the floor where she had no complaints.

OSH Blood cxs: 4/4 bottles positive for Pseudomonas pan-resistant except to tobramycin  Repeat surveillance cultures: [**3-18**], [**3-22**], [**3-24**]: negative growth .
CT abdomen: 1. evaluation limited due to lack of IV contrast (IV infiltrated after 20cc, no access).
small amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
No evidence of abscess.
no free air.
2. moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted for sepsis, with initial presentation of fevers, leukocytosis and [**3-21**] blood cultures from OSH positive for Pseudomonas resistant to imipinem, quinolones and sensitive only to tobramycin.
She has a history of multiple resistant infections including MRSA/VRE abscesses in thigh, Clostridium difficile infection, Klebsiella, and prior Imipenem sensitive pseudomonas.
On the floor, she was afebrile and normotensive.
Her coumadin, which was initially started several weeks prior to admission and then discontinued at time of GI bleed, was not restarted although she did have a CHADS score of 2 with her atrial fibrillation history, given that she was deemed too high risk for anticoagulation.
Her lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma continued to be in remission.
She did initially have an O2 requirement however this was weaned; she was found to have small, stable pulmonary effusions likely secondary to fluid administration.
At time of discharge, she was saturating well on room air although had mild dyspnea on exertion.
She was afebrile and normotensive.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Pseudomonas bacteremia 2) Lower GI bleed 3) Aplastic Anemia 4) Lymphoplasmacytic  Lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulating on room air, clear mental status, normotensive, in atrial fibrillation with normal ventricular rate.
You were admitted because you had positive blood cultures growing out a bacteria called Pseudomonas.
At the time of admission, you also had some lower GI bleeding, however this resolved.
At time of admission, you had no evidence of continued GI bleed.
