Again there is a right lower lobe mass with hilar and mediastinal adenopathy consistent with the patient's known neoplasm.
There may be some associated consolidation in the region at the right base.
Continued but decreased left basilar opacification consistent with atelectasis or pneumonia and pleural effusion.
The effusion at the right base appears to have substantially cleared.
[**2-17**] Endoscopy: Impression: Moderate-severe distal esophagitis Normal mucosa in the stomach Mild duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Antireflux regimen: Avoid chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, caffeine, onions, aspirin.
[**2-17**] Colonoscopy: Impression: Blood in the whole colon Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyps in the ascending colon and transverse colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids No blood noted in Terminal Ileum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum Recommendations: No active bleeding noted.
If starts bleeding actively, recommend CTA and IR.
Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSION: 77 yo M with h/o lung adeno s/p chemo/radiation, p/w BRBPR and hypotension.
Given hypotension on presentation his anticoagulation was reversed with IV vit K (recently admitted with c/f pulmonary embolism, and discharged on warfarin).
EGD and [**Last Name (un) **] were done [**2134-2-17**], showing esophagitis (likely [**12-24**] radiation) and multiple colonic diverticuli with no stigmata of active bleeding.
# Multi focal tachycardia: Present on prior admissions, but felt to be exacerbated by his acute blood loss and hypotension.
# ARF: Thought to be prerenal in the setting of blood loss and hypotension.
# Dysphagia: [**12-24**] prior chest radiation.
Started on PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate QID and lidocaine/maalox/benadryl mixture QID prior to meals with some relief.
# History of PE: pt on warfarin for dx of presumed PE based on ekg findings (S1Q3T3), ddimer, and echo with RH strain on prior admission.
In setting of GIB warfarin held and initially pt reversed with vit K.  IVC filter placed on [**2-19**] without complication.
#lung adenocarcinoma - s/p chemo and XRT.
#Sputum: productive cough with sputum, left lower lung field with diffuse rhonchi.
Afebrile without leukocytosis; not hypoxic or subjectively dyspneic.
Pt was recently treated for hospital acquired pneumonia in the beginning of [**Month (only) 958**] and it was felt that without a fever or leukocytosis, he would not require retreatment for HAP.
Transitional issues: - evaluation of esophagitis if symptoms continue - repeat colonoscopy in future for removal of polyps seen on [**Last Name (un) **] this admission   Medications on Admission: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheeze.

Discharge Medications: 1. sucralfate 1 gram Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for swallowing pain.
2. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**11-23**]  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
12. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
14. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
16. silver sulfadiazine 1 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical DAILY (Daily): to areas of stage 2 burns on back only.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed from diverticulosis Esophagitis (radiation induced) Multifocal atrial tachycardia Pulmonary embolism Acute kidney injury  Lung adenocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had and upper and lower endoscopy which showed #1) moderate to severe radiation esophagitis and #2) diverticulosis.
You were bleeding from one of these diverticula due to the lovenox you were taking for a pulmonary embolism.
Please note the following changes to your medications:  START Lidocaine/maalox/benadryl mixture 30ml by mouth four times per day as needed for swallowing pain (take 15-30 minutes before meals) Sucralfate 1g by mouth four times per day as needed for swallowing pain (mix in 10mL of water prior to consumption) Pantoprazole 40mg by mouth twice per day Aquaphor lotion to radiation burns three times per day as needed for itch Silvadene cream to areas of stage 2 burns once per day applied with a sterile tongue depressor  STOP Lovenox Prednisone Levofloxacin  Otherwise take all medications as prescribed.
