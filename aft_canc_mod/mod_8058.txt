[**2177-9-4**] EEG - (preliminary) no epileptiform activity, diffuse theta-delta slowing, severe diffuse encephalopathic pattern   Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo W h/o CAD, HTN, HL, history of essential thrombocythemia which may have evolved into a Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] (JAK2+), tobacco use p/w up to 10 hours of depressed level of awareness and R hemiparesis with spontaneous improvement and found to have IVH and very mild SAH due to hemorrhage leaking out from the foramen Lushkae into the [**Female First Name (un) **].
[] Intraventricular Hemorrhage - She was found on the ground on the evening of [**8-27**] by her husband.
When she arrived at an outside hospital, her exam was very poor: she was nonresponsive, her pupils were described as pinpoint, and she was only minimally withdrawing on the left side.
Her exam since arrival has fluctuated significantly: at times she was minimally arousable and at other times she remained awake and followed simple commands with only mild right-sided upper extremity-predominant weakness, inattention, and some memory deficits.
Neurosurgery was consulted but decided to hold off on placing a ventriculostomy while her mental status remained relatively functional.
Her exam worsened on [**2177-8-30**] mainly due to respiratory problems and she was intubated.
At this time, Neurosurgery decided to place a ventriculostomy; the EVD was placed without complication and with maintenance of appropriate ICPs with minimal change in neurologic exam.
During her complicated medical course, her neurologic exam has gradually deteriorated with worsening of her right sided arm and leg weakness and decreased level of awareness (unable to obtain attention, no longer following commands reliably).
After several days of delay due to multiple medical complications, she was stable enough to receive an MRI of the Brain on [**2177-9-3**] which shows multiple small right-sided ischemic infarcts (DWI bright, ADC dark), extensive subcortical and periventricular white matter disease, and persistence (but improvement) in the degree of intraventricular hemorrhage.
The strokes by themselves would not explain her depressed level of consciousness, and thus an EEG was performed due to concerns for potential status epilepticus as she was having rhythmic eyelid contractions and sporadic eye movements.
The EEG was negative for seizure activity.
[] Thrombocythemia, likely Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] - She is noted to have a history of thrombocythemia per report, and per prior records from her previous Hematologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90792**] in [**State 108**], she has the JAK2 mutation that is strongly suggestive of Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
We consulted Hematology-Oncology regarding bleeding risk assessment in case the patient requires further invasive procedures, for which it appears that her thrombocytosis would place her at risk for both thrombosis and hemorrhage (via acquired [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease).
[] Pulmonary Edema, Hemodynamic Instability - On [**2177-8-28**], the patient became progressively tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypertensive and required more supplemental O2 to maintain her SaO2 in the 90s in the setting of a 500cc fluid bolus given for suspected hypovolemia in the setting of progressive tachycardia.
Her hemodynamic status normalized with metoprolol, albuterol/ipratropium, oxygen and mild diuresis with furosemide 10 IV.
This may have been related to mild volume overload in the setting of likely COPD or beta blocker withdrawal from having been off medications during the prehospital obtunded period.
However, her respiratory status continued to be tenuous and she was intubated for persistent respiratory distress.
She intermittently had episodes of tachynea/tachycardia/hypoxia without any evident cause (clear lungs to auscultation besides upper airway sounds and secretions, no infiltrates on CXR, no cardiac or metabolic causes) which resolved to some degree with sedation with Propofol.
[] Fever of Unknown Origin - On [**2177-8-30**], the patient became febrile and had blood, urine, and sputum cultures drawn, all of which have had no growth to date.
It is possible that her fever was central in origin and was the result of temperature regulation dysfunction from the intraventricular hemorrhage.
[] Hypernatremia - The patient was mildly hypernatremic at admission to the high 140s, thought to be secondary to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
In the setting of large amounts of IVH and no ventriculostomy for decompression, she was permitted to have mild hypernatremia to minimize cerebral edema.
However, this progressed during [**Date range (1) 10659**], and the patient was started on NS, then 1/2NS and Furosemide to address her hypernatremia which resolved with this treatment.
