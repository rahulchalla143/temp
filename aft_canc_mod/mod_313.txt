Admission Date:  [**2110-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-5-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ibandronate Sodium / Actonel / Hydrochlorothiazide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 11740**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a history of HTN who presents with SOB and fever.
She went to her PCP yesterday with complaint of several days of SOB and non productive cough.
She did not have wheezes and was not hypoxic.
Tonight she presented to the ED due to progressive respiratory distress.
The patient was tachypneic and very wheezy despite no COPD/asthma history.
A chest X ray showed an opacity so she was given ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
Given poor response to above, she was placed on BiPAP and was noted to have a breif episode of hypotension to the 70s which resolved with 500 cc NS bolus.
She was sent for a CTA, which revealed a moderate pericardial effusion showing effusive constrictive pattern but no tamponade.
An echo was obtained which showed a moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tampenade.
She also complained of some intermittient abdominal discomfort, but her abdomen was soft and she was guaiac negative.
She also admits to poor PO intake due to anorexia and chills for the last week.
She denies any chest pain, palpitations (even in the ed witht the SVT), syncope, orthopnea, ankle edema, prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, black stools or red stools.
HTN 2.
Family History: Denies significant cardiac history.
Sister had liver cancer  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.4 BP: 159/102 P: 99 R: 28 O2: 100% on bipap pulsus 10 mm hg General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, biPAP mask in place  HEENT: Sclera anicteric, mouth not examined, fine jaw tremor Neck: JVD difficult to assess given mask and fine jaw tremor Lungs: no wheezes or rhonchi, bilateral rhales CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, extra heart sounds difficult to appreciate over the sound of the bipap machine Abdomen: + BS, soft, non-distended, tenderness to deep palpation in RLQ, no rebound tenderness or guarding Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: [**2110-5-2**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Low lung volumes limit evaluation, as does the portable AP technique.
The heart appears mildly enlarged allowing for technical limitations.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is slight increase in retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
There is note made of Kerley B lines suggesting mild fluid overload.
Degenerative changes are severe at both shoulders.
There is a dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, apex along the upper lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild fluid overload, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Probable left lower lobe atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, possibly related to hydrostatic edema but not specific for this process.
Mild hydrostatic edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions, left slightly larger than right.
Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules.
Given the patient's advanced age, follow- up is likely not warranted if there is no history of a primary malignancy.
Focal opacity in the right lung apex, which appears to have been present on chest radiograph of [**2109-2-5**], and most likely reflects a scar.
However, serial chest radiographs could be considered to exclude indolent infection if warranted clinically.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 11740**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and recent symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented to the ED with fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial effusion and atypical cells on diff suggestive of blasts.
# Acute leukemia: Patient's initial labs showed anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis which was concerning for hematological malignancy.
She was also found to have a pericardial effusion which was thought to be malignant.
?s age and poor prognosis with leukemia - a family meeting was held to determine whether or not she should have a confirmatory bone marrow biopsy and undergo chemotherapy.
# Pericardial effusion: In the ED the patient underwent CTA for her dyspnea and was found to have evidence of moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Pulsus paradoxus was not elevated at 10 mm hg and she had no evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although she did have transient hypotension in the ED that was responsive to a small bolus of IV fluids).
The initial differential diagnosis included malignant versus infective pericarditis with effusion.
Uremic or autoimmune disease was less likely given no history of autimmune disease and normal BUN.
Given the presence of blasts on peripheral blood, and no ST changes on EKG or elevated troponin, it was thought that the effusion was most likely malignant.
Heme/Onc was consulted and it was decided not to pursue fluid diagnosis with pericardiocentesis given comfort goals as stated above.
# Shortnes of breath: The patient presented with complaint of worsening dyspnea.
Her chest x ray showed evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
This was thought to be due to poor forward left ventricular ejection possibly due to the pericardial effusion versus diastolic dysfunction.
This was continued initially, but was stopped in the CCU as the patient was no longer febrile and it was not thought that she had a pneumonia, but rather the fever was from her malignancy.
# Hyponatremia: The patient was found to be hyponatremic on admission with sodium of 122.
Pt had history of hypnatremia in [**2107**], but this was thought to be from appropriate ADH in setting of overdiuresis with HCTZ.
Fena was 2.5 which did not support hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Clinically she appeared hypervolemic, therefore it was thought that she may have SIADH likely due to malignancy.
Her EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged PR or QRS.
It was thought that she may have pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of thrombocytosis (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal) however, hyperkalemia resolved while her platelets were still elevated which does not support this.
Iron studies  were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
It was thought that her anemia was likley from her malignancy.
This was also thought to be secondary to her underlying malignancy.
# AVNRT: The patient had an episode of SVT in the ED that looked like AVNRT on EKG.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and had no other events.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
New leukemia 2.
Pericardial Effusion 3.
Heart Failure Exacerbation 4.
You were initially admitted with shortness of breath and fever.
In the emergency room you were treated for pneumonia, but required IV fluids due to low blood pressure, bipap for help with breathing and were found to have fluid that had built up around your heart.
After discussion with hematology/oncology and your family, you decided that you did not want to pursue further testing or treating.
