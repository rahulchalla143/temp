Admission Date:  [**2168-7-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-7-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-10-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**] Chief Complaint: Inability to speak.
Head CT non contrast   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 64 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of left temporal anaplastic astrocytoma, s/p resection who presented with acute onset speech disturbance.
There was no obvious weakness or other concerning symptoms.
Work-up also included a CT of the head which revealed a hyperintense area in the left temporal lobe.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**], he received atropine x 2 for bradycardia into the 30's.
At that time, he had subacute onset of headache.
He apparently experienced an episode of aphasia and a seizure.
[**State 4338**] with gadolinium revealed 2x4cm enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe.
CT torso to evaluate for occult malignancy was negative.
Stereotactic biopsy of the lesion was performed and demonstrated grade III-IV anaplastic astrocytoma.
He was initially treated with steroids with some improvement.
Eventually, he underwent partial resection of the lesion, but post-op scans revealed "significant mass remained."
Note is made of stable appearance of the lesion since surgery on serial scans.
Distant history of cigarette smoking, more recently he smoked cigars.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: bradycardic, RR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Funduscopic exam technically limited due to pt cooperation, but revealed no overt papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Right nasolabial fold flattened.
Tone mildly increased on the right.
When held against gravity, there is mild drift in the right arm and leg.
Hyperdense material present within the surgical bed is consistent with acute blood products, at site of resected astrocytoma.
Slight asymmetry in the lateral ventricle size may at least in part represent a component of ex vacuo dilatation.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity is present and is notably greater on the left than the right, likely representing persistent peritumoral edema.
[**Month/Day/Year 4338**]/MRA: : A left temporal lobe subacute hematoma.
There is a thin rim of marginal enhancement present, which could represent residual or recurrent tumor.
No enhancing nodules are identified.
There is no abnormal signal deep to the region of enhancement.
There are no aneurysms.
There is no significant intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
Repeat Head CT [**7-14**]:  There is no change in the intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporoparietal region at the site of prior surgery.
No new hemorrhage is present.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There have been no other changes in the two-day interval.
Coumadin and all anticoagulation were held secondary to patient's bleed risk.
Neuro/Oncology:  Exam improved markedly over 48 hrs and now has minimal comprehension and word finding difficulties.
Still minor paraphasic errors, but much improved.
Received high dose steroids (with PPI and RISS) initially with rapid taper.
Cardiovascular:  Patient bradycardic since admission with rates regular but usually 40s and sometimes going into the 20s.
Noted to have a junctional rythem interjecting within 2.6 seconds.
Seen by cardiology who recommended no further treatment unless patient symptomatic or having other signs of poor perfusion (poor urine output).
Several hours later, pressures drop from SBP of 140s to 90 for period of 30 minutes or so.
He has history of PE and DVT post-op and will need to resume anticoagulation (lovenox) in [**4-14**] weeks.
ID: Had low grade fever to 100.5 on evening of [**7-13**].
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Temporal Anaplastic Astrocytoma with hemorrhage.
Bradycardia Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Aphasia much improved.
Now only making very minimal paraphasic errors and having only minimal cognitive problems.
[**Name (NI) **] deficits in strenght, coordination, sensation or gait.
Contact neurologist or call emergency medical services if symptoms return or if you develop any sudden visual changes, weakness, speech changes.
