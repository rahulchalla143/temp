There is a small amount of increased density in the acqueduct and fourth ventricle.
There is a small amount of increased density peripherally in the posterior frontal on the right and parietal region on the left consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent.
There is low density in the periventricular white matter.
There is a history on subsequent examinations (this examination is being interpreted on [**2176-9-30**]) of a transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary tumor and the appearance of the sella is consistent with.
IMPRESSION: Intracranial hemorrhage is noted.
CT ANGIOGRAM: There is no definite evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
There is no evidence of vascular malformation.
There is no evidence of irregularity of the arteries in the region of the skull base.
There is mild calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of aneurysm or apparent cause for the intracranial hemorrhage.
FINDINGS:  There is a new ventricular catheter, extending from a right frontal approach, and terminating in the right lateral ventricle.
There is a small amount of nondependent air in the right lateral ventricle, and pneumocephalus, presumed related to recent surgery.
There is a similar degree of intraventricular hemorrhage occupying much of the left lateral and the entire third ventricle.
There is also similar hemorrhage within the right anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**], layering in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
The degree of ventricular dilatation is similar, and primarily involves the supratentorial ventricles, and again noted is a subependymal edema, which may overlap somewhat with diffuse white matter hypodensity suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus and some of the posterior ethmoid cells, which is often seen in intubation.
Similar appearance of extensive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus of the supratentorial ventricles.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW:  There is irregularity at the margins of the sphenoid sinus, with areas of demineralization.
There may not be integrity of the sinus walls and a direct coronal sinus CT could provide a better evaluation of this area.
In addition, there is asymmetric soft tissue at the right side of the sella, and a sella mass cannot be excluded.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11315**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] with these findings on [**2176-9-25**].
[**2176-9-25**] POST-TPA NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: FINDINGS:  Again seen is a ventriculostomy catheter traversing the right frontal lobe, terminating in the right lateral ventricle.
There has been interval decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus.
A small focus of intraventricular air remains stable in size and appearance.
There has been an interval decrease in the amount of intraventricular hemorrhage within the right and left lateral ventricles, although the amount of hemorrhage layering within the occipital horns is similar.
There is a similar amount of hemorrhage within the third ventricle.
The degree of ventricular dilatation has not significantly changed.
Again seen is diffuse hypodensity within the periventricular white matter which has previously been suggested to represent subependymal edema Vs. chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
The visualized paranasal sinuses again show opacification of the sphenoid sinuses with irregularity of the bony margins and demineralization.
Slight interval decrease in amount of intraventricular hemorrhage with unchanged hydrocephalus.
Irregularity within the sphenoid sinuses with areas of demineralization.
[**9-27**] CT head without contrast FINDINGS: There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with the tip in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
As before, there is layering blood within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
There is some subarachnoid blood bilaterally as before.
There is no midline shift, mass effect.
A tiny amount of pneumocephalus is present within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
The degree of subependymal edema is unchanged.
Unchanged amount of subarachnoid blood in the right parietotemporal region.
Unchanged amount of blood within the region of the left parietotemporal lobe.
Unchanged amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Left anterior fascicular block.
There is a small amount of intraventricular blood as before.
A small amount of hyperdensity along the falx, within one of the posterior frontal lobe gyri appears stable.
IMPRESSION: Stable intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhages previously described.
No new hemorrhage.
A 3 X 2 cm mass is seen in the right atrium.
Consider atrial myxoma, fibrionous material or a thrombus.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
3.The aortic root is moderately dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: 3x 3 right atrial mass that is partially mobile but seems to be attached to the wall of the right atrium.
Consider atrial myxoma, fibrionous material or a thrombus.
There has been interval retraction of the Dobhoff tube, which now terminates in the region of the gastric antrum.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
There is no airspace opacity to suggest consolidation.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No evidence for airspace opacification to suggest consolidation.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute bleeding in the abdomen.
There is some high attenuation density around the area of the bumper which could represent hematoma.
There is a NG tube noted within the stomach.
Non-contrast images of the liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, abdominal portions of the small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There does not appear to be significant pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no evidence of significant pathologic inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of acute bleeding.
Minimal amount of free fluid noted in the pelvis.
M recently admitted to OSH ([**9-22**]) presents to OSH with difficulty to arouse and respiratory distress (negative chest CT and labs).
Symptoms persisted so he was brought to another OSH for further evaluation where a head CT was performed and an interventricular bleed was noted.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-24**], where he was admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit, was intubated, an an intracerebral drain was placed, followed by a VP shunt for persistent hydrocephalus.
Thought to be [**2-1**] periprocedure adrenal insuffiency as he was afebile, blood, urine cx neg, CXR neg and CT abdomen not concerning for bleed or free air in abdomen.
He responded nicely to hydrocortisone 50 mg IV tid and has been hemodynamically stable now for several days with SBP from 110 - 130.
# L calf ulcer: He is now s/p a 7- day course of Vanc for possible skin infection on L calf which is now resolving.
# ICH: s/p VP shunt (sutures removed [**10-15**]).
He had no further evidence of seizure activity and, at the time of discharge, his dilantin level was therapeutic.
# Hyponatremia: He had a period of hyponatremia thought to be [**2-1**] volume depletion in the context of his pulling out his NGT and the fact that we had trouble replacing it.
Urine osm was high in context of low serum osms.
# Hypopituitary: started levothyroxine [**10-8**] for his panhypopituitarism  # Atrial flutter: had 2-3 episodes on [**10-8**] but none since then.
No h/o atrial tachycardia but has had surgery recently so is at increased risk.
TTE showed a right atrial mass, which most likely represents an atrial myxoma, although clot remains on the differential diagnosis.
He is a poor anticoagulation candidate, given his recent intraventricular hemorrhage and fall risk, and, therefore, anticoagulation was not initiated.
# Adrenal insufficiency: changed [**10-17**] from hydrocortisone 50 mg IV tid to prednisone 10 mg po qam and 5 mg po qpm.
# H/o hypoxia: He was found to be hypoxic for a short period after extubation.
No infiltrate on [**10-10**] CXR.
Has not needed any furosemide since transfer to medicine  # Hematuria: He had several episodes of hematuria during his hospital course but this was thought to be [**2-1**] bladder/urethra trauma from the foley.
If hematuria persists as an outpatient, urology follow-up may be considered at the discretion of his PCP.
# Gerd: continue Lansoprazole  # Anemia: He was not anemic on admission but became anemic during his hospital coure.
There was no clear source of active bleeding.
On CT abdomen, there may be a small hematoma peri-PEG-site.
Likely also [**2-1**] intracranial bleed and serial phlebotomy.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 13990**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Adrenal insufficency ICH Hypopituitary MRSA PNA Paranoid Schizophrenia Gastritis R atrial mass   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
If you experience any fever, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention immediately.
