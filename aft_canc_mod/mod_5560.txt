Admission Date:  [**2123-8-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-9-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 97-yo Russian-speaking man w/ h/o CAD s/p BMS [**11/2122**] and angioplasty [**5-/2123**], CHF (EF 40%), HTN, h/o GI bleeding and colon Ca, who presented to the ED for evaluation of chest pain.
However, on the morning of admission, the pt developed more severe chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder, assoc w/ SOB and diaphoresis, non-responsive to SL NTG, so he came to the ED for evaluation.
The pt was started on PRBCs for transfusion, but he developed chest pain and diaphoresis, so the transfusions were stopped for concern for a transfusion reaction.
Per the blood bank there was no evidence of a transfusion reaction.
He had 2/10 chest pain with ECG showing worsening ST depressions precordially, which resolved with Nitro gtt and Lopressor.
Of note he had been given lasix 20mg IV x1 at 8pm when he was noted to be tachypnic to 30's, O2 sat 93-94% on 3-4L, diffuse crackles and expiratory wheezing with chest xray per the radiology resident showing worsened pulmonary edema compared with admission.
He responded well to lasix with resolution of respiratory distress and put out 600+ ml of urine with blood pressures 110-120.
At 12:30 he was noted to be hypotensive as above on bp check.
Of note he had a large melanotic stool in the early evening.
He remained asymptomatic throughout.
EKG showed improvement in precordial ST segment depressions compared with admission.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95893**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of severe CAD s/p multiple prior PCI, moderate aortic stenosis, daily angina, anemia due to chronic GI blood loss admitted with NSTEMI and hematocrit of 21. .
1) NSTEMI/severe CAD- He has significant CAD hx s/p numerous percutaneous interventions and stenting previously.
He presented with chest pain, worsening ECG findings with marked precordial ST segment depressions and uptrending cardiac enzymes.
He was initially started on a nitroglycerin gtt and was transferred to the floor with persistant chest pain.
He was given metoprolol 5mg IV x1 which resolved his hypertension, tachycardia and chest pain.
His hematocrit was noted to be 21 which was the likely causing factor of his worsening symptoms.
Given the severity of his symptoms and his multiple prior PCI he was continued on his aspirin and plavix despite his GI blood loss.
Heparin was not started given the significant risk of worsening his blood loss.
2)Anemia/GI bleeding - Pt has h/o colon Ca and melanotic stools x1 on the day of admission.
He has not had colonoscopy or endoscopy due to his tenuous cardiac status but he has had melena in the past making an upper GI source the likely cause of his continued blood loss.
He did not have any additional melena and his hematocrit remained generally stable, at 34 on the day of discharge.
3) Hypotension - On admission patient was normotensive to hypotensive despite gastrointestinal bleeding.
During the initial night his blood pressure dropped to a systolic in 70's likely due to multiple etiologies including cardiac ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding and antihypertensive medications.
In addition he received lasix prior to the episode for dyspnea and worsening pulmonary edema seen on CXR following transfusion.
His antihypertensive medications were restarted slowly and he was back on his full regimen prior to discharge with no recurrance of hypotension or melena.
4) Acute on Chronic Systolic heart failure- mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferior septal/inferior lateral [**Last Name (LF) 95894**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 40%.
Known modearte-to-severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2) and left ventricular hypertrophy.
He did have intermittent periods of dyspnea which were thought most likely to be due to intermittent flash pulmonary edema that seemed to be provoked by pain or anxiety and responded to low dose morphine 0.25mg x1 or NTG.
He was not diuresed given poor oral intake during his admission and hypotension on admission following lasix administration for dyspnea.
5) AF with RVR - he remained in sinus rhythm during the majority of his hospital stay but did have period of afib with RVR with HR 110s while he was in the ICU.
His Metoprolol dose was increased to back to 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and he did not have any recurrance of Afib.
6) Bladder Spasm, penile pain - patient had episodes of severe bladder spasm and pain for which he was evaluated by urology.
There was not evidence of urinary retention however foley placement was difficulty due to his BPH.
In addition, he had [**7-22**] penile pain following foley placement which improved with removing foley and morphine 0.25mg IV.
In speaking with urology there was not evidence of obstruction or retention.
There was no growth on urine culture however he was treated with bactrim for 3 day course given that he had pyuria and bladder spasm.
Colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for Acute Gout.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1643**] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe Anemia likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding Coronary Artery disease Unstable Angina NSTEMI Chronic Systolic and [**Hospital6 7216**] heart failure, EF 40%, severe LVH Moderate-severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2 in [**2123-3-17**]) COPD   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having severe chest pain.
You were found to have a low blood count of 21 which was likely the cause of your worsened chest pain.
You did not have a colonoscopy or endoscopy because of the severity of your heart disease.
You will likely continue to require occasional blood transfusions to treat the blood loss becausing having a low blood count will cause you to have more chest pain.
Medications: 1)You were changed to Flomax to treat your prostatic hypertrophy.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any concerning symptoms including chest pain that is wore or different than your usual angina, light headedness, fainting, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, evidence of blood loss or any other worrisome symptoms.
