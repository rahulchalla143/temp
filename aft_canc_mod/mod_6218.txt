Admission Date:  [**2141-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-11-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis, hypoxic respiratory failure, s/p inferior MI and Vfib arrest, tx for palliative XRT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy chest tube placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 69 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and recently diagnosed RLL NSCLC who initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**12-19**] with a few episodes of teaspoon sized hemoptysis that resolved quickly.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital **] hospital from [**2140-12-24**] to [**2140-12-26**] with recurrent hemoptysis and profound hypokalemia and was treated briefly with potassium replacement and supportive care.
He represented again from home on [**2140-12-27**] with recurrent hemoptysis at home.
He was observed overnight in the CCU and had no further episodes of hemoptysis on hospital day one and was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
The patient was taken to the [**Location (un) 538**] campus the morning of [**2140-12-28**] for mapping for radiation therapy.
He had a planning CT scan at that time which showed a mass vs. a clot in the right bronchus intermedius.
The initial episode of hemoptysis lasted for approximately 20 minutes and he reports couging up bright blood and blood clots.
The medical team and MICU team was called to assess the patient when he experienced a second episode of hemoptysis on arrival to the floor- approximately [**12-14**] cup total of hemoptysis (bright blood mixed with clots).
He had no documented hypotension during the acute episode of hemoptysis and was transferred to the MICU for closer observation.
In the early morning of [**2140-12-30**] he suffered an acute STEMI with 12 lead EKG revealing ST elevations in II, III and aVF.
This was associated with a polymorphic VT arrest which decompensated to Vfib.
He was shocked x 1 and went into sinus tachycardia for a few beats and became asystolic.
He was also started on an amiodarone drip for his arrythmia.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended no further intervention.
He did not have any further arrhythmias.
On the day PTA to [**Hospital1 18**], he was started on ceftriaxone out of concern for pulmonary infection on [**2140-12-31**] with leukocytosis but no fevers and no clear change in sputum production.
On the morning of [**2141-1-1**] the patient was noted to have increasing oxygen requirment.
He had hemoptysis and was intubated for airway protection.
Bronch was performed, and large clot was seen obstructing R main stem bronchus.
Blood pressures post intubation were in the 70s systolic which improved to mid 80s with fluid boluses.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional pulmonology evaluation and radiation therapy.

Right lower lobe density is visualized which probably represents a combination of mass and some post-obstructive atelectasis.
There is a right effusion as well.
No pneumothorax and the remainder of the lungs is clear.
MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is a 3-mm enhancing lesion within the right frontal lobe cortex versus in a leptomeningeal location within a sulcus without surrounding edema.
No other areas of pathologic enhancement are identified within the brain.
There are a few foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular and subcortical white matter in the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, most suggestive of small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or territorial infarct.
A retention cyst is seen in the left maxillary sinus measuring 2 cm.
Scattered fluid versus mucosal thickening is noted within ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Three-mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe cortex versus in the adjacent leptomeninges.
This is highly suspicious for a metastatic focus.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT chest: FINDINGS: There is a heterogeneous enhancing mass with significant necrotic component in the right infrahilar region measuring 4.3 x 4.8 cm representing the primary lung cancer.
Significant necrotic pathological lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinal compartments, the largest is located in the subcarinal location and measures approximately 1 cm x 6.5 cm x 2.8 cm.
This has resulted in a collapse of the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe.
It should be noted that the collapse of the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe is incomplete due to either fenestration in the fissures or due to the collateral air drift from the right upper lobe.
The heart is not enlarged and there is no pericardial effusion.
There are bilateral bibasilar small pleural effusion.
On top of the left pleural effusion, there is an air-fluid level consistent with a hemopneumothorax as the attenuation coefficient of the fluid in the left pleural space approaches that of 60 units with a layering effect.
Within the right upper lobe, there are at least three patchy areas of ground-glass opacities which could represent aspiration and/or hemorrhage.
The osseous structures do not show any lesions suspicious for metastatic lesions.
There is significant subcutaneous air collection in the chest wall anteriorly and along the lateral sides.
There is significant gas collection which is extraperitoneal but within the fascia of the anterior abdominal muscles.
There are some air pockets in the mediastinal compartments which extend into the retroperitoneal space, most likley as a continuation of pneumomediastinum.
The visualized portion of the abdominal structures demonstrate bilateral mixed density adrenal masses consistent with metastases; the largest is a left adrenal metastasis measuring 2.6 x 4.1 cm and the smaller right adrenal lesion measures approximately 1.8 x 2.4 cm.
In addition there are multiple necrotic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy along the aortic margin measuring respectively 4.1 x 1.9 cm and 2.6 x 1.4 cm.
The gallbladder is grossly distended secondary to starvation.
There is also a small right retrocrural pathological lymph node which measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in maximum dimension.
The visualized portion of the liver do not demonstrate any metastatic lesions.
A large necrotic primary lung cancer in the right lower lobe with multiple pathological mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest is in the subcarinal location which has invaded/obliterated the bronchus intermedius and resulted in an incomplete collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe secondary to incomplete fissure or collateral edges.
Multiple ground-glass opacities seen in the right upper lobe secondary to aspiration and/or hemorrhage and unlikely metastatic because of their attenuation.
Necrotic metastatic adrenal masses and pathological metastatic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Small right pleural effusion.
Small pneumomediastinum with extension into the retroperitoneal area.
Extensive yet decreasing subcutaneous air collection in the chest wall and in the abdominal wall.

On the morning of [**1-2**] pt had recurrence of hemoptysis.
Anesthesia performed bronchoscopy and large clot visualized and aspirated from right bronchus.
Pt was taken emergently to the OR for Rigid bronchoscopy.
He was subsequently transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for continued management of hemoptysis and airway compromise.
Left pneumothorax: subsequent to rigid bronchoscopy.
Hemoptysis/NSCLC  - Pt had significant hemoptysis at OSH and here.
He has known endobronchial lesion with bil adrenal mets.
He subsequently received four XRT to the right chest during his stay, without recurrence of hemoptysis.
# STEMI s/p VT arrest: AT the OSH, pt had clear ST elevations in inferior chest leads with reciprocal ST depressions in anterior leads.
At the VA, Cardiology consulted during acute event who felt no indication for catheterization given metastatic disease and inability to anticoagulate given hemoptysis.
He was transfered on Amiodarone gtt and in sinus bradycardia on admission.
EP recommended discontinuing amiodarone as it does not have morbidity/mortality benefits when used for VT in setting of ischemia.
Hypotension- Most likely due to inferior infarct.
Hyperlipidemia - continued home pravastatin .
hypokalemia -- required scheduled daily repletion, may be related to adrenal mets, discharged with VNA instructions to draw chemisty to follow potassium levels.
brain metastases -- noted on MRI brain during hospitalization, no symptoms.
