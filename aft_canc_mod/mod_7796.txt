Admission Date:  [**2150-9-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-9-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**] Chief Complaint: Jaundice, Dilated CBD   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP - [**9-10**] PICC placement by IR -- [**9-11**]  History of Present Illness: 89 y/o F with DM, HTN and gout who initially presented to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital with painless jaundice that she says developed over the past day.
An ultrasound of her abdomen showed a heterogenous liver with nodular edge suspicious for cirrhosis, patent portal vein, thickened gall bladder wall, CBD dilated to 20mm and medium amount of ascites.
A repeat RUQ U/S again showed a likely cirrhotic liver with CBD dilatation to 1.5cm and moderate ascites.
She was seen by surgery and discussed with hepatology and ERCP, the decision was made to attempt to reverse her coagulopathy and get an ERCP.
She was also given another 10mg of IV vitamin K.  She also was found to be a difficult stick and developed a large hematoma on her right hand post an attempt at IV placement.
She currently is complaining of right hand pain at the site of her hematoma, and will also admit to about one week of easy bruising  and ankle edema prior to admission.
She denies any n/v/d, constipation, abdominal pain or fever/chills.
- Tobacco: never - Alcohol: 1oz vodka with soda nightly - Illicits: Denies   Family History: No FH autoimmune disease, liver disease, or GI disease, including IBD/UC.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Microbiology: [**2150-9-9**]    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-9-11**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
Large amount of gallbladder sludge identified without evidence of stones.
The common bile duct demonstrates increasing dilatation towards the level of the pancreatic head, suggestive of obstruction.
No common bile duct stone or pancreatic head mass definitely identified.
Coarse echogenic liver texture suggestive of cirrhosis.
Low amplitude portal venous flow, could suggest impending reversal of flow.
Massive soft tissue swelling at dorsum of hand, tracking proximally.
No discrete fracture.
Possible CPPD involving the ulnocarpal joint.
TTE ([**9-11**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
ERCP ([**9-10**]): - Moderate diffuse biliary dilation .
Given possible extravasation of contrast and presentation with cholangitis, detailed cholangiogram was not obtained.
- Likely distal pancreatic duct stricture - Sphincterotomy was performed - Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush.
- Successful placement of a 7cm by 10 FR biliary stent - Successful placement of a 5cm by 5FR pancreatic stent - Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - Follow for response and complications.
If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP fellow on call - Consider CT abd to further evaluate pancreas once renal function improves.
Renal ultrasound ([**9-12**]): pending IMPRESSION: Normal kidneys bilaterally, without obstruction  COMMON BILE DUCT BRUSHINGS Procedure Date of [**2150-9-10**] Distal common bile duct brushing: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 y/o F with a h/o HTN and DM who initially presented to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital complaining of one day of jaundice, found to have an obstructive pattern of jaundice on LFT's and imaging, likely a more chronic process given the degree of CBD dilatation seen on abdominal ultrasound.
Brushing was performed for cytologic study, which revealed cancer cells.
#) Acute Kidney Injury: On presentation the patient was found to have a Cr of 3.3.
Hydration did not improve her renal function, and she continued to have low urine output and her creatinine continued to rise.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Eagle [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Center - [**Location 23723**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pancreatic cancer Renal failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with inoperable cancer of the bile ducts/pancreas.
You chose to not have continued aggressive care, and your treating team at the [**Hospital1 **] as well as your family agreed that this is the best course of action given the poor prognosis associated with the kidney failure and the cancer.
