He noted progressive shortness of breath, right sided chest pain, and cough after discharge on [**2106-10-6**].
He was originially admitted last earlier in the month with weight gain and edema after RFA in late [**Month (only) 216**].
A pleural effusion was noted during his last admission, but as it was improving radiologically upon discharge, it was not tapped.
He denied hemoptysis, worsening abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: -Cirrhosis secondary to PBC and alcoholism.

Studies: CXR [**2106-10-8**]: A large right pleural effusion has increased in size with adjacent atelectasis in the middle and lower lobes.
There is no substantial left pleural effusion.
Limited doppler interrogation demsontrates patent portal veins with possible slow flow within main portal vein.
Complex right pleural fluid consistent with provided history of hemothorax.
Moderate, partially loculated right pleural effusion with increased density compared to simple peritoneal fluid, likely reflecting recent hemorrhage, although no evidence od active bleeding is present.
Small amount of pleural air, most likely related to recent thoracentesis.
Atlectatic right middle lobe and right lower lobes adjacent to effusion.
Multifocal patchy lung parenchymal opacities, new since [**2106-10-5**], and mostly in the left lung.
Differential diagnosis includes aspiration, infection, and hemorrhage.
Small mediastinal and 1 cm right and midline paracardiac lymph nodes.
Intra-abdominal findings consistent with liver cirrhosis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64 yo with cirrhosis and new diagnosis HCC s/p RFA with resulting right hemothorax and left pneumonia.
# Right sided pleural effusion: The pleural effusion was tapped with over 2L of bloody pleural fluid removed from his right chest.
He was in the MICU for one day following the VATS because of difficulty weening from the ventilator after the surgery.
Of note, he also had a left upper lobe infiltration which was treated with vanc and zosyn for nine days and finished before he went home.
He was set up with VNA to help him with any continued draining through the chest tube site.
# Weight gain: received albumin and was fluid restricted.
His edema improved through his stay and his weight was decreased upon discharge.
He likely has a new baseline due to decreased epo production from liver.
# Cirrhosis/HCC: s/p RFA, in transplant workup.
He had a slight LFT elevation upon admission, likely related to the recent procedure.
Recent slight LFT elevation from baseline, likely related to recent procedure, now normalized.
Secondary: PBC and alcoholic liver cirrhosis Hepatocellular carcinoma Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy   Discharge Condition: good, improved SOB and cough, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for a right hemothorax (blood in your chest cavity).
We made the following changes to your medication regimen: - Your lasix is now 20mg daily - Your aldactone is now 50mg daily - We added lactulose 30ml twice daily - We sent you out with a limited supply of oral dilaudid for pain .
You should return to the ED or call your primary care provider if you experience worsening shortness of breath, abdominal pain, coughing blood, increase in chest tube site drainage or blood in the drainage, fever greater than 101.4 degrees F, blood in your stool, increasing swelling in your legs, or any other symptoms that concern you.
