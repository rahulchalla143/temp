Skin (A): Fibrin thrombi in papillary and reticular dermal blood vessels with associated partial epidermal and adnexal necrosis (see microscopic description and comment).
Microscopic description.
There are fibrin thrombi in the papillary and reticular dermal vessels, extending into the superficial subcutaneous fat.
There is sparse acute inflammation, predominantly in the deeper dermis and subcutis.
Acute vasculitis is not appreciated in this sample in multiple tissue levels examined.
No fungal or bacterial organisms are seen on GMS, PAS and PAS-D, or tissue Gram stains, respectively.
The overlying epidermis shows partial necrosis and there is also focal necrosis of associated eccrine glands.
The histologic features are those of an occlusive thrombotic vasculopathy.
This may be seen in a variety of conditions including disseminated intravascular coagulation and warfarin necrosis, and clinical correlation is necessary to differentiate between these conditions.
The negative bacterial and fungal stains argue against an acute septic vasculitis or angioinvasive fungus.
Skin; direct immunofluorescence: No immunopathologic abnormality.
No specific immunofluorescence is seen for IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and fibrin.
A concomitant left lung base consolidation cannot be ruled out.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Asymmetric fat stranding along the soft tissues of the lateral left hip and thigh suggesting edema or inflammation.
Deep fascial infection is not excluded by this study.
The extent of deep compartment involvement of infection or inflammation is not well characterized and MR could be of potential value in further assessment if needed clinically.
No gas or drainable collection is visualized.
Wall thickening and mucosal enhancement seen along the sigmoid [**Month/Day (4) 499**] suspicious for colitis.
Similar soft tissue defect at site of removed port.
3.5-cm area of ground-glass lesion in the right upper lobe may be resolving since it first appeared on [**2112-8-22**].
Given the decrease in density, differential diagnosis includes atypical infection, hemorrhage or infarction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Increased small pericardial effusion.
CXR ([**8-30**]): IMPRESSION: Worsening left pleural effusion and complete left lower lobe atelectasis.
New right focal opacities consistent with pneumonia.
Improved are areas of atelectasis at the bases of the right lower lobe.
The appearance of the left hemithorax, including a small left pleural effusion, is unchanged.
No mediastinal lesions.
No substantial pericardial effusion.
In this region, there is fluid with internal echoes tracking tracking along the subcutaneous soft tissue planes, extending approximately 2.6 cm in length, without a discrete drainable fluid collection or hematoma identified.
There is generalized subcutaneous edema and skin thickening.
IMPRESSION: Subcutaneous edema and fluid tracking along the soft tissue planes, but no discrete abscess identified.
U/S LUE ([**9-11**]):  PRELIM 10 x 20 x 2 mm subcutaneous fluid collection adjacent to but not involving the nearby tendon sheath.

CXR ([**9-13**]): Increased left perihilar and stable right perihilar consolidations versus edema.
CT Chest w/o contrast ([**9-13**]): As compared to the previous examination, there are newly appeared right lower lobe opacities and a slightly more extensive left lower lobe opacity.
Both opacities have air bronchograms.
The pre-existing bilateral upper lobe opacities are stable.
The changes could correspond to atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
No mediastinal lymph node enlargement.
CT neck without contrast ([**9-13**]): There is no evidence of an exophytic mucosal mass.

There is opacification of the right and left mastoid tip air cells.
There are no lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
There is bilateral pulmonary opacities, described in the concurrent chest CT report.
IMPRESSION: New enlarged left level 2 lymph node.
No evidence of an exophytic mucosal mass.
Moderate to severe mucosal thickening in the right sphenoid sinus.
Milder mucosal changes in maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.

Moderately dilated aortic root.
No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Very small percicardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-8-29**], the overall left ventricular systolic function appears to have minimally improved, although the previously reported ejection fraction may have been an underestimate.
The absence of valvular vegetations/abscesses on transthoracic echocardiogram does not preclude its presence.
If clinical suspicion for endocarditis is high, consider transesophageal echocardiogram.
As compared to the prior examination, a perihilar opacities appear improved consistent with a component of edema.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Limited mobile examination without cholelithiasis.
Coarsened echotexture of the liver without fatty deposition.
Underlying hepatocellular disease cannot be excluded on this exam.
Bibasilar atelectases, left side more than right side are unchanged since [**2112-9-15**].
Wide cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely from low lung volumes.
There are lung opacities concerning for pneumonia.
No renal or ureteral calculi or hydronephrosis.
No acute vertebral compression deformity.
New ill-defined fat stranding in the retroperitoneum, just inferior to the aortic bifurcation with a probable 5 mm associated lymph node.
Superior vena cava venogram via the left brachiocephalic vein: [**2112-9-23**].
[**10-3**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Since [**2112-9-13**], bilateral multifocal pneumonia and ground glass opacification as well as bilateral lower lobes opacities representing either atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia have decreased.
[**10-3**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process .
No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
Specifically, there is no evidence of RP bleed.
Interval increase in patchy ground-glass opacities throughout the upper lung zones since the [**2112-10-3**] CT examination concerning for worsening multifocal pneumonia.
[**10-9**] CT Chest: Multifocal ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation in the upper lobes are unchanged.
Mild interval progression of the dense consolidation in the right lower lobe, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis, infection, and or aspiration.

The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
Left ventricular dysnchrony is present.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Very small pericardial effusion.
Bilateral lower lung atelectasis, left side more than right side, are unchanged.
There are no new lung opacities of concern  [**10-16**] Left foot biopsy Pan-dermal hemorrhage with focal organizing thrombus formation  [**10-19**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**10-16**], the tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 5 cm above the carina.
Again, there are low lung volumes with stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
Increasing pulmonary vascular congestion with progression of opacification in the retrocardiac region.
This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe, though the air bronchogram pattern raises the possibility of superimposed pneumonia in this region.
There is also a more focal area of opacification in the right upper and left mid zone, worrisome for possible supervening infection  [**10-20**] EKG Atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular rate of 160 beats per minute.
Moderate baseline artifact.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-10-19**] no diagnostic interval change.
[**10-21**] Rt Wrist Biopsy Abundant intravascular and interstitial fungal hyphae with thrombosis and secondary ischemic subepidermal bulla (see note).
Note: The findings in the clinical context are consistent with disseminated fungal infection.
ADDENDUM: The fungal hyphae do not stain well with PAS and GMS, more characteristic of Zygomycetes than Aspergillus species.
The presence of fungi within blood vessels and interstitially within the dermis and panniculus is concerning for, but not necessarily diagnostic of systemic infection, as this distribution may also be found in localized infection.
[**10-22**] CT Sinus Interval increase in degree of sinus disease, with mucosal thickening and secretions present in the ethmoid air cells and nasal cavity, along with mucosal thickening increased in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
Moderate sphenoid sinus thickening as before.
Much of this increased secretion could be related to intubation.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax  [**10-23**] Left groin biopsy Skin and subcutaneous tissue, left thigh, biopsy: Necrotic skin and panniculus with abundant Gram positive bacterial cocci and thrombosed blood vessels (see note).
Marked muscular edema involving all visualized muscles as well as extensive subcutaneous edema without focal fluid collection.
Given the history of positive biopsy, these findings are consistent with extensive cellulitis and myositis.
Serpiginous bone marrow signal abnormalities involving the base of the first metacarpal, distal radius and portions of the distal ulna, concerning for bone infarctions given the history of infectious vascular invasion  [**10-28**] CXR There are low lung volumes.
Moderate pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left side and unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of CLL status post allogeneic transplant in early [**2111**] complicated by chronic extensive moderate graft-versus-host disease involving the GI tract and capillary leak syndrome, and recent PE who presents in septic shock.
He was noted on admission to have numerous areas of skin breakdown with erythema on the left thigh concerning for infection.
On the morning of HD1, this area of erythema became bullous and the blistering extended up to his mid-abdomen/torso and down to his left knee and became the most concerning and obvious source of infection.
He was given hydrocortisione 100mg IV q8 for adrenal insufficiency given his history of chronic prednisone use.
On the floors, patient hemodynamically stable and weaned off hydrocortisone and restarted home dose prednisone 12.5mg daily  Hospital course was prolonged by repeated episodes of hypoxia requiring ICU transfers.
He was treated with linezolid, but due to extremely poor vascular access, HD and left PICC lines were not removed, but were treated with daptomycin locks.
Unfortunately, during this time, a bullous right wrist lesion was noted to be expanding, and biopsy and MRI were consistent with invasive mucormycosis.
He was deemed a poor surgical candidate for debridement or amputation due to extensive comorbidities and attempts to treat medically with ambisome were continued.
The size and extent of the right wrist Mucor infection expanded, and the right hand demonstrated progressive cysnosis, pallor by [**10-27**].
Additionally, further skin biopsies showed VRE growing within left groin lesion.
By [**10-27**] patient was pressor dependent, persistent sepsis, persistent bone marrow failure, with progressive renal impairment, evolving progressive lactic acidosis, and progressive systemic acidemia.
Following multiple discussions with health care proxy and extensive number of family members, all clearly indicated that patient would not want to be maintained on life support in the context of severe medical illness and continued decline in condition.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  The patient had large A-a gradient on presentation, and was therefore intubated and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam.
This was attributed to PNA seen on chest CT as well as metabolic acidosis secondary to renal failure.
Following callout to the floor, however, he developed an episode of large volume epistaxis and hemoptysis, of unclear etiology, and developed respiratory distress, likely secondary to aspiration.
He was again noted to have significant oropharyngeal bleeding, and due to repeated aspiration and hypoxia was intubated on [**10-19**].
CXR's showed persitently low long volumes with bilateral infilatrates.
Additionally, as he developed anuric renal failure and hypotension, fluid balance was difficult to achieve and he became grossly fluid overloaded.
By [**10-30**], the decision to cease supplemental O2 with ventilation was made along with his family and HCP due to insurmountable disease and medical futility.
CMV Viremia: Patient had a history of known CMV and while in the hospital he was continued on gancyclovir.
MSSA scalded skin reaction:  The patient first complained of pain in L upper thigh and inguinal area on [**8-15**] via telephone to oncology nurse.
On admission, he was noted to have purpura, bullae, erythema and warmness on the left anterior thigh that progressed to the abdomen.
CT torso to knees did not show evidence of necrotizing fascitis.
Two 4mm punch biopsies showed occlusive thrombotic vasculopathy, consistent with a scalded skin reaction, and his infection was initially treated with Vancomycin, but switched to daptomycin because of vamcomycin-associated [**Last Name (un) **].
His pain was managed with long and short acting opioid agents, as well as lidocaine gtt and PCA.
Mucormycosis: On [**9-9**] the patient was discovered to have a small erythematous lesion on his right medial forearm.
This had a small black scab/eschar in the middle and was surrounded by peeling skin.
There was concern for cellulitis, investigated with ultrasound on [**9-9**] and again on the 28th.
Biopsy showed invasive mucormycosis.
Patient was not a surgical candidate for debridement and hand became cyanotic and cool.
MRI was suggestive of marrow infarction along with significant invasive diesease.
He was treated with ambisome and CT of sinus showed no evidence of maxillofacial disease, and BAL showed no sign of pulmonary disease.
Biopsy of left groin lesion showed VRE but no evidence of mucor.
Unfortunately, wound continued to expand aggressively prior to the cessastion of pressors.
PNA: Shortly after the patient's admission, he was noted to have signs of PNA on CXR and CT.
He was already on empiric antibiotic coverage, so pneumonia was monitored on subsequent AM CXRs.
On HD13 as his respiratory status deteriorated, he was found to have increased pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and PNA.
CXR [**8-30**] showed RUL infiltrate and LLL collapse.
He was treated with linezolid and meropenem for presumed HCAP, later switched to vancomycin and meropenem as he became neutropenic.
Subsequent BAL on [**10-20**] and [**10-26**] showed no evidence of infection despite persistent consolidations and hypoxemia.
Bleeding: The patient developed large volume hemoptysis and epistaxis on [**2112-9-13**].
Neisseria was grown, but in small volume, and thought to be insignificant.
Nutritional: Due to recurrent mucosal bleeding and clots formation in his OP, patient developed significant dysphagia and odynophagis during his final ICU transfer.
Of note, due to extremely poor venous access, a dedicated line was not able to be used for TPN.
Acute Renal Failure: During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he developed a metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure.
Etiology of renal failure thought to be [**2-17**] Vancomycin (supratherapeutic to trough 35) as well as hypoperfusion from insensible volume loss.
Additionally, some element of foscarnet toxicity was thought to play a role as well.
He was started on CRRT on HD15, which was used both to normalize his acid-base status and to reduce the significant anasarca developed secondary to his skin infection and fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
DVT's: Patient was found to have extensive clots of his central veins involving the IVC, the subclavian veins, and an internal jugular vein on this stay.
Hypertension:  Once the patient's sepsis resolved on HD3, the patient began to experience hypertension to the SBP 170s, particularly associated with pain.
Initial hemolysis labs were negative and there was no evidence of DIC.
His Hct improved initially, but declined as hospital stay continued, likely due to severe disease and recurrent bleeding.
Tachycardia: Patient had sinus tach throughout ICU stay, thought to initially be secondary to sepsis and inflammatory response and later due to a component of pain from skin infection that the team was actively trying to control.
He was given fluid boluses as needed for fluid repletion and monitored on telemetry.
Hyponatremia: As patient became increasingly hypervolumic due to anuric renal failure, patient developed hypervolemic hyponatremia.
Fluid balance was attempted to be controlled by HD/UF and CRRT with poor results.
