Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M w/ esophageal CA w/ hip Fx s/p fall p/w hip fracture, CHF exacerbation in setting of A.fib with RVR, GPC bacteremia in setting of 9yo port.
Hip Fx - Patient was admitted with left hip fracture after a mechanical fall when flushing toilet with his cane (has poor baselien gait).
The OR was delayed given AFib with RVR and acute heart failure.
He went to the OR for ORIF without complications in the OR and Post-op complications mentioned below.
Pain controlled with morphine SR 15mg [**Hospital1 **] and morphine 15mg IR Q4hrs.
AFIb - Pt with new AFib in the setting of bacteremia and hip fracture.
CHF - Patient went into CHF in the setting of AFib and hip fracture.
Pt had coag negative staph bacteremia in the setting of a 9-year old port.
Now at baseline mental status.
Per wife he gets confused on times.
Acute renal failure: in the post op setting patietn had poor PO nad was very dry.
Re-check was 9 (from Port) and 8 from peripheral stick.
This was in the setting of acute renal failure as described above.
DIC work up was negative without any abnromal RBCs, high hapto and high fibrinogen.
# H/o CVA, PVD: On aspirin and plavix at baseline.
# h/o CAD/HTN.
# Esophageal Ca: plan to start XRT post d/c.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Hip fracture Bacteremia Atrial fibrillation Heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear mr [**Known lastname 5890**], you were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after experiencing a fall which left you with a left hip fracture.
Your medical course was complicated by a bacteremia (bacteria in your blood) from a port that was 9 years old.
In addition, you were noted to have an irregular heart beat, atrial fibrillation.
This irregular heart beat caused an increased heart rate that did not allow for your heart to pump efficiently; as such, we controlled your heart rate with a new medication as listed below.
To treat your infection: * IV Vancomycin 1gm every 12hrs for total of four weeks (start date [**11-30**]) To prevent DVT * Start enoxaparin (lovenox) to prevent clots 40mg IV daily for total of 4weeks: start date: For pain control: - Start Morphine 15mg SR. Take one every 12hrs - Start Morphine 15mg IR, take one tablet every 4hrs as needed for pain.
