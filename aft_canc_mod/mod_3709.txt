This was worked up through a chest CT scan which in fact showed evidence of a large cystic mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen upon review of the abdominal slices.
She was sent to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for endoscopic ultrasound evaluation and cyst analysis was performed.
He saw mural nodules and solid components to this very large cyst but the aspirate itself was negative for malignancy.
What we found was a large space-filling mass with attenuation of the stomach in front of it.
This cyst had solid components with septae within it and was very concerning for a mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma.

This was a left lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of atelectasis on that side, probably from this tumor mass.
