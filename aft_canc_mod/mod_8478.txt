Given the clinical history of bronchial artery embolization and hemoptysis, this most likely represents pulmonary hemorrhage.
Successful CT-guided core biopsy of large presumed right adrenal metastasis.
CT HEAD:There are multiple large supra- and infratentorial masses with a hyperdense rim and associated surrounding edema.
There is mucosal thickening in the bilateral ethmoid, right greater than left, and sphenoid sinuses.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: Multiple supra- and infratentorial masses with a hyperdense rim, which could represent enhancement, but underlying intralesional hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease or infection.
DIAGNOSIS: A.  Liver, needle core biopsy:Hepatic parenchyma and necrotic material.
No viable cells are present for evaluation in the necrotic area.
No features of small cell carcinoma are seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 12166**] was admitted to the MICU with altered mental status following bronchoscopy by thoracics.
While in the MICU he was intubated for airway protection and he continued to have hemoptysis into the tube.
Given acute changes in his mental status we did an extensive workup for possible offending agents and infectious causes, as well as obtained a CT of his head, which showed large number of masses most consistent with metastatic disease.
A CT of his chest was performed and showed possible primary lung pathology as well as extensive metastatic disease in hte liver as well as adrenal glands.
Pathology of these came back as poorly differentiated carcinoma, the tumor cells are large with abundant cytoplasm.No features of small cell carcinoma were seen.Tumor cells stained strongly for CK7 and do not stain for CK20.
The patient had recurrent hemoptysis on the morning of [**2147-10-14**].
