Physical Exam: Admission Exam to ICU: Vitals: 98.7 126 156/58 19 97 RA General: Alert, oriented, appears uncomfortable but NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: mild rales at bases B/L, nonlabored breathing CV: regular rhythm, tachy, no M/R/G Abdomen: soft, no shake tenderness, mild guarding, diffuse tenderness to moderate palpation, no rebound tenderness, GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: CT report from OSH (oral contrast, no IV): no gallstones seen, but GB distended and likely "sludge" no ductal dilitation, "severe" pancreatitis, w/ extensive extrahepatic inflammation in abdominal pelvic mesentary, moderate pancreatic ascites, thickening of wall of descending colon.
No evidence for gallstones or sludge in the gallbladder.
The common bile duct is mildly dilated to 8 mm, a region for this such as choledocholithiasis is not identified on this scan; however, cannot be excluded as the distal portions of the common bile ducts are not visualized.
Moderate amount of ascites and small right pleural effusion.
There continue to be bilateral pleural effusions, but these are somewhat smaller compared to prior.
There is volume loss at both bases.
Worsening acute pancreatitis, with areas of necrosis, as well as surrounding edema and fluid.
There is no well formed fluid collection on this study.
Reactive changes of the duodenum and left colon.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Moderate amount of abdominal ascites.

ACUTE ISSUES: .
# Acute Pancreatitis and C. Diff colitis: -Pt tranferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU from OSH.
Initially presented with leukocytosis with bandemia, severe pain, and positive blood culture for gram negative rods, on IV zosyn and aggressively hydrated.
The etiology of pancreatitis remained unclear.
OSH CT scan showing distended GB and RUQ showed mild CBD dilatation at 8mm but no stone/sludge.
MRCP showed extensive pancreatitis, ascites, and fluid around the liver but no biliary dilitation.
Pt is social drinker, no FMH of pancreatitis or hyperCA, hypertriglyceremia.
No new meds, structural or anatomic abnormalities.
Given recent use of thiazides, this was entertained as a possible cause of pancreatitis.
Had an acute rise in WBC while on Zosyn (attribued to continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] flare).
Switched to cefipime and covered empirically for C. Diff for a few days on Po Vanc and IV Flagyl which were later discontinued after C. Diff PCR returned negative.
Repeat CT Abdomen showed mild area of necrosis.
GI/Pancreatitis team consulted (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] - felt there was no need for invasive intervention.
Due to continued abdominal pain, distented abdomen, and woresening anemia, pt underwent a repeat CT scan on [**10-7**] that showed evolving pancreatic pseudocyst, new SMV thrombosis with edema of the ascending colon, no evidence of hemorrhagic pancreatitis or necrosis.
[**10-8**] pt's symptoms improved.Pt was started on clears [**10-10**] and her diet was successfully advanced to a BRAT diet on [**10-11**].
She continued to have abd pain and was evaluated by pancreas team in the ICU.
She triggered on [**10-15**] with Temp of 102, worsening abdominal discomfort, increased respiratory distress.
Her CT was repeated and showed no change in the pancreas, but increse in pleural effusion on the right side.
Surgery was consulted and there were no acute surgical intervention done.
There was concern for C.diff given that pt had diarrhea on the onset of antibiotics and she started on PO vanco in addition to IV Flagyl.
She then had worsen abd distention and decreased BS which were concerning for ileus.
She did have C.Diff toxin positive stool at that point.
Her symptoms improved and she was transferred back to the floor on [**10-17**].
Since transfer back to the floor, her abdominal pain has slowly improved (though she still has pain), and her nausea has improved.
They recommended no other changes in her management at this time, and on [**2104-10-29**] agreed with the plan for discharge to LTAC.
# E. coli bacteremia: -OSH BCx with E. Coli bacteremia.
Source of E. Coli unclear.
Potential sources were transient cholangitis from blocked CBD stone, or translocation from a thickened descending colon found on abdominal CT scan.
Blood cultures from [**10-12**] grew E. coli as well and at this time pt.
# C Diff colitis: Severe.
# Acute Kidney injury: Creatinine was 1.8 at the time of admission.
This was likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
# Metabolic Encephalopathy: Pt presented A0x3 and became confused and agitated on [**9-4**] with hallucinations of her cousin in the room, and although orientated largely to time, person and place, became agitated and pulled out her picc line and ng tube.
Pt was started on vancomycin (and zosyn) to cover for HCAP, but these were discontinued after one day given her rapid clinical improvement following diuresis with furosemide.
There was also significant bilateral pleural effusion from likely pancreatic effusion.
Pt was later weaned to room air and then developed respiratory distress on [**10-15**] and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
TTE showed low normal LVEF, 1+ MR, borderline elevated PASP.
Hypoxia was felt to be due to volume overload and she was diuresed with furosemide 20mg IV with good effect.
However, her vitals stabilised and she subsequently became hypertensive with SBP in the 200s.
Her hypertension was controlled initially with labetalol, and then with PO metoprolol.
# Question of SMV thrombosis.
This is considered to be a provoked event and 3-6 months of anticoagulation would be recommended.
This was stopped on the day of the transfer back to the ICU, as repeat abdominal imaging was obtained, and upon further review by Radiology and GI, it was determined that the patient most likely did NOT have an SMV thrombosis, and that the occlusion in the SMV was due to extrinsic compression, most likely due to significant underlying inflammation and edema from her pancreatitis.
# Spinal stenosis: At home, was controlled with ibuprofen 2 tabs [**Hospital1 **] - Lidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY:PRN pain.
Narcotics were limited due to her severe ileus.
She did not complain of severe back pain, but as she begins rehabilitation this may flare up again.
In the hospital she received: - Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN shortness of breath - Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN shortness of breath  - Fluticasone Propionate 110mcg 2 PUFF IH [**Hospital1 **] .
# Elevated Alk Phos: unclear cause and significance, perhaps medication-related.
# Hyponatremia: likely related to fluid shifts and limited nutrition.
#Weakness -Due to prolonged hospitalization and severe illness.
No focal findings.
2. fluticasone 50 mcg/Actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: Two (2) Spray Nasal DAILY (Daily) as needed for congestion.
3. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) PUFF Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath.
5. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) NEB Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath.
8. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
10. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: Seventeen (17) grams PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Acute pancreatitis - Ecoli bacteremia - Hypertension - Severe C. diff infection Minor spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You also were found to have bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) which was likely related to your pancreatitis.
You were treated with antibiotics for the bacteremia and also for possible pancreatic necrosis.
The cause of the pancreatitis remains unclear and may have been due to a passed stone.
You were then transferred back to the ICU with new infections, bacteria (E.Coli) in your blood stream and bacteria (C.Diff) in your colon.
You have completed a course of antibiotics for the E coli bloodstream infection.
You will need to complete a course of antibiotics for the C diff colon infection (continue oral vancomycin through [**2104-11-4**]).
