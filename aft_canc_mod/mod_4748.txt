[**2104-12-16**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild spontaneous [**Month/Day/Year 113**] contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous [**Month/Day/Year 113**] contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Injection of agitated saline into the left upper extremity appeared in the right atrium through the superior vena cava, ruling out a persistent left SVC.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely not as good given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular dysnchrony is present.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild hypokinesis of the basilar portion but severe mid and apical free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.3 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The valve ring appears somewhat more mobile than expected but there is no perivalvualr leak and no evidence of dehiscence.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid regurgitation is at least mild to moderate.
There is a large left pleural effusion.
The right ventricle displays improved systolic function with mild free wall hypokinesis.
The left ventricle is hyperdynamic with an ejection fraction near 75 to 80%.
There is a bioprosthesis in the mitral position.
There is trace valvular mitral regurgitation.
No perivalvular regurgitation is seen.
Lung volumes remain low without evidence of pneumothorax and with unchanged positioning to left-sided pacemaker and right Port-A-Cath.
Left pleural effusion has increased in the interval with expected probable adjacent compression atelectasis.
Mild right basilar atelectasis is improved with stable eventration of the hemidiaphragms.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with no other change to mediastinal and hilar contours.
Degenerative changes involving the right humeral head are again noted.
IMPRESSION: Marked interval increase in size to moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**]   Brief Hospital Course: 76F who underwent mitral valve replacement in [**2097**] who had developed progressive fatigue and dyspnea since [**2104-7-29**].
She also developed lower extremity edema.
She was found to have severe MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] as well as 3+MR and pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures in the 50s.
She underwent cardiac catheterization at outside hospital, which showed no coronary artery disease.
She was continued on milronone until post operative day 4 due to right ventricular dysfunction.
She did have acute tubular nephrosis with a peak creatinine of 2.4.
The patient was started on Natrecor and Lasix drips with increased diuresis.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
