Cause of LLL bronchial compression was uncertain but suspicion was that recurrent lung cancer could be the cause.
Code Blue was called and attempt was made to resuscitate patient, but this was deemed futile after a short time.
At that time, she had no pulse, no respirations, pupils were fixed and unresponsive to light, and there were no dolls eyes.
