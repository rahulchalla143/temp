Patient was hypoxic to the 80's prior to intubation and therefore aneasthesia and surgery preferred monitoring in ICU with likely extubation tomorrow AM.
As per anaesthesia and surgery, surgery was uneventful, no complications.
Status post surgical repair of uterine prolapse, TAH/BSO Obesity Heavy Smoker H/o DVT s/p IVC filter implantation   Social History: The patient lives with her daughter in [**Name (NI) 8391**].
She formally worked in a factory, however, denies any chemical or radiation or asbestos exposure to her knowledge.
Father died in his 70s from congestive heart failure.
Her brother with esophageal cancer and there is a prominent family history of type 2 diabetes.
There is no family history of breast, GYN, colonic, or renal cell cancer in the family.

Prior to the nephrectomy, she was mildly hypoxic, and it was felt that she would not be easy to extubate.
Her hypoxia was likley secondary to chronic insufficiecny in the context of atelectasis and volume overload.
She initially had pain at the surgical site which slowly resolved.
Her wound was C/D/I at discharge after staples were removed.
Her final pathology revealed conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma pT3a: tumor directly invades adrenal gland or perirenal and/or renal sinus fat but not beyond Gerota's fascia; spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding her follow-up and the results of the lung biopsy, which after review are consistent with metastatic disease obviating the need for a lung biopsy.
## ileus/SBO:  patient stopped passing flatus and had worsening abdominal distention.
She then had bilious emesis x 2 for a total of 600 cc.
Abdominal imaging showed evidence of small bowel dilation consistent with ileus vs. obstruction.
As patient's operation was not within the peritoneal cavity but retroperitoneal, it was believed to be more likely ileus in the setting of increased pain med requirements.
Indeed her prolonged hospital course was secondary to a prostracted ileaus that was initially managed with NGT/decompression however by POD [**11-28**] the NG was remvoed, her diet was advanced and she tolerated it well.
Interval KUBs would show dilated small loops with AFLs, no free air that would resolve thorughout her course.
## Hyperglycemia: Likely in setting of stress from surgery and mild underlying insulin resistance.
## h/o DVT: Should likely be on life-long anticoagulation given she had a malignancy-associated DVT.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Suppository Sig: [**12-18**] Suppositorys Rectal Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
