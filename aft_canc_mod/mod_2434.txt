CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 50-year-old female who was transferred today from [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **], presenting there on the [**7-21**] with shortness of breath.
The patient's recent history includes one month of cough, dysphagia, and some shortness of breath.
Was treated initially with Protonix and, five days prior to presentation there, complained of shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds on the right.
She underwent thoracentesis in the Emergency Room there, with 1300 cc of an exudative fluid aspirated.
CT scan done at that time revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, narrowing of the right lower lobe bronchi, and bilateral pulmonary nodules.
There were also liver nodules noted, with numerous episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
An echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion with some tamponade physiology.
At this time, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**], where her pleural effusions were tapped, and she had a drain placed in her pericardium.
The neck has a palpable lymphadenopathy, and there is a left anterior cervical lymphadenopathy with an SCL lymphadenopathy.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, with occasional rhonchi.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No edema.
Given the rapidity of the patient's signs and symptoms and early evidence of metastatic cancer, we admitted the patient to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.
We consulted Surgery for biopsy, which revealed poorly-differentiated cells, consistent with some adenocarcinomatous process.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted at this time and, after significant discussion with the family, it was felt that there was no treatment option available, and recommended no further treatment.
However, with regard to symptomatic relief, we note that the patient's shortness of breath had progressed during the hospitalization, and she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stenting of the bronchi for symptomatic relief.
Two days prior to her demise, she was made comfort measures, and a morphine drip was started, titrated for her comfort.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] noted in her final note that the patient was asystolic and there were no spontaneous respirations, no heart sounds.
