MRI showed large L cerebellar mass.
He has also felt lightheaded and has woken up in the mornings with a headache posteriorly.
This showed a large enhancing mass involving nearly the entire left cerebellar hemisphere.
The mother recalls some sort of intracranial hemorrhage and work up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], a neurologist in [**Hospital1 1474**].
Past Medical History: Past Medical History:  Leukemia age [**4-20**] s/p whole body XRT, chemotherapy, and BMT transplant from his identical twin brother.

Fluent speech with no paraphasic or phonemic errors.
Able to name low and high frequency objects.
No left/right mismatch.
fatiguable endgaze nystagmus.
No pronator drift.
Occipital incision well healed, clean warm and dry.

CTA Brain [**2174-2-2**]: Large amorphous left cerebellar mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement and areas of possible calcification versus hemorrhage, and necrosis versus cystic change.
This mass exerts substantial mass effect and partially displaces the fourth ventricle and quadrigeminal cistern on the left.
Minimal descending ectopia of the left tonsil is also noted, resulting in mild narrowing of left posterior aspect of foramen magnum  Post op MRI [**2174-2-5**]: 1.
Extensive post-surgical changes related to the recent partial resection of the extensive infiltrating process in the left cerebellar hemisphere; however, allowing for this, there is persistent nodular and ring-like enhancement at the inferomedial aspect of the resection bed, highly suspicious for residual tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83461**] is a 43 yr old male who presented to the ER with a 4 week history of gait inbalance and speech slurring.
Work up included a head CT that revealed a left cerebellar mass.
He was admitted to the ICU for observation and MR imaging was performed: This demonstrated a heterogeneous mass lesion at the left cerebellar hemisphere with multiple areas of irregular enhancement and areas with high signal intensity on T2, possibly related with a combination of necrosis and cystic transformation.
There was significant mass effect and narrowing of the fourth ventricle, effacementof the posterior perimesencephalic cisterns and left side of the foramen magnum.
The differential diagnosis included primary cerebellar neoplasm versus metastatic lesion.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for headach.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
