Moderate cardiomegaly is worsened and there is now a new small pleural effusion.
Extensive pulmonary metastasis is only partially visible.
Interval increase in mediastinal caliber is probably due to venous engorgement, baseline widening due to extensive fat deposition and some lymph node enlargement.

Focal left upper lobe perfusion/ventilation defect corresponds to a known metastatic nodule in that region.
[**2120-12-31**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-27**], the overall cardiac size is within normal limits and there is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion.
Left pleural effusion and small right effusion persists.
Multiple nodular metastases are seen as well as extensive prominence of the mediastinum caliber that could reflect venous engorgement, lymphadenopathy, or both.
Heterogeneous and hypervascular left renal mass, without frank hydronephrosis.
Elevated resistive indices and decreased diastolic flow, compatible with known partial renal vein thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course: 61yo man with a recently diagnosed metastatic renal cell CA to brain s/p cyberknife, lung, and [**Month/Day/Year 500**] admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia found on pre-op labs prior to debulking nephrectomy.
Hospital Day #1, he was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and rapid afib.
Furosemide given for pulmonary edema and hypoxia, but then creatinine worsened, Nephrology consulted, and dialysis started [**2121-1-3**].
Drowsiness and confusion waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
# Left humerus pathological fracture: Fell [**2121-1-7**].
Changed MSContin 15mg [**Hospital1 **] with PRN morphine to oxycodone PRN to avoid high plasma concentrations due to kidney failure per Nephrology and Pharmacy.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Initially improved with IV fluids and resolution of hypotension.
Returned back to baseline creatinine 1.8, but on the floor started to rise again after furosemide given for pulmonary edema.
# Hyperkalemia: Initially resolved with insulin/D50 and sodium polystyrene sulfonate.
# Mucositis: Possibly due to sunitinib, but Mr. [**Known lastname 3142**] states this started prior to sunitinib.
- [**Month (only) 116**] need to hold sunitinib if mucositis worsens.
# Altered mental status: Likely metabolic encephalopathy/acute delirium due to hypoxia and medications (lorazepam/narcotics).
# Hypotension: Developed 1st night of admission, seemingly not related to afib.
# Pneumonia: Cefepime for possible sepsis changed to pip/tazo and vancomycin, and continued for LLL infiltrate.
Although no leukocytosis, he did have a fever to 100.6F in the ICU.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Able to only tolerate low doses of metoprolol due to hypotension.
# Hypoxia: Likely causes include acute pulmonary edema and pneumonia, both seen on imaging as well as RCC.
No right heart strain on echo.
V/Q scan very low probability for PE.
Avoided CTA with acute on chronic kidney failure.
Completed course of antibiotics for pneumonia.
# Metastatic renal cell CA: s/p CNS cyberknife.
Scheduled [**2121-1-7**] for debulking nephrectomy, but cancelled given events of this admission.
Continued levetiracetam 500mg PO BID seizure prophylaxis with extra half dose after dialysis.
# Microcytic anemia: Likely anemia of CKD and inflammation as based on iron studies, low retic index.
# Hypertension: Lisinopril held due to hypotension and ARF.
Metoprolol started for rapid afib.
# BPH: Stopped tamsulosin given low BP and anuria.
Hyperphosphatemia due to renal failure.
Hyperkalemia treated by 3x/wk dialysis.
# Pain (humerus, abdomen): MSContin 15mg [**Hospital1 **] + morphine PRN changed to oxycodone PRN only to avoid rising plasma concentrations in kidney failure per Nephrology and Pharmacy.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC.
# Lines: Dialysis central line.
Medications on Admission: tamsulosin ER 0.4 mg 24 hr Cap 1 Capsule(s) by mouth HS levetiracetam 500 mg PO BID for seizure prevention pantoprazole 40 mg PO q24HR hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5mg-500mg PO q6hrs morphine 15-30mg PO q3HR PRN pain lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY dexamethasone 4 mg PO once a day, Decrease to 2 mg a day on [**12-21**] x4d, then on [**12-25**] decrease to 1 mg a day x4d.
Acute on chronic kidney failure.
Hyperkalemia (high potassium).
Hypotension (low blood pressure).
Atrial fibrillation (fast irregular heart arrhythmia).
Pulmonary edema (fluid on the lungs).
Acute delirium (confusion).
Metastatic kidney cancer.
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Left humeral pathological fracture (broken left arm due to cancer in the [**Hospital1 500**]).
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for acute kidney failure and hyperkalemia (high potassium level).
This was found on pre-op blood work in preparation for a nephrectomy for metastatic kidney cancer.
However, your blood pressure became dangerously low and your heart developed an abnormal fast rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
For these reasons, you were transferred to the ICU and given a large volume of IV fluids as well as metoprolol, which controlled the heart arrhythmia and returned it to normal.
Chest x-ray showed fluid on the lungs (pulmonary edema).
Immediately after the dialysis line was placed, your blood pressure became dangerously low again, but this time it improved quickly with IV fluids.
This may have been due to very low oxygen levels and lorazepam, a medication given the night before for sleep/anxiety.
You started dialysis [**2121-1-3**] and were given a red blood cell transfusion the same day for severe anemia (low red blood cell count).
From all these medical problems, you have become very weak and will need physical therapy/rehab.
The fracture was partially caused by cancer in that [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] radiation therapy to the left arm was done.
Persistent high potassium levels and high phosphorous levels will be treated primarily by dialysis.
You were also started on viscous lidocaine to numb the mouth and artificial saliva (Gelclair) for mucositis.
The cause of mucositis is not clear, but chemotherapy (sunitinib) may be contributing.
Treatment for diabetes has been stopped because of controlled sugar levels by diet.
Metoprolol 25mg 2x a day for atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone 2x a day x2 weeks, then once daily for atrial fibrillation.
Levetiracetam (Keppra) 2x a day, dose varies on day of dialysis: 500mg 2x a day with an extra 250mg after each dialysis session.
Stop lisinopril due to kidney disease.
Stop glipizide due to kidney disease.
Aspirin started for atrial fibrillation.
You are unable to have a stronger blood thinner because of your risk for falling/bleeding.
