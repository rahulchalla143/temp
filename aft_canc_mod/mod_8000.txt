Admission Date:  [**2144-9-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-9-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-6-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11839**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress.
Thoracentesis  with pigtail drain placement [**2144-9-16**].
Removal of pigtail [**2144-9-22**] picc line placement [**2144-9-14**]   History of Present Illness: 77 year old man with h/o stage IB (pT2aN0Mx) Squamous NSCLC s/p right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] wedge resection ([**2144-2-8**]), presenting with lung/pleural and rib mets with extrinsic and intrinsic compression.
He presented [**2144-9-14**] for rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, initially planned as a day/ambulatory procedure.
Flexible bronchoscope showed patent distal airways.
Patency of distal airways confirmed.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.
He remained well-appearing and mentating post-operatively and ambulating with the RN around the [**Name (NI) 13042**].
Post-procedure CXR without pneumothorax.
Given his vital signs, the patient was planned for admission overnight with telemetry and continuous pulse oximetry observation.
He was placed on 10L non-rebreather initially for desaturations into the low 80s and then transitioned to 4L shovel mask, gradually to 4L nasal cannula with neb treatments and mucinex.
In discussions with IP, second CXR while in [**Name (NI) 13042**] suggestive of RML/RLL collapse after procedures with planned flex bronch by IP in the morning.
A pigtail was also placed  for continued drainage of R sided effusion.
Has had occasional cough with yellow sputum, no blood.
Stable weight, no edema, no orthopnea.
Past Medical History: obesity, hypertension, CAD s/p CABG, hyperlipidemia, anemia, polyclonal gammopathy, osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, renal insufficiency, BPH, allergic rhinitis, skin cancer, and ischemic optic neuropathy, L orbital pseudotumor s/p biopsy.
-- In [**2-/2142**] CTA revealed complete occlusion of the right ICA and patent ACOM, and moderate stenosis of the right vertebral artery.
-- In early [**2143**], he was reevaluated for persistent headaches and progressive visual loss.
Imaging revealed a retroorbital lesion.
On MRI and MRA imaging studies NSMC:  An ill-defined mass in the right posterior orbit encasing the optic nerve extending into the right cavernous sinus with thrombosis of the RCA inside the cavernous sinus.
-- On [**2143-5-24**], given the concern for lymphoma, a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to assess for other lesions.
This revealed a 1 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] pulmonary nodule with irregular margin concerning for primary lung cancer or metastatic disease.
Otherwise, on imaging was found no evidence of lymphoma, a 6-mm bladder diverticulum.
-- On [**2143-6-12**], PET CT scan revealed 24 x 22 mm right retroorbital soft tissue mass which is FDG avid (SUV maximum 5) with FDG avid retrobulbar fat.
In the right lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] FDG avid 14-mm solitary nodule (SUV maximum 7.1) otherwise no evidence of distant FDG avid disease.
-- On [**2143-7-30**], biopsy of the orbital apex lesion showed a mixed inflammatory picture, it was not diagnostic lymphoma.
-- On [**2143-11-5**], PET CT noted a 2.2 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] nodule with a SUV maximum 8.24 with no FDG avid mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
-- On [**2144-2-14**], he underwent a right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] wedge resection, which revealed squamous cell carcinoma (2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm) grade 2 moderately differentiated T2a N0 Mx tumor which was invading the visceral pleura and had lymphovascular invasion.
Level 7 and 9 lymph nodes were negative for malignancy.
A few days prior to his six-month followup visit, he noticed being increasingly short of breath.
-- On [**2144-8-18**], CT of the chest revealed new right-sided effusions and new 3-mm nodules in the left upper and lower lobes, suspicious.
-- On [**2144-8-20**], 2 liters of pleural fluid were drained from his right lung, which was negative for malignant cells.
A 3.4 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] FDG avid nodule (maximum SUV is 30), FDG avid lymph nodes in the right perihilar region measuring largest 2.5 x 1.4 x 5 cm maximum SUV 30 associated with marked narrowing of the bronchus intermedius, obstruction of the lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] bronchus with distal patency, and marked narrowing of the origin of the middle [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] bronchus.
There were 2 FDG avid pleural soft tissue masses on the right measuring 2.8 x 3.2 cm (maximum SUV 36) and another nodule measuring 3.9 x 4.2 cm (maximum SUV 19) along with pleural posterior to the right costophrenic angle highly suspicious for metastatic deposits.
In addition to right pleural effusion, there is bronchovascular thickening in the right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] suspicious for lymphangitic spread of disease.
There are postoperative changes consistent with right lung wedge resection.
Fine needle aspirate of the right upper lope endobronchial mass and right bronchus intermediate mass both revealed squamous cell carcinoma, non-small-cell carcinoma.
Family History: Positive for hypertension, renal failure, and possibly CAD in his mother.
[**Name (NI) **] family history of diabetes or malignancies.
Physical Exam: On transfer from MICU to oncology: T97.3, 130/56, HR 73, R20, 92% on 4L NC Alert, appropriate, breathing comfortably, no distress.
HEENT: small healing lac on lower lip on R.  PERRL and anicteric.
Neck: obese, supple, no JVD elevation appreciated, no adenopathy.
Heart: regular, slightly distant, no m/r/g.
L side clear.
1+ pitting LE edema.
New collapse of the entire right lung is explained by tumor impinging on the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] bronchus and occlusion of the bronchus intermedius stent by secretions, partially bloody.
Moderate right pleural effusion, stable volume since [**8-17**], despite large, interval thoracentesis, may contain minimal bleeding.
Right pleural metastasis, increased since [**2144-8-21**].
New moderate left basilar atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion.
There is still a large right pleural effusion demonstrating loculated components.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yo man with stage IV squamous cell CA of the lung and CAD admitted for dyspnea, respiratory distress, and a obstructive right lung collapse.
Bronchial stent was attempted [**2144-9-14**] by Interventional Pulmonary, but the stent became occluded and was not able to be reopened.
# Hypoxia: Due to obstructive right lung collapse, progressive NSCLC, and post-obstructive bacterial pneumonia.
Pt completed  antibiotics (ceftriaxone/azithromycin) for post-obstructive pneumonia and also received PRN nebs.
# NSCLC: Pt started XRT to relieve bronchial obstruction on [**2144-9-24**] and plan for 10 day treatemnt total dose 3000cGy.
# Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive after the treatment.
On th efloor he did have a few brief episodes of asymptomatic hypotension ( systolic to 80's).
48 hrs prior to discharge blood pressure remained stable.
# Non-occlusive thrombosis of left basilic vein: Pt developed LUE pain and swelling .
U/S of LUE revealed a non-occlusive thrombosis of left basilic vein, which was the site of teh picc line.
The pain and swelling resolevd spontaneously adn the picc line was removed.
# Anemia: Anemia panel c/w anemia of inflammation.Pt did receive 1 unit of PRBCS during hospital stay with appropriate response.
# Urinary retention: Pt had a foley cath placed prioir to transferto teh Oncology floor.
1 dose of   tamsulosin was given but not tolerated due to low blood pressures.
# Pain: Pain was well controlled with acetaminophen as needed.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC.
# Precautions: None.
# CODE: FULL.
