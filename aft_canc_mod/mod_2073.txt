She awoke this am with nausea and vomiting and noted that there were bright red blood clotts in her emesis.
After this, she felt dizzy and was noted to be pale and diaphoretic by family members.
She has never had bleeding or black stools in the past.
In the ED, NG lavage initially showed bright red blood but cleared after 500cc.
Patient had frank melena on rectal exam.
Past Medical History: IDDM, MDS (follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], S/p lense replacement, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhoids, htn, retinopathy, hearing loss (no CAD hx, EF 55%, recent normal MIBI).
No tobacco, no illicits, no ETOH, no NSAIDs or aspirin.
Family History: Daughter with [**Name (NI) 1932**], brother with throat cancer, sister with lung cancer, mother with "abdominal" cancer   Physical Exam: vitals 99.5/ hr 75/ bp 140/42/ 97% on RA GEN: appears stated age, well nourished, NAD flat in bed HEENT: anicteric sclerae, no pallor, clear OP NECK: supple, no JVD w/ upright positioning, no LAD HEART: s1/s2, no murmurs, no rubs LUNGS: clear B/L, no CVA tenderness ABD: soft, non distended, nt, hypoactive BS, no fluid wave, no masses appreciated EXT: warm.
trace edema B/L, pain w/ palpation B/L (pt reports this is chronic) No tremor/ no asterixis NEURO: CN II-XII intact, no focal deficits.
5/5 strength in all 4 extremities   Pertinent Results: EGD [**3-7**]: 1_ One long, linear ulcer in the antrum and one small ulcer in pylorus.
These ulcers account for patient's GI bleed.
2) Three cords of grade II nonbleeding varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus.
3) Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis .
EKG: nsr 76, L shift, TWi in V1,V2, no st changes .
No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
Cholelithiasis and gallbladder sludge with mild gallbladder wall edema and small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
The gallbladder was not distended and there is no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] or evidence of common bile duct dilatation.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Left kidney exophytic cyst stable compared to the prior examination.
GI bleed: Given the bloody emesis, it was thought to be most likely an upper GI source, possibly gastric or duodenal ulcer.
She initially refused to have a blood transfusion, but then relented and was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs.
She was found to have antral and pyloric ulcers, but esophageal varices as well.
Given these findings, she was continued on the PPI [**Hospital1 **], and underwent work-up for evidence of cirrhosis leading to portal hypertension.
An abdominal US showed patent flow in the portal system, and no evidence of ascites or abnormal liver architecture.
The patient will need further work-up as an outpatient to evaluate non-cirrhotic portal hypertension leading to esophageal varices.
Her hematocrit remained stable, with no further transfusion requirements.
She was monitored with FS QID, and placed on RISS for coverage.
She will follow-up with her PCP for diabetic control.
Thrombocytopenia: The patient had a known history of thrombocytopenia with platelets ranging from 125-159 since [**2191**].
Given this history, she was provided pneumoboots rather than sc heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
These were initially held secondary to her GI bleed, then the lisinopril was slowly restarted once her hematocrit was stable, as her blood pressure remained stable.
She was tolerating a regular diabetic diet at the time of discharge, and did not have any further evidence of active bleeding.
She will be followed up by her PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further work-up of the esophageal varices.
Outpatient Lab Work Hematocrit   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal Varices Antral and Pyloric ulcers Hypertension Insulin Dependent Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: We have started you on two new medications for the ulcers and varices seen on EGD.
