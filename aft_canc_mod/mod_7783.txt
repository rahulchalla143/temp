History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 56636**] is an 85-year-old right-handed woman, with history of B cell lymphoma, who complains of nightly headaches waking her from her sleep, difficulty walking and word-finding difficulty.
She has been followed by neuro-onc and was sent for an MRI which revealed a right occipital lesion.
She denies fevers, chills, nightsweats, nausea, vomiting, or loss of consciousness.
Past Medical History: B-cell lymphoma HTN CAD PVD: s/p 2 stents hypercholesterolemia s/p splenectomy, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy  Social History: She has a heavy smoking history.
Her father also died from coronary artery disease.
She had 3 brothers who are deceased; they all had coronary artery disease and one also had a cerebral aneurysm.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
There is a homonymous left visual field cut.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Left atrial abnormality.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Marked interval enlargement of gyriform right occipital enhancing mass with marked worsening of adjacent vasogenic edema.
The gyriform pattern and associated restricted diffusion are most suspicious for "metastatic" lymphoma from the patient's known systemic lymphoma.
The other foci of enhancement in the left posterior temporal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere show continued decrease in prominence.
[**2179-5-27**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/aneurysm of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Likely severe calcific aortic stenosis (low-output, low-gradient AS).
[**2179-5-29**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Increase in size of right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with increase in associated leftward midline shift.
[**2179-5-29**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 85-year-old woman with history of lymphoma, presenting with headaches and left visual cut, now s/p brain biopsy showing CNS lymphoma, with course complicated by post-op left sided weakness and hemorrhage at biopsy site now C1D4 MTX.
(1) CNS lymphoma:  Patient has known lymphoma diagnosed in [**2176**] and found to have intracranial masses in [**2179-1-9**] but symptoms had been stable and she was being monitored clinically.
She now presented with headaches and left visual field cut, and was subsequently admitted to the neurology service.
Post-operatively, the patient developed a new left hemiparesis, a CT head showed a hemorrhage in the post-op tumor bed with cerebral edema.
Her repeat Head CTs showed stability of the bleed, and her left sided weakness slowly improved.
She also had a restaging torso CT on [**6-3**] concerning for malignant nodules within a background of infectious/inflammatory process.
She was continued on leucovorin until her blood methotrexate levels cleared.
Of note, patient was seen by ophthalmology who felt that she did not have ocular lymphoma contributing to her visual symptoms.
She was maintained on IV morphine and oxycodone in-house for her headaches.
(2) UTI:  Urinalysis drawn for very slightly elevated temperature to 99.1 F.  Urinalysis borderline with cultures growing Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Oragesic Solution Sig: One (1)  Mucous membrane four times a day as needed for oral sore pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 11496**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: -Central Nervous System Lymphoma -Right occipital brain mass - with associated left sided hemineglect -Right occipital hemorrhage -Oral stomatitis - secondary to methotrexate -Uncomplicated UTI - with Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin -Depression -Hyperlipidemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 56636**],  You were admitted to the hospital for vision changes and headaches.
You also developed weakness of your left side while in the hospital.
We did a scan of your head and you were found to have a hemorrhage where your biopsy was done.
Your weakness improved overadmission and the hemorrhage remained stable.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP acetaminophen-codeine - START oxycodone 2.5mg every 4-6 hours as needed for headache - START acetaminophen 650mg three times daily for headache - START dexamethasone 4mg oral twice daily, please continue this until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] instructs you to stop - START omeprazole 20mg daily, please continue this as long as you are taking dexamethasone to prevent stomach ulcers - START colace 100mg twice daily as needed for constipation - START senna 8.6 mg twice daily as needed for constipation - START oragesic mouth wash as needed for oral sore pain - STOP potassium chloride  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] is going to talk to your local medical oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and will coordinate your next round of chemotherapy and follow up appointment.
