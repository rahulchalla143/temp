There has been interval removal of the PICC line and left IJ central venous catheter.
There has been significant interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary vascular congestion as demonstrated on radiograph one day prior.
Narrowing and angulation of the celiac artery at region of median arcuate ligament may be due to respiratory phase of imaging.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including linezolid given concern for potential VRE as he had recently been on vancomycin for treatment of pneumonia.
Sensitivities later revealed pan-sensitive enterococcus, and linezolid was changed to ampicillin.
He did have an episode of tachycardia and hypotension on the floor, which responded to intravenous fluids.
# COPD/Respiratory Distress: On [**4-15**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea and a worsening oxygen requirement in the setting of IV fluid administration for hypotension.
He was given IV lasix boluses and nebulizer treatments with significant improvement in his respiratory status.
There was no evidence of pulmonary infection on imaging and urine legionella was negative.
He was continued on outpatient tiotropium and inhaled steroids.
He required transfusion of four units of packed RBCs.
His aspirin and warfarin had been held, but were restarted on his day of transfer to rehab, as his hematocrit had been stable with no further bleeds for about a week.
The patient was placed on conservative fluid restrictions.
Renal was consulted and the patient was also diuresed with IV and PO furosemide.
He was continued on rate control with lopressor and diltiazem.
He was anticoagulated with warfarin for thromboembolic prophylaxis with a goal INR of [**1-26**].
He and the rehabilitation center were instructed to restart his warfarin (and aspirin) on the day of transfer.
PE Likely contributing to right ventricular volume overload and pulmonary hypertension as above.
Patient tolerated systemic anticoagulation until he experienced his GI bleed (see above).
Warfarin was subsequently held as noted above.
