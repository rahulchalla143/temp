# Hypotension:  Likely etiology was septic shock in the setting of fever and neutropenia and hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation in the ED.
Medication effect was also considered, and his terazosin and tadalafil were held.
He was initially broadly covered with Vancomycin/Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.
Stress dose steroids were administered, which was tapered to twice the dose of oral dexamethasone than the patient's home dose on discharge, to be tapered at the discretion of his outpatient oncologist.
However, given the clinical setting of hypotension, fever, and neutropenia, the patient was treated with a 14 day course of Vancomycin and an IR guided PICC line was placed.
Irradiated, leuko-reduced blood products he received in clinic were cultured by the blood bank, but showed no source organism.
Cefepime was discontinued once his ANC was noted to be greater than 1000.
Patient was admitted to the MICU initially for hypotension and treated with IV fluid boluses as needed, pressors were not required.
