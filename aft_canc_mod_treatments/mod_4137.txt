No immunohistochemical work-up and/or blocks were submitted.
Overall, the features are of a high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
CD3 stain reveals scattered mature T-lymphocytes.
Severely elevated filling pressures and LV dysfunction possibly due to sepsis with acidosis or Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy as echo in cath lab showed apical ballooning.
CXR ([**9-3**]): FINDINGS: Single radiograph of the chest demonstrates ETT in satisfactory position; right subclavian venous catheter is noted with the tip at the level of the SVC.
Shock - The patient was initially thought to be in cardiogenic shock given her non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
However, she spiked temperatures, her Swan-Ganz catheter showed lower SVR (500s) with increased cardiac output to 8, less concerning for cardiac etiology and more concerning for sepsis.
She was initially started on antibiotics (zosyn, levo, and vanco), but these were stopped per ID recommendations, as there was no source for infection.
She was eventually made CMO and pressors were stopped.
A bicarb drip helped but could not prevent the acidemia.
Her family decided to make her comfort measures only and all care was withdrawn except for morphine and tylenol.
She was started on dialysis for uncontrollable acidemia, fluid status, and uremia without improvement.
They recommended treatment with decadron daily, and allopurinol and bicarb to alkanalize her urine.
They considered chemotherapy, but they could not start therapy as the patient remained too sick.
Eventually, the decision was made that she would be unlikely to get well enough to have chemo, and the family decided to change treatment goals to comfort measures only.
She was initially started on a D5 drip, but then became hyperglycemic.
As a result, she was changed to an insulin drip.
Her liver function, which had improved, began to worsen and her sugars began to trend downward again, so she was treated with all IV medications in D5.
Sedation/Mental status - The patient was anesthetized with propofol in an effort to control her breathing.
She was taken off sedation occasionally to check her neurologic status, and was responding to stimulus but not following commands.
Hypothyroidism - She was maintained on her levothyroxine.
