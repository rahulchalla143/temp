Sepsis: Patient was admitted with hypotension, elevated lactate(4.6), fever to 103, after an episode of nausea, vomiting and witnessed aspiration at [**Hospital3 **].
He was treated for presumed sepsis with aggressive IV fluids and antibiotics and defervesced.
The patient was maintained on a full treatment course of Vancomycin and Meropenem.
All antibiotics were discontinued on [**2126-1-1**].
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure secondary to Aspiration Pneumonia s/p tracheostomy.
On admission, it was felt the patient had a recurrent aspiration pneumonia as he was witnessed to vomit through his tracheostomy tube.
The patient was therefore started immediately on Meropenem on [**12-13**].
He was also treated with Gentamicin x 2 doses.
He was noted to be hypoxic(pO2 50)in the ED on trach [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was placed on AC ventilatory support with improvement of his oxygenation.
During this admission, he was also fitted for a PMV ot facilitate communication.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2125-12-22**] for transition to [**Hospital1 **] for further rehab care.
The patient was treated with Meropenem for full course of antibiotics that began [**2125-12-13**].
He should have his urinalysis repeated to document clearance of the infection.
History of VRE bacteremia:  The patient was continued on linezolid for empiric treatment of VRE endocarditis for 6 week course of antibiotics, given family declined TEE during his [**Month (only) 359**] admission to fully exclude endocarditis.
His Linezolid was discontinued on [**12-23**] after multiple negative blood cultures.
This was several days shy of the full 6 week course, but it was felt that Linezolid may be contributing to his persistently low platelets and was not adding any further benefit.
Fevers:  The patient was treated for his Klebsiella pneumonia and urinary tract infection with Meropenem and his fevers resolved.
He was managed with agressive fluid resuscitation and transient pressure support with Levophed .
Atrial Fibrillation with history of rapid ventircular response s/p IVC filter placement:  The night of admission, the patient had one episode of a fib with conversion to NSR after IV metoprolol was administered.
No anti-coagulation was indicated given his history of multiple intracranial bleeds.
Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p MI [**2-27**].
He was treated with aspirin daily, and b-blocker as tolerated.
GI was consulted and recommended prophylaxis with PPI and possible scope as an outpatient.
Prior to transfer to the floor the pt was started on sucralfate and the PPI was discontinued because of possible bone marrow suppression influencing the patient's platelet count.
These were restarted on HD #3.
It was felt that medications including linezolid and protonix may be contributing to his declining platelets.
Linezolid and protonix were stopped on [**12-22**] and he should be monitored for improvement in his platelet count.
Depression:  Pt was previously on Zoloft 50 mg po QD, which was held due to interactions with Linezolid.
Pt should resume Zoloft at low dose and titrate up as necessary now that off Linezolid.
