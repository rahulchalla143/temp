Interventional Radiology also evaluated patient and felt any invasive intervention would be potentially too complicated given multiple tumors in that region.
Urology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that given patient's past right retroperitoneal bleed which responded well to conservative management, patient should receive blood transfusions and close monitoring.
Patient has refused any surgical interventions in the past for these tumors (as recently as 10/[**2169**]).
His pain has improved after pain medications were administered in the ED.

Urology/surgery/interventional radiology all followed patient closely during the admission, with plans for interventional radiology procedure first if patient became hemodynamically unstable.
# Fever: Questionable whether related with loss of blood, 4 units of blood products transfused or retroperitoneal blood collection.
# Trigger word: The word, "surgery" makes patient severely anxious/uncomfortable with potential behavioral issues.
As patient declined surgical intervention during this hospitalization, his retroperitoneal hematoma was conservatively managed.
He was closely monitored in the MICU and started on low-dose short acting Metoprolol once stable (instead of his home Toprol).
Patient's blood pressures and heart rate were monitored and he was discharged on lower dose of his long-acting Metoprolol with instructions to resume his home dose of Toprol after seeing his primary care physician.
Patient was continued on outpatient carbamazepine.
