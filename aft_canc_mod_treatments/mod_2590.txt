At previous hospitalization, was initially treated with vancomycin (2 doses), then given at discharge 5 day course of Augmentin.
On admission for present hospitalization, vancomycin IV was started.
Pain and erythema improved considerably on IV antibiotics.
A PICC line was also placed to allow the patient to complete additional 7 day course of vancomycin IV.
Stenotrophomonas sensitivities from previous hospitalization show sensitivity to Bactrim and ceftazidime.
On admission, patient was restarted on ceftazidime based on the possibility that his diffuse arthralgias may be due to a systemic infection.
Ultrasound at former central line site was ultrasounded to assess for abscess - no abscess or clot was seen.
Given patient's improvement on steroids (as explained below), ceftazidime was stopped prior to discharge.
Differential diagnosis on presentation also included GVH, avascular necrosis given longterm steroid use, rhemautoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, Still's, Lyme.
Voriconazole was continued at home regimen of 300mg PO Q12.
Neurology was consulted given that patient's outpatient workup for these issues included an EMG - their recommendation was to hold off on the EMG as would likely not alter management.
On discharge, patient was on prednisone 20mg PO QAM and 15mg PO QPM.
Source unclear, although during previous admission creatinine rose steadily on IV bactrim, furosemide, lisinopril.
Creatinine continued to improve during this hospitalization with IV fliuds, increased PO intake.
Acute myelogyenous leukemia - s/p allo SCT.
Hyperkalemia - On presentation.
Patient was given calcium and furosemide given EKG changes associated with hyperkalemia.
Hypertension - During previous admission was restarted on carvedilol; ACE inhibitor was held secondary to elevated creatinine.
Continued to hold ACE inhibitor as creatinine improved.
Neuropathy - Continued neurontin per home regimen.
Diabetes mellitus - Continued glargine 4U at bedtime.
Sliding scale insulin with QID blood glucose checks.
Of note, blood glucose ran high after [**Hospital1 **] steroids were started.
