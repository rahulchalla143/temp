In the intensive care unit he received treatment for pulmonary hemorrhage.
The patient had been transferred from the hematology/oncology service, where he was undergoing treatment for AML that had been refractory to several chemotherapies, and he had persistent blast pancytopenia and diffuse pulmonary process, possibly infection, and had been noted to require increased oxygen demand and developed dyspnea and tachypnea with a new left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray.
Oxygen 96% on 100% non-rebreather mask.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  For hypotension and anemia, the patient received 3 liters of normal saline boluses for hydration, 1 unit of platelets, vitamin K, Amicar for thrombocytopenia, 2 units packed red blood cells and oxygenation on 100% non- rebreather facemask.
He was given morphine for comfort.
Given the gravity of the situation, the patient and his family decided to pursue comfort measures only, considering that his leukemia was not treatable, nor was the pulmonary hemorrhage with low platelets with platelets at the level of 5, down from 10.
For the respiratory distress, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, including Caspofungin, Voriconazole, Acyclovir, Dalfopristin and Imipenem.
In the event that the respiratory distress was related to underlying pulmonary infection, oxygen supplementation with a non-rebreather mask maintained oxygen saturation over 90%.
He received a blood transfusion and platelet transfusion for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
IV fluid boluses were given for hypotension.
The patient had end stage AML refractory to chemotherapy and several platelet transfusions.
A family meeting with palliative care and ICU team led to pursuit of comfort measures in light of futility of additional treatment, unable to maintain adequate levels of thrombocytes and blood cells with continuing pulmonary hemorrhage.
