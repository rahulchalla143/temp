You were admitted to the hospital after several days of dark bowel movements, weakness, and dizziness.
You were started on a medicine (pantoprazole) for likely bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
You also had an endoscopic study, which showed an ulcer at the connection made between your stomach and small intestine during your gastric bypass surgery.

Several factors place you at higher risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, including your gastric bypass surgery and daily use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin in Alka-Seltzer and ibuprofen).
Because of your stomach ulcer and recent gastrointestinal bleeding, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU AVOID TAKING MEDICINES CONTAINING aspirin (including Alka-Seltzer) and NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve)).
