Stable appearance of neobladder without evidence of perforation, however, evaluation of the lower pelvis is limited by streak artifact from surgical clips.
He was given several courses of albuterol nebs which resulted in temporary improvement of symptoms, but serial ABGs revealed worsening alkalosis.
In this first MICU stay, he was continued on vanco and levaquin for pneumonia.
The differential diagnosis considered included atypical pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1902**], vasculitis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
He was on BiPAP for an unspecified period of time.
He was also given nebs and started on solumedrol.
Coumadin was held.
He was on 2L nc at that time, and was satting 95-96% on room air by the following morning.
He was given nebs without improvement.
He was also treated with nitro, morphine, and lasix with some improvement.
On [**2105-2-15**], he was intubated in anticipation of inability to sustain high minute ventilation.
He was given vitamin K to reverse his INR, and his Hct was monitored closely.
DFA returned positive for influenza A. BAL bacterial and fungal cultures were negative, so all antimicrobials were discontinued on [**2105-2-17**].
Since, he has had continued improvement in his respiratory status, currently breathing well on 3L/min nasal cannula.
He was transferred back to the floor on [**2105-2-25**] where he was weaned off of his supplemental oxygen.
Due to his continued hemoptysis and the patient's concern, his warfarin continued to be held and he was not put on a heparin drip (since his only risk factor for thromboembolization was a-fib); he will discuss resuming this with his PCP.
