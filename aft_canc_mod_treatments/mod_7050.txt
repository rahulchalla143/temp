Admission Date:  [**2164-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16115**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy and altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left internal jugular central line placement  History of Present Illness:  75-year-old male with history of stage IV NSCLC with metastases to his brain and liver s/p craniotomy on gemcitabine/carboplatin, brought in from [**Hospital3 **] for lethargy.
He has been on antibiotics since recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for lung abscess (cefepime, linezolid, and metronidazole).
He had been started on anticoagulation, but this was held due to occurence of hemotypsis.
Bronchoscopy was performed but no drainage of the abscess was attempted due to perceived high risk of seeding, and he was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics for likely post-obstruction pneumonia complicated by an empyema in the hopes they would keep the infection at bay.
Swallow evaluation was performed here and he was recommended for thin liquids and regular consistency solids, safe to take whole meds with water.
Cardiology was consulted for tachycardia of multifactorial etiology and he continues on metoprol for rate control.
Gemcitabine/carboplatin was started during this hospitalization with the understanding that he is a borderline candidate, complicated by fatigue, mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, currently C1D20.

Increased bronchial compression and invasion by right hilar adenopathy, nearly occluding right main bronchus contributing to increased right lung atelectasis and post-obstruction pneumonia.
Increase right pleural effusion.=   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with stage IV NSLC s/p craniotomy and initiation of systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine/carboplatin with recent hospitalization for empyema treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, returning with altered mental status and acute kidney injury.
# Altered mental status/sepsis: thought to represent a recrudescence of his pulmonary infection that could not be optimally treated with drainage.
Since he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, it seems less likely that other sources of infection would be causing this new clinical state (i.e.
It is more likely that these antibiotics are not penetrating his empyema and his new leukocytosis with a small bandemia may be a reaction to this.
He was started on IV fluids without any real improvement in his kidney function, despite low CVPs ([**3-5**]).
TSH slightly elevated with borderline low free T4, but CT chest showed worsening lung parenchyma and the decision was made to hold off on further treatments until palliative care and transition to hospice was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Oncology team on transfer.
He was continued on b-blockade, IV while not taking POs.
He had tolerating prophylactic doses of heparin SC prior to transfer to rehab and he has been on dalteparin at rehab.
Given high risk of recurrent thromboembolic disease, he was continued on prophylaxis.
# Metastatic NSCLC s/p craniotomy and liver involvement:  His adenocarcinoma is quite advanced and chemotherapy was only recently started after left temporal tumor resection and radiation therapy.
He was not a candidate for chemotherapy given his poor functional status, and he may not be able to tolerate this in the future, especially given his persistent infection.
Antibiotics were stopped, and symptoms were controlled as needed with intravenous medications.
