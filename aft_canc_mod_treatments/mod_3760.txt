Discussion was held regarding mutuality of a pulmonary artery catheter with possible intubation that might alter her case; however, it seemed unlikely that a PA catheter would add information which would be able to alter the patient's course.
The patient was initially treated with vasopressin and Levophed as well as the broad spectrum antibiotics started at [**Hospital1 26200**].
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] offered the family the option of aggressive measures including a pulmonary artery catheter and possible intubation noting that they might afford some benefit.
At this point, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending, was notified and the patient was made comfort measures only.
