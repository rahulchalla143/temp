Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).
Extremely limited study secondary to patient motion and lack of intravenous contrast.
Patient was briefly admitted to the ICU for management prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 4601**] Oncology where patient receives majority of his care.
Patient now intubated and sedated for airway protection.
On admission to ICU, patient was initially covered with vancomycin and zosyn, but given concern for CNS infection was broadened to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin and flagyl at appropriate doses.
Plan was for urgent LP/MRI/EEG but work-up was interrupted by request of family and primary oncologist to have transfer to [**Hospital3 328**] for further care.
Plan at the time of discharge is for: - LP (plts marginal, will need plts pre LP), would send infectious/viral studies in addition to routine labwork.
- continue dilantin for now, 100mg IV TID, check albumin and dilantin trough in am goal level (adj for hypoalb [**11-21**]).
Patient initially covered with vanc/zosyn but after culture data returned, and given ?
of CNS infection, patient changed to ceftriaxone in addition to vanc/flagyl/acyclovir/ampicillin.
?in setting of Narcan (patient seizured after receiving this at OSH).
Continue anti-epileptics and monitor levels.
- Lesion on CT unlikely seizure focus as per neurology - MRA/MRV/EEG - consider LP for infection, toxic-metabolic w/up .
Continue hydration as tolerated given concern for SIADH.
- Mucomyst 600mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses - Bicarbonate with IVF's.
