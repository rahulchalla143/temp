Known liver mass better assessed on prior studies.
Surgical clips are seen in the upper abdomen.
Will continue aggressive management of symptoms until clarification of goals of care.
Concern also for bacterial peritonitis related to the pleurex catheter despite cipro prophylaxis although unfortunately unable to obtain peritoneal fluid studies prior to administration of abx due to mechanical issues.
Patient was initially treated with zosyn for concern of abx resistence.
Patient's pain was controlled with morphine and oxycodone.
After clarification of goals, antibioitcs were stopped.
Seems as if this lab was drawn prior to administration of insulin and D50 so likely not iatrogenic.
No medications such as steroids to explain either.
Patient was initially placed on a sliding scale but per patient's wishes glucose was no longer monitored.
Patient had an abdominal catheter in place for comfort paracentesis, this became blocked in the ED after they attempted to draw off fluid.
