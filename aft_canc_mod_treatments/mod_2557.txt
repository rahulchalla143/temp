Family History: Mother with gastric cancer.
Severely depressed cardiac output with cardiac index 1.21 with arterial O2 saturation by pulse oximetry 97% on room air and PA O2 saturation of 30%.
Prominent hepatic veins, right pleural effusion, ascites, and diffuse gallbladder thickening consistent with the patient's known cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male w/ hx of NSTEMI, HIV (CD4 < 200), DMII, CKD, cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), Burkitt Lymphoma and Hodgkin's who presents with failure to thrive and decompensated/acute on chronic biventricular heart failure.
He underwent diuresis with lasix and metolazone and was started on dopamine and milrinone.
Pt responded and was transferred to the floor and was dc-ed to a long-term acute rehabilitation in a stable condition.
He was transferred to the CCU for further care after small IVF bolus and broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated.
He was started on a low dose dopamine infusion and milrinone was initiated which resulted in improvement in blood pressures, excellent urine output 10L net negative and weight loss with improvement in kidney function and liver enzymes c/w fluid overload as cause of both.
He was taken off dopamine and milrinone before transfer to the floor and pressures were stable after initial hospital course.
He was started on torsemide, lisinopril and metoprolol.
Torsemide was held on discharge due to increase in creatinine with plan to resume as an outpatient once creatinine returned to baseline.
Pt was started on dopamine, milrinone, and diuresed with IV lasix gtt and metolazone.
He was started on metoprolol XL 25 qd and lisinopril as well as torsemide.
His volume status is difficult to assess on exam as he rarely has peripheral edema and tends to hold extra fluid in his abdomen.
He underwent thoracentesis which showed no malignant cells and few macrophages.
However, he did have plamcytoid cells and large atypical cells with basophilic cytoplasm and nucleoli c/w immunoblasts.
While awaiting urine culture, he was empirically started on ciprofloxacin which was broadened given his hypotension.
Urine culture was negative and pleural effusion showed no evidence of infection, thus abx were discontinued with exception of flagyl.
Pt also with oral thrush; he was continued on nystatin given his elevated liver enzymes.
When his liver enzymes trend down, he should be restarted on fluconazole.
Bactrim was continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Pt has very limited understanding of his medical condition.
Improved immensely with milrinone and low dose dopamine and lasix.
Continue to hold glipizide given rising creatinine  # Neuropathy: Gabapentin was continued but renally dosed.
