The patient is status post a long hospitalization at the [**Hospital 14852**] beginning in [**2149-7-10**] and ending on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2149-12-26**], when she was transferred to the [**Hospital3 537**].
The patient was initially diagnosed with AML in [**2148-9-9**] while undergoing treatment for her Sezary syndrome.
In [**2149-7-10**], she was admitted to the [**Hospital 8503**] for autologous bone marrow transplant.
Over one week later she was diagnosed with nonconvulsive status epilepticus and was transferred to the ICU for intubation and treatment.
She was loaded initially with Dilantin which was discontinued when it caused leukopenia and then later with Depakote and Keppra.
During this long hospitalization, she also was readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit and intubated for an MRSA pneumonia which was treated with linazolid.
At some point in the course, the patient was treated with vancomycin and the family felt that this contributed to her unresponsiveness and refused future doses of vancomycin.
At that time, she was not intubated but still was not responsive or verbal.
She was intubated for hypoxemia using Etomidate, succinylcholine, and Ativan as the patient clenched her jaw shut tight.
It was felt that she was in septic shock and dopamine was switched to Neo-Synephrine at 60 micrograms per minute.
In the Emergency Department, she was also noted to have poor urine output and received 6 liters of IV fluids with 600 cc of urine output over the next two hours.
She received IV doses of Clindamycin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, and linazolid.
She was sent to the ICU for further management.
Cervical cancer, diagnosed in [**2106**], status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Breast cancer times two, right breast DCIS, status post mastectomy and lymph node dissection in [**2138**]; left breast intraductal cancer, status post mastectomy and adjunctive chemotherapy with four cycles of Cytoxan and Adriamycin in [**2145-9-9**].
Sezary syndrome, status post photophoresis weekly up until [**2148-9-9**].
Myelodysplasia converted to AML diagnosed in [**2148-9-9**], status post autologous bone marrow transplant at the [**Hospital 4415**] in [**2149-7-10**], status post four courses of Ara-C. 5.
Keppra 1,000 mg b.i.d.
Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d.
Depakote 1,000 mg t.i.d.
Imodium 2 mg q.i.d.
Prozac 20 mg q.d.
Prilosec 20 mg q.d.
Lantus 10 units subcutaneously q.h.s.
Jevity Plus tube feeds.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE ICU:  Blood pressure stable, saturations 99% on assist control 20, 500, and 60%.
Mastectomy scars were noted.
CARDIAC:  The patient was initially felt to be in septic shock secondary to her left shift, fever, and hypotension not responding to fluids; however, on [**2149-12-30**], a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which demonstrated a cardiac index of 1.5, SVR 1,200, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20.
Her CK was in the 800s and troponin 2.6.
Her Levophed was switched to dobutamine and Cardiology was consulted.
Cardiology felt that she was significantly fluid overloaded and recommended not only diuresis but Captopril for afterload reduction.
The patient's last dose of Adriamycin was several years ago during her treatment for breast cancer.
Up to this date, the patient has been weaned off of dobutamine (weaned entirely on [**2150-1-4**]) and Captopril has been increased to 50 mg t.i.d.
Of note, the Swan-Ganz catheter was removed on [**2150-1-5**] and changed to a triple-lumen catheter.
She was loaded with Depakote, phenobarbital was added to her regimen and Keppra was continued.
PULMONARY:  The patient's ventilator dependency has continued but she has remained on pressure support weaned down on [**2150-1-5**] to 5 of pressure support and 5 of PEEP, tolerating this well and with saturations in the high 90s.
She may require a tracheostomy if she is unable to tolerate pressure support without having significant apneic periods, may require tracheostomy for airway support.
She was continued on an eight day course of linazolid until [**2150-1-5**] when it was discontinued as the patient has been afebrile without worsening of her pneumonia, also with thrombocytopenia and felt maybe contributed to linazolid.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient is status post G tube placement in [**2149-10-10**] at the outside hospital.
Tube feeds initially held secondary to sepsis, on pressors, and then started Criticare at 10 cc per hour for trophic feeds.
TPN was initiated on [**2149-12-29**] with insulin to cover for elevated blood sugars.
We have started to attempt to increase tube feeds as tolerated and checking residuals frequently.
We will discontinue TPN if able to.
SKIN:  The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and calf decubitus ulcers, heel decubitus ulcers being treated with wet-to-dry dressing changes.
ENDOCRINE:  Apparent history of diabetes mellitus treated with regular insulin sliding scale here.
Insulin drip started on [**2150-1-5**] to gain further control of sugars now that the patient is off TPN.
No treatment initiated at this point.
Ceftazidime and Flagyl were discontinued on [**2149-12-31**] and linazolid was continued until [**2150-1-5**].
Have discontinued all antibiotics at this point but will restart if necessary.
We will discontinue Foley and repeat.
We will review all medications to take off further medications that may be causing thrombocytopenia.
ACCESS:  Right Cordis from [**2149-12-30**] to [**2150-1-5**] changed to a triple-lumen catheter Port-A-Cath since previous admission at the [**Hospital 4415**].
Femoral A line placed by the Pulmonary Fellow in the Emergency Department on [**2149-12-29**].
Risk Management and Legal had been involved at the [**Hospital 4415**].
Depakote and phenobarbital levels should be followed-up on.
Attempt to wean from ventilation but may require tracheostomy for airway support.
