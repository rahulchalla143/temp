You were given medications to reduce the potassium level and catheter drains were placed into both ureters to bypass the obstruction.
You immediately began excreting urine and over several days the kidneys returned to baseline.
The nephrostomy tubes will need to stay in place until after radiation therapy and how long they are needed will be determined by Urology.
In addition, you were started on an antibiotic for a bacteria that grew in your sputum (possible pneumonia) and steroids (prednisone) for acute COPD exacerbation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema).
You will need to complete a course of the antibiotic and a slow taper of the steroids.
Aspirin has been held due to bleeding from the nephrostomy tubes.
Levofloxacin once daily x7 days total.
Prednisone as directed.
Hold aspirin until further notified.
Stop enalapril and potassium supplements as both elevate potassium levels and your potassium level had been dangerously high.
