HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] is a 76-year-old male who was noted to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus on routine surveillance esophagoscopy for known [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus.
Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
Allopurinol 300 mg p.o.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride.
He had a preoperatively placed epidural for pain control; which at the time contained only narcotic medications.
He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and proceeded to receive  multiple fluid boluses postoperatively for decreases in urine output.
On postoperative day three, the Levophed drip was turned off as the patient's blood pressure stabilized.
On postoperative day four, the patient continued to be intubated and sedated but showing improvement in cardiac index as well as improvement in urine output.
Tube feeds were started on postoperative day five by jejunostomy tube with the patient receiving Impact with fiber at 30 cc per hour.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable, and with diuresis the patient's oxygenation improved.
On postoperative day six, the patient continued to require further diuresis as he would occasionally have oxygen desaturations on turning.
His tube feeds were raised to 40 cc per hour on this day.
He remained intubated and stable over the next number of days.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] continued to be intubated and sedated with active diuresis and was started on levofloxacin for his pneumonia.
He did require occasional suctioning for desaturations as he respiratory status continued to fluctuate.
The patient remained intubated and sedated on postoperative day 17.
At this time, he was continuing on his tube feeds as well as Levaquin for pneumonia.
Due to the prolonged course of intubation, on postoperative day 17, a tracheostomy was performed on the patient.
He tolerated the procedure well.
He was started on Coumadin on postoperative day 19 due to his prolonged atrial fibrillation.
At this time, his tube feeds were running at his goal nutritional rate.
On postoperative day 27, Mr. [**Known lastname 7635**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a bedside swallowing evaluation; however, this study could not be evaluated as the patient refused to swallow liquids given to him.
The patient was tolerating his tube feeds without nausea or vomiting, and return of bowel function was indicated by bowel movements.
At this time, the patient continued to receive daily doses of Coumadin with intravenous heparin for anticoagulation due to his atrial fibrillation.
By postoperative day 30, the patient was deemed stable and ready for transfer to an acute care rehabilitation facility where he could continue to receive tracheostomy care as well as tube feeds.
The patient will require remaining nothing by mouth at this time and will require daily INR checks as he is receiving daily Coumadin until his INR has reached a therapeutic level; per his prolonged and continued atrial fibrillation.
DISCHARGE DIET:  The patient is nothing by mouth at this time and is receiving Impact with fiber (full strength) at 80 cc per hour.
DISCHARGE ACTIVITY:  The patient's activity is to be restricted, and he require extensive help with Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy to regain strength and mobility as well as independence with his activities of daily living.
Levofloxacin 500 mg via jejunostomy tube once per day.
Reglan 10 mg via jejunostomy tube three times per day.
Zantac 150 mg via jejunostomy tube once per day.
Lopressor 12.5 mg via jejunostomy tube twice per day.
Acetaminophen liquid 650 mg jejunostomy tube q.4-6h.
NPH insulin 20 units subcutaneously q.12h.
Coumadin (dose to be adjusted per the patient's INR which need to be continually checked on a daily basis).
