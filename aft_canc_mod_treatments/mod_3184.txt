HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and breast cancer (status post mastectomy with metastatic spread to the spine) who complained of chest pain on the morning prior to admission.
She took one sublingual nitroglycerin with resolution of the pain, but then the pain recurred and the patient presented to the Emergency Department.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, transient ischemic attack, breast cancer (status post left mastectomy in [**2120**] with metastases to the spine), left upper extremity lymphedema, anxiety disorder, skin cancer, history of peptic ulcer disease in [**2114**], and left leg fracture.
Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Ativan 0.5 mg by mouth as needed.
Lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Celebrex 100 mg by mouth once per day.
Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
Exercise tolerance test done in [**2138-6-20**] with four minutes on a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and stopped secondary to dizziness with a heart rate of 105.
The Cardiothoracic Surgery Service was consulted, and an intraaortic balloon pump was placed.
In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending, a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
Her bypass time was 66 minutes with a cross- clamp time of 52 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
She had nitroglycerin at 0.3 mc/kilogram per minute, propofol at 20 mcg/kilogram per minute and an intraaortic balloon pump at 1:1.
Her anesthesia was reversed.
Attempts to wean her from the ventilator were unsuccessful as she developed a severe respiratory acidosis when she was switched to pressure support ventilation.
Additionally, the patient was weaned from the intraaortic balloon pump which was also removed on postoperative day one.
On postoperative day two, the patient remained on a nitroglycerin infusion to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the middle 120s.
Her chest tubes were removed.
Her pulmonary artery catheter was removed.
Her tram line was changed to triple lumen catheter, and she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody screen was sent, and the patient's medications were tailored to eliminate any that could cause thrombocytopenia.
Her beta blockers were gradually increased.
Her pacing wires were removed.
On postoperative day four, it was noted that her hematocrit had drifted down from 24 to 20, and she was  transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was noted to have a large ecchymotic area on her right neck which resulted from her central line placement in the preoperative theater.
Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three (with saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery).
Breast cancer; status post mastectomy of the left breast with metastatic spread to the spine.
