Bleeding ceased but the patient was kept intubated for airway protection.
She was started on Solu-Medrol intravenously and transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for urgent radiation.
The patient also received large doses of sedation for agitation including Fentanyl, Ativan, Morphine, Versed and two doses of             .
MEDICATIONS AS AN OUTPATIENT:  Insulin, sliding scale in AM, Valium prn and Aleve prn.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenously q.
6 hours, Protonix 40 mg intravenously q.
24 hours, insulin sliding scale, heparin subcutaneously, Labetalol 5 to 10 mg intravenously q.
1 hour prn, Ativan 1 to 2 mg q.
1 hour prn, Morphine 4 to 8 mg q.
1 hour prn, Ativan 2 to 4 mg q.
1 hour prn, Tylenol prn, Propofol drip.
The patient came over on SIMV with title volumes of 700, respiratory rate of 10, pressure support of 5 and 5 with arterial blood gases of 7.39, 4, 5 and 70.
The patient was noted not to be over-breathing the ventilator at this time.
Jugulovenous distension could not be assessed.
There was also shotty left groin adenopathy.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, BUN 15, creatinine .5, glucose 266, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.8, iron 42, TIBC 249, ferritin 259.
Total bilirubin .3, ALT 24, AST 24, total protein 6.5, albumin 3.4, alkaline phosphatase 129, Vitamin B 12 910, Folate 10.6.
Chest x-ray from outside hospital per report, endotracheal tube with tip carinii, cardiomegaly, right lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient had a computerized tomography scan of the trachea on [**11-28**] after eight to nine doses of radiation which showed trachea that was patent with improvement in its caliber and less extrinsic compression seen on previous computerized tomography scan.
She required frequent suctioning due to secretions and required both nasal cannula and high flow oxygen to maintain a saturation above 90%.
She was started on Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers which were [**2-13**] and then spread out to prn by hospital day #16.
In terms of her right middle lobe collapse, due to extrinsic compression and marked middle lobe bronchus it was thought that the patient should be carefully observed, however, stent was not needed at this time.
The patient was started on CPAP trials, however, she did not tolerate the mask and has only been able to tolerate at maximum two hours of CPAP at a setting of 8 cm.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44983**] from the Department of Anesthesia evaluated the patient's diaphragmatic movement with ultrasound at the bedside.
In terms of the patient's post obstructive pneumonia, the patient has been on a course of Levaquin and Clindamycin.
The patient's mental status appears to be approaching baseline and it is not thought that the patient has lost her gag due to decreased mental status or medication effect.
The patient should continue Levaquin for a 21 day course.
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued which should improve drainage of her secretions.
It was thought that this is most likely due to medication effect as she required doses of Ativan for radiation.
It was thought at this time that since her mental status continued to improve, no other source of delirium was likely.
She has received ten doses of radiation which the patient has tolerated well and has shown some improvement of tumor size.
The patient has started on free water infusions and this has subsequently improved.
Diabetes - The patient was on Solu-Medrol for a short period of time, however, since this was not thought to be lymphoma, Solu-Medrol was subsequently discontinued.
However, while she was on Solu-Medrol the patient required an insulin drip.
The patient is currently on an insulin sliding scale, however, is receiving dextrose in her partial parenteral nutrition and is started on NPH 4 mg b.i.d.
She is started on partial parenteral nutrition since her PICC line is not central enough for total parenteral nutrition at this time.
After speech and swallow, if she aspirates during her speech and swallow examination, then the decision whether to pursue a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube will be approached with the patient at that time.
Because of the patient's SVC syndrome, diuresis was not pursued at this time, however, once hypernatremia resolves, the patient may benefit from diuresis in the future.
Tubes, lines and drains - The patient has a PICC line, day #8 at this time of this dictation and she has a Foley catheter.
Urinary tract infection - The patient had a Klebsiella urinary tract infection during this hospitalization which has been pansensitive to antibiotics.
Prophylaxis - The patient is on heparin subcutaneous and Protonix.
