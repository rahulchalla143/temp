He also received preoperative cardiac clearance and was catheterized at the end of [**2145-12-10**].
The plan - after multiple meetings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - was to proceed with mediastinoscopy, and if the nodes were negative to proceed to a lobectomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the morning of [**2146-2-14**], the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was brought to the operating room that morning where he underwent bronchoscopy, cervical mediastinoscopy, and right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy.
The operation proceeded without complication and without any hemodynamic instability.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient's pain was well controlled with an epidural catheter that was managed by the acute pain service.
His chest tubes at this time were placed to water seal at midnight on the night on postoperative day #1.
There was minimal small right pleural effusions noted at this time on serial chest x-rays, and these chest tubes were without air leak with the posterior tube removed on postoperative day #3 and the anterior tube removed on postoperative day #4 with no significant untoward event.
On postoperative day #5, after working with physical therapy on multiple sessions, it was deemed that he would benefit from the option of home oxygen.
