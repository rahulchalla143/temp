Admission Date:  [**2135-10-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-11-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-7-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Penicillins / Ciprofloxacin / Roxicet / Salicylate / Clindamycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**] Chief Complaint: worsening gastric reflux symptoms  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2135-10-27**]: Esophagectomy with J-tube placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62 year old male who presented with worsening reflux symptoms.
After identifying the patient appropriately, he was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.
The position of this tube was confirmed bronchoscopically.
We carried our dissection toward the base of the right gastroepiploic artery and vein.
We then injected the pylorus using 200 units of botulinum toxin.
We then inserted the 7-French needle jejunostomy catheter using the large needle and wire assembly.
We observed appropriate position of this tube going distally into the small bowel.
The feeding tube was then tacked up to the abdominal wall using 3 additional sutures.
The external portion of the feeding tube was secured to the abdomen using 3-0 nylon sutures.
Once we approached about 2 cm within the GE junction, we then used multiple fires of the green Endo [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] staplers to create a wide gastric tube that was about 6-7 cm in diameter.
Once the tube was created we then placed a single U stitch between the tube and the specimen to allow the tube to be brought up into the chest.
Remaining port sites were closed using 4-0 Vicryl and Dermabond.
Before turning the patient we also placed a nasogastric tube into the proximal thoracic esophagus.
We then divided the esophagus at the level of the azygos vein using laparoscopic scissors.
We sent margins for frozen section which returned negative for malignancy.
We then made a small gastrotomy at the tip of the gastric conduit adjacent to the lesser curve staple line.
We then placed a 10 mm flat JP drain adjacent to the anastomosis.
We then placed a 24-French chest tube through the camera incision.
