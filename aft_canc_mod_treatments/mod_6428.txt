Recommendations are as follows:  1) given his recent sbo I am reluctant to increase his zyprexa given anticholinergic side effects until some time has passed from the sbo, so would keep all medications as they are now.
He also may need an increase in effexor over time as well 3)check TSH if not recently checked.
Physical therapy deemed the patient appropriate for return to his home facility but recommended physical therapy services.
