[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 39 year old woman with nsclc mets to brain, s/p VP shunt 2 days ago now with fairly severe HA for several hours.
There has been interval placement of a left-sided intraventricular drain with the tip in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Skin staples are seen overlying the course of the VP shunt.
Interval placement of VP shunt with removal of prior right intraventricular drainage.
Diagnosis of metastatic large cell lung cancer was made by ultrasound guided liver biopsy, and multiple metases noted throughout spine and brain by MRI (L spine metases, loss of L4 disc space, foraminal narrowing; multiple enhancing lesions in brain, largest of 2.5 cm with hemorrhage).
Carboplatin/Taxol chemotherapy was administered, however, over several days, patient began to have decreased level of consciousness, increased headache, nausea, and vomiting with no relief from narcotics or acetaminophen.
Patient was given a bolus of 10mg decadron q6hours, and transferred to the ICU for q1hour neuro checks.
Patient was administered whole brain radiation therapy (total dose 2,000 cGy).
A right frontal EVD was placed, and mannitol and decadron were administered to reduce edema and increased intracranial pressure.
The EVD was then removed and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed without complication.
The patient's mental status continued to improve and at the time of discharge, decadron had been weaned to 4mg QD.
The patient was placed on a regiment of Keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **] to maintain seizure prophylaxis.
2) Metastatic lung cancer: Although it was felt that the patient had an overall poor prognosis, it was felt that she may still benefit from a palliative standpoint from aggressive treatment.
Was scheduled for repeated chemotherapy but delayed due to EVD infection.
The patient was started on Iressa (EGFR inhibitor) 250mg qd, since shown to have some benefit in metastatic lung Ca to brain as 2nd line [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to chemo/XRT.
3) Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: Had multiple runs of NSVT and was started on amiodarone infusion.
Evaluated by Cardiology who felt that the rhythm was polymorphic, and likely catecholamine mediated VT which would be best treated with a beta-blocker.
Amiodarone was discontinued.
At the time of discharge, patient's blood pressure and heart rate were stable without ectopy, and patient was discharged on 25mg Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].
Patient's pain was fairly well controlled with morphine PCA, then converted to Oxycontin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
