Due to Ms. [**Known lastname **] numerous allergies to medication, it was necessary for her to receive IV antibiotics for the abscess; moreover, in light of her bleeding disorder, it was best that she be evaluated for oral surgery in an inpatient setting.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] dentist recommended that she have her teeth extracted as well as receive antibiotics for the infection.
However, due to Ms. [**Known lastname **] multiple drug allergies, she was unable to take any appropriate medications by mouth.
Patient was admitted to the hospital and started on vanc and gent; she was pre-medicated with benadryl and hydrated with IVF prior to vanc administration due to prior minor side effects and a tendency to self-diureis.
Patient had no serious adverse effects from this regimen and her creatinine remained normal despite gent administration.
ID was consulted early on in hospital admission and recommended starting flagyl for anearobic coverage.
However, as patient had had reactions to flagyl in the past, she was transferred to the MICU were she was placed on a special desensitization protocol for flagyl.
She received Amicar during surgery as bleeding prophylaxis due to hyperfibrinolysis syndrome; however, after surgery, patient appeared to be bleeding excessively (she kept complaining of blood dripping down her throat) and she was transferred to the MICU for observation on the night of [**7-19**].
She was continued on IV vanc, gent, and flagyl for 5 more days until [**7-23**].
Again, she had minor side effects wtih these antibiotics (coughing, itchy eyes, auto-diuresis) but nothing life-threatening.
She was eventually transitioned to oral amicar; however, she was was not sent home on this medication.
Afterward, her diet was slowly advanced from NPO to sips to soft foods.
