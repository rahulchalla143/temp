He was diagnosed with a UTI and given several doses of Levofloxacin.
He received 3liters NS and 1 units pRBC's w/o improvement of BP.
Prior to his current admission he was admitted from [**Date range (3) 77130**] for small bowel obstruction which was complicated by incarcerated hernia which also required surgical treatment.
Source was initially thought to be PNA given RUL infiltrate on CXR and hypoxia and he was treated with vanc/zosyn/levo.
Her was persistently hypoxic and on an NRB mask for a prolonged period of time.
He was treated with an NG tube and fluids.
On [**2192-9-30**] his blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and pip/tazo + levofloxacin were d/c'd and he was continued on vancomycin alone.
Gentamicin was started on for synergy given continued bacteremia.
He was also started on levophed for hypotension.
On [**2192-10-11**] he underwent to surgery for a porcine valve replacement and was transfused 9U pRBC perioperatively for a post op HCT of 30. .
Regarding his ongoing bacteremia, he was changed from vancomycin + daptomycin to linezolid on [**2192-10-12**] due to BCx positive Staph.
aureus intermediately resistant to vancomycin and daptomycin.

Left PICC tip is in the SVC.
The patient is status post bilateral lens replacement; otherwise, the soft tissues appear unremarkable.
A right nasogastric tube is noted to be in place.
No region of abnormal enhancement is noted after administration of IV contrast.
The Dobbhoff tube tip is proximal in the proximal stomach, unchanged compared to the prior study.
Following the intravenous infusion of gadolinium-DTPA, within the limits of this study, there are no definite signs for the presence of pathological enhancement intracranially.
Brief Hospital Course: INITIAL MICU COURSE [**Date range (2) 77131**]: The patient was initially started on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, pending identification of the cause of his sepsis.
Zosyn and Levofloxacin were stopped on [**9-30**] and Vancomycin continued when he was found to have MRSA in his blood, urine, and sputum.

Gentamycin was started on [**9-7**] for synergy given continued bacteremia.
He had a repeat ECHO on the same day showing a large aortic valve vegetation.

After discussion with the patient's daughter, surgical service, and gastroenterology, the patient was transfered to the surgical service on the morning of [**9-10**] for surgery to remove the vegetation and repair the valve.
Patient was on DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin and pneumoboots.
Per report, he had some degree of altered mental status at rehab following his ventral hernia repair.
Received 9 units during his MICU course (3 of those the day prior to surgery).
Pt was given renal protective therapy with sodium bicarb and mucomyst.
On [**2192-10-11**] The patient was transfered to the surgical service for aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve which was uncomplicated.
He was changed from vancomycin + daptomycin to Linezolid on [**2192-10-12**] as his sensitivities VISA and dapto-intermediate sensitivity.
On [**10-12**] he was started on amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] following loading with an IV drip for rapid Afib, he was decreased to 400mg daily on [**10-18**].

MICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 77132**]: The patient was continue on the Lasix 40mg IV BID but this was stopped on [**2192-10-19**] due to concerns of rising creatinine.
MEDICINE COURSE [**2192-10-19**] to [**2192-10-26**]: 80M with PMH of CVA, small bowel obstruction, and metastatic prostate CA admitted originally for altered mental status who developed vancomycin and daptomycin intermediate resistant endocarditis with destruction of the aortic valve now s/p valve replacement with persistant delirium.
To reduce this we have treated pain with tylenol standing and low dose MS IV if appeared to be in pain.
He has not required MS IV in several days.
We held sedating and altering medications as much as possible.
He has a condom cath and an NG tube which he tolerates.
The Pt also has ongoing frontal sings including [**Last Name (un) 8752**]-metal, snout, [**Doctor Last Name **], and [**Doctor Last Name 77133**] as well as pathologic Babinski.
# Atrial fibrillation - he had Afib with RVR post-operatively for which he was started on amiodarone + metoprolol.
Cards had recommended amiodarone 200mg daily for 6 months but CT [**Doctor First Name **] said none is needed since he seems to be in stable sinus rhythm.
On metoprolol for rate control.
He was transfused 9U pRBC peri-operatively.
Held off on imaging of spine as he was clinically improving and afebrile.
Now that he has PO access hopefully improved nutrition will help this.
# Aortic valve endocarditis and bacteremia- now s/p aortic valve replacement with porcine valve.
On strict contact isolation for vancomycin and daptomycin intermediate resistant Staph.
Per ID will continue linezolid to [**2192-11-23**].
Held off on additional imaging as clinical status improving.
Will need weekly CRP to confirm imporvement after his endocarditis.
# Volume Overload - Positive fluid balance over his length of stay with significant pleural effusions and lower extremity edema.
Holding Lasix for now since seems euvolemic.
PSA WNL [**2192-10-20**] so was holding leuprolide given low PSA.
Pt normally received his leuprolide every 4 months of 30 mg IM.
Hold metoprolol for SBP<90 .
# Depression: prior to his prolonged two hospitalizations here he had been treated for depression with Remeron 45 mg qhs, Effexor XR 150 mg tabs (1.5 tabs daily) and Zyprexa 7.5 mg qhs.
He has not been on these doses for a couple of months but prior to his hospital stay at the [**Hospital1 18**], at the MACU at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab he was on Effexor 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Haldol.

A dubhoff was placed for enteral nutrition.
