Expansile hyperechoic vascularized tumor thrombus is present within the proximal main portal vein extending into the right and left portal system with cavernous transformation noted in the portal hilum.
CT and MRI were completed which did not show metastatic lesions and MRI did not show cerebral edema.
She was promptly started on TPN [**2146-12-16**] after left liver biopsy results were obtained.
She was started on a heparin drip [**2146-12-17**] to prevent tumor propagation.
She was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] hepatobiliary surgical service [**2146-12-17**] in preparation for triple lobectomy and portal vein thrombectomy on [**2146-12-19**].
She was taken to the operating room on [**2146-12-19**] for a right hepatic trisegmentectomy, cholecystectomy, and portal vein thrombectomy with intraoperative ultrasound.
She received a total of 8000 mL of plasmalyte, 1250 mL of albumin, 3 units of fresh frozen plasma, 16 units of packed red cells, 1 unit of cryo and made 1530 mL of urine intraoperatively.
She tolerated the procedure well but due to the extensive nature of the resection she was returned to the surgical ICU post-operatively.
She received an additional 2 units of PRBC overnight on POD 0 into POD 1 and was briefly on neosynephrine to maintain her blood pressure.
On POD 1, she was off pressors, cardiovascularly stable (no additional blood products) and was extubated.
Pertinents, by system:  Neuro: After receiving intermittent fentanyl and propofol in the ICU, she was on intermittent IV dilaudid in the initial days following the operation and subsequently transitioned to oral dilaudid which she tolerated well.
Her sedation was not an issue in the latter portion of her hospitalization after dosing adjustment.
Her pain was well controlled at time of discharge on a regimen of oral dilaudid 2-4 mg Q4H prn pain which she was using approximately every six hours.
Her heart rate gradually came down on its own throughout her hospitalization without the use of beta blockers or other medications to slow the heart rate.
Her oxygen saturation dropped while working with physical therapy to the mid 80s and CXR confirmed mild to moderate bilateral atelectasis with associated pleural effusion.
The effusion was re-evaluated with another CXR on POD 9 and it was deemed of insufficient size to treat with therapeutic intervention.
She continued to improve her activity level with physical therapy and concurrently continued to improve in her respiratory status.
GI: Ms. [**Known lastname 72714**] was NPO with ice chips for comfort initially after the operation.
Calorie count for POD 9 showed 700 calories intake and 11 gms of protein but this only counted her consumption of the hospital food service meals (not including the food brought in by her family, which was documented by the nurses and more than half of her daily intake).
She was started on TPN three days prior to the operation and this was continued until POD 4 (volume reduced by a third) and discontinued on POD 5 as she was tolerating regular diet well at this point.
Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 72714**] was treated with a heparin drip preoperatively from [**12-16**] until the morning of her surgery on [**2146-12-19**].
She was initially autoanticoagulated after the surgery (INR 2.3).
The drip was restarted on POD 2 and eventually bridged to coumadin.
Her daily coumadin dosing starting on POD 4 until discharge with associated INR in parenthesis: 1.7 ( 2 ) - - > 1 .
Heparin drip was stopped on POD 9 when INR was greater than 2.
She was discharged with detailed instructions for scheduled blood draws to manage her INR and coumadin dosing.
GU: Ms. [**Known lastname 72714**] had a foley catheter which was dc'd on POD 4.
She was diuresed with furosemide 40 PO BID and intermittent doses of IV  furosemide.
She lost significant water weight during the later days of her hospitalization and weighed 63.4 kg on POD 10.
On POD 11, she was ambulating, tolerating regular diet and her pain was well controlled with PO pain medications.
