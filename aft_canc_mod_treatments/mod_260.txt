His urine output was managed with increased fluid and his continued bouts of emesis required placement of any NG tube.
Following placement of the NGT an CXR was ordered and it was found to have been placed in the right mainstem bronchus on chest x-ray, so it was removed and replaced with correct placement confirmed on chest xray.
During placement of the NGT and the vomiting episodes, the patient had episodes of desaturation that improved with supplemental oxygen.
Because of his recurrent emesis, a general surgery consult was called for a possible small bowel obstruction, but their reccomendations were to continue conservative managment (NGT, IV fluids, PPI, minimize narcotics, and consider a abdomen/pelvis CT for eval of retroperitoneal mass) of a likely post-surgical ileus.
A thoracentesis of this effusion was performed and the fluid sent to pathology.
Because his level of nutrition was suboptimal prior to his surgery as well as in the days following, a PICC line was placed and TPN started.
After a few days in the SICU, his oxygen requirement was decreased from 15L on face mask to 6L nasal cannula.
On POD 6 the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was discontinued and followup chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
