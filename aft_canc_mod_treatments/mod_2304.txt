She required BiPAP several times during her course for ventilation assistance.
Intubation was considered at several points, but was not required.
The patient was continued empirically on levo/flagyl for a presumed GI source, given diarrhea.
Her course was also notable for a fluid overload state given evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and exam, requiring agressive diuresis with lasix gtt and IV chlorothiazide.
The central line was d/c'd and the patient was started on vancomycin empirically (1 gram dosed for daily levels<15).
She was treated with 5 days of IV vancomycin and transitioned to oral therapy with Doxycycline for a further 8 days on discharge.
Her urine on [**2125-7-6**] also grew out <10,000 Enterococcus senstive to IV vanc and IV ampicillin.
Although this is not a true UTI as it is less than <10,000 and her u/a was sterile, it was decided to treat with vanc as she is a renal transplant patient.
She was treated with levofloxacin and flagyl empirically for 14 days.
This was all most likely [**2-22**] lymphangioleimeimatosis combined with fluid overload; no sign of pneumonia on CXR.
She shoudl continue aggressive pulmonary toilet to improve her lung function as much as possible.
ESRD s/p transplant with ARF - likely intrinsic process as FENa of 1.21% and  FeUrea = 47.8; no evidence of obstruction on U/S; creatinine stable at 4.0 - cont immunosuppressants for now - restrict phosphate and potassium intake - may require HD in the future, patient refusing currently; transplant renal followed during course - need to follow renal function carefully as pt may require HD in the near future .
NIDDM - initially on a HISS during her course, added NPH due to elevated BS on a HISS.
HTN - continued norvasc and metoprolol, BP well controlled .
F/E/N - The patient was placed on a diabetic, low sodium diet.
She was restricted to < 1.5L/day fluid intake, 1 gram phosphate as patient was hyperphosphatemic on admission, and 2grams of potassium daily.
