Admission Date:  [**2178-9-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-10-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2142-5-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Blue Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 43972**] is a 36-year-old male with a past medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated approximately 15 years ago with staging laparotomy, splenectomy and nodal sampling followed by x-ray radiation therapy, the subsequent diagnosis two years ago of ITP with evidence of splenosis by CT scan, which was treated with Prednisone IgG, and recently treated with Rituxan with good effect.
He presented approximately one month ago with severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis and started on coumadin after being heparinized.
2) ITP diagnosed two years ago treated with IgG and Prednisone, recently treated with Rituxan approximately one week prior to admission.
3) Portal vein thrombosis diagnosed approximately one month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid 4 mg q 4 hours, Prevacid 30 mg q day, Levoxyl 250 mcg q day, Mysoline 125 mg q d, Paxil 40 mg q day, Permax .015 mg q day, Coumadin 5 mg q day.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2178-9-26**] for emergent exploratory laparotomy.
On admission the patient was begun on a Heparin drip, IV antibiotics.
The patient was left intubated following his operation, given his bowel edema and otherwise guarded status.
Once admitted to the surgical ICU the patient was sedated on Morphine and Propofol.
Systolic blood pressure was maintained with fluid boluses and he was left intubated.
He was admitted with an NG tube, central venous access.
His coag values were followed q 6 hours and Heparin drip was begun on the patient.
Overnight in the surgical ICU from [**2178-9-26**] to [**2178-9-27**] the patient was left intubated on Morphine and Propofol drip.
His ventilator support was weaned as well.
On the patient's Heparin drip PT was found to increase at 4 a.m. to 12.0, PTT was found to be 39.9 and the patient's INR was 2.0.
Hematology/Oncology was asked to see the patient for management of his portal vein and splenic vein thrombosis and his new diagnosis of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis given his history of Hodgkin's disease and ITP.
At that time hematology/oncology service recommended continuation of the Heparin drip for anticoagulation.
It was unclear at this time why the patient developed spontaneous portal vein and splenic vein thrombosis.
It was decided at this time to start TPN on the patient to increase his Heparin to maintain a goal PTT of 55 to 70.
Heparin previously at 1400 units had only elevated his PTT to a value of 45.2.
There is concern at this time that given the patient's history of prior exposure to Heparin, his current Heparin drip, the patient might be experiencing Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
The patient spontaneously pulled his nasogastric tube which was replaced on the floor without difficulty.
Given the concern about the patient's possible platelet decline being due to Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was begun on Lepirudin on Tuesday, [**2178-9-28**] and was continued to [**2178-9-29**].
The NG tube was putting out approximately 640 cc on the 19th, 350 cc overnight from [**9-28**] to [**2178-9-29**] after the tube was replaced.
Also on [**2178-9-30**] the patient's Heparin induced thrombocytopenia came back negative and it was decided to restart his Heparin at that time.
The patient's NG tube continued to have a moderate amount of output, putting out approximately 1220 cc total overnight from [**2178-9-29**] to [**2178-9-30**].
On [**2178-9-30**] the patient's negative Heparin induced thrombocytopenia panel was felt that his platelet drop was most likely due to recurrence of his ITP and it was decided at that time to give IVIG of 1 gm/kg in a divided dose over approximately two days.
His pain control continued to be with a Dilaudid PCA.
The patient's platelet count was found to respond to this IVIG regimen increasing to a value of 53.
The patient was also restarted on his Heparin drip which was elevated to 1800 units per hour at which time was found to have a PTT of 47.9 and it was decided at this point to increase Heparin dose to [**2176**] units per hour.
His NG output was noted to be moderately decreased over the day and it was decided at that point to discontinue his Foley catheter and continue to try and get his Heparin to a therapeutic PTT value.
He was burping with NG tube clamped.
He was having low residuals from his clamped NG tube but it was at that time just replaced back to continue suction.
After replacing the tube to continuous suction approximately 200 cc of bilious fluid was obtained.
The morning of [**2178-10-3**] the patient was given a Dulcolax suppository which induced good bowel function.
The patient was showing good signs of bowel function and it was decided at that time to also start the patient on a clear liquid diet.
The patient was also started on Flagyl 500 mg tid.
The patient's central line was changed on [**2178-10-4**].
Culture of the central line tip was negative.
Following changing the patient's central line, chest x-ray was obtained.
Following the patient's procedure, central line was changed.
The patient's Heparin was stopped for approximately two hours.
Laboratory values after changing this line demonstrated PTT of 26.3 and the patient was restarted on his usual dose of Coumadin.
At this time the patient was started on his home medications of Paxil and Permax.
On the evening of [**2178-10-5**] it was also decided to begin patient back on his dose of Coumadin for consideration of long-term anticoagulation.
The patient was given a dose of 7.5 mg of Coumadin this evening.
He was tolerating a solid diet and it was decided at this time to discharge the patient home on Lovenox and Coumadin with follow-up until his Coumadin is therapeutic.
The patient is to continue taking his Lovenox.
On [**2178-10-6**] the patient's staples were taken out and the plan was discussed with Hematology Oncology for long-term anticoagulation in this otherwise complex patient.
He was tolerating full liquid diet, his pain control is with oral pain medications, he is therapeutic on a Heparin drip with a PTT value of 84 this morning.
From a GI standpoint the patient is status post exploratory laparotomy with resection of 50 cm of mid to distal ileum for mesenteric ischemia, most likely induced by venous congestion.
The patient was to follow-up with his regular hematology oncologist as an outpatient for consideration of Rituxan treatment.
It was decided that the patient will need long-term anticoagulation given his history of a portal venous splenic vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
This will be accomplished with Coumadin as per the hematology oncology service who has been in touch with his regular hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
The patient is to be discharged on a dose of 1 mg/kg, approximately 120 mg of Lovenox q 12 hours to be injected subcutaneously.
The patient was given his first dose of Lovenox here in the hospital.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet 5/325 mg 1-2 tabs po q 4 hours prn pain, Colace 100 mg po bid prn constipation, Lovenox 120 mg q 12 hours to be administered subcutaneously, Coumadin 5 mg q day, Protonix 40 mg q day.
Patient's home medications which he is to begin taking again include Paxil 40 mg q day, Permax .01 mg q day, Levoxyl 250 mcg q day.
