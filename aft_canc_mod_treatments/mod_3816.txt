Admission Date:  [**2144-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-2-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-3-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim / Levofloxacin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Excisional biopsy of left cervical lymph node Intubation [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16689**] Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy CVVH/Hemodialysis PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 45 yo man with h/o HIV, MRSA abscesses, and anal fistula, who presents with fever and tachycardia.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was treated for PNA with Levaquin and was diagnosed with HIV.
Given the high concern for PCP PNA despite negative induced sputums, he was started on Prednisone and Trimethoprim/Dapsone, the course of which ended on [**2144-1-14**].
He was started empirically on acyclovir to treat possible HSV/VZV hepatitis, which ended on [**2144-1-12**].
He finished his course of antibiotics, and his PICC line was pulled without complication on [**1-13**].
This morning, he woke up with a fever of 102 and then took Tylenol and went back to bed.
Past Medical History: * Facial acne vs. folliculitis * MRSA abscess on right buttocks ([**2139**]) * Anal fistula s/p fistulectomy ([**2137**]) * HIV/AIDS diagnosed on recent admission when he was treated presumptively for PCP   Social History: Occupation: teaches musical theatre at [**Location (un) 86**] Conservatory for Music.
These findings are consistent with patient's HIV positive status; however, given diffuse nature of lymphadenopathy, lymphoma should be considered and additional differential considerations and opportunistic infections cannot be entirely excluded.
SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE BIOPSY [**2144-1-18**] -HIGH-GRADE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, BEST CLASSIFIED AS LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA ARISING IN A BACKGROUND OF MULTICENTRIC CASTLEMAN'S DISEASE (MCD), SEE NOTE.
Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies confirmed that he has plasmablastic lymphoma in the setting of HHV-8(+) Castleman's Disease.
His HIV(+) status predisposes him to having a more acute course of Castleman's Disease; he presented with multiorgan dysfunction, fevers, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia.
He was treated with 1 cycle of modified R-[**Hospital1 **] (steroids, Rituximab, Bortezomib, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin): [**2144-1-24**]: started Dexamethasone 20mg PO daily (decreased to 10mg PO daily) [**2144-1-31**]: Rituximab 710 mg IV (375 mg/m2) [**2144-2-8**]: Rituximab 710 mg IV (375 mg/m2) [**2144-2-10**]: Bortezomib 2.4mg IV (1.3 mg/m2) [**2144-2-13**]: Cyclophosphamide 1340 mg IV (750 mg/m2), Doxorubicin 4 mg IV (2.5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), changed from Dexamethasone to PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-14**]: Doxorubicin 4 mg IV (2.5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-15**]: no chemo [**2144-2-16**]: no chemo [**2144-2-17**]: Doxorubicin 8 mg IV (5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-18**]: Doxorubicin 8 mg IV (5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO He tolerated the chemotherapy well without significant side effects.
He was on Allopurinol and TLS labs were monitored.
There are plans to treat with full-dose chemotherapy in the future, including Etoposide, when his liver function improves more.
When he was clinically stable on the floor, he was started on Truvada/Raltegravir per ID recs (dual therapy for HBV and HIV), on [**2144-2-11**].
He was discharged on Truvada/Raltegravir as well as Dapsone for PCP prophylaxis, and he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] (I.D.)
He was started on Truvada/Raltegravir on [**2144-2-11**] when he was stable and on the floor.
He had been on Ganciclovir IV since [**2144-1-24**], but this was stopped prior to discharge.
At the time, his liver dysfunction had been attributed to Levofloxacin versus HSV/VZV hepatitis, so he had been treated with empiric IV Acyclovir.
His liver disease is improving, and when his T. bili is near 1.5 he will be a candidate for Etoposide therapy.
# Thrombocytopenia: possibly from bone marrow infiltration as well as chemotherapy.
He remained clinically stable without signs of bleeding, and he did not require any transfusions (goal plt>10).
He was put on marrow-suppressive therapy which could have caused further anemia.
Patient had nighttime fevers for two weeks prior to admission, despite treatment for PCP PNA, VZV/HSV hepatitis.
On the medicine floor, he underwent extensive infectious workup for opportunistic infection, endocarditis (negative TTE), viral infection (brief course of IVIG in the setting of suspicion for Parvo), fungal infection (briefly on Fluconazole, which was stopped in the setting of elevated T bili).
He was changed to Vancomycin/Azithromycin/Meropenem/Micafungin in addition to Primaquine/Clarithromycin/Methylprednisone for treatment of PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] had a negative BAL so PCP treatment was stopped and he was on prophylaxis only.
Also, started to treat him for HHV8 with Gancyclovir (see above).
BAL that was sent on [**1-23**] returned negative, thus PCP treatment was dc'd and atovaquone for prophylaxis was started.
Once it became clear that the patient's fevers were not of an infectious cause, all antimicrobials (except for Ganciclovir and prophylactic Dapsone) were discontinued on [**2143-1-31**].
He was started on CVVH for a few days, which helped him to remain euvolemic.
Then he was switched to Lasix for a few days.
His ventilation requirements gradually improved and he was successfully extubated on [**2144-1-31**].
He remained stable, breathing comfortably on room air with occasional nebs as needed, for the rest of his stay.
Steroids were started 5 days earlier, but his WBC had been increasing prior to this as well.
He will be started on Neupogen as an outpatient and will follow-up for count checks after discharge.
