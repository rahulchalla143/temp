Admission Date:  [**2142-5-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-5-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-1-15**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MED ONCOLO  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 59 year old male with a recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer in [**2142-1-6**], who is status post chemotherapy, who presented to the Emergency Department today with complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion, new onset of orthopnea and generalized weakness in the setting of mild bright red blood per rectum.
He reports not feeling greatly shortness of breath at that time and that the Lasix was started for radiographic findings rather than symptoms.
His dose was increased over the weekend because of this progressive shortness of breath and he was told to go to the Emergency Room on Monday if he did not improve.
He received three liters of normal saline, one unit of fresh frozen plasma, 40 mEq of potassium by mouth and 40 mEq of potassium intravenously.
He is status post Gemcitabine now undergoing Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for chemotherapy.
Hodgkin's Disease diagnosed 30 years ago, status post chest radiation therapy and splenectomy.
Prostate cancer diagnosed six years ago status post radiation therapy.
Status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies.
Accupril 5 mg p.o.
Albuterol 2 puffs every four hours as needed.
Amoxicillin two grams before dental visits.
Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day.
Cardizem 300 mg once every day.
Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg once a day.
Levoxyl 88 micrograms p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Theophylline 200 mg three times a day.
At first it was not clear given his bright red blood per rectum whether or not he should be started on anti-coagulation, however, GI was called, who advised to get an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy within the next few hours after his admission and defer any anti-coagulation until after that.
Thus, the patient underwent a colonoscopy and nothing was seen and he was then started on heparin and Coumadin until his INR became therapeutic.
At the time of his discharge, the patient's INR was therapeutic on Coumadin alone.
He was started on Levofloxacin and received a five day course.
For his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient was continued on Salmeterol inhalers, ipratropium inhalers and fluticasone inhalers.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of presumed coronary artery disease as he had had a prior positive stress test in the past and has been placed on Imdur to prevent any symptoms of chest pain.
The patient demonstrated atrial flutter and he had been on Diltiazem to help control his rate.
The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and was continued on Atorvastatin.
He was continued on his levothyroxine.
Warfarin 5 mg p.o.
Fluticasone 110 micrograms two puffs inhaled twice a day.
Levothyroxine 88 micrograms p.o.
Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o.
Ipratropium two puffs inhaled four times a day.
Diltiazem 50 mg p.o.
Phexofenadine 60 mg p.o.
Salmeterol two puffs twice a day.
Imdur 60 mg p.o.
Of note, his long-acting Cardizem was changed to a four times a day Diltiazem as his blood pressure had been on the low side and we felt that the patient should not be taking a sustained release tablet if he was feeling lightheaded; this can be also followed up by his primary care physician.
This is very important since patient had been on Levofloxacin in the hospital which can effect the level of Coumadin metabolism, thus altering the INR level.
