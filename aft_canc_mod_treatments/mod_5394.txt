He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for broadspectrum coverage of nosocomial pneumonia, and started on a sepsis protocol with aggresive IVF rehydration, transfusions and transient use of levophed.
This was felt to be secondary to his aggressive fluid resuccitation and transfusion with 5 units of RBCs here + 2 units of RBCs at the OSH + 3 units of FFP here.
He may benefit from occasional diuresis with 20-40 mg PO lasix.
His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to vancomycin, and he was started on flagyl to cover for anaerobes given his history of chronic aspiration.
He had occasional desaturations, but these resolved with aggressive chest PT and expectoration of large mucus plugs.
On the day of discharge, he was switched to vancomycin and levofloxacin for broader coverage of gram negative organisms, given his recent hospital stays.
The flagyl was discontinued as it was felt that his lack of teeth made anaerobes less likely a factor in his pneumonia.
A PICC line was placed on the day of discharge for administration of his vancomycin, but he pulled this out accidentally because he was curious how it worked.
His INR was found to be elevated to 2.1 on admission secondary to coumadin therapy for his atrial fibrillation.
He had received 2 units of pRBCs at the OSH with an improvement in his hematocrit to 20.9 on admission.
However, a lavage through his PEG tube was negative.
He will need to continue on lansoprazole 30 mg per G-tube Q12.
He was restarted on aspirin 81 mg QD and started on metoprolol which was titrated up to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], and restarted on simvastatin at 20 mg QHS.
He should be restarted on an ACE-I as an outpatient if he remains hypertensive.
Atrial Fibrillation:  He has chronic atrial fibrillation, and was on amiodarone on admission.
His INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K, and his coumadin was held secondary to his GI bleed.
He will be continued on a baby aspirin for CVA prophylaxis.
His amiodarone was discontinued because of his history of restrictive lung disease secondary to asbestos exposure and because he did not appear to have any rhythm benefit from it.
Instead, he was restarted on metoprolol, and this was titrated up to his outpatient dose of 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good rate control.
He has a PEG tube in place and was continued on his tube feeds.
He was continued on carbidopa-levodopa and requip.
Anemia - The patient has a history of myelodysplasia and chronic Vitamin B12 deficiency.
He was restarted on his outpatient dose of cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg PO QD.
Given his elevated INR, this was felt to be due to foley trauma.
He will be discharged with his foley in place, and will need a voiding trial at his [**Hospital1 1501**].
