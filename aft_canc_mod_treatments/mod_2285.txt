The patient has undergone radiation treatment for her splenomegaly several years ago.
In addition, she had a left-sided nephrectomy and breast carcinoma with a left-sided mastectomy in [**2148**].
The patient received all of her previous treatments at outside facilities.
The patient was consequently scheduled for an elective open splenectomy by the General Surgery staff.
On [**2160-10-16**], the patient underwent open splenectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The procedure was without any complications.
The estimated blood loss was approximately 600 cc, and the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the history of myeloproliferative disorder and significant splenomegaly, a surgical intervention was undertaken.
The procedure was without any complications with an estimated blood loss of approximately 600 cc.
She was originally made nothing by mouth and was adequately resuscitated with intravenous fluids.
She was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells in the operating room.
She was placed on a beta blocker and subcutaneous heparin.
She was placed on prophylactic antibiotics.
A nasogastric tube was placed.
The patient was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells as well as platelets.
She had been on Lovenox and Coumadin.
A central line was placed.
Her hematocrit was increased with several transfusions.
She was maintained on intravenous fluids.
Total parenteral nutrition was started given that the patient had been without any oral intake for several days.
The patient continued to be coagulopathic even without receiving any Coumadin or other anticoagulation products.
She was started on clear liquids, and her diet was very slowly advanced; which she tolerated well.
A successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis of the ascites was performed on [**2160-10-25**].
The patient would have several such paracentesis procedures.
The patient was consequently placed on Unasyn for empiric coverage.
The patient also had several urine cultures obtained which grew Escherichia coli as well as Corynebacterium species.
The patient was consequently restarted on Coumadin.
In addition, the Renal Service was consulted given the ascites; with the specific question of whether ascites were from a renal etiology and also the significance of proteinuria which was noted on routine urinalysis.
She was continued on Unasyn and intravenous heparin.

The patient was restarted on Hydroxyurea.
The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions.
The patient was place G-CSF (growth factor) to which she responded well, and G-CSF was discontinued several days later.

She was continued on Coumadin with a stable regimen of 2.5 mg toward the end of her hospitalization.
The staples were removed on postoperative day 18.
While the patient was on neutropenic precautions; secondary to a low white blood cell count, she was maintained on cefepime intravenously which was discontinued when the neutropenic precautions were removed.
