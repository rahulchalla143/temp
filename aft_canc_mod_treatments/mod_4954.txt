There was moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.19 cm2 (based on an assumed VO2).
He was started on ASA 325, Atorvastatin 80mg, and Metoprolol.
He was not originally started on heparin or plavix given GIB (see below) and was trasnfused 1U pRBCs to minimize cardiac demand ischemia.
After undergoing a flex sig, a cath was performed and showed "LAD disease, with ramus occluded, diseased circ, 60% RCA, and aortic valve area 1.1 without gradient".
Given the extent of his disease, the option of a CABG and valvular repair was offered.
However, cardiac surgery evaluated him and determined that he would not be a good surgical candidate and should be medically managed at this point.
His valvular disease was not significant enough to warrant mitral and aortic valve replacements, but should be monitored.
On discharge,  he will begin taking the follow medications for optimal medical management:  aspirin 325 mg daily, Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 80mg daily, metoprolol 75mg daily, and lisinopril 5mg.
However after medical treatment and diuresis, a repeat ECHO showed 2+ MR and a TEE confirmed these findings.
He required 1 U pRBCs on [**3-27**] but then stopped bleeding with stable hematocrit.
His Plavix was held on discharge and he should receive his colonoscopy before restarting this.
He will also be continued on omeprazole for gastric protection while taking ASA.
However, given his elevated white count of 21.9, which may be all or partially due to his NSTEMI and GI bleed, his Levofloxacin was continued for 5 days.
Since he has not been watched by the medical system for a while, he should be encouraged to follow-up closely, given that he is on many new medications and will new follow-up imaging to monitor his valvular function.
