Admission Date:  [**2145-6-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-5-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for hypoxia and bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation pulmonary artery catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 68 y/o male with a history of angioimmunoblastic T cell Lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy diagnosed in [**2144-9-23**] on [**6-9**] with increasing hypoxia (90% on RA), orthopnea, decreasing appetite, increasing weakness and increasing abdominal girth.
He was thought to be in decompensated CHF with pulmonary edema and ascites and underwent aggressive diuresis with no improvement in his symptoms.
On admission he was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
He was evaluated by infectious disease given his lack of improvment who recommended vancomycin for MRSA infection, bactrim for PCP pna, cefepime for GN coverage, and gatifloxacin for atypical pna.
Worsening of his rapid afib with RVR to the 140s for which he was started on diltiazem.
He underwent diagnostic paracentesis which revealed atypical cells on cytology and WBC 14,030,  RBC 38,000, with 41% Neutropil concerning for SBP.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o male with progressive pulmonary decline unresponsive to diuresis and broad spectrum antibiotics and new onset of ascites concerning for rapidly progressive metastatic lymphoma and new acute renal failure.
Intubated emergently for refractory hypoxemia on [**6-17**] w/prolonged ICU stay c/b vent-assoc MRSA PNA, periods of rapid Afib, drug rash, and diffuculty weaning off ventilator.
He was covered broadly with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, bactrim, vancomycin, and voriconazole.
Was on Vanco/CTX/Azithro/Vori x 14 days([**Date range (1) 62192**]), on Zosyn for increased fever and secretions, 7 day course ([**7-1**]- [**7-8**]).
He was continued empirically on antibiotics given his clinical decline with sepsis physiology.
He had a tracheotomy tube placed on [**7-14**] and was slowly weaned off the ventilator.
Weaning was complicated by large amount of bleeding from tracheostomy while on heparin and by large amounts of secretions leading to mucous plugging.
Heparin was d/ced [**2-24**] to bleeding from tracheostomy.
Course was further complicated by MRSA tracheobronchitis treated with Vancomycin ([**7-20**]-expected [**7-29**] to complete 10 day course).
Current respiratory treatments include Vancomycin 1gm q12hr (day [**9-1**]), Albuterol q 6hr.
He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as outlined above.
In addition he was started on pressors with neosynephrine.
Therefore vasopressin was added to his regimen.
He was also noted to have initial evidence of low-grade DIC with increasing PT/PTT, and decreasing fibrinogen and platelets.
Therefore he was started on activated protein C. His fibrinogen levels subsequently improved with stable coags and platelets.
Currently he is normotensive with BP 130's-150's/50's-80's without use of pressors - given improvement of hypotension with antibiotic treatment, likely etiology was sepsis.
Started on ceftriaxone for sbp.
He is currently with slightly distended, non-firm, non-tender abdomen, on Ciprofloxacin 400mg 1x/wk for SBP prophylaxis.
Possibly [**2-24**] to lack of sleep, infection, medications, or combination.
Haldol initially tried, but d/ced [**2-24**] to increased QTc.
Ativan 2mg was effective in assisting the patient to sleep, and patient has not had delirium since this time.
Treated with IVF, allopurinol and close monitoring of electrolytes.
He was felt to be too sick for chemotherapy during his stay.
Initially on heparin, but discontinued because of large amount of bleeding from trach site.
Restarted with TPN (5000units).
Good rate control with 0.125mg Digoxin QD, Metoprolol 7.5mg q4hr.
Attempted anticoagulation with heparin drip and coumadin.
However, had extensive bloody secretions and anticoagulation was subsequently stopped.
Plan for Coumadin once start PO.
As pt was not able to take po medications, metoprolol was d/c'd prior to discharge to rehab.
He was initially started on heparin, but this was discontinued given large amounts of bleeding from the trach site.
As a result, he was started on TPN for nutrition.
rash started after starting multiple antibiotics, biopsy performed, felt to be drug rash associated with antibiotics most likely ceftriaxone, improved on steroids.
Pt was treated with beta-blocker and ASA.
Hydralazine for afterload reduction was initiated at low doses but d/c'd before discharge since pt could not take po medications and IV hydral could not be dosed at rehab.
Pt should be started on an ACE-I once he can tolerate po's again.
# DM1 - ISS, Humalin (dose calculated out and based on carbs in tube feeds) and glargine (calculated based on basal metabolic rate).
Currently pt is receiving insulin in TPN.
Once this is stopped and he is able to eat he should be restarted on glargine approximately 18 units.
-No antifungal treatment for now.
# ppx - heparin stopped because of bloody secretions - restarted in TPN.
