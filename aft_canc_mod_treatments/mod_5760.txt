He was treated with steroids, nebs and weaned from non-invasive prior to transfer to floor.
Pt was continued on steroid taper and was initially improving.
He was started on a course of Vanc/Zosyn (day 1 was [**2139-1-11**] of a planned 8 day course).
Pt was being treated with augmentin for a UTI and received a dose of gentamycin prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
Given his hx of MDR organisms, he was treated with zosyn for a 10 day course.
Pt was transfused by slowly drifting hematocrit and will need close f/u with urology (1 unit PRBC on [**1-2**] and 1 unit PRBC on [**1-8**]).
Pt was started on Vanco 125mg QID while on broad spectrum abx with plan to taper after completed of course for HAP.

Creatine did increase from 1.5 ([**1-12**]) to 1.9 ([**1-13**]) without a change in hemodynamics and without a change in volume status (euvolemic on exam), this will need to be rechecked.
His Cr was 1.9 on discharge (which is within his baseline of 1.5-2.0), PLEASE RECHECK CREATININE ON THURSDAY [**2139-1-15**]- if increasing please discontinue lasix and dose based on weight prn gain > 3 pounds.
