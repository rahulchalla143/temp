She has had a jejunostomy tube in place.
She has had some progressive nausea and now vomiting with dilatation of the bowel proximal to the jejunostomy site.
The patient has not responded to conservative treatment, and therefore operation was advised and accepted by the patient.
Originally, we thought that a  laparoscopic revision of the jejunostomy would be feasible.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Hyperlipidemia COPD Esophageal Cancer s/p minimally invasive esophagectomy Breast Cancer s/p Right mastectomy   Social History: She has been a nonsmoker for the past year, having started at the age of 14 and smoked up to one pack per day.

The duodenum is fluid filled and dilated measuring up to 4.8 cm with abrupt caliber change at the anterior abdominal wall (series 2A, image 47), worrisome for an obstruction.
The vagina contains soft tissue material which is of uncertain etiology.
Direct visualization is recommended as a fistulous connection to the adjacent bowel is not entirely excluded.
The distal neoesophagus and duodenum are fluid filled and dilated with abrupt caliber change at the anterior abdominal wall proximal to the jejunostomy, worrisome for obstruction.
Soft tissue material within the vaginal canal, which is of uncertain significance.
There are post-surgical clips noted in place.
There is a nasogastric tube with its tip overlying the gastric shadow.
She was status post esophagogastrectomy with J tube placement for adenocarcinoma and was admitted with question of bowel obstruction after experiencing nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
She was made NPO and given morphine for pain control as well as anti-emetics for nausea/vomiting.
An NG tube was placed for gastrointestinal decompression, which was later removed.
A urinalysis specimen came back positive for UTI and she was treated with a three day course of Ciprofloxacin.
Gynecology was consulted after pelvic matter was seen in the vaginal on CT. She declined an exam in the hospital and it was felt that outpatient follow up with her regular gynecologist would be appropriate to further evaluate the bleeding and pelvic matter on imaging.
For nutrition, tube feed were provided through her J tube, however, she continued to experience intermittent nausea and vomiting throughout the early days of her hospital stay.
IV fluids were provided for hydration.
Potassium and magnesium were provided for correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia respectively.
After her nausea and vomiting failed to improve, the decision was made to return to the operating room on [**2154-7-5**] for small bowel resection and J tube revision.
Her J tube was involved by tumor; the affected portion of the jejunum was resected and a new J tube insertion site was created.
Atrial fibrillation: HOD 8 ([**2154-7-5**]) Prior to going to the OR the patient developed a-fib with RVR [**12-29**] her afternoon dose of Lopressor was held.
The pt was converted to NSR with Lopressor 10mg IVP.
The pt went to OR for laparoscopy converted to laparotomy, small-bowelresection, and jejunostomy.
Pt tolerated the operation well, but developed a-fib with rapid ventricular response.
Loressor was used with success for a few hours, but the patient continued to convert to a-fib and dropped her SBP to 90s (MAP 50s).
An amiodarone drip was started and the patient was transferred to the ICU where she did well for the next few days.
She continued to have further episodes of nausea and vomiting after transfer back to the floor and the NG tube was replaced again.
Reglan was tried to promote gastric motility and Pantoprazole was provided for stomach acid reduction without any symptomatic improvement.
Nystatin was provided for oral candidiasis.
Tube feeds were restarted to the new J tube.
NG clamp trials were attempted in an effort to remove the NG, but she always had substantial residual volumes and felt more comfortable with the NG tube in place for decompression since she quickly became nauseated without it.
On [**2154-7-16**] after home hospice had been arranged, she was discharged to home with a plan for further palliative and comfort care per hospice.
