Name:  [**Known lastname 12453**],[**Known firstname **]                 Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 12454**]  Admission Date:  [**2134-6-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-7-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-1-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: acetaminophen / Codeine / Erythromycin Base / Methadone / morphine / propoxyphene / Penicillins / Meperidine / macrolides / ketolides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5448**] Addendum: #Coag.
Patient was started on IV Vanc through her PICC line.
Patient was discharged with the PICC line with intention to complete a 14 day course of IV vancomycin, last day being [**2134-7-15**].
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old woman with past medical history of etoh abuse, primary hyperparathyroidism s/p left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection in [**2127**], AF and sCHF p/w hypercalcemia, [**Last Name (un) **], elevated troponin, ruled out for ACS with hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
Improved with IV fluids and lasix.
she has a known baseline of hypercalcemia between [**10-19**].
She was treated with calcitonin, cinacalcet, brief course of hydrocortisone (100 mg q8h) as well as aggressive IVF balanced with lasix (for volume).
She was placed on a low calcium diet.
Her previous left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection operative reports and surgical pathology from [**Hospital3 3287**] were reviewed among her inpatient and outpatient endocrinologists, surgery, and radiology.
The decision was made to pursue  an exploratory surgery for resection of the neck tumor on [**2134-6-30**]  rather than FNA alone, for concern of possible seeding if it were to be a malignant tumor and the ultimate goal of treatment.
A decision was made to stop her cinacalcet given her calcium normalization and to monitor her calcium daily at rehab.
Her calcium values will be faxed to her  Endocrinologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was subsequently re-intubated and started on dopamine drip.
A Central venous line was therefore placed.
Hypotension was unlikely acute coronary syndrome with troponin downtrending since admission.
This could have been exacerbated in the setting of intubation and initiation of propofol.
She received large volume IVF for treatment of hypercalcemia with frequent dosing of Lasix.
However, her lasix was held on the day of the CT neck/torso for renal protection given the contrast load, and the rate of the fluid was decreased slightly to avoid acute exacerbation.
The  patient was diuresed with IV Lasix.
She was restarted on 40 mg PO Lasix and 6.25 mg PO carvedilol, but her blood pressure dropped to the 80's, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
These medications were held on discharge, but can be restarted as needed.
# Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease.
It improved while she was on treatment for hypercalcium, likely due to improved forward flow.
Lasix was held on the day of her CT neck/torso given contrast dye being a nephrotoxin.
Patient was started on IV Vanc through her PICC line.
Patient was discharged with the PICC line with intention to complete a 14 day course of IV vancomycin, last day being [**2134-7-15**].
She has not taken warfarin for about 1 month prior to admission.
She was started on ASA instead.
Pt was restarted on coumadin post-operatively and will need follow up.
Carbamazepine was initially held given underlying AMS, but it was restarted as her confusion was resolving.
Her home medications were held.
She was placed on insulin sliding scale.
She is discharged on her home anti-diabetic agents except for metformin given her kidney disease and Cr 1.5 on discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -daily Ca and PTH for 5 days after discharge -fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 **] -follow up with surgery as directed -Full code -Coumadin restarted -> continued INR monitoring as outpt -home carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID and furosemide 40 mg PO daily were discontinued due to borderline blood pressure (SBP 80's-90's) after aggressive diuresis, may need to restart   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 1726**] Bay Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 3983**]                               [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5451**] MD [**MD Number(2) 5452**]  Completed by:[**2134-7-11**
