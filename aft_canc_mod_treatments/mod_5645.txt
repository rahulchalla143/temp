Pt was initially on pressors for a prolonged period of time, then was eventually weaned off of them.
Pt was still requiring vasopressin especially with dialysis sessions.
Pt was emperically treated with 14 day course of vanc as well as an 8 day course of Meropenem for pneumonia and question of a line infection.
Pt was also started on Midodrine as well as Fludricortisone for further BP support.
The fludricotisone was stopped as she was continuing to retain fluid.
Currently, pt is normotensive, off all pressors but still taking midodrine TID.
# ESRD: Pt is on hemodialysis as an outpt, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].
Pt was also on CVVH at times to get fluid off as pt was often fluid overloaded.
Pt's tunneled HD line was removed though low suspicion of a line infection.
A temporary HD line was placed, and a few days later that was removed and a new HD tunneled line was placed.
They recommended to consider giving albumin if hypotensive during dialysis for BP support.
Tube feeds may have been contributing.
The symptoms are gradually improving with addition of banana flakes in tube feeds, per Nutrition.
She is sensitive to constipation medications and one dose of senna seemed to have given her diarrhea.
Pt was also receiving Zyprexa PRN, which was then discontinued due to concern that it may be adversly affecting her mental status.
[**Female First Name (un) 1634**] was consulted to help manage pain control and delerium.
We put her on standing acetaminophen.
We decided to continue her oxycodone on an as needed basis for now.
Of note, on her home meds, lyrica and her temazepam were stopped to see if her mental status would improve.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt had elevated sugars, especially in the setting of steroids for her hypotension.
Pt was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
Pt was also started on NPH 12 units qAM, 10units qHS but was weaned down to no standing long acting insulin.
She is now just on a regular insulin sliding scale.
# Nutrition: An NGT was placed and tube feeds were started to give pt nutrition during this long ICU course.
As pt's mental status continues to improve, speech and swallow is evaluating pt, however, most recently recommeded that pt remain NPO for now.
# Atrial fibrillation/Tachy/Brady syndrome: Pt was supratherapeutic on Coumadin intially.
Couamdin was held.
INR trended down appropriatly and Coumadin was restarted.
# Metastatic breast carcinoma: Pt is s/p palliative radiation to hip, is followed by an oncologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] but currently off treatment due to GI intolerance.
She also has a rib met seen on CT chest.
Her pain regimen is with oxycodone as above.

During your initial presentation, you required intubation and special medications to keep your blood pressure up.
We changed your lines to help facilitate improvement of your line infection.
You were getting dialysis while here because of your renal disease.
We tried oral medications to help you.
We will keep you on midodrine for this reason.
Dialysis will continue to try to keep getting excess fluid off as your blood pressure tolerates.
This is likely related to ICU delerium and all the medications you had that have sedating side effects.
We are trying to find a balance between pain control and confusion, and have you on oxycodone for now.
Other problems included diarrhea, which was likely related to antibiotics and the tube feeds.
You need to continue the tube feeds until your swallowing improves.
Your platelets were also low, likely from the acute illness.
We had stopped your tempazepam and lyrica because you were too sleepy at times.
The changes to your medications at this time are: - stopped lyrica and tempazepam - stopped wellbutrin - stopped atorvastatin (because of your liver) - stopped protonix (because of your platelets) - changed coumadin from 2 mg to 1.5 mg (your inr was 2.0 on discharge) - started insulin for high blood sugars - started midodrine for low blood pressures   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your rehab doctors.
