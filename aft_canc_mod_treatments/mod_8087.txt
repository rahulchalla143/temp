Endotracheal tube with its tip less than 1 cm from the level of the carina, suggest repositioning.
Despite pre-EGD erythromycin and multiple attempts at suctioning the clot, fundus could not be completely visualized.
KUB There has been placement of a large caliber tube in the stomach with a balloon in the region of the body of the stomach.
CXR: The tip of the endotracheal tube has been pulled back and the tip is now 3 cm above the carina.
There is again seen a left-sided PICC line with its lead tip in the proximal SVC perpendicular to SVC wall.
Brief Hospital Course: 71yo male with hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented with acute variceal bleed initially requiring intubation and [**Last Name (un) **] placement that has since resolved.
# Variceal bleed:  Presented with hematemesis and initial EGD was without a clear lesion for intervention but suspected to be a variceal bleed.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube was placed and subsequently removed once patient stabilized.
Patient was started on pantoprazole and octreotide drips.
Pantoprazole was changed to IV BID and octreotide was continued for 72 hours.
He also completed a course of ceftriaxone for 5 days.
Nadolol, oral proton-pump inhibitor, and sucralafate were started for prophylaxis and treatment of his recent bleed.
He was insufflated with quite a bit of air during his endoscopy with rising bladder pressures, relieved by placement of rectal tube and decompression of abdominal gas.
Repeat CT was performed which showed no signs of perforation so patient was empirically started on fluconazole for a total of seven days and zosyn for 48 hours.
Despite low suspicion for infection, he will continue fluconazole for a seven day course.
He was started on oxycodone for his discomfort.
Once variceal bleed stabilized, patient was started on nadolol for prophylaxis.
Given no history of encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ciprofloxacin, lactulose and rifaxamin were not initiated at this time.
Patient will require further imaging with MRI/MRCP and discussion of possible treatment of his likely hepatocellular carcinoma  # s/p intubation: Patient intubated at outside hospital for airway protection in the setting of GI bleed.
When HCTs stabilized, sedation was stopped and the patient was successfully extubated.
# Hypertension: He was transitioned to nadolol and his blood pressures remained well-controlled.
His amlodipine was held at discharge as he was normotensive.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Further workup and management of his hepatocellular carcinoma will need to occur in [**Location (un) **] - Consider initiating diuretics if required for volume overload/blood pressure control - Fluconazole course will end on [**6-20**] and sucralafate will end on [**6-25**] - The hepatology attending on service was [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD whose telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111934**] and address is [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]  Medications on Admission: - amlodipine 10mg daily - atenolol 100mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

You had a breathing tube placed to protect your lungs as we controlled the bleeding.
You will need to discuss further treatment for your possible liver cancer as well as repeat endoscopy to evaluate the the blood vessels in your GI tract.
