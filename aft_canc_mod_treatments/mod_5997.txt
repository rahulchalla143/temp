Endotracheal tube in appropriate location.
EEG [**2141-10-26**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study due to paroxysmal and, at times, periodic epileptiform discharges in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta activity suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
Evolution of the bilateral parietal infarction, with associated vasogenic edema, producing effacement of the sulci on the right parietal lobe as described above, there is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4027**] is a 58 year old male with past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by gastric varices, encephalopathy and recurrent GI bleeding admitted for concern for variceal bleeding after biopsy of mass at the gastroesophageal (GE)junction, found to have R MCA and PCA territoty infarcts once awakened from sedation.
The patient was initially on pantoprazole and octreotide drips.
After the endoscopy, the octreotide drip was discontinued, and the patient was switched to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
He was also started on ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.
Hepatology followed the patient and on [**10-27**] felt that ASA 81mg was ok to give, which was started for secondary stroke prevention (see below) .
Additionally, he continued to have focal occipital seizures even after increasing antiepileptics.
However, saline was only injected at rest, as patient could not perform any maneuvers.
Social work, PT/OT, and speech and swallow were all consulted.
We started him on ASA 81mg QD on [**10-27**].
He received a CTA to see if his blood vessels were patent, which they were.
He was started on IV Keppra 2 grams [**Hospital1 **].
However, he continued to have no clinical correlate and was awake and interactive during his sublclinical seizures.
No infectious source was found, but there was a possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and the patient was empirically started on cefepime.
Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by cirrhosis and encephalopathy: Hepatology was following the patient, and he was continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **], and was started on ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
The patient was also initiated on CIWA protocol.
On transfer from the unit, the patient was not requiring any ativan for withdrawal.
PENDING RESULTS: Final EEG read [**10-27**], [**10-28**] and [**10-29**]  TRANSTIONAL CARE ISSUES Patient is Rh neg and received RH + plt.
His LFTs will need to be monitored frequently as he was just started on simvastatin on [**2141-10-30**].
In addition, his platelets will need to be monitored while he is on aspirin to ensure that they do not drop below 50.
