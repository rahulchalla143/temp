The left kidney measures 9.7 cm.
There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year old female with history of CLL, HTN, lymphedema of LE, atrial fibrillation, and HCV, who was sent in by her PCP for symptomatic bradycardia and creatinine elevation.
In brief, she had an AV pacer placed in house, with normalization of her blood pressure and renal function subsequently.
She was started on epogen for her anemia, attributed to her chronic renal insufficiency, however she may not need this in the future.
However, the patient was on amiodarone and a beta blocker, and given her renal failure on admission, she may have had impaired clearance of her BB, further contributing to her bradycardia.
Unfortunately the following morning she was becoming hypoxic from fluid overload, and her heart rate had not improved.
The patient was therefore transferred to the CCU, where she was started on a dopamine drip with little resultant increase in blood pressure or heart rate.
This refractoriness did not respond over several days, making beta blocker toxicity less likely as an etiology and indicating a likely underlying sinus node/conduction dysfunction.
A temporary pacemaker was placed, followed by a permanent pacemaker (DDI at 75 bpm).
Given her PAF, she was restarted on coumadin for anticoagulation, which she should continue for the time being.
She was restarted on her amiodarone, as well as the atenolol, both at her outpatient doses.
The patient was hypotensive even on the dopamine (although this was likely [**1-4**] inability to increase the heart rate), and was given large amounts of fluids to maintain her BP while in the CCU.
Shortly after pacer placement she began auto-diuresing (polyuric phase ATN--see below) and became quite negative (4.6L Urine output on [**4-10**]).
However, on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] she remained fluid overloaded by exam and CXR and therefore received 1 more dose of IV lasix prior to being switched over to her usual daily dose of 40 mg PO BID, which she will be discharged on.
She was continued on ASA 81 mg daily.
On transfer to the CCU, she was in frank oliguric ATN and over the next couple of days required hemodialysis once due to concerns of increasing acidosis and hypervolemia.
She continued to have satisfactory urine output on the floors, with creatinine decreasing to 1.4 on the day of discharge.
Given that her kidney has just recovered, she was sent home on half of her usual dose of lisinopril (20 mg daily) - additionally, her blood pressure was well controlled on the lower dose.
This was felt secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency, and she was therefore started on epogen by the renal team.
