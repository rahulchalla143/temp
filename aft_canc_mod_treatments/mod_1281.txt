Recently admitted for hypotension and anemia/thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions in the setting of her critical AS.
She was then transfused 1unit PRBCs and 1 bag of platelets, and given a dose of Neupogen.
She denies any chest pain, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, or dysuria.
She was given PO K 40 mEq but she vomited the pills.
No IV fluids or Abx were given.
[**Date range (3) 23460**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with c/o 2 months of facial swelling, poor appetite and 10 lbs weight loss.
Silicone Y stent placed for extrinsic compression in light of [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] respiratory symptoms.
TREATMENT HISTORY:  *  Received two doses of emergency radiation therapy on [**2189-5-15**], a dose of Cytoxan on [**2189-5-16**] and three-fifth dose of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy starting on [**2189-5-20**] that had to be aborted secondary to failure of her vascular access.
Mediastinal biopsy on [**2189-6-3**] was nondiagnostic and the Y stent was removed.
* 2nd cycle of [**Hospital1 **] (dose level 1) given on [**2189-6-8**], requiring increasing doses of Lasix to maintain her volume status.
Given her difficult access, it was decided to leave PICC in place and she continued on Lovenox twice per day.
Noted for C difficile infection and treated with Flagyl which has been switched to Vancomycin.
* Discharged on [**2189-7-2**] and saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23461**] [**Name (STitle) 3315**] from [**Company 2860**] in consultation who recommended a dose adjusted CHOP regimen given her age and other medical issues with usual dose of Rituxan.
Started on a lasix drip and underwent aggressive electrolyte and fluid management.
* Received dose adjusted CHOP on [**2189-7-18**](Cytoxan given at a dose of 400 mg per meter squared, Adriamycin 25 milligrams per meter squared, vincristine 2 mg(no dose reduction) and prednisone 60 milligrams daily for 5 days).
Cardiac catheterization done which revealed full occlusion of her RCA stent and 70-80% stenosis of her LMCA that had developed since the most recent angiogram.
No surgical intervention was performed given her high risk; continued on her aspirin.
Metoprolol has been held with low blood pressure but restarted along with aspirin.
Maintained on Oxygen and was discharged on [**2189-8-8**].
* [**2189-7-23**], admitted for her 2nd cycle of the dose adjusted RCHOP.
Chemotherapy given on [**2189-8-19**] and Rituxan on [**2189-8-20**] after her pleural effusion was again tapped and her fluid status maximized with aggressive diuresis.
Repeat upper extremity ultrasound showed resolution of upper extremity thrombus and Lovenox discontinued.

Superimposed PNA cannot be excluded, but seems unlikely given lateral radiograph demonstrates no definite opacity.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF ?35%) with septal hypokinesis (the anterior wall and apex are not fully visualized).
Right chest tube has been inserted replacing a pigtail catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75yo F with PMH of critical AS, systolic heart failure (EF 30%), complete heart block s/p pacemaker, hypothyroidism, aggressive B cell lymphoma s/p multiple rounds of reduced CHOP and many admissions over the past few months for dyspnea and decompensated heart failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation for chemotherapy and transfusions, who presented with [**Known lastname 9140**] dyspnea on exertion.
She had bilateral chest tubes placed and developed [**Known lastname 9140**] hypoxia following this, likely due to reexpansion pulmonary edema and required transfer to the ICU.
She was diuresing well out of her chest tubes prior to them becoming kinked and they were pulled on [**9-2**].
Given her tenous balance between renal perfusion and her respiratory status, and difficulty diruesing her and her known preload dependence from her critical AS, discussion was had with her heme-onc providers about whether she was tolerating the chemotherapy.
It was clear that she was not tolerating her chemotherapy sessions, as they required large volumes of fluids to prevent renal toxicity and other complications, and it was unclear if there was significant improvement in her disease.
Prior to discharge she had a right sided pleurex chest tube placed for palliative diuresis of her reaccumulating pleural effusion.

You had chest tubes placed, and after developing more difficluty breathing you were monitored in the ICU.
We treated you with medications to help remove the fluid, and your breathing improved.
You also received morphine, which helped treat your shortness of breath.
We also spoke with your cardiologist, and your aortic stenosis cannot be fixed surgically.
Therefore, we switched our focus of our treatment on managing your symptoms.
Do not manipulate catheter in any way.
Keep a daily log of Drainage amount and color.
You may shower with an occlusive dressing 7.
If the drainage is less than 50cc for three consecutive drainages please call the office for further instructions.
Pleurex catheter sutures to be removed when seen in clinic [**10-4**] days post PleurX placement.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 23463**] clinic on Wednesday for suture removal in 2 weeks.
