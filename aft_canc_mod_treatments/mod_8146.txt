The procedure was performed for diagnostic purposes at the operating room.
The bronchoscope was introduced orally and advanced under direct visualization until the tracheobronchial tree was reached.The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
other findings: Rigid intubation was performed with a black rigid bronchoscope.
The old ET tube was in good position.
The old ET tube was backed out under direct vision.
Therapeutic aspiration was performed.
A new portex perfit non fenestrated size 8 tracheostomy tube was inserted and the correct position confirmed with direct visualization with bronchoscope.
The new tracheostomy tube was sutured in placed and the strap applied.

Per [**Name (NI) 9168**], pt was saturating 97% en route to [**Hospital1 18**] and was placed on Ambubag upon transfer to the unit.
Upon arrival to MICU, put on CMV450x16 and sedated with fentanyl and propofol drips.
P:F ratio did improve to 160 while on vent along with reassuring ABGs showing improved ventilation and oxygenation.
Pt was transitioned from propofol to Midaz drip and remained stable.
We continued gentamicin drops to ostomy site.
Tracheostomy tube replaced with improvement in minute ventilation.
She was transitioned to pressure support for ventilation however acheived low tidal volumes so was placed back on CMV mode.
She has required minimal sedation on fentanyl and midazolam boluses.
She was on lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, which replaced omeprazole given use of NG tube for medications.
#Leukocytosis: Was on Linezolid and tobramycin previously at St. [**Hospital 15000**] hospital but unclear course.
Initial WBC in unit at 17.7, but afebrile, and hemodynamically stable.
She was noted to have 12% eosinophils on her CBC/diff on admission, which could be consistent with an allergic reaction given recent use of antibiotics and other new medications or could be paraneoplastic in setting of known multiple myeloma.
Wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] who recommended saline irrigation, pat dry with gauze, apply wound gel and Mepilex foam dressing.
#HTN: Pre-admission medications included verapamil and metoprolol.
Pt's SBP in 170s on arrival and thus continued home medications which brought down SBP to 150s.
PRN hydralazine 10mg q6h PRN for SBP>160 was added when patient trialed on PSV ventilation which transiently brought down pressures.
Labetolol 5mg IV was also given for SBPs persistently in 160-170.
IV Lasix was given after bronchoscopy which helped control pressures.
Patient was given IV Lasix once after bronchoscopy procedure to help alleviate peripheral edema.
#History of ARF: Pt was on hemodialysis at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 107**] hospital, resolved.
#Depression: sertraline was held at St. [**Doctor Last Name 15000**].
She had been on linezolid which can cause serotonin syndrome with sertraline, and thus continued to hold sertraline while at [**Hospital1 18**].
Olanzapine, scheduled, was on active pre-admission medication list, and this was changed to PRN agitation.
Lorazepam was held as well due to sedation, as patient was on fentanyl and midazolam drips during admission.
Transitioned to bolus sedation with fentanyl and midazolam on discharge.
#Nutrition: Patient was restarted on original tube feeding regimen (glucerna) at St. [**Doctor Last Name 15000**] after bronchoscopy completed.
#hypokalemia: patient's K was 2.8 on day of discharge, received PO and IV replacement on discharge but should be rechecked on arrival to St. [**Hospital 15000**] Hospital.
# elevated blood sugar: patient was on detemir insulin at St. [**Hospital 15000**] hospital, however during admission here tube feeds were held and patient was found to be hypoglycemic.
Long-acting insulin was discontinued and patient was kept on sliding scale insulin with fingersticks 88-200 during admission.
She may require long acting insulin again when tube feeds on consistently.
Transitional issues: - continued tracheostomy care and ventilator support - may benefit from further diuresis with IV lasix - consider increasing anti-hypertensive regimen if blood pressures continue to remain elevated - wound care of sacral decubitus ulcer  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital from St. [**Hospital 15000**] Hospital because your tracheostomy was not functioning well and there were concering findings on the CT scan of the lungs.
Our interventional pulmonary team did a rigid bronchoscopy to look at the airways and determined there were no structural problems in your airways, but that the tracheostomy tube was out of place.
The tube was replaced and your breathing improved.
Changes to medications: STOP taking sertraline STOP taking lorazepam STOP taking detemir insulin STOP taking omeprazole  START taking lansoprazole START using fentanyl and midazolam boluses for sedation  Followup Instructions: You are being transferred to St. [**Hospital 15000**] hospital for continued medical care.
