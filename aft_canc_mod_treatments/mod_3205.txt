Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 40 year-old man with a history of C5-quadriplegia following a motorcycle accident at age 17 and a recent episode of ESBL UTI/urosepsis who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension concerning for pneumonia or urosepsis.
# UROSEPSIS/UTI: The patient was admitted to the ICU were he was treated with meropenem, levophed, and IV fluid resuscitation for preseumed septic shock.
He was gradually weaned off of levophed and maintained normal pressures on his own.
He received two doses of furosemide, but subsequently auto-diuresed himself.
He was continued on meropenem for a 9 day course, discontinued on day 9 because of an episode of pancytopenia (WBC 1.6; Hct 22.5; Plt 34), thought to be due to drug toxicity.
Throughout this process, there was concern that the sepsis may also have been due to a pneumonia because the patient was highly congested and demonstrated bilateral opacities on chest radiograph.
The patient has had recurrent UTIs and given his anatomy it is difficult to identify these early.
He also is hypothermic at baseline with low WBC count due to his MDS.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was intubated given a combined metabolic/respiratory acidosis and concern for mental status changes.
With chest physical therapy he was easily weaned off of the O2.
Typically in the mornings, patient would desat to mid 80s if he had not received chest PT overnight.
His oxygen requirement (typically 2-3 L during these acute episodes) would resolve after chest PT and active suctioning of his secretions.
He also is at risk for pneumonia given his ventilator use and hospital stay.
he is hypothermic at baseline with temperature around 94 and his white count is typically low, around [**12-29**].
#ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient's baseline creatinine was known to be 1.1, but was measured to be 2.2 at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
As mentioned above, he was given IVF fluids during sepsis treatment that put him in a fluid excess of 12 L. He was then given two doses of furosemide and subsequently auto-diuresed the majority of this fluid out.
This was felt to be due to shock liver, and with fluid resuscitation these values continuously trended downward throughout his hospital stay.
Following discontinuation, his blood counts returned to their respective baselines as mentioned above.
# S/P APPENDICOVESICOSTOMY/ACE-[**Location (un) **]: The patient underwent urinary catheterization four times daily through the appendicovesicostomy.
He also underwent his normal bowel program q3x/wkly with senna, docusate sodium and subsequent catheter saline flush.
Throughout, he was continued on his home regimen of levetiracetam and phenytoin.
# DEPRESSION: The patient has a mood disorder that is treated with sertraline at home.
# FEN: While in the hospital, the patient was given IV fluids for resuscitation in the ICU.
He then received two doses of furosemide and then auto-diuresed himself.

You were treated with antibiotics, fluid rehydration, and blood pressure support.
You were also treated for a pneumonia.
Your condition improved and you were transferred to the floor, where you continued antibiotics until you finished your course of treatment.
You had some episodes of when your blood oxygen levels dropped low which were related to poor clearance of your secretions in your lungs.
You will need to continue frequent chest physical therapy (every 4 hours) as well as use of the cough assist device/insuflator/exsuflator, suction, and your mucinex in order to clear these secretions.
Please continue taking your medications as you were previously.
