HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 62385**] was admitted to begin high-dose IL-2 therapy.
He underwent central line placement to begin therapy.
Given his history of borderline pulmonary function tests, radiation to the lung, and tuberculosis history we reduced his intravenous fluid rate and planned to limit fluid boluses secondary to concern regarding pulmonary toxicity.
Over the first several days he had the usual IL-2 side effects including fever, chills, nausea and diarrhea; improved with supportive medications.
However, on treatment day #4 he developed hypotension and was treated with slight increase in intravenous fluids as well as a fluid bolus x1.
He required the addition of dopamine to a maximum of 6 mcg/kg/min as well as Neo-Synephrine up to 3.5 mcg/kg/min to support his blood pressure.
He continued to require vasopressors and was changed from Neo-Synephrine and dopamine to Levophed.
He was weaned off pressors over the next 2 days.
He remained intubated and sedated.
On [**2152-5-28**] he developed a fever; and vancomycin was added with cultures negative.
His tuberculosis medications were initially held due to transaminitis and were restarted with normalization of his liver function tests.
On [**2152-5-31**] he was transferred back to the floor to continue rehab in order to be discharged to home.
He was initially maintained on vancomycin and Zosyn, and later changed to levofloxacin when sputum culture grew Enterobacter with appropriate sensitivities.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Ativan 1 mg q.4-6h.
nausea/vomiting, Benadryl 25 to 50 mg q.6h.

daily, levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
He will not be returning for week 2 of IL-2 therapy given significant toxicity.
