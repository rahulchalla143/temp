He was taken by EMS to the ER at which point his O2 sat was 88% and he was placed on a NRB.
Upon arrival to the ED his vitals were T 98.9, HR 67, BP 116/62, RR 20, O2 sat 96% on NRB, and while there failed a trial on nasal cannula and placed on 70% cool mist mask.
He received 3L of IVFs as well as Levoflox 750mg IV x 1 and Flagyl 500mg IV x 1.
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI Brain and C-spine +/- gadolinium to eval for mets once respiratory status stabilized (not emergent) as well as EEG.
Past Medical History: Lung cancer- s/p radiation Neck Cancer- newly diagnosed/awaiting biopsy, pt has severe dysarthria x1month as a result.
Suggest having a discussion with the pt regarding his options for nutrition (POs alone vs POs with supplemental tube feeds vs tube feeds only).
Pt will need to understand the risks of continued aspiration prior to making his decision.
If he decides to continue with PO intake, I would recommend a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and pureed solids with the following aspiration precautions: a) alternate between every bite and sip b) small, single sips of liquid only -no straws and no chugging c) pills crushed with purees .
In the ICU, his hypoxia resolved and he was transitioned from NRB to NC.
The patient decided that he would like further treatment and rehabilitation and would consider hospice in the future.
After being made [**Name (NI) 3225**], he received morphine for pain and air hunger.
On [**11-28**], morphine was discontinued per the brother's request.
Overnight on [**10-29**], the patient was agitated, moaning and tachypnic per nursing report and was given 1 dose of Morphine 2mg IV at 3:30 am.
The causes of his hypercarbia were felt to be irreversible - advance lung CA-, and he was changed to comfort measures only.
The reason for his fall is likely multifactorial with PNA, gait instability, vasovagal episode?, arrhythmia?, deconditioning and possible dehydration.
He was given IVF to resolve dehydration and antibiotics for likely PNA.
He responded well to Zyprexa or Risperdal during episodes of agitation.
Given, the lack of intracranial mets, he was kept on heparin for PE.
He was also started on coumadin originally but this was stopped when he had an episode of GIB.
He may be switched to lovenox when consistently without GIB.
He was also given albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN, but did not require them.
His was treated for PNA with Unasyn.
He was weaned off the oxygen.
Given the low suspicion for endocarditis, echo was not pursued further.
As the patient was already on heparin for PE, and this was continued.
Neurology would recommend ASA if heparin is changed to lovenox.
The patient also received a speech and swallow evaluation which showed significant dysphagia and aspiration.
However, given his prognosis, the patient elected to continue with oral intake (thickened fluids and pureed solids) knowing the risks of aspiration and pneumonia.
# GI Bleeding: Several days after the patient was started on heparin for PE, he had a bowel movement with bright red blood on the exterior, no melena.
He was continued on heparin but coumadin was stopped in order be able to stop anticoagulation if GI bleed became more significant.
In the ED he was given Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl for PNA but this was changed to Unasyn given likelihood of aspiration of gram positive oral anaerobes with his mouth cancer.
# CK elevations: On admission, his CK was elevated (peak 1391), with Troponin 0.02 making AMI unlikely.
He never had any electrolyte abnormalities or myoglobin in his urine.
He was given fluids and his CK's trended down.
