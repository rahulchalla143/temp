The patient patient had been experiencing 1-2 months of pressive dyspnea and orthopnea in early [**2105**].
He was admitted for potential LE cellulitis as well as failure to thrive.
The patinet was found to have an enteroccocus UTI on admission, and was treated with a course of unasyn to cover both his urinary pathogen, as well as a potential LE cellulities.
He was intiated on both flagyl and PO vanc was started on [**2106-1-11**].
He was started on parental TPN throughout his hospitalization.
It was initially believed that his coagulopathy was secondary to malnutriion, however, his INR remained levated despite vitamin K supplementation.
Hematology was consulted, who felt that he had aquired a prothrombin inhibitor, potentially due to exposure to bovine thrombin.
The patient had several episodes of bleeding, including profound epistaxis requiring ENT packing, and a drop in his HCT from 30 to low 20s which aparently responded to several units of PRBCs.

Brief Hospital Course: 77M with a history of CAD s/p MI and recent CABG, dCHF with mod AR, CRI (Cr ~2.0) who presented to an OSH with failure to thrive, found to have a UTI, developed c.diff, unresolving coagulopathy requiring multiple transfusion, and acute pulmonary edema (sent to MICU), extubated transferred to the floor, then sent back to MICU for resp distress, worsening renal failure, finally made CMO and expired peacefully.
ultimately, the pt was not tolerating POs, was placed on TPN, but was finally made CMO in the ICU given his continual decline with his coagulopathy, CHF, respiratory distress, and renal failure.
He was seen by heme/onc and outside results showed a likely acquired factor V inhibitor as the source for his coagulopathy.
He was continued on IV flagyl for his Cdiff and cefazolin as prophylaxis while he had nasal packing in place.
His nasal packing was removed by ENT without any bleeding complications.
# Coaguloapathy - INR of 5.6 at the OSH despite vit K and FFP.
#  Diastolic CHF - Has had persisent LE edema and orthopnea since CABG surgery in [**Month (only) 116**], with escalating doses of lasix.
He required intermittent diuresis w/ IV lasix to improve his fluid overload and resp distress, while also balancing between his hypernatremia which was thought to be due to a lack of free water as well as his rising renal failure.
His home digoxin was held in the setting of renal failure.
Thoracentesis was not an option with coagulopathy.
Ultimately the pt was sent to the MICU again after being on the floor and slightly improving due to resp distress.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Had worsening of kidney function in setting of diuresis and acute disease.
# C.Diff: C-diff positive at OSH, started on IV flagyl / PO vanc on [**1-11**].
Not on coumadin given coagulopathy.
he was continued on lipitor, BB, but his ASA was held in setting of epistaxis.
# Patient was made DNR/DNI on [**1-21**] and then CMO on [**1-29**] due to rising renal failure, persistant coagulopathy, respiratory distress due to chronic CHF/fluid overload, and chronic cachexia.
