History of Present Illness:    47yo M with metastatic colon CA (mets to retroperitoneum, liver, mediastinum, supraclavicular area) with recent admission for abd pain where he was found to have cholangitis and underwent ERCP/biliary stent sphincterotomy.
At the time, he was found to have a duodenal stricture for which a duodenal stent was placed on [**2124-12-5**].
The patient presented to oncology clinic on Fri [**2124-12-8**] and was referred to ED for further evaluation.
Colon CA-pt presented as apeendiceal abscess in [**6-25**] and had percutaneous drainage of appendiceal abscess on [**2124-7-22**].
Due to poor resolution of phlegmon with antibiotics and drainage, pt was taken to OR on [**2124-8-24**] for laproscopic right colectomy which revealed a 7x4 cm ulcerating mass in the cecum the pathology of which revealed Stage IIIC adenoCA.
Pt was intially sceduled to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, but due to these findings was started on the irinotecan/5FU/LV (bolus weekly vs CI q2wks) and avastin regimen which he started on [**10-18**].
He denies EtOH, illicit drug use, remote minimal smoking hx of 1 pack/2weeks, is sexually monogomous with his partner and recently HIV tested to be negative in [**9-25**]  Family History: Father died of colon CA age 37, maternal grandmother died in 60's of breast CA, maternal grandfather died of prostate CA in 70's, no hx of MI, CVA, DM  Physical Exam: VS: T: 98.6   BP: 156/100   HR: 110   RR: 18   SaO2: 95% RA Gen: thin cachectic male with temporal wasting lying in bed holding bin for nausea.
Placement of internal and external biliary drain: 1) Partial occlusion of common bile duct stent, complete occlusion of the patient's duodenal stent distally.
2) Internal/external 8 french biliary drainage catheter placed percutaneously, through a peripheral right duct, through the stent within the common bile duct and into the duodenal stent where the pigtail was formed.
Percutatneous GB drain: Successful placement of a 6-French percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy tube  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 47yo man with stage IIIc metastatic colon CA diagnosed [**8-26**], s/p resection and course of inrinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin/avastin.
Pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 81955**] [**1-24**] cholangitis s/p sphincterotomy and repeat biliary stenting w/ metal stent placement, course c/b duodenal stricture requiring stent placement who now presents with abd pain, n/v, and evidence of cholestasis, with increased AP and t. bili as well as increased WBC count.
1) Biliary Obstruction- as there was concern for obstruction and potential cholangitis, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics to include ampicillin/gentamycin/flagyl.
IR placed a percutaneous biliary drain, and he was observed overnight in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU to monitor for any instability or signs of ensuing sepsis.
Over his ICU stay, he remained afebrile, his white count trended downward, and his cholestasis remained stable.
His pain was managed with fentanyl patch and prn morphine IV.
XRT evaluated pt during his ICU admission and felt there were no further radiation intervention would be beneficial.
Although the pt had decreased abd pain, he was still consistently having RUQ pain and his transaminases and bilirubin did not rapidly trend down.
He underwent HIDA scan which showed no flow in the gallbladder and on HD3 underwent percutaneous placement of choleostomy, w/ subsequent decrease in pain and appropriate response of liver enzymes/bilirubin.
He was discharged to home hospice w/o antibiotics, percutaneous drains in place.
SBO- in this patient with an acute onset abd pain with tightness, rebound and guarding who had recently undergone a duodenal stent placement the most likely diagnosis was SBO.
Pt was maintained w/ gastric decompression via NGT, NPO, and morphine PCA for pain control.
Arranged for home hospice to have suction available so that pt could maintain decompression via NGT (we discussed placement of g-tube w/ pt but he felt that NGT was comfortable and did not want to undergo another procedure).
Scopolamine and hyoscyamine were started on [**12-12**] to help manage secretions, and possible removal of NGT.
Rx for octreotide was also provided but drainage of NGT had been minimal and administration of requires SC injection, so we did not start the medication in house.
Metastatic colon CA: Pt was previously on irinotecan/5FU/LV and avastin regimen which he started on [**10-18**].
Due to rapid progression of disease pt was not continued on chemotherapy.
XRT was consulted and felt that no further intervention was indicated.
Discharged on dexamethasone 8mg [**Hospital1 **] TD.
Pain - pain well controlled w/ morphine PCA, which was steadily titrated up.
Fentanyl patch was removed [**1-24**] concern that pt did not have appropriate fat stores for volume of distribution.
