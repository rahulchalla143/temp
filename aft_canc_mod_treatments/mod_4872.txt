26 yo man D +278 after single cord transplant for hypoplastic MDS with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted for sepsis.
Initial MDS course was complicated by mucor infection of the tongue with prolonged ICU course for upper airway obsturuction, followed by pericoronitis as well as perirectal abcess.
Was subsequently managed with a single cord transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG conditioning.
Post transplant course c/b VRE + Coag neg staph bacteremia [**6-/2137**] (treated with dapsone); CMV viremia [**7-/2137**], c.diff infection [**10/2137**] (treated with 14 days oral vanc), admission on [**10/2137**] for low grade temperature attributed to +CMV viremia with prolonged IV ganciclovir --> oral Valgancyclovir course; last admission 10/4-6 for neutropenic fever, CT chest showed non specific minimal peribronchial ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe, treated with course of levofloxacine; Saw ID [**12-12**] Valgancyclovir was stopped as CMV viral loads remained negative since [**10-22**], was started on valacyclovir for HSV/VZV PPx.
He also continues oral Posiconazole for mucor and monthly pentamidine nebs for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (most recent [**12-28**]).
This has been attributed to possible BM supression by CMV and/or antiviral meds.
Finally he is thought to be at low risk for GVH and thus stopped immunosupressive meds in [**2137-9-16**] (was on tacrolimus prior).
He was treated with meropenem, azithromycin and oseltamivir.
During this visit he was in the midst of being treated for another pulm infection with moxifloxacin.
He was started on meropenem and vancomycin and started on maintenance fluids at 150cc/hr.
Past Medical History: -Hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13) - single cord transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG.

s/p excision by ENT.
- C. difficile infection [**10/2136**] - pericoronitis s/p extraction 4 teeth [**2137-1-24**] - peri-rectal abscess s/p drainage [**2137-2-27**] - Hemochromatosis - Transaminitis (felt most likely multifactorial; contributions by medications and hemochromatosis)  Social History: -Moved from [**Country **] in [**2136**].
