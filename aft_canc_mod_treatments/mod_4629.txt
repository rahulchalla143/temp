2 sons  Family History: all 5 siblings died of some sort of cancer including "blood" cancer, breast and lung.
On Discharge: AOx3, following commands, speech intact Right upper and lower extremity weakness more pronounced: Right upper extremity [**2-21**] throughout Right lower extremity 3-4/5 throughout   Pertinent Results: [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   WBC-7.5 RBC-3.49* HGB-11.8* HCT-35.5* MCV-102* MCH-34.0* MCHC-33.4 RDW-16.8* [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   PLT COUNT-150 [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   PT-12.0 PTT-21.0* INR(PT)-1.0  MRI [**2161-6-14**]: Enhancement of dominant right posterior frontal lesion, with extensive surrounding white matter edema.
Further evaluation with ultrasound may be obtained.
The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy and resection of right frontal enhancing mass.
Intrinsic T1 hyperintensity is present within the surgical cavity, likely representing postoperative blood products and proteinaceous material.
For this she was planned to undergo resection of the mass on [**2161-6-21**], however, during the preparation for the OR, the brainlab guidance system malfunctioned and the operation was aborted.
Given the proximity of her lesion to the motor areas of the brain and her preoperative weakness, this was not an unexpected short term complication and function of the left leg and arm should improve over time.
She was able to eat and her pain was well controlled on oral medications.
She worked with physical therapy and rehab was recommended.
She is being discharged on a dexamethasone taper and will continue on dexamethasone 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] until follow-up in Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic.
As this appeared to be consistent with a macrocytic anemia (MCV ~100), she was tested for methylmalonic acid, B12 and folate which were all normal.
On [**6-26**], her PTT was elevated which was felt to be secondary to heparin flushes through her IJ.
Concerned about the formation of HIT antibodies, her heparin was stopped and she was switched to fondaparinaux for DVT prophylaxis.
On [**6-30**] heparin SC was restarted.
She is currently on a course of keflex for her scalp incision and will complete treatment on [**7-6**].

It is likely that you will need chemotherapy in the future.
At that time, your options for treatment will be discussed.
It is important that you continue to drink plenty of fluids as your kidney function appears to be consistent with mild dehydration.
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
You may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have been removed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
Please call if you need to change your appointment, or require additional directions.
