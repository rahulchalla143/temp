Dorsalis pedis was felt on Lt side, couldn't be felt on Rt side.
Evidence for volume overload, including anasarca and bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M, with recent bladder mass & renal cyst, hypertension, scrotal bilateral swelling, SOB on exertion and new hemoptysis presented with swollen painful Rt thigh and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
He was started on heparin infusion since his Cr on admission was 2.8 with baseline of 1.2-1.5 per OSH records from [**Hospital1 2177**].
Heparin infusion was discontinued prior to thoracocentesis [**2137-2-18**] by 6 hours and restarted after the procedure by 1 hr.
Also, Heparin was discontinued prior to cystoscopy [**2137-2-19**] by 6 hours and restarted after the procedure by about 12 hr.
He was transferred to the Medical ICU, where he received total of 3 units of PRBC (had a few episodes of coffee ground vomitus) and Heparin drip was held.
IVC filter was fixed without using contrast on [**2137-2-27**] with the aim to discontinue his heparin infusion, since his urine wasn't clearing of blood following cystoscopy despite continuous bladder irrigation.
# HYPOXIA: Most likely was due to PE given his DVT and possible hypercoag state due to bladder cancer.Another conern was that the Rt pleural effusion that could be causing compression atelectasis.
Had been off heparin drip for nearly 24 hours the day before for cystoscopy, which could have allowed PE to progress or for second PE to occur.
Heparin drip was empirically restarted but was held due to coffee ground emesis in the ICU, then restarted and transferred back to medical floor after he became stable.
IVC filter was fixed in an attempt to stop heparin infusion, with the aim to remove the foley.
Palliative chemotherapy was limited due to his poor kidney function.
Intra-operatively (cystoscopy [**2137-2-19**]) retrograde pyelogram was done which didn't reveal [**Last Name (un) **].
Baseline Cr 1.2-1.5 per OSH records from [**Hospital1 2177**].
After gradual improvement, his kidney function deteriorated further after IVC filter was placed though contrast was not used.
# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA: Hematuria due to bladder cancer, cystoscopy and biopsy, and was on heparin drip.
# comfort measures: on [**2137-2-28**], pt and HCP decided for comfort measures only after having extensive family meeting.
