Given the patient's overall condition (with severe COPD, pneumonia/probable aspiration pneumonitis), he was not considered to be a surgical candidate--this was discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting involving medicine, neurosurgery and neuro-oncology.
The patient has tolerated the first two sessions of whole brain irradiation well.
He is scheduled to receive a total of 10 radiation treatments at [**Hospital 61**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center.
The patient was treated supportively for the brain mass with high dose steroids (dexamethasone 4 mg PO Q6H) and phenytoin (100 TID, with dose adjusted per level; goal level [**10-18**]).
He will need to stay on these at least until his radiation is complete, if not beyond that point.
COPD: The patient had an exacerbation of his emphysema when he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
He was treated with steroids (which were dosed for his brain mass), nebulizers, and levofloxacin--for possible RML pneumonia.
He was requiring 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula at the time of discharge.
Of note, the patient was asymptomatic during these episodes, and his saturations improved with nebulizer treatment and supplemental oxygen.
Despite this, he was put on aspiration precautions.
Given his somewhat tenuous state, the patient was given empiric antibiotic therapy (levo and flagyl) for possible aspiration pneumonia--he is on day 6 of 7 of treatment on the day of discharge.
He remained on an beta-blocker throughout his stay  H/O CAD: the patient underwent cardiac-preoperative risk stratification.
He was kept on beta-blocker; however, aspirin was held for surgery (and given his hemorrhagic brain mass) as was statin given LDL 78.
