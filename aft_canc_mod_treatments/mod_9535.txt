She has peripheral vascular disease and is status post right iliac stent for a nonhealing ulcer on the right heel.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Amaryl 1 mg po b.i.d., Maxzide, Cosopt eye drops and Lipitor.
She was placed on Integrilin drip.
She was also treated with aspirin and heparin.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2113-5-12**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three with a mitral valve repair with a 26 mm ring.
Postoperatively, the patient was on Milrinone, Amiodarone, neo-synephrine and insulin intravenous drips and was transported to the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.
The patient had some supraventricular dysrhythmias throughout the operation and was placed on Amiodarone for that reason.
The patient was reintubated on postoperative day three due to increase work of breathing and tachypnea and enteral tube feeds were initiated at that time.
On [**5-16**], postoperative day four the patient underwent a bronchoscopy for copious secretions.
She was noted to have purulent secretions and cultures of those secretions grew out Moraxella for which she was placed on Levofloxacin and has completed a ten day course of that.
The patient was started the following day on a low dose heparin drip for her stroke and basilar artery stenosis.
However, later in the day the patient was subsequently reintubated again for continued increased respiratory rate and work of breathing.
Her central line was discontinued.
She had a double lumen PICC line placed.
Her arteriole line site was changed.
She underwent a bronchoscopy again due to copious secretions and she had a percutaneous tracheostomy performed at the bedside as well as a PEG for feeding purposes.
The patient was intermittently placed on low dose neo-synephrine around the [**5-26**] for one to two days due to some mild hypotension in the one teens in attempts to keep her systolic blood pressure higher, because of her neurologic status.
The patient remains on a heparin drip and on the [**5-28**] was placed on a trach collar and taken off the ventilator.
Her Lopressor was increased due to a heart rate in the 90s.
She was begun on NPH insulin since she had been tolerating her tube feeds well at this point.
Her antibiotics were discontinued.
On the [**5-29**] the patient was noted to hve increased lethargy, decreased responsiveness and was placed back on the ventilator due to worsening work of breathing with a PACO2 of 63.
The patient was also noted on chest x-ray after being placed back on the ventilator to have a left pleural effusion.
Most recent culture data, on [**5-22**] the patient had one positive blood culture drawn from a peripheral A line for coag negative staph.
The patient's central intravenous catheter on [**5-24**] cultured negative.
The patient remains afebrile at this time with no antibiotics with a decreasing white count.
PTT this morning on 1100 units per hour of heparin was 116.
The heparin was discontinued for one hour and resumed at 900 units per hour with a subsequent PTT pending.
She remains on the ventilator in the CPAP mode at 40% FIO2 with pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5.
Her abdomen is soft, nontender with her PEG tube in place.
She has a small area of the saphenous vein harvest site in her right thigh area, which is nonhealing that is requiring Santal ointment to be placed to the area.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 5 mg per G tube q.d.
She is being anticoagulated for basilar artery stenosis per the Neurology Service.
Lasix 40 mg per G tube q.d., Protonix 40 mg per G tube q.d., Colace 100 mg per G tube b.i.d.
Cosopt eye drops to both eyes b.i.d., Lumigan 0.03% to both eyes q.h.s., aspirin 325 mg per G tube q.d., Albuterol nebulizers treatments q 4 hours and prn, Lopressor 25 mg per G tube b.i.d.
She is receiving NPH insulin 10 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
She is also on a sliding scale regular insulin.
This should also be readdressed as the patient recovers from her stroke and cardiac surgery to be determined whether she is appropriate to be placed on an anti-depressant.
Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve repair.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
