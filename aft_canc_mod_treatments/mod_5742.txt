He was taken to the endosuite on [**6-18**] where he underwent Balloon angioplasty of the posterior tibial artery, Stent placement at right common femoral artery to below-knee popliteal bypass graft x4,  AngioJet thrombectomy of right common femoral artery to below-knee popliteal bypass graft.
He tolerated the procedure well, remaining hemodynamicaly stable.
He was started on pletal 100mg [**Hospital1 **] as well.
After discussion, he agreed to take meds and have labs , however, when phelbotomy came he became aggitated and began flailing his arms during his veinapuncture.

His dilaudid pca was stopped and he was transitioned to his home regimen of ms contin 100mg q8h with ir morphine 30-60mg q2h prn.
