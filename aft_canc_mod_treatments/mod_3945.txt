[**2170-8-14**] CXR - A pacemaker overlies the left chest, with leads overlying right atrium and right ventricle.
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with aortic calcifications.
It was thought that there may also have been a component of leukocytosis contributing to her resp distress as well given her CBC showing 80% blasts.
She was also given lasix IV boluses as needed for SOB.
Although she responded to diuresis, given her refractory leukemia she remained transfusion dependent and unfortunately with transfusion would become overloaded with worsening respiratory status.
She continued to complain of SOB and she began to require morphine IV to make her breathing more comfortable.
She was continued on Nitropaste and given morphine as needed for comfort.
She had elected not to pursue any aggressive treatment up to this point.
It was explained to the patient and the family that the patient would continue to need transfusion support which would likely worsen the patient's respiratory status and make it difficult for her to return to her nursing home.
After a long discussion, the patient elected to stop getting transfusion support with goal of comfort only.
She was made CMO and was continued on IV morphine and nitropaste as needed.
When she became CMO her antibiotics were discontinued and labs were no longer checked.
