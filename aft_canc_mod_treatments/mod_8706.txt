HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman who had previously been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and had undergone chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy.
When the patient initially presented, it was with an upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2148-4-16**] which required 4 units of packed red blood cells.
After this was the time in which the patient received his chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
The patient presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy for management of his esophageal cancer.
The patient had his epidural stopped, and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He was also given aggressive fluid hydration, as his blood pressure was thought to be secondary to his volume loss.
He was treated with aggressive chest physical therapy and nebulizers treatment, but it was felt that this was likely secondary to volume overload as he was positive 7500 cc of fluid on postoperative day zero.

These issues had resolved by postoperative day seven, and the patient had been diuresing well and his atrial fibrillation was controlled with metoprolol.
He was started on a clear liquid diet.
By postoperative day seven, the patient tolerated a clear liquid diet well.
Otherwise, the patient's chest tube was out by postoperative day eight.
He was tolerating his tube feeds well.
Ipratropium inhaler q.6h.
