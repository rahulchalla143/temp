The skin surrounding the skin exit site and tract were infiltrated with approximately 8 cc of buffered 1% Xylocaine for local anesthetic.
The catheter was accessed using a 0.035-inch Bentson guidewire which was advanced under fluoroscopic visualization uncoiling the retention pigtail within the bowel.
The catheter was then removed leaving the guidewire in situ.
Subsequently, the 7 French bright tip sheath was then removed leaving the guidewire in situ and exchanged for a new, 10 French internal/external biliary drain.
The catheter was secured using a 2-0 silk, retention suture at the skin entrance site.
Obstructed afferent limb, s/p Whipple procedure.
10 French internal/external biliary drainage placed to gravity drainage.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2106-11-2**] 5:10 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval for afferent loop obstruction Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old man s/ whipple now with obstructive [**Last Name (un) **], fevers, wbc REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for afferent loop obstruction CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Consolidation at the left lung base has improved with atelectatic changes still present.
A transhepatic biliary drainage catheter is seen traversing the right lobe of the liver and terminating in a loop of jejunum.
It is visualized coursing inferior to the level of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and in the region of the soft tissue mass anterior to the aorta.
Colon and Rectum: Resection Synopsis  MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Colonic resection.
ADDENDUM #1: with  REVISED DIAGNOSIS    1.
ADDENDUM #2    Upon further review, the mesenteric mass (part I) was in the mesenteric root whereas the colonic tumor (part II) was in the proximal sigmoid area.
th Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52M with likely recurrent pancreatic cancer causing obstructive jaundice & cholangitis   PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, and using a 21-gauge needle that was introduced into the tenth intercostal space in the mid axillary line in the right abdomen, access was gained into the biliary duct from the right side, after injection of contrast material.
A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the site of anastomosis, and the needle was then exchanged for an Accustick sheath over the wire and its tip was positioned in the jejunum.
Cholangiogram was performed, demonstrated dilation of intrahepatic biliary system, patent hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, but markedly dilated bowel loop.
A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then advanced into the hepaticojejunostomy and the Accustick sheath was removed and exchanged for a 8 French internal external biliary catheter that was placed over the wire with the loop formed in the bowel loop.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Uncomplicated placement of percutaneous internal external biliary drainage tube.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Per report, patient is status post Whipple procedure and cholecystectomy.
He then had an uncomplicated placement of percutaneous internal external biliary drainage tube.
He tolerated the procedure well.
The Right internal/external biliary tube drainage placed, and continues to be only route of bile drainage.
Post-operatively he was NPO with IV fluids.
His pain was well controlled with an epidural.
He then went for a Biliary tube check on [**2106-11-2**] that showed non-visualization of new jejuno-jejunostomy which is thus presumed occluded.
A 10 French internal/external biliary drainage placed to gravity drainage.
The tube continued with external drainage.
On POD 12, his drain was capped and we monitored his LFT's for changes.
