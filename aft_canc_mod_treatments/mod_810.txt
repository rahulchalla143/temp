He is now s/p a matched cord blood nonmyeloablative transplant(about 50 days ago) with conditioning regimen of ATG, Fludarabine, Melphalan, and methylprednisolone.
When he was hospitalized for allogeneic transplant in this [**Month (only) 116**], his hospital course was complicated by fever, with positive blood cultures with Staph, coag(-)from his hickman.
He was initially treated with Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl and was discharged home on Vancomycin which completed on [**2137-5-22**].
Given his increased EBV viral load, he was started on Valcyte 50 mg twice per day.
He received IV vanc and IV cipro in ED.
Diagnosed in [**10/2129**] with non-secretory multiple myeloma with vertebral collapse and rod placement.
Surgery complicated by DVT, treated with Coumadin for 18 months.
He was initially treated with melphalan and prednisone 8 cycles, dexamethasone and thalidomide.
Received intermittent doses of Cytoxan followed by high-dose Cytoxan on [**2131-7-4**] with stem cell mobilization and collection and status post high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant in 10/[**2130**].
Noted for disease progression on BM bx in [**2133**] and was treated on the multiple myeloma/dendritic cell vaccine trial in [**7-/2134**] and taken off study due to progression of disease.
Increasing back pain during this time but noted for new herniated disc and underwent surgery in 09/[**2133**].
Begin Revlimid with dexamethasone but developed a rash at higher doses of 25 mg daily, then restarted a three-week cycle with increasing doses as of [**2135-9-8**].
He is status post 13 cycles with his last cycle completed on [**2136-9-14**].
Noted for disease progression/persistence with bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealing approximately 80% plasma cells.
The plasma cells comprise 7% of aspirate differential and 10-15% of the bone marrow core biopsy by CD138 immunohistochemical staining and are kappa restricted.
Completed Decadron 20 mg daily for two days in [**2-/2137**], repeated weekly x 2 in order to temporize his disease prior to his transplant.
11. this [**Month (only) **] : matched cord blood nonmyeloablative transplant with conditioning regimen of ATG, Fludarabine, elphalan, and methylprednisolone.
The patient insisted on continuing the neurontin as a "security".
He was initially started on Dilantin but this was tapered and discontinued in [**2130**] and he was put on Neurontin.
His Neurontin was tapered to 100 mg three times per day with no evidence for any seizure activity.
Spinal surgery with rod placement in [**2128**] at time of diagnosis.
Recent surgery for herniated disc in 9/[**2133**].
strength 5/5 UE and LE b/l, gait intact, romberg negative, FTN intact  Pertinent Results: [**2137-6-7**] SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Hypercellular bone marrow for age with dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old gentleman with a history of multiple myeloma nonsecretory type with free light chain disease, kappa predominating who is s/p a matched unrelated double cord blood nonmyeloablative transplant with conditioning regimen of ATG, Fludarabine, Melphalan, and methylprednisolone.
Peripheral smear was notable for blasts and plasma cells, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed involvement by lambda-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia, [**Last Name (un) **] immunoreactive, worrisome for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and hypercellular bone marrow.
Haptoglobin was WNL early in the hospital stay but quickly dropped  and Coombs test was negative.
GvHD remained a possibility, but was unlikely given colonoscopy results.
Tube feeds were begun for nutritional support, but stopped as pt began to have frankly melanotic stools.
He was then imaged with hydration and bicarb plus NAC before and after the contrast.
Pt became anasarcic, anuric and required intermittent hemodialysis for fluid removal.
He was placed on CVVH which he tolerated better, and effectively removed the extra fluid volume and helped to reverse his metabolic acidosis.
Treated with multidrug regimen.
Pt was intubated and transferred to ICU on Assist-Control.
Pt was placed on intermittent hemodialysis, then on CVVH for fluid removal.
Pt improved from respiratory perspective enough to be placed on Pressure support however was not extubated due to concerns for what to do should re-intubation be necessary.
This was discontinued and a Foley was placed to facilitate intravesicular cidofavir.
The procedure was tolerated well.
