LT COLECTOMY SUTURE ON PROXIMAL MARGIN [**2122-2-12**] Adenocarcinoma with associated adenomatous precursor lesion  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 20400**] was originally admitted to the medicine service on [**2122-2-1**] for work-up of malaise, anemia and hematochezia.
She underwent an emergent tagged red cell study after a supposed episode of bright red blood per rectum but which was eventually deemed falsely positive due to her ileal conduit.
CT scan on [**2-5**] demonstrated a short segment stricture with wall thickening identified in the mid-descending colon consistent with mass seen on colonoscopy and without lymphadenopathy.
On [**2122-2-6**], her hematocrit dropped from 29.2 to 26.9 then 25.1 and was subsequently transfused with 2 units of PRBCs by the medicine team; repeat hematocrit was 29.7.
A PICC line was placed on [**2122-2-11**] for TPN in anticipation of her nutritional needs following her pending colectomy.
She then went to the operating room on [**2123-2-12**] for a left hemicolectomy, splenic flexure mobilization and adhesiolysis.
Post-operatively, she was kept NPO, and placed on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
On POD 8 she was advanced to a regular house diet without issue and was again restarted on her H. pylori treatment.
She continued to have delusions while admitted that she had a child at the age of 10 that was taken from her.
Her risperidone was continued and the psychiatry liaision was notified.
After her surgery she was NPO so did not receive her risperidone and instead was treated with haldol prn.
This was the recommendation of the psychiatry service as it was likely that she would tolerate po medications within a week or so of her surgery.
She was then restarted on her risperidone on POD 6.
She is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], General Surgery, in [**2-15**] weeks; Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Oncology, given her diagnosis of adenoCA;  and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 365**] in Urology for continued management of her urostomy/ileal conduit.
