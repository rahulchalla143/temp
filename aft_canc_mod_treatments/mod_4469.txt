A TEE procedure related complication occurred (see comments for details).

[**12-16**] Cardiac Cath:Percutaneous Balloon Valvuloplasty: was performed on the mitral valve by a transseptal approach with a maximum balloon diameter of 27 mm.
Part of the consolidation might be due to superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema and reevaluation of the patient after diuresis is recommended.
[**12-20**]: video swallow-final report pending, prelim report showed some aspiration   Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo gentleman with PMH significant for CVA, B-cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic afib on anticoagulation admitted for elective valvuloplasty for mitral stenosis.
Hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and pneumonia.
He returned this admission and was found to have persistant clot in the atria, however underwent mitral valvuloplasty without complication and was found to have a significantly reduced gradient post-intervention.
He was monitored briefly in the ICU but returned to the floor without needing intubation or pressor support.
Given his hypotension and poor PO intake, he was inititially managed with fluids with improvement in HR and BP.
Given persistent tachycardia, digoxin was added to his regimen in the ICU.
Additionally, he was started on metoprolol, which was weaned down from the initial 25 [**Hospital1 **] dosing when pt became bradycardiac with 2 sec pauses on tele.
On discharge HR was well controlled in the 50s-60s on 25 [**Hospital1 **] of metoprolol and digoxin 0.125.
He was treated with heparin bridge until therapeutic on warfarin, which was increased to 5 mg/day during the hospitalizaton for goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
He may also need titration of BBlocker as an outpatient and should be monitored for symptoms concerning for bradycardia.
He was initially started on vancomycin and cefepime, switched to cefepime alone given low suspicion for MRSA with continued improvement.
