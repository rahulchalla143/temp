Tracheostomy 2.
G-tube placement (IR) [**2143-8-26**]  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 93910**] is a 65 year old male s/p ICH in [**2124**] secondary to cerebral aneurysm, with baseline dysarthric, hoarse speech.
As the patient usually has minimal complaints, she contact[**Name (NI) **] her physician who recommended ER evaluation.
Despite bag ventilation, O2 saturation drops and intubation is attempted.
and airway is occluded due to blood accumulation.
Patient underwent emergency surgical airway in ER and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with tracheostomy tube and a stable respiratory status.
Mr. [**Known lastname 93910**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further management.
Cerebral aneurysm [**2124**] s/p surgical clipping, complicated by intracranial bleed.
Seizure x1 in [**2132**], on chronic depakote and seizure-free since this time 3. s/p cholecystectomy 4. s/p AAA s/p aortobifemoral stenting  Social History: Lives with wife and daughter.
soft, non tender, no defense or rebound; BS normal; G-tube site:no drainage; packed - see instructions for maitenance at 7-10 days;  Neuro: s/p SAH and residual mental and motor impairment; patient is pleasant and cooperative but not well oriented in time or space; limited judgement ability (wife has POA); impaired memory; impaired speech/dysarthria; as prior to hospitalization, patient is wheel chair bound b/c of dystonic movements of 4 limbs;  Pertinent Results: CT neck [**7-24**]: Asymmetric soft tissue density in the left neck extending from the region superior to the hyoid bone, producing mass effect upon the epiglottis and valleculae and severe narrowing of the airway down to the level of the false cords with apparent mass effect, possibly pushing the false cords and cricoid cartilage to the right.
A tracheostomy tube is demonstrated.
The patient is restarted on antibiotics (levofloxacin + metronidazole on [**2143-8-17**]; stopped on [**2143-8-21**]).
On [**2143-8-19**], a video swallow shows persistence of a moderate-severe dysphagia.
PO-feeding reeducation is initiated and the patient's family consent to the placement of G-tube to improve feeding as TPN cannot be continued for the extended period of time that the patient will potentially require to recover functional swallow.
G-tube is placed on [**2143-8-26**] by interventionnal radiology as GI team could not illuminate gastric lumen sufficiently well b/c of [**Last Name (un) **] tissue from previous abdominal surgeries.
On [**2143-8-27**], trache tube is changed for a smaller cuffless, fenestrated Portex #6 in order to improve the patient's ability to breathe via upper airway and use his voice.
Capping trials are done during the day, tolerated w/trache tube suction q4-6h.
Significant medical events during his hospitalization include:  Respiratory - Lung opacity on initial CXR is consistent with pneumonitis from aspiration of blood during procedure and intubation.
Antibiotic coverage (Cefazolin) is initiated.
Because of heavy secretions/expectorations at the trach tube, patient requires frequent aspiration and pulm.
During the course of his hospitalization, repeat CXR reveal the development of bilaterl pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis but without showing any consolidation or opacification suggestive of pneumonia.
Transient hypotension during intubation procedure and large amounts of morphine sedation.
During his hospitalization on the [**Hospital1 **], patient has low level HBP, treated with metoprolol and nitroglycerin ointment.
Patient presented one episode ([**2143-8-19**]) of bigemminal pulse that lasted about 5 min.
However, his peripheral smear and differential was not normal even prior to his hospitalization and it is recommended to check a CBC again 1 month after his discharge and f/u with a hematologist.
GI - Patient was NPO from his arrival.
As the family refused to consent on a G-tube feed, patient was fed via TPN until [**2143-8-28**] as a G-tube was inserted on [**2143-8-26**] and tube feed initiated on [**2143-8-27**].
