Therefore, the patient was begun on Acyclovir intravenous for presumptive HSV encephalitis.
For this, the question was whether the patient should be started on intravenous Ganciclovir to treat for CMV.
Therefore, the patient was switched from Acyclovir to Ganciclovir intravenously.
The patient was continued on her AmBisome and her Flagyl which had been discontinued secondary to the presumed treatment of her Clostridium difficile infection was restarted.
Therefore, for presumed sepsis, the patient was begun on Vancomycin empirically.
The patient was also started initially on Ceftriaxone but secondary to Penicillin allergy was switched to Ciprofloxacin intravenously to cover for pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The patient was treated aggressively with antibiotics during this time.
At that time, the family felt that the patient had undergone enough intervention and was suffering with the treatment that she was undergoing.
Therefore, the decision was made to make the patient comfortable rather than to pursue any further aggressive intervention.
The patient was begun on Morphine empirically to control her pain and dyspnea.
She also received Ativan for increasing agitation.
Her oxygen was continued but her antibiotics were discontinued.
