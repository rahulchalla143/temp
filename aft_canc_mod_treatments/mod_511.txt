She was tried on steroids empirically without resolution of drainage.
As her lengthy hospital course continued, the output from her right drain decreased and this was pulled.
However, her left drain continued with output, so a pleurex catheter was placed by IP.
When her pancreatic cancer was found to have reoccurred via MRI (done to better evaluate her portal vein thrombosis ?bland thrombus vs tumor thrombus), we felt that her effusions might have been related to a capillary leak paraneoplastic process, because after starting chemotherapy her effusions slowed.
She started chemotherapy with gemcitabine on [**2120-4-18**].
Next chemotherapy is due on [**2120-5-3**].
She was placed on an octreotide drip for possible hepatorenal syndrome (noted due to orthodeoxia when standing, however after further analysis we noted that her orthodeoxia was more likely due to hypoperfusion because of extreme orthostasis (sbp in the 40s while standing)).
She will be discharged on florinef, salt tabs and midodrine and the patient was encourage to stand up slowly.
Issues with hyperglycemia when on steroids requiring aggressive uptitration of her insulin regimen.
When off of steroids and after starting octreotide (an inhibitor of pancreatic function) she developed severe symptomatic hypoglycemia requiring discontinuation of her insulin.
After stopping octreotide, she was restarted on an humalog insulin sliding scale.
We attempted to find an intervention to remove/lyse this clot, however in discussion with many different services found no options (the clot was present for too long to be lysed with TPA via IR, and would require an open abdominal surgery with reconstruction via vascular/transplant).

You were admitted for shortness of breath and found to have a reaccumulation of the fluid around your right lung as well as a new fluid collection around your left lung.
As you know, we had extreme difficulty preventing water from accumulating around your lungs; eventually we had to place a pleurex catheter in your left lung due to the speed of reaccumulation of fluid.
You will need the pleurex catheter drained between 500-1500cc of fluid periodically for comfort.
We gave you new medications to raise your blood pressure.
Please note the following changes to your medications:  STOP lasix spironolactone enoxaparin 70mcg  START salt tabs 2g twice per day enoxaparin 40mg twice per day florinef 0.2mg daily midodrine 10mg three times per day, please take the last dose at least 4 hours before bed, and the first dose as soon as you wake up prior to standing  Please see discharge summary for more details regarding your new medications.
