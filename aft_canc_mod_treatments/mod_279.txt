History of Present Illness: 75 yo lady with hx of severe COPD on home O2, non operable NSCL CA with nodule in LUL dx in [**2184**], s/p XRT, throid nodule, s/p flex bronch today with radioactive seed implantation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CXR prior to procedure showed spiculated mass in the left upper lung field retracting the left hilum with volume loss in the LUL area and post procedure there was no evidence of pneumothorax.
Patient apparently returned home after procedure which was tolerated well, some hemoptysis post procedure.
Patient then "just didn't look well" as per family, developed increasing SOB and brought to ED by daughter.
Tmax 99.8, SBP initially stable at 110s, then decreased to 50s post intubation and after receiving sedation.
Lactate was 6.0, patient received 4 L of NS but did not respond therefore started on Dopamine and Levophed.
Also started on Vancomycin and Unasyn to cover oral flora s/p bronch as well as post obstructive PNA given hx of lung CA.
Right IJ central line was placed in the ED and the sepsis protocol was initiated.
Patient transfered to ICU sedated and intubated on Levophed gtt at 0.18 mcg/kg/min.
NSCL CA: non operable, no hx of chemotherapy as per family, s/p XRT, s/p radioactive seed implantation, initial bronch in [**2181**] was negative for malignancy, diagnosed in [**2184**] after mass identified on CXR, PET positive nodule, also positive thyroid nodule 2.

3) FDG-avidity in paratracheal region near right lower pole of thyroid (peak SUV 15.1)   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo lady w/ severe COPD, non operable lung CA s/p bronch with gold seed placement admitted with respiratory failure and septic shock.
Also question of LLL segmental bronchus obstruction from clot post procedure given history of hemoptysis and LLL atelectasis on CTA.
Patient treated with Unasyn for gram negative and anaerobic coverage and Vancomycin since patient has been in/out of hospital, instrumented, lives in retirement home, to complete a 14 day course of each.
The patient was also treated with steroids for COPD exacerbation with hydrocortisone and then Solu-Medrol with inhaled steroids.
She was also treated with Albuterol/Atrovent MDI through the ET tube with improvement in her wheezing.
Due to her severe COPD she required Albuterol Q2 hrs and Atrovent Q 6 hrs, 8-10 puffs each.
Patient has remained on ventilator throughout admission.
She has been weaned several times to pressure support of [**3-22**] and even 0/5 but then becomes hypertensive, tachycardic, with increased secretions and dropping O2 sats.
Patient is off baseline sedation, anxiety well controlled with Seroquel and small doses of Ativan since patient was taking Ativan at home for anxiety (?).
She had a tracheostomy placed given the anticipated prolonged weaning process.
Central line placed was performed in the ED.
Empiric antibiotic coverage for post-obstructive PNA initiated with Unasyn and Vancomycin given recent bronchoscopy and high risk for mixed flora/anaerobes.
Patient received a total of 5 units of NS in the ED with continued fluid resuscitation in the ICU as per the sepsis protocol.
Levophed drip was started to meet the above criteria which was weaned after stabilization of her BP after approximately 48 hrs.
IV fluid boluses were continued with Lactated Ringers due to rising lactic acidosis.
Patient had a cortisol stim test which showed abnormal and paradoxical results but was ultimately started on steroids due to severe COPD.
The patient was adequately fluid resuscitated and weaned off pressors.
She remained stable in terms of her likely pulmonary infection with her limitations being her dependence on the ventilator due to COPD and underlying lung CA.
Monitoring was continued with daily chemistries, lactic acid measurement and ABGs with subsequent resolution and normalization of her lab values.
TWI subsequently resolved on repeat EKG.
Beta blockers avoided given severe COPD.
Patient had been off all antihypertensives until this point due to initial sepsis with hypotension.
Patient had been taking an ACE inhibitor at home, which was restarted, Captopril 6.25 mg titrated as necessary for elevated BP.
She blood pressure and heart rate improved with light sedation with propofol.
She received another unit of red cells on [**8-15**] for a hematocrit of 24.4.
Patient has been monitored with regular finger sticks and coverage with regular insulin drip then sliding scale with good control.
Her glucose was further elevated once steroids were started.
# Anxiety: Patient has been anxious throughout admission, on benzos at home.
Patient was having episodes of anxiety with hypertension, tachycardia, agitation with weaning of sedation/ventilation.
# FEN - Patient started on tube feeds.
IV fluid resuscitation initially, subsequently bolused as needed with LR, then not requiring fluids with OG feeds.
Once the PEG was placed, she was continued on tube feeds via the PEG tube.
# Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, Heparin SC + pneuma boots given history of CA, PPI, FS with insulin, ASA .
