A left subclavian was placed on [**10-21**] and then changed over a wire on [**10-24**].
The patient's hematocrit post procedure was noted to drop from 29.7 to 22.8.
He received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, 4 bags of platelets, 1 cryo, 17 units of fresh frozen platelets between [**10-20**] and [**10-21**].

Antibiotics were then changed to Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl on [**10-26**].
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.
Insulin sliding scale.
Albuterol nebulizer.
The patient was on SIMV vent, tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 14 to 24, FIO2 0.4, FIO2 pressures support 5 of PEEP.
Urinalysis large blood, 30 protein, urobilinogen 1, 11 to 20 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood cells, 0 to 2 epithelials, moderate bacteria, negative glucose, negative nitrite, negative leukocyte esterase, negative ketone, negative bilirubin.
Troponin 0.03.
However, the patient remained stable on room air and then on oxygen by nasal cannula, hence a repeat paracentesis was not performed.
Given that his disease was so diffuse with multiple hepatic masses and most likely seeding in his abdomen the family decided that they did not want to initiate any chemotherapy at the current time.
The differential diagnoses include MRSA, pneumonia, E-coli, necrotizing hepatic masses, ischemic bowel, SBP, diarrhea, endocarditis, deep venous thrombosis, PE, drug fever given that the patient was on Zosyn and has a Penicillin allergy, Atelectasis, endocarditis, DVT and PE were all ruled out.
SBP was ruled out based on peritoneal fluid analysis and the patient's fever curb trended down.
He had multiple rule out protocols performed and ruled out for myocardial infarction on repeated occasions.
Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute on chronic worsening of his renal failure, but with hydration his creatinine normalized to the baseline of 1.3.
FEN:  The patient was maintained on tube feeds.
