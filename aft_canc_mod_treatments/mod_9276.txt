Due to concerns for bypass occlusion, the vascular surgery team preferred to send Mr. [**Known lastname **] to rehab to work with the leg, in order to improve the chances of bypass survival and efficacy.
In the mean time, the patient has been on Linezolid and zosyn as an inpatient, and will be on oral bactrim per the vascular surgery service until follow up with Vascular surgery clinic.
He has been monitored daily with steady but slow improvement, and all sedating medications have been avoided.
# Hyperglycemia:  The patient has been doing poorly on just an insulin sliding scale with FS in the 250's.
Once his renal function was stable,  he was placed on Metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for better glycemic control, in addition to an insulin sliding scale.
# Rectal [**Hospital 13051**] surgery was consulted for his partial obstruction.
They have decided that he is a poor candidate for surgical intervention.
# ARF: resolved while avoiding Vancomycin and all nephrotoxic medications.
He required an NGT for nutrition and has since started eating on his own once he passed a swallowing evaluation (recommended ground solids and thin liquids).
NGT was discontinued but his oral intake remains poor.
While on the vascular service, patient was started on IV Vancomycin for presumed osteomyelitis and oral flagyl for presumed c. diff infection (although has had 3 sets of negative toxin assays), and recommended angiogram.
Renal was consulted for ARF on [**2-13**], and thought it was due to AIN due to antibiotics or PPI.
Therefore, it was recommended that steroids were initiated (prednisone 40 mg PO daily), PPI be d/c-ed and changed to H2 blocker, and to schedule a renal biopsy if renal failure continued to worsen.
Vancomycin has been held since [**2-12**], with trough still elevated at 30.9 on transfer on [**2-15**].
No antibiotics prior to those given by Vascular.
# Mental Status Changes: Patient with sporadic episodes of delirium at night including agitation, getting out of bed, and shaking fist/threatening staff.
Other etiologies of delirium included infectious (pneumonia), toxic metabolic (acute renal failure/AIN and hypernatremia due to diarrhea), and medications.
Underlying causes were treated individually (pneumonia was treated with antibiotics, hypernatremia was treated with maintenence fluids, acute interstitial nephritis with steroid treatment, vancomycin and PPI were held, and ranitidine was renally dosed).
TSH indicated a subclinical hypothyroidism (poor free T4->T3 conversion in the setting of acute illness) which did not require levothyroxine supplementation.
He was taken off glyburide, required D10 drip and boluses of D50 to maintain blood sugars.
At that time he was intubated for airway protection.
His blood sugars were more consistent after starting tube feeds.
He tolerated a CO2 angiogram (low dose dye) without insult to his kidneys.
Treated with linezolid and zosyn given AIN with vancomycin.
Patient was initially on the vascular service and transferred to medicine for management of ARF.
Vascular recommended a fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and a transmetatarsal amputation, which was postponed given altered mental status.
Corrected with IVF and encouraged PO fluid intake.
Hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%, so either onset of DM is relatively recent or blood sugars in 400s were acute exacerbated by prednisone.
Held aspirin given anemia/possible GIB.
Continued beta-blocker and started simvastatin given low HDL levels.
He was managed with RISS after transfer out of the MICU and was eventually started on metformin just prior to discharge.
Treated with immodium prn and stool bulking agents.
Had colonoscopy at OSH showing multiple colonic polyps in the ascending and sigmoid colon (1 with high grade dysplasia) and rectal mass (villous adenoma, no adenocarcinoma identified).
General Surgery was consulted as well but thought he was not a good surgical candidate given his multiple comorbidities.
Had received 2 U PRBCs at [**Hospital1 8**] + 2 U at OSH => 4 U PRBCs total.
Was B12 deficient, likely in setting of EtOH use, was corrected with IM shot.
He will need possibly an upper endoscopy as an outpatient.
# HTN: initially controlled with metoprolol and amlodipine, later discontinued.
Meds will need to be resumed as outpatient as he was hypertensive prior to discharge.
# Rectal mass: Colonoscopy results as above.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 49**] - [**Location (un) 50**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PVD Left foot gangrene Acute Renal failure- likely AIN Anemia of chronic disease Rectal mass diabetes mellitus type II- new diagnosis hypertension- will need meds  Discharge Condition: alert, oriented to person & place, tolerating ground solids but appetite poor, still with significant diarrhea  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a diagnosis of acute renal failure and left foot gangrene and a pneumonia.
Your renal failure was though to be due to an antibiotic called Vancomycin or a proton pump inhibitor.
You were treated with steroids and your renal function improved by discharge.
You underwent a procedure called an angiogram of your left foot.
Vascular surgery recommends revascularization of your left foot, but due to a flexion contracture of the left leg, they would like you to go to rehab for 2 weeks before the procedure.
Your pneumonia was treated with antibiotics and resolved.
You were treated with immodium and it had improved slightly prior to discharge.
