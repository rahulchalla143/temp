She is s/p her first round of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin which she underwent [**2172-7-13**].
She was found to be in Atrial flutter on f/up EKG and ruled out for MI.
She was rate controlled with metoprolol and a digoxin load.
A CTA showed large mediastinal mass and cardiothoracic surgery did not feel there was any need for intervention as it was not felt to be hematoma.
During her admission she had episodes of hypoxia requiring supplemental O2 which was felt to be due to combination of Afib and pulmonary edema and atelectasis.
She had a port placed during the admission for chemotherapy.
She had blood cultures drawn and received vancomycin and cefepime, as well as ibuprofen 600mg x 1.

Past Medical History: # Thymoma ([**6-30**]) and status post chemotherapy [**7-13**] (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin regimen) #Afib/flutter, diagnosed [**3-/2172**] # h/o transaminitis/LFT elevations - liver Bx from [**Hospital1 1474**] in [**1-/2172**] nonspecific minimal lobular and portal mononuclear cell inflammation w/ rare hepatocyte necrosis.
Rounded hyperdense swirling density arising from site of prior biopsy, extending through the right anterior chest wall into the subpectoral soft tissues, most c/w hematoma; however, concerning for possible superinfection vs residual air related to bx.
No significant interval change in appearance of biopsy-proven thymoma 4.

Brief Hospital Course: # SIRS : On admission, the patient met SIRS criteria of fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia plus suspected infection on initial presentation.
The patient has a left sided subclavicular placed port which appeared clean and without bleeding, discharge on daily exams so it is an unlikely infection source.
She completed a course of IV vancomycin and cefepime, and remained afebrile for the remainder of her admission.
# Fevers: persistent fevers alongside neutropenia s/p recent chemotherapy ([**7-13**])prior to admission.
Anemia may be contributing to afib/tachycardia also, thus was transfused 2 u pRBCs on [**2172-7-27**] - volume replete with NS IVFs - monitored UOP, keeping >35cc/hr - rate control attained through beta blocker, increased dose during ICU stay and continued home level Digoxin.
Unlikely ischemic in nature given pattern and presentation.
Pain was control with Oxycontin and Oxycodone prn and later Morphine PRN given as her nausea seemed to increase with oxycontin dosing.
She was given transfusions Plts for Plts<10.
Ceruloplasmin normal.
Tylenol and other hepatotoxic agents were avoided during admission.
# B1 Thymoma: s/p her 1st course of chemo on [**7-13**] including cyclophosphomide, doxurubicin, cisplatin.
She has a follow-up appointment with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] in clinic the week after her discharge to continue with chemotherapy.
