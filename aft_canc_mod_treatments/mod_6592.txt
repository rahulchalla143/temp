His platelets on admission were 38 (baseline) and Hct was 21.5, so he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs and platelets.
On [**2184-5-12**], he had respiratory distress overnight off of O2 (increased RR) and required 4 L O2 to achieve normoxia.
His IVF were d/c'd (started on admission) and he received 20 mg IV lasix along with his regular 80 mg oral dose, with good effect.
He received 20 mg IV lasix x 2 and his regular 80 mg po dose, with an output of 2.8 L thus far.
Of note, the patient has been O2-dependent at home on 2 L NC since his MI in [**2182**].
Has had worsening LE edema after his MI in [**2182**], requiring an increase in lasix dose (40->80 mg daily) and was recently on metolazone with good effect.

TECHNIQUE: Axial T1, FLAIR, T2, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images as well as sagittal T1-weighted images were acquired prior to administration of IV contrast.
Subsequent multiplanar T1-weighted imaging was performed after administration of IV gadolinium.
The patient is status post bilateral lens replacement.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial imaging was performed through the brain without administration of IV contrast.
The patient is status post bilateral lens replacement.
IMPRESSION: Slightly more prominent edema surrounding posterior parafalcine right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, again with sulcal effacement but without shift of normally midline structures.
He was started on ciprofloxacin then narrowed to ampicillin for pan-sensitive enterococcus in the urine; he should be continued for a total of 7 day course of antibiosis, which will be completed on [**5-24**].
Lasix was given with improvement.
An echo did not provide an obvious explanation for why he has a 2L O2 requirement at home after his MI, and it may be that pulmonary follow-up would be appropriate to consider his pulmonary hypertension.
# Subarachanoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages: he was initially monitored in the neurosurgical ICU and blood pressure controlled with IV nicardipine.
Levels was 6.5 at discharge (with albumin 3.3)  #.
His diastolic CHF does necessitate an extra dose of lasix 40mg po with each blood transfusion.
