Admission Date:  [**2174-9-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-10-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Planned admission for high dose melphalan autologous stem cell transplant   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation with melphalan   History of Present Illness: 42-year-old male with kappa light chain myeloma diagnosed in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2173**] when he presented in acute renal failure, with hyperkalemia.
He was on dialysis for 6-7 weeks, then recovered renal function.
He is status post two cycles of Decadron and thalidomide therapy, and one cycleof Decadron therapy alone, which had to be held for one month due to a perforated ulcer, on [**6-24**], during his second cycle.
He received his last dose of Thal/[**Month (only) **]/ coumadin on [**2174-6-26**].
Presented in hypertensive urgency in [**Month (only) 216**] with acute renal failure and progressive myeloma during admission pt received Cytoxan one gram per meter square and Decadron pulses.
Pt was started on dexamethasone 40 mg IV daily x 4 days for pulse therapy of presumed light chain renal toxicity.
His creatinine decreased with pulse-dose steroids.
Past Medical History: ONC Hx: as stated above Hypertension, longstanding Pneumonia [**5-/2174**] Perforated peptic ulcer [**6-16**] Meningitis x 2 (unclear etiology - one episode required 2 week hospitalization) Surgeries: Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs as child 3 cervical spine fusions (3 years ago, 2 years ago, [**Month (only) 205**] of [**2172**]) Right knee arthroscopic surgery and open patellar reduction Bilateral rotator cuff repairs Cardiac catheterization ([**7-/2170**]) Repair of perforated peptic ulcer [**6-16**]   Social History: He served in the USMC for 6 years.
He also received several stab wounds.
Family History: He has 2 sisters, one of whom has MS. His father has had a CABG and an aortic valve replacement.
This intermitently changing pattern and location of multifocal densities has a broad differential diagnosis, including atypical infection, eosinophilc lung, vasculitis, aspiration and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
Considering interval treatment for [**Month/Day/Year 1065**] infection, the worsening abnormality in the right lung could be due to a second infectious process.
Anasarca and trace ascites as well as slight increase in right effusion, likely due to generalized fluid overload.
Left- sided internal jugular catheter is identified with tip in distal SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yr old male with kappa light chain myeloma diagnosed this [**Month (only) 116**] with multiple admissions for renal failure treated with thalidomide, prednisone, cytoxan presenting for autologous stem cell transplant with Melphalan, course complicated by renal failure, fevers and pulmonary edema.
Light chain with increased renal failure due to cast nephropathy, light chain deposition disease, Amyloid deposition, Fanconi's, but renal biopsy with no evidence of cast nephropathy or amyloidosis Did well on prednisone and thalidomide with some peripheral neuropathy.
Cytoxan treatment in the past.
Oncologist felt autologous transplant with melphalan best option at this point.
Melphalan treatment performed with autologous transplant per protocol, with 2 renally dosed treatments.
Rasburicase 6 mg given with decrease to <1.
[**9-20**] stem cells given without incident.
[**9-22**] creatinine noted to be increasing to 3.
Decreased on hydration 100 cc/hr, then to off as patient retaining fluids with swelling, and weight gain of 18+ pounds.
Lasix given sparingly as concern for further worsening renal failure, but diuresis necessary given pulmonary edema.
Severe line pain, evidence of possible pulmonary infiltrate and continued worseing fluid overload with necessity of face mask for aid in breathing, also prolonged admission.
ID- Due to intense pain from left central line site, central line was pulled [**9-22**] with subsequent rigors, concerning for bacteremic, spread of infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on catheter.
Cefepime, vanc, flagyl and caspo continued with Acyclovir held due to cr>1.5 per protocol.
[**10-1**] bronchoscopy performed with evidence of slight erythema in right lower lobe without purulent secretions.
Pt had 4 day stay in the ICU but was never intubated requiring nonrebreather following BAL.
Of note, pt's kidney function also improved on high dose steroids bringing into question a pulmonary-renal syndrome given his renal function seemed worse following steroid taper and evidence of improved light chains.
lasix 40 IV given [**9-28**].
[**9-29**] after 40 lasix and starting caspo, marked improvement in breathing sats to 95% on RA, but later hypoxic again, previous to bronch on [**10-1**].
With diuresis and antibiotics sats to 95% on RA, but continued to intermittently drop to 85% with wheezes overnight, and patient continued to be febrile.
Chronic renal failure with bouts of acute renal failure treated with pulse dose steroids and chemotherapy in the past.
Cr trended up with fluids and diuresis to 3.8 max.
Rasburicase given 6 mg given elevated uric acid to 13, which also led to slight decrease in creatinine.
Acute renal failure as described above occurred in setting of prednisone taper raising suspicion for pulmonary-renal syndrome.
The patient required daily intravenous fluids at time of discharge.
Hypertension- Metoprolol 50 QID, nifedipine 90 SR as outpatient.
On admission patient started on metoprolol TID, titrated up to QID with SBP in the 170's.
Nifedipine started at 60 mg, and increased to nifedipine 40 [**Hospital1 **].
Lasix also improved BP as patient fluid overloaded during admission.
Pain- Several fractures and surgeries in the past, consider possible previous undiagnosed multiple myeloma, with lytic lesions.
Dilaudid PCA had to be started given extent of pain.
he was weaned from dilaudid PCA.
At time of discharge pt required Fentanyl patch 75mcg q72hrs for relief of his chronic neck and back pain.
