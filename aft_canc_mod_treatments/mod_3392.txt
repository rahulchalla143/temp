female with a h/o severe PVD including AAA status post repair and stenting, and metastatic Ca of unknown primary complicated by T7 destructive lesion here in [**12-26**], s/p T3-T11 fusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] status post radiation with left pelvic metastasis, s/p XRT to chest and cervical subcutaneous soft tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer metastasis and paraneoplastic syndrome manifest with diffuse lower extremity weakness who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from her rehab for initiation of chemotherapy.
She was seen in clinic today with noted growth of her neck mass with associated [**2104-7-28**] pain in right shoulder despite current pain medication regimen.
She is being admitted for chemotherapy carboplatin/etoposide(over 3 days) and received day 1 today with 2 more days of etoposide.
Pain control is the other objective of her admission.
Past Medical History: # HTN # COPD # Osteopenia # PVD: s/p aortobifem [**2091**] and [**2095**], s/p right SFA and [**Doctor Last Name **] angio, # s/p right SFA stenting, s/p a right common iliac to left renal artery bypass, s/p right renal artery stenting, s/p right profunda femoris to posterior tibial bypass # AAA repair with stenting # Hypercholesterolemia # Carcinoma of unknown primary w/ T7 lesion, L Pelvic metastasis, s/p XRT, and Cervical subcutaneous soft tissue mass # History of thrombocytopenia (has not been formerly worked up.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, stomach, small bowel, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear unremarkable.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 66 year-old female with a history of small cell lung CA, COPD, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, and paraneoplastic neurologic disorder who was initially admitted for chemotherapy and eventually transferred to the ICU on [**7-14**] for hypoxia, tachycardia, and mental status changes.
Originally, patient was going to be discharged after receiving chemotherapy and IVIG for her neurologic disorder, but had developed febrile neutropenia.
While receiving her course of antibiotics (Cefepime/Vancomycin/Metronidazole) for the neutropenia, she developed headaches in the setting of thrombocytopenia (Plt count 16).
Halfway through the transfusion, patient experienced desaturation and transfusion was stopped and labs for transfusion reaction were sent.
Later that morning, patient again became increasingly hypoxic, requiring 5 litres nasal cannula, and received 10mg IV furosemide with 600cc diuresis and no significant improvement in oxygen requirement.
At 8PM on [**7-14**], patient became febrile to 102 and tachycardic (while on Vancomycin [**7-3**], Cefepime [**7-5**], and metronidazole [**7-8**]), appeared dehydrated, and received 750cc IV fluids.
Oxygenation improved to mid-90% on non-rebreather.
Blood gas showed 7.39/41/53 presumably while on 5 litres nasal cannula.
She received 10mg IV furosemide with 1 litre diuresis.
Transfusion then was considered but was deferred due to unclear volume status, and question of possible TRALI with prior platelet transfusion.
Due to persistent hypoxia, diagnosis of PE was entertained, although thought unlikely as patient had been on low-dose fondaparinux for prophylaxis.
Patient complained of some jaw discomfort similar to her chronic angina, relieved with nitroglycerin earlier that morning.
Pt continued to be hypoxic, requiring nasal cannula and face tent,and continued to be hypotensive as well.
She was made comfortable on a morphine drip, and was discharged to home with hospice services.
Details below pertain to her hospitalization prior to transfer to the ICU:  # Metastatic Ca of unknown primary and cervical subcutaneous soft tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer metastasis: Patient received carboplatin and etoposide.
Although temporally this was associated with Filgastrim, due to high risk of infection, patient was treated for HAP: started on Vancomycin (4), Levofloxacin(2d), then switched to Cefepime (2d) for pseudomonal coverage (days of AB on day of discharge)  to be most likely [**1-21**].
Pt was continued on ipratropium nebulizers q6h daily.
# Pain control - Oxycontin was increased to 60 Q8h and oxycodone for breakthrough at 5mg q4h prn and gabapentin 300 mg [**Hospital1 **].
With PT and movement from OOB to chair, patient's pain had dissipated by HD#5 and she did not require prn oxycodone by HD#6.
She continued to receive oxycontin 60mg TID.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1206**] of neurology was consulted and a recommendation was made to readminister an IVIG regimen x5d at 0.4g/kg/day of IVIG x 5 days.
Initially there was mild improvement in motor function of LE (4+/5 strength with flex/ext of feet b/l, 2+/5 proximally b/l) and decrease in numbness improved in LE and paresthesias in UE.
It was difficult to delineate the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] of change as multiple interventions were performed in parallel (chemo/IVIG).
A taper of 1mg to 0.5mg qd for 5 days was initiated on [**7-5**] to be changed to prednisone 0.5mg EOD by [**7-10**] and completed by [**7-17**].
# CAD - ASA was continued at 162mg daily as were her statin, b-blocker, nitrates and ACE-I.
# PVD - patient was continued on plavix, statin and aspirin.
# COPD - Patient was continued on nebs q6h.
