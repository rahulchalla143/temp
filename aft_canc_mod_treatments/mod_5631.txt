Brief Hospital Course: 66M h/o antiphospholipid syndrome on anticoagulation (held for past 5 days), s/p dental procedure p/w one day of hematemesis.
He had been off of warfarin/asa for 5 days, yet still w/ INR 2.2 on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He received 2 units FFP and 10mg IV Vitamin K. He was likely supratherapeutic prior to procedure, leading to increased blood loss and failure of hemostasis at extraction sites.
In the ICU, the patient's warfarin and ASA were held.
Considering that NG tube drainage slowed after suture placement, this was removed the afternoon of [**2-26**].
## Gastric-like mucosa noted on EGD: This area of the esophagus was noted incidentally on EGD and not thought to be at all related to his initial presentation.
He was started on Omeprazole per GI recommendation.
He should have H. pylori testing as an outpatient.
Acute renal failure: Improved with IV fluids.
Anti-phospholipid syndrome: Coumadin and ASA were initially held.
After sutures were placed by OMFS and EGD was negative, Hct and BP remained stable.
Thus, the OMFS service stated that there was no contraindication to restarting both Coumadin and Aspirin the day after discharge.
He should resume his prior Coumadin dosing since he appeared to be well-controlled on that.
He takes plendil 2.5 mg daily at home, which was initially held and then restarted on discharge.
