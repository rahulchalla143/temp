He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.

This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant pseudomonas.
