Hypoxia--We thought that her hypoxia was a result of her gettting a small dose of Dilaudid after having taken a questionable amount of methadone and benzodiazapines recently and even in the EW.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was sating well on 100% mask but this would drop w/sleep to high 80s.
Also, Patient was started on a narcan drip after which her O2 sats improved such that she was able to be gradually weaned off the supplemental oxygen and she was transferred to the floor.
LBP-We controlled her pain with NSAIDS and the pain service reommended that she be discharged with a small amount of oxycodone along with close follow up with the pain clinic at [**Hospital6 **].
In light of this opiod overdose we thus decided it best that the patient obtain all of her care at [**Hospital6 **] to which the patient was in agreement.
The patient was suspected to have obstructive sleep apnea as she required CPAP at night.
