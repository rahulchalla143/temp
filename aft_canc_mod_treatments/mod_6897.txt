Reason for MICU transfer: Ventilator Management   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 78y/o M with history of bronchoalveolar carcinoma s/p rt upper lobectomy in [**2-/2138**], aspiration pneumonia c/b L sided empyema s/p thoracentesis and chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy transferred from OSH for J tube evaluation.
Given malnutrition and h/o esophageal stricture, a J-tube was placed.
Pt also has h/o partial gastrectomy and Bilroth II procedure and thus J tube was considered over G-tube.
LTAC reported that J tube was leaky and patient subsequently underwent 2 revisions on [**5-20**] and [**5-29**] by general surgery at OSH.
This PNA was also complicated by MRSA empyema which was drained by pigtail catheter placed over past weekend.
Pigtail catheter fell out yesterday however repeat CT showed interval improvement of pleural effusion.
Patient was started on imipenem empirically for aspiration pneumonia was due to finish treatment on [**6-14**].
Patient was significant improving from ventilation stand point and was due to be sent back to rehab however J-tube remained leaky which prompted transfer for further evaluation.

Left-sided PICC line terminates in the mid distal SVC.
Aspirated secretions are seen in bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchus as well as in the left main stem bronchus concerning for continued aspiration with a bolus of secretion seen immediately superior to the tracheostomy tube (601B:21).
In this setting of bronchoalveolar carcinoma, this could also reflect foci of malignant involvement and followup to resolution should be performed.
Impending aspiration of additional bolus of secretions proximal to the tracheostomy tube.
The patient is status post surgery in the right lung.
A jejunostomy tube is seen.
A Foley catheter is detected within the urinary bladder.
Fractures of right ribs 11 and 10 with no calus formation.
Air-filled tubular structure within the right lower quadrant, cannot rule out free air we recommend further clinical follow up or an interval CT examination with oral contrast ( through J tube ).
PICC line in situ within the right subclavian and right basilic veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o M with h/o malnutrition requiring J-tube with recent respiratory failure from aspiration PNA c/b MRSA empyema now s/p tracheostomy transferred with J-tube evaluation found to have profound malnutrition who clinically deteriorated during MICU stay and after multiple family meetings was ultimately made CMO.
His J tube site appeared macerated.
IR was consulted who performed a J tube study which confirmed placement and patency.
Surgery was consulted and upsized the tube however J tube continue to leak.
TPN was started and family was approached regarding [**Last Name (un) 1372**]-jujenal feedings.
# Floor Course:  Mr [**Known lastname 78143**] was continued on his morphine and ativan with transition to IV morphine drip the following morning.
