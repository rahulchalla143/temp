She elected not to have chemotherapy and took Arimidex as adjuvant therapy beginning in [**2170-8-6**].

-KUB ([**2179-4-25**]): Supine and left decubitus views of the abdomen show considerable increase in distention and wall thickening of the large bowel consistent with pancolitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 78F with met breast CA on gemcitabine, initially admitted for fevers, abdominal pain and leukocytosis, subsequently found to have C. diff colitis, [**Last Name (un) **] and and concern for toxic megacolon  #C. diff colitis with toxic megacolon and sepsis: While on the medicine floor, she was found to have worsening abdominal pain and distention in the setting of C. diff, which was likely related to her recent antibiotics during prior admission for cellulitis.
She was treated with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl.
An NG tube was placed for decompression which the patient removed.
Her blood pressure improved with multiple fluid boluses and she did not require pressors.
Surgery was consulted and felt that there was no surgical intervention indicated given that her surgical mortality would be extremely high.
Lisinopril was held and renal was consulted.
#Hypoxia: She was initially transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for the above findings as well as hypoxia with O2 sat of 70s on RA.
There was concern for aspiration and she was empirically treated with Vanc/Zosyn for aspiration PNA as well as HCAP given her recent admission.
She was continued on ASA 81mg.
#Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (from her lactic acidosis) and non-anion gap (likely from GI losses as well as fluid resuscitation with NS).
#Hypertension: Home BP meds held in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.
