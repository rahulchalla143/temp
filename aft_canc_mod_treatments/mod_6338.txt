Ventricular masses were found on TTE as well as pericardial effusion which has since been drained and a pericardial window with drain has been placed.
Patient is being transferred from surgical ICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to receive chemotherapy,  to monitor pericardial drain placed yesterday [**7-25**] and in hypercalcemic crisis [**1-19**] metastasis with Ca of ~15 on transfer s/p [**2126-7-25**] administration of 30mg IV pamidronate, decadron, and IVFs at OSM.

Exam notably changed in patient was alert and oriented times three and asking appropriate questions about his medical condtions and treatment plan.
Pericardial drain also removed at discharge with healing incision in left chest with dressing C/D/I.
They do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD5, CD23 or CD10.
Multiple paratrabecular and non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregates, in keeping with involvement by patient's known B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see note).
By immunohistochemistry, the infiltrate is diffusely immunoreactive for pan B-cell marker CD20 with scant CD3 positive T-cells.
By immunohistochemistry, the infiltrate is diffusely immunoreactive for pan B-cell marker CD20 with scant CD3 positive T-cells.
If clinically indicated, we recommend a repeat specimen be submitted for further studies.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year male with new diagnosis NHL involving lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys admitted with this new diagnosis and in hypercalcemic crisis with persistent encephalopathy status post placement of pericardial window.
Separate biopsies of the patient's bone marrow, pericardium and a mass on the surface of his heart also all revealed B-cell lymphoma.
After placement of a PICC line the patient was started on CHOP on [**2126-7-26**] for a 4 day course.
Pretreatment prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome was initiated with allopurinol and discontinued after several days of normal uric acid levels.
There was never any signs of [**Last Name (un) **] following the chemotherapy and uric acid peaked at 3.1.
Still, given lack of other sources of mental status changes he was considered high risk for CNS lymphoma and received intrathecal methotrexate and then high dose methotrexate on [**2126-8-9**].
After this last treatment he received leucovorin rescue.
Overall, the patient tolerated chemotherapy very well with minimal nausea and no appreciated mucositis or other toxicities.
After his MTX levels were within safe limits following this final treatment and his neutropenic nadir begun to recover he was discharged to home with plans to return for further cycles of outpatient CHOP.
Encephalopathy: The patient presented with encephalopathy that persisted despite correction of hypercalcemia (corrected with IVFs and pamidronate 30mg IV X1 [**7-25**], decadron 20mg IV bid and lasix 20mg X1 and IVFs) and hyponatremia.
Thiamine and folate were given initially, but B12, folate, TSH, LFT's, and ammonia were all checked early in his course and were within normal limits.
An infectious work up was initiated on [**2126-7-31**] given persistent encephalopathy despite correction of his electrolyte abnormalities and discontinuation of CNS inhibiting drugs but no signs of UTI or pneumonia.
During the height of this confusion the patient was quite agitated and required feeding by NG tube as well as olanzapine and soft restraints in order to be administered his medical care.
Eventually, the patient began to clear on his own and as of [**2126-8-5**] was responding in a meaningful way to most questions, though he continued to not be oriented to time and would become extremely disoriented about time and situation at night.
At the time gram positive cocci were reported empiric vancomycin was initiated and the PICC was discontinued.
Cultures of the PICC catheter tip did not grown any bacteria.
When speciation revealed strep viridans he was switched from vancomycin to ceftriaxone.
This was briefly switched to Penicillin G during the period of leucovorin rescue given a concern that the calcium in the leucovorin could precipitated with ceftriaxone.
Though there was never fever, embolic phenomena, or other high risk features for endocarditis, multiple echocardiograms were performed and none showed vegetations.
At discharge he was switched back to ceftriaxone for an easier dosing interval with plans to continue a four week course for uncomplicated bacteremia.
Pericardial window was chosen over pericardial drain given this was now thought most likely to be a malignant infusion and the risk of recurrence was high.
Drain output gradually decreased and the drain was discontinued when there was only a minimal amount of drainage.
This resolved with vigorous IV hydration and never recurred.
Right-sided catheter associated DVT: On ICU day five his right upper extremity was noted to be swollen.
Heparin gtt was held given concern for triggering pericardial hemorrhage in light of recent pericardial window.
Tachycardia: The patient had a history of tachycardia that was treated with metoprolol during his hospitalization.
This worsened in an expected manner with chemotherapy and was recovering at the time of discharge.
The patient intially required tube feeds in the ICU due to his mental clouding.
After this resolved he was placed on a neutropenic diet.
He received DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots and then was encouraged to ambulate.
SC heparin was held due to his history of hemopericardium.

Initially, the tumor in your heart was causing fluid to collect around the heart so the cardiac surgeons drained this fluid and left a drain in place.
This drain was eventually removed.
