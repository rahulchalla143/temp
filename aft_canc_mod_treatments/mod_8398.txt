The previously seen craniotomy bone flap has been removed and there is a new mesh in the craniotomy defect.
There is heterogeneous high- density material immediately under the mesh, which may represent post-surgical fluid, but if there is concern for infection, this could be further evaluated with MR. Again seen is encephalomalacia of the adjacent right frontal lobe.
