PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with a bone marrow transplant in [**2124-7-26**] with recurrence status post chemotherapy.
A lumbar puncture was performed and there was a question of meningitis for which he was treated with Acyclovir, Vanco, Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone.
There was no evidence of lymphoma on cerebral spinal fluid cytology.
[**Name (NI) **] kept requiring large amounts of platelet products and had a gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Postoperatively, the patient initially did reasonably well requiring continued platelet transfusions though at a much lesser rate.
However, over his Intensive Care Unit stay he had more difficulty with respiration and required reintubation for a pneumonia.
He also then had a higher requirements for platelets and red cells.
Because of his extremely poor prognosis and the fact that the splenectomy did not improve his platelet problem as well as severe respiratory failure it was thought that further measures were to attempt to improve the situation were futile.
