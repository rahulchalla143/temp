Hypoxia: Pt initially felt to be a vasculopath with poor pleth and inaccurate peripheral O2 sat [**Location (un) 1131**] resulting in likely premature intubation.
Sputum cultures speciated enterbacter with intermediate sensitivity to ceftriaxone on [**10-4**], so pt switched to cefepime.
2nd GNR isolate speciated to citrobacter, both were sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) 9847**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt was started on [**First Name3 (LF) 9847**] on [**10-7**], with plan for 14d course (day 1 [**10-7**]).
On [**10-10**] pt stable on 2L NC x 2d.
He was treated with albuterol/atrovent nebs prn.
Still with O2 by NC requirement, has been satting in mid-90s with 2-3L NC stably.
Pt received factor IX in ED for unclear reasons, and was given 2U PRBC without bump in HCT (27->28).
ASA and coumadin where held, PPI IV BID started, GI consult obtained, however EGD deferred given ongoing hypotension.
GI deferred inpatient repeat EGD and colonoscopy, but hope to do this later within the next month, as his health status continues to improve, and perhaps after variceal banding.
We continued to hold coumadin and anticoagulation as risk of variceal bleed remains considerable, balance is of risk from GIB versus several week risk of stroke from atrial fibrillation; GIB risk appears at this point to be more severe and immediately worrying.
clinda d/c'd on HD#1 in favor of CTX for broader coverage.
he was started on dopamine gtt HD#1, switched to levophed given excess tachycardia on dopa gtt.
TTE revealed severe RV dysfunction raising concern for PE, however LENI's and CTA were unremarkable.
on HD#2, pt initially doing well after ~1L diuresis overnight (pt felt to be in RV failure, significantly volume overloaded, and with poor starling physiology).
Pt continued to get diuresed, tolerating this well, with stable SBPs, thus levo gtt was weaned off after ~24-36hrs.
Pt did not require pressors after HD#3.
For much of the admission he was on diltiazem for rate control, an inheritance of the diltiazem drip which he had required for rate control in the MICU.
pt diuresed aggressively, with 1-3L removed daily (grossly total body up, likely 10-15L) with lasix gtt + prn lasix, with improvement in O2 sats and creatinine, and transitioned to prn 80mg iv lasix q8h on [**10-7**].
over coarse of HD#[**1-31**] of MICU stay pt with frequent episodes of bradycardia, initially attributed to vagal effects from coughing while on mechanical ventilation.
Pt was placed on extrinsic cardiac pacing pads, with intermittent episodes of bradycardia with coughing requiring pacing.
Rather the pt was started on diltiazem gtt and transitioned to PO diltiazem for rate control.
His coumadin was held pending EGD/colonscopy to evaluate for melena, planned for [**10-10**]; and given varices, this was held until discharge and beyond (see above re GI bleed).
Note that given this recent medication change, periodic monitoring for changes in rate or rhythm will be particularly important for the first several days of his rehabilitation facility stay.
Changed back to metoprolol for discharge, as described above.
Erythema improved with brief [**Name (NI) 621**] course, wrapping LE, elevation, and diuresis as above; this care should continue in his next placement.
