The patient was hydrated with IV fluids.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on [**2101-7-15**] after triggering for desaturations, tachypnea and nursing concerns about her mental status.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was placed on BiPap and given aggressive nebulizer treatments, including albuterol and ipratropium.
These medications were started [**2101-7-15**].
She was quickly weaned off BiPap to nasal cannula O2.
She continued to receive Q3-4hr nebulizer treatments as well as IV/oral steroids and Advair for her comorbid COPD.
A PICC line was placed on [**2101-7-16**] for antibiotic administration.
Of note frequent anxiety attacks have been treated with PRN Ativan with good effect.
The patient will continue aztreonam and vancomycin for a total of 14 days (until [**7-29**]), for pseudomonas and staph coag positive culture data (sputum), organisms are sensitive to these antibiotics.
# COPD/cough: The patient was given steroids and azithromycin in the ED for possible excacerbation, but given the fact that she initially denied having any shortness of breath, steroids and antibiotics were initially held.
During the hospitalization, the patient reported episodes of subjective SOB, as well as coughing, and she was started on a brief course of prednisone 40 mg daily.
She remained on prednisone, and initiated a taper.
We would recommend titrating down to 5mg over the course of ~10d, remaining on the 5mg indefinitely, as she does for her rheumatologic disease.
The patient's cough was treated symptomatically with guafenisen syrup.
# dysphagia: The patient reports having a sensation of food and liquid getting stuck.
Given her radiation therapy, differential can include esophagitis versus stricture formation.
She was continued on omeprazole 20 mg daily.
She was also started on sucralfate, Maalox, and Roxicet as needed for the dysphagia.
Roxicet was discontinued given her avoidance of narcotics.
She was also started on Metoprolol for her tachycardic episodes (see below).
She was placed on Metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as well as ASA81 mg. Metoprolol has been uptitrated to 25mg TID, with good effect (no more tachycardia), she has been arranged for a followup with cardiology as an outpatient.
# HTN: The patient's lisinopril was initially held given her [**Last Name (un) **].
Her fourth cycle of chemotherapy was on hold secondary to her acute illness.
# RA: The patient has history of RA and takes prednisone 5 mg daily.
Of note, the patient is currently undergoing a prednisone taper, and is currently on 20mg.
Transitional Issues: - Abx: aztreonam and vancomycin, started on [**2101-7-15**], recommend 14 day total course - Prednisone: on prednisone for a COPD exacerbation.
currently tapered from 40mg to 20mg (transitioned from 30 --> 20 on [**2101-7-26**]), recommend taper down to 5mg over next 10 days - Continue chemotherapy after stabilized: would recommend f/u w/ oncologist w/in next 1-2 weeks if stable.
