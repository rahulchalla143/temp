He was discharged on meropenem for 6 days.
He was seen by urology and foley irrigation was performed and he was sent out on Levofloxacin with plans to undergo cystoscopy with bladder biopsies and possible resection of TURBT as an outpatient.
He was given vanc and meropenem and, had an IJ placed, 6 L fluid, and foley showed gross hematuria.

Bladder Cancer - s/p transurethral resection in [**7-31**] - completed [**3-29**] BCG treatment (missed treatment 5 [**1-25**] UTI) 8. s/p Stab Wounds 9. h/o RPR - treated in [**2119**] 10. s/p Penile Implant 11.
Foley with red urine in bag.
The left kidney measures 13.1 cm.
Right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC.
There are numerous coronary artery calcifications, as well as calcification of the aortic arch.
Limited axial imaging of the upper abdomen is fairly unremarkable, although numerous renal hypodensities are again seen, which are most consistent with cysts, although better demonstrated on prior imaging studies.
The superior most aspect of an infrarenal IVC filter is seen (2:56).
Brief Hospital Course: 83yo gentleman with h/o bladder cancer, recurrent UTIs, and dementia called out from the MICU for continuing treatment of urosepsis.
# Urosepsis: Patient received 7 L IVF with improvement in blood pressure, never needed vasopressor support.
He was started on meropenem given prior urine cx sensitivities.
His renal function returned to baseline after volume repletion.
PICC line placed and he was treated for 14days with meropenem.
A Foley catheter was placed at admission.
He was noted to be incontinent of urine at baseline.
CT to assess for invasion/ lymph node involvement-> no clear evid of invasion or LN involvement however mult lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
Given massive DVT and need for anticoagulation, discussion had with family/urology/ radiation oncology about possible palliative procedures to stop hematuria and allow for anticoagulation.
Decision was made to proceed with palliative radiation tx as family wished to avoid any further invasive procedures.
Patient underwent palliative radiation in attempt to control hematuria so that he could have anticoagulation given his large lower extremity DVT as below.
# DVT: h/o PE [**1-25**] DVT with IVC in place not anticoagulated due to history of hematuria.
Palliative radiation therapy was given with the goal to control hematuria, however the patient did continue to bleed with anticoagulation.
Given that he bled enough to require multiple transfusions during this admission, it was ultimately felt that anticoagulation should be held with the decision to re-start deferred to the outpatient setting.
# Low grade fevers:  Following treatment with meropenem for urosepsis as above, patient developed recurrent low grade fevers.
He frequently became agitated, pulling at his PICC line and foley.
He frequently required soft restraints to prevent him from injuring himself and occasionally required haldol (ECG checked and QTc wnl).
After his catheter was removed the restraints were removed and he was overall much more calm.
He was transfused a total of 5 units of PRBCs during this admission given blood loss from his friable bladder tumor.
