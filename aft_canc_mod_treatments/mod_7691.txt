A Pleurx catheter enters at the lateral right hemithorax and terminate in the mid medial right hemithorax.
Right chest tube is in place in standard position.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo man with hx of ?a-fib (narrow complex tachycardia) and rate controlled as well as stage IV squamous cell lung Ca who was admitted to the ICU s/p pluerex catheter placement in A-fib with RVR and hypotension.
Hypotension:  He presented with hypotension in the setting of Afib with RVR after pleurex catheter placement.
He was also initially placed on vancomycin/cefepime due to recent instrumentation and potential concern for sepsis.
He was also given stress dose steroids.
The cardiology team felt that while pericardiocentesis could possibly help his short term hemodynamics, he could have a longstanding effusive-constrictive physiology that may require pericardial window.
Risks and benefits of drainage vs pericardial window were discussed with the patient, who expressed a desire to go home and focus on comfort measures.
His rates responded to IV and po metoprolol although dosing was limited due to hypotension.
His home metoprolol dose was decreased due to hypotension but may be able to be uptitrated as an outpatient if tachycardia remains an issue and BPs are stable.
Hypoxia: He had a new oxygen requirement after his procedure in the setting of Afib with RVR and hypotension.
Low grade fevers: He had a low grade fever on admission and was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime.
Stage IV lung Ca: He is s/p multiple rounds of radiation therapy and 2 rounds of chemo, getting vinorelbine when able as an outpatient.
He expressed a desire for a comfort-focused treatment and was discharged with VNA bridge to hospice.
Pleural effusions: He is s/p pleurex catheter placement and developed the hypotension and tachycardia after the procedure.
