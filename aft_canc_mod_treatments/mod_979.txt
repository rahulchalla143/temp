Patient was also treated with a 14 day course of levaquin and flagyl.
#Gastritis- During this hospitalization, pt found to have guaic positive stools.
H. Pylori was equivocal.
He received 14 days of flagyl, [**Hospital1 **] protonix, and 7 days of clarithromycin which should be continued for 7 more days.
[**Hospital1 2591**] are now within normal limits, although the patient did need to be supported with several units of FFP and ddAVP.
# Anemia- in the setting of bilateral groin hematomas and right sided adductor compartment bleed, seen on CT, secondary to emergent attempts at HD catheter placement (eventually placed in the RIJ).
Patient received a total of 8 units of pRBC's with a transfusion threshold of >25.
Aspirin was d/c'd in the setting of acute bleed.
Likely troponin elevated in setting of decreased clearance with ARF, however it peaked at 2.2 s/p dialysis for unclear reasons as [**Name (NI) **] showed EF>55% with normal LV function.
Was initially beta blocked and on aspirin but in the setting of acute bleed and hypotension requiring pressors transiently, these were d/c'd.
Insulin gtt was transitioned over to RISS.
Patient was maintained on 13 units of glargine in the am and sliding scale for coverage.
