A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
The previously seen gas in the disc and vertebral body are likely the result of vacuum phenomenon in the setting of degenerative and post-traumatic change.
Brief Hospital Course: 86M w/HX prostate CA s/p recent orchiectomy, Atrial fibrillation, and remote [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH in setting of AMS and a mechanical fall at home, treated for presumed urosepsis and PNA w/improvement in WBC and mental status to baseline AOX2, but found to have unstable L1 & L2 fractures requiring ongoing bracing, PT, and pain control.
He requiring standing tylenol + PRN oxycodone for pain control (note PO morphine poorly tolerated, caused N/V).
# CONCERN FOR VERTEBRAL OSTEOMYELITIS We note that, given initial CT spine read suggesting possible osteomyelitis/discitis/aortitis and initial lack of history of traumatic injury to his back, he was thoroughly evaluated by interventional neuroradiology, infectious disease, and neurosurgery teams for consideration of vertebral biopsy.
Febrile, leukocytosis >15, and relative hypotension, confusion.
No cultures were ever positive here; OSH cultures also negative (finalized [**2-13**]); however, unable to determine from OSH records whether these cultures were drawn before or after antibiotics were started at the OSH.
Here he received broad-spectrum antibiotics starting on [**2-6**] (vanc/cftx, then vanc/cftx/zosyn, then vanc/cftx).
PICC should be removed in rehab after antibiotics complete.
Will need to watch carefully for fever/mental status changes/new focal symptoms/clinical deterioration in rehab after finishing antibiotics.
# URINARY/FECAL INCONTINENCE Patient found incontinent at home in the setting of a fall.
He will need neurologic re-evaluation if urinary incontinence and leg weakness worsen or persist.
# DELIRIUM Patient confused on arrival in the setting of sepsis; this resolved with antibiotics to treat his underlying process soon after arrival.
No antipsychotic medications required.
# PSEUDOSEIZURES Patient arrived w/hx of two ativan-responsive seizures at OSH and in-transit.
Here he had witnessed episoded of total body tremor overnight [**2-12**] and [**2-13**] and during the day on [**2-14**] which self-resolved without medical intervention.
Recommended no medical intervention, as pt had no benefit with any medications previously tried including dilantin and Mirapex.
Metoprolol was increased in the ICU due to uncontrolled afib there; stable on 50 metoprolol TID on the floor, with HR baseline 70s-80s.
Also on coumadin at home; this was stopped here given possible vertebral biopsy (as above), then restarted on [**2-12**].
Anticoagulated on a heparin gtt when INR drifted <2, is discharged on lovenox bridge while awaiting coumadin therapeutic >2 x48h (because of stroke history).
Continued home lasix and advair inhaler.
After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his troponin leak was thought most likely demand ischemia in the setting of infection-related tachycardia.
Suspect antibiotic-associated diarrhea which should resolve after antibiotics finish.
Discharged off bowel meds per patient request.
Will need encouragement to increase PO intake.
Note oxycodone [**5-1**] well-tolerated, PO morphine caused nausea/vomiting.
Follow-up urinary/fecal incontinence, leg weakness (expect gradual resolution as hematoma resorbs; if no improvement in one week please consider neurology re-evaluation and/or send note with patient to neurosurgery f/u appt) 4.
Metoprolol dose increased in setting of infection, will need HR monitoring and dose decrease as infection resolves.
