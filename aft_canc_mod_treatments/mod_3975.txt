Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 57923**] is a 65-year-old gentleman who was admitted for stem cell transplant and developed overwhelming sepsis 2 weeks into his hospital stay and ultimately passed away with multi-organ failure.
Heme/Onc: He has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma which has been recurrent/refractory following his autologous stem cell transplant and is being admitted today for his non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor with Cytoxan/Fludarabine conditioning regimen.
He was started on a cytoxan/fludarabine conditioning regimen, which he tolerated quite well.
He was treated with methotrexate after the transplant of cells.
He was started on continuous CSA as [**Doctor Last Name **] as empiric antibiotics per protocol.
He was treated per sepsis protocol, given multiple liters of IV NS, given stress dose steroids, started on levophed.
He was started empirically on very broad spectrum abx coverage including fungal coverage given his immunosuppressed state.
An a-line was placed by anesthesia the following morning.
He was intubated by anesthesia as well for shortness of breath in the setting of CHF with massive IVF infusion.
He required increasing level of pressor suppport and was on high doses of three pressors.
The pt was requiring maximal doses of 3 pressors, levophed, dopamine, and phenylephrine to maintain map around 60.
Broad spectrum abx coverage was continued, vital signs were supported.
Ultrasound guided cholecystotomy was performed to drain a suspected source of infection.
Blood cultures were found to be positive for E. coli and viridans strep, which were sensitive to the antibiotics which he was on.
Amiodarone was infused IV with the plan to cardiovert, although the pt spontaneously returned to NSR at roughly 130 bpm.
The following morning, on [**4-9**], the pt was found to be on an irreversible course toward passing away.
His bp was dropping below life sustaining levels despite maximal pressor support, liver tests indicated hepatocellular damage likely from hypoperfusion, acidemia was becoming more severe.
Medications on Admission: Aerosolized pentamidine each monthly, last given on [**2186-3-6**], magnesium oxide 1 tablet b.i.d., Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d., Valtrex 500 mg b.i.d., atenolol 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily, Epivir 100 mg daily, fluconazole 200 mg daily.
