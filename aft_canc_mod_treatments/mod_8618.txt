Started on Vancomycin, Cefepime for HCAP, and Levofloxacin to cover atypicals.
The patient was maintained on the vent during his ICU course, and early on met criteria for ARDS and so was placed on ARDSnet vent settings.
He tolerated these setting well, but showed little signs of improvement, thus precluding attempts to wean the ventilator.
