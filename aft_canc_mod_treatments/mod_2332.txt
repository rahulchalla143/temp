Her AML has persisted and she is s/p 6 total cycles of Decitabine last given on [**2134-11-25**] with a 2nd DLI given after her 4th cycle.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] has remained pancytopenic requiring transfusion support and has required periodic admissions with fever and infections.
She was treated with Zosyn/Vancomycin for six days while hospitalized and her cellulitis markedly improved.
She received her 6th cycle of Decitabine as planned on [**2134-11-25**] and her 3rd DLI on [**2134-12-14**].
Her peripheral blast count has been increasing and she underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2135-1-10**] which unfortunately showed increasing blasts in the biopsy.
After further discussion of treatment options, the decision was made to [**Year (4 digits) 10836**] froward with more intensive chemotherapy with MEC in hopes of getting her leukemia in better control and then move forward with another DLI.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor - s/p partial pancreatectomy/splenectomy in [**2126**], with recurrence in pancreatic tail in [**2129**] treated with octreotide then bevacizumab/Temodar until cycle 15, day 15 on [**2131-7-18**]; liver metastasis in [**2130**] treated with chemoembolization 9/[**2130**].
Follow up CT scans that have showed some persistent lesions in the liver, but no clear evidence of growth of her neuroendocrine tumor.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and she underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2133-4-28**], which revealed involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with monoblasts and monocytes accounting for 29% of the aspirate differential, categorized as AML, FAB subtype M5B.
Treated with induction chemnotherpy on [**2133-5-5**] and achieved complete remission; subsequently received two cycles of high-dose ARA-C with continued remission.
Treatment course complicated by an episode of acute appendicitis with E. coli bacteremia and s/p appendectomy.
Neurologic workup during her admission to evaluate her symptoms of transient weakness, shakiness, and headaches were felt consistent with conversion disorder.
Matched sibling reduced intensity allogeneic transplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG on [**2133-9-16**].
Her initial post transplant course was essentially uneventful.
Nasal washings were positive for parainfluenza with no pneumonia.
She completed a 10 day course of Tamiflu and 5 day course of Zithromax.
In [**1-/2134**], platelet count continued to decrease and repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2134-2-18**] did not show any evidence for recurrent leukemia but was noted for Trisomy 8.
Because of persistent drop in her neutrophil count and platelet count, she underwent repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2134-3-4**] which showed increased blasts with CD34-blasts comprising 10-15% of marrow cellularity.
Trisomy 8 was evident and she was now 85% donor.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] received modified cytarabine therapy from [**Date range (2) 44392**] followed by her DLI on [**2134-3-26**].
Noted for increased liver function transaminases and bilirubin with acute GVHD, Grade III.
Treated with high dose steroids with resolution.
Admitted on [**2134-3-27**] with fevers and right hand cellulits and sinus infection with conjunctivitis.
Prolonged admission with IV antibiotics.
AML persisted despite the GVHD and with improvement of her liver function tests, Ms. [**Known lastname **] received 1st cycle Decitabine at 20mg/m2 for 5 days starting on [**2134-5-7**].
Treated with IV antibiotics.
Received IV Vancomycin along with IV Zosyn.

Continues with Trisomy 8 abnormality.
5th cycle of Dacogen which was given on [**2134-10-28**].
Admitted on [**2134-11-13**] with periorbital cellulitis.
Treated with IV Zosyn with resolution.
6th cycle of Decitabine on [**2134-11-25**].
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor status post partial pancreatectomy/splenectomy in [**2126**] with recurrence in the pancreatic tail in [**2129**] treated initially with octreotide then bevacizumab/Temodar until cycle 15 and day 15 on [**2131-7-18**] and was stopped due to decrease of tumor burden.
She was then noted to have liver metastasis treated with chemoembolization in 09/[**2130**].
Appendectomy on [**2133-5-15**].
Status post open cholecystectomy [**31**]/[**2131**].

MEC treatment was initiated on [**2135-1-18**] and DLI was initiated on [**2135-2-17**].
Following her admission, she developed fevers for which she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Her symptoms improved on these antibiotics and she remained afebrile.
Her symptoms recurred again in [**Month (only) 958**], with continued blasts on peripheral smear after MEC and 1 week post-DLI with extreme fatigue and gum pain felt to be related to recurrent leukemia.
She was started on a mylotarg/azacitadine regimen on [**3-3**], but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fevers and hypotension later that night.
Her chemotherapy was continued through her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay and she completed her mylotarg/azacitadine course.
She had been on a PO antibiotics regimen and she was converted back to an IV regimen.
Her fevers persisted through vancomycin + cefepime, although she did remain normotensive.
Fungal coverage was added with voriconazole in addition to flagyl but her fevers persisted.
She was initiated on daptomycin, and repeated urine cultures were negative.
Ms [**Known lastname **] continued to have peripheral blasts (between [**1-22**] on peripheral diff); given continued blasts, decitabine was initiated on [**3-24**].
She tolerated decitabine therapy well.
Following completion of daptomycin course for 10 days, her fevers resolved and she was afebrile for 5 days prior to discharge.
Her flagyl was discontinued and her cefepime was transitioned to PO cefpodoxime.
After discontinuation of dapto and conversion to PO regimen of cefpodoxime, Ms [**Known lastname **] continued to be afebrile > 72 hours.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Acute myeloid leukemia - Neutropenia  Secondary: - Diabetes mellitus - Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion.
You first received the MEC regimen (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) and donor lymphocyte infusions.
Following these treatments, we waited for your bone marrow to recover, however you had continued numbers of blasts in your blood, suggesting that your AML needed further treatment.
You also did develop a jaw infection and a low blood pressure with fevers for which we kept you on several antibiotics and briefly admitted you to the intensive care unit.
Your blood pressure improved with antibiotics and we decided to start treating your AML again given continued blasts.
Following a second round of chemotherapy with azacitadine/mylotarg, your blast count improved somewhat, however we did a third round with decitabine to keep your blast count low.
You continued to have fevers which required us to keep you on antibiotics for several weeks.
At time of discharge, you had repeatedly clear blood and urine cultures with no fevers for five days prior to your discharge.
(2) We decreased your morning oxycontin dose to 40 mg and we decreased your evening oxycontin dose to 40 mg.  You should continue the 20 mg afternoon oxycontin.
(5) You can take Ativan as needed for nausea.
You should continue your other antibiotics as usual (posaconazole and acyclovir).
Prior to this you will get a pentamidine treatment at 10:00 AM on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] ([**Location (un) 19201**], rm 116).
