Etiology of her stroke appears to be cardioembolic from Afib in the setting of discontinuation of coumadin for a GU procedure.
Because of the risk of bleeding at this point (from PEG, GU, and hemorrhagic transformation) we will NOT start coumadin yet.
Instead, she should be on a full dose aspirin for secondary prevention.
