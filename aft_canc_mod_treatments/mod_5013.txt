Transesophageal echocardiography   History of Present Illness: 61 y M with a history of metastatic lung cancer to his right hip, liver (with question as to whether the lung is primary) being treated with carboplatin and gemcytabine (last dose 11/3) who was in his usual state of health until [**2149-10-8**] when he began to feel weak.
During his stay there he received 4u FFP (coags were reportedly normal throughout), 9u PRBC and 14 bags of platelets.
He received a colonoscopy once his neutropenia ([**1-2**] chemotherapy) resolved, which showed cecal ulcers (radiation vs. ischemia vs. Crohn's), sigmoid diverticulosis, internal hemmorhoids, but no bleeding.

He was started on a PPI.
H. pylori serology was negative.
Colonoscopy showed cecal ulcers, sigmoid divertics, and internal hemmorhoids.
Given his abnormal coagulation studies, we held heparin for DVT prophylaxis (he did wear pneumoboots).
In addition, the patient had a Foley for several days and a U/A was mildly positive with trace leuks, [**2-2**] RBC, [**5-10**] WBC, and few bacteria.
His foley catheter was removed.
We started him on a 10-day course of levaquin 500 mg PO qd.
He was started on vancomycin.
Azithromycin and cefepime were added to his antibiotic regimen.
There was a question of a post-obstructive pneumonia that was discussed with radiology and interventional pulmonology.
They recommended IV vancomycin and cefepime for 14 days and then subsequent blood cultures to ensure that the bacteria was cleared from the blood.
It was decided to leave the port in place, continue IV antibiotics and repeat cultures.
If cultures continue to be positive after 2 weeks of vancomycin and cefepime, port removal will need to be re-addressed.
# R hip pain: The patient continued his outpatient regimen of fentanyl and oxycontin.
He continued to have significant pain which impaired his ability to ambulate, so we increased his dose of oxycontin to and treated him with oxycodone prn.
It was recommended to his oncologist that he consider using a new narcotic regimen and possibly incorporating methadone.
His last dose of vancomycin and cefepime should be [**11-5**].
He will draw labs: vancomycin trough, cbc, ast, alt, and creatinine q weekly and have them faxed to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11382**].
