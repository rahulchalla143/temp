Both the lesions have areas of negative susceptibility representing blood products/melanin as well as heterogeneous enhancement with nonenhancing necrotic areas.
Prominent extra-axial CSF space in the superior aspect of the posterior fossa causing indentation on the superior part of the cerebellum as described above, which can represent prominent CSf space with a differential diagnosis of arachnoid cyst in this location.
