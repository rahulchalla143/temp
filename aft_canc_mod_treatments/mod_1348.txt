He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotic empirically as culture data was sent.
Vancomycin was changed to linezolid.
The pt remained hypotensive on pressors for the next several days and a work-up was initiated to determine the source of infection.
GI and Surgery were [**Year/Month/Day 4221**] for assistance in the management of these problems.
For the pancolitis, the pt was kept NPO and he was treated for possible c. diff infection while c. diff cultures were sent and found to be positive.
It was unable to be confirmed on imaging whether these lesions on CT which were new compared with a previous scan in [**10-1**] were abscesses vs possible mets from an unknown primary.
The GI team suggested an MRI to further evaluate the liver lesions although this was unable to be pursued because the pt was too unstable requiring pressors for bp support.
We explained to the family that we would need a NGT place in order to feed him and give him some of his medicines now that he is having trouble swallowing given his mental status.
Also we have explained that we still not have a clear dx on his liver lesions, and in order to obtained a dx he might need a surgical intervention for biopsy.
The antibiotics and pressors were d/c'ed.
A morphine drip was started for pain.
His blood pressure was in the 80s-90s systolic off pressors and his extremities continued to show evidence of perfusion.
Continued sinvastatin, aspirin until made CMO.
BB and BP medications were held in the setting of hypotension .
Peripheral vascular disease: continued plavix, Aspirin until CMO The vascular team followed the pt.
DM: insulin sliding scale was continued before the pt was made CMO.
FEN: He was kept NPO given the colitis and sepsis.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine until CMO.
# PPX: Pantoprazole, pneumoboots until CMO.
#Code: DNR-DNI was changed to CMO on [**2-6**] .
