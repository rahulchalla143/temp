Admission Date:  [**2128-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-8-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-2-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatic head mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Whipple procedure, [**2128-8-3**]  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was a 65 year old woman with no significant past medical history who was well until approximately one month prior to admission when she presented with jaundice and weight loss to an OSH.
She initially underwent ERCP at [**Hospital **] hospital with a plastic stent placed on a stricture but without biopsy due to her ASA 81mg adily.
This was removed, brushings were taken, and a self expanding metal stent was placed in the CBD.
Patient was discharged on [**7-10**] with cholestyramine and augmentin.
She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for another ERCP on [**2128-7-16**] and scheduled for surgery on [**2128-8-3**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was taken to the operating room for a Whipple procedure and cholecystectomy on [**2128-8-3**].
The operation proceeded without complication.
Her narcotics were removed from her epidural and overall pain regimen.
A UTI was suspected based on UA dipstick and ciprofloxacin was started but stopped the next day after the urine cx returned no growth and no clinical signs of infection.
From a nutritional perspective, she was transitioned from NPO to sips on POD 4, to clears on POD 5, to fulls on POD 7 and to a regular diet with pureed consistency on POD 8.
She had several loose bowel movements, sample sent for c.diff and started on empiric flaygl therapy.
On POD 10, Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**] confusion returned intermittently, improved from prior but but she appearing more tired, especially after getting out of bed with physical therapy and after a 2.5 mg dose of oxycodone.
Oxycodone was thereafter removed from her medication list and replaced solely with tylenol.She had fewer loose bowel movements.
She was actively coded for 10 minutes prior to regaining a pulse with chest compressions performed throughout, receiving three shocks, epinephrine, bicarbonate and vasopressin.
She ultimately regained a pulse and was transferred to the SICU.
It was decided to manage her non-operatively with close monitoring with serial hematocrits, with fluid resuscitation and a low dose neo drip.
Initially her bladder pressures were monitored frequently to monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome due to an on-going bleed.
Her pressors were turned off entirely on [**2128-8-17**] and she remained hemodynamically stable for the next few days and her renal function improved gradually(1.2 on [**8-17**] to 0.6 on [**8-22**]).
She had some low blood pressure issues (SBPs in the 80s) and low urine output (20 cc/hr, Cr bumped suddenly to 1.7 from 0.6) for which she received a IVF boluses including both crystalloid and albumin, eventually had pressors restarted for a short period of time then dc'd after her toes were found to be blue then restarted after her toe ischemia resolved and pressures dropped again, this time with limited change in color of the toes.
Her fluid overload status continued to worsen by both clinical (edema, decreased pO2 on ABG) and radiologic measures (worsening CXR).
A lasix drip was started on [**2128-8-26**] and diuresis was successful (she was negative almost 800 ml as opposed to daily positive in I's/O's since ICU admission) but her blood pressure did not tolerate it and it was dc'd shortly thereafter.
She was thought to have had some seizure-like activity the morning of the 26th ( morning after the PEA arrest) which resolved when treated with midazolam.
She failed to regain any meaningful neurologic function two days post the PEA event, even with sedation weaned and turned off.
The EEG revealed  nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and she was treated with keppra and ativan starting [**2128-8-17**].
She continued to be minimally reactive even with sedation off throughout her final days and did not improve.
The team recommended continued support and the family concurred with wishes to continue all efforts.
Her poor prognosis was explained and the family agreed to a plan of DNR but continued life-sustaining medications until further discussions with the rest of the family for comfort-measures-only and withdrawal-of-care.
Mr. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Known lastname 87585**], the patient's husband, indicated the family's desire to withdraw life-sustaining measures and switch to comfort-measures-only on [**8-28**].
Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**] medications were discontinued.
She was extubated at approximately 4:35 PM on Saturday, [**2128-8-28**] with morphine administration for comfort.
Of note, on an ID front, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was started on flagyl on [**8-14**] for empiric therapy of loose stools thought to be C. Diff.
Initially broad based antibiotic therapy was started (vanc/cipro/flagyl) and was further refined (nafcillin/cipro) when sensitivites showed MSSA on [**8-23**].
Post operative delirium 3.
