She tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to the PACU, and then the SICU intubated and in stable condition.
Her postoperative course is summarized below by systems: Neuro: Patient became agitated and confused with hallucinations on POD1, consistent with post op delirium.
She was given haldol PRN with good effect.
Her neurontin and amitriptyline qHS (for peripheral neuropathy) were initially held given her altered mental status and then restarted on POD8.
Her Lopressor dose was increased from 50 [**Hospital1 **] to 75 TID with good effect.
Patient was sating well on RA by POD5 and continued so to the day of discharge.
She received chlorhexidine washes QID.
A Dobbhoff was placed intraoperatively and was started on continuous TFs on POD1.
Plastics would like her NPO for 2 weeks from the time of her surgery (end date [**2104-1-15**]).
Prophylactic augmentin while drain in place.
It is encouraged that she follow up with her primary care physician to discuss another colonoscopy given her anemia and h/o GI bleeds.
Endocrine followed in house and made minor adjustments to RISS to tailor cycled tube feeds.
Her blood sugar tended to bottom out late afternoon but peaked during cycled tube feeding at night.
JP drain #2 of the neck was removed on POD4.
The left sided JP drain (#1) will remain until f/u with plastics.
Her hyponatremia was likely caused by mild dehydration - with an appropriate increase in ADH - even though she had adequate UO and no creatinine bump during her postoperative course.
Free water boluses were increased to 200mL TID.
She also received 500ml NS IV bolus before discharge today.
She is receiving all meds via the dobhoff.
