At that time was found to be supra therapeutic on Coumadin for her h/o atrial fibrillation (INR of 7) and was also anemic.
The pelvic mass was discovered at that time; she subsequently was discharged after adjustment of her anti-coagulation and transfusion for anemia.
In the Intensive Care Unit, she received vasopressin for blood pressure support as well as vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl for presumed urosepsis due to her initial hypotension and a leukocytosis of 18.7 with 6 bands, although U/A showed only [**2-20**] WBC.
Urology was consulted for possible stent placement, but opted to begin with hydration, after which her renal function eventually improved.
Her blood pressure also normalized, and the vasopressin was discontinued.
Hyperkalemia was treated with Kayexelate, after which she developed loose stools (C. diff.
Urine cx grew out yeast only and blood cx were negative, so her antibiotics were stopped and fluconazole was initiated on the day of transfer.
She was also placed on a heparin drip for anti-coagulation both for atrial fibrillation and her bilateral DVT.
Rate control was achieved with metoprolol and digoxin.

She was transferred here for further management after she was stablized and extubated at [**Hospital3 3583**].
On [**2194-1-7**] (on hospital day #4) she underwent surgery as above.
Her hospital course was complicated by the following issues:  *) CARDIOVASCULAR:     *) POST-OP HYPOTENSION:  In the immediate post-operative period, the patient's blood pressure was maintained on a Levophed and Phenylephrine drip in the ICU.
Her hypotension improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood products.
Her Levophed drip was discontinued on POD#2 and her Phenylephrine drip was discontinued on POD#3.
She did not require pressors for the remainder of her hospitalization and was subsequently transferred out of the ICU on POD#6     *) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
While in the ICU, she briefly required a esmolol drip for rate control while on pressors.
Once transferred out of the ICU, the patient remained rate controlled on Lopressor and Digoxin.
It was noted that her Lopressor dose had been held secondary to mildly low blood pressure.
The hold parameters on her Lopressor were changed and the patient was given her usual dose of PO Lopressor with good rate control.
*) HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION: Her antihyperentive medications, including Lisinopril 5mg qdaily and HCTZ 25mg qdaily were held throughout her hospitalization, however she did receive Lopressor and Digoxin.
Post-operatively, she remained intubated in the ICU secondary to massive fluid volume resusicitation and blood products.
She received IV Lasix daily x 6 days.
She remained on oxygen via nasal cannula until POD#7.
The patient was placed on a heparin drip.
On the day prior to surgery, that patient had an IVC filter placed without difficulty.
Her heparin drip was restarted two hours after filter placement and then held 8 hours prior to her scheduled surgery on [**2194-1-7**].
Her heparin drip was restarted POD#3 with no evidence of bleeding.
She remained on heparin until POD#11, at which time she was started on Lovenox 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
At [**Hospital1 46**], she was treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl.
Her urine culture revealed yeast, therefore IV Fluconazole was added and she was treated for 5 days.
Her broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued, however her Fluconazole was continued for 5 days.
She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin, Kefzol, and Flagyl for 72 hours post-op.
She was bolused 500cc normal saline and her urine output responded appropriately.
She was started on prophylactic Macrobid 100mg qdaily on POD#13 to be given as long as the patient's foley is in place.
*) GI:  The patient remained NPO until POD#7, when her NG tube was removed and her diet was advanced to clear liquids.
She remained on an insulin sliding scale until POD#9, at which time her Glimepiride 4mg was restarted.
Per the patient, she is also on a Novolin sliding scale at home, but she could not remember her usual regimen.
Of note, the patient did receive stress dose steriods on POD#1.
She was treated with PO diflucan once.
*) PHYSICAL THERAPY: The patient has been followed by physical therapy throughout her hospitalization.
*) ACCESS: The patient initially had a left subclavian line which was removed on POD#7, at which time a PICC line was placed by interventational radiology.
Her PICC line was removed on her day of discharge.
