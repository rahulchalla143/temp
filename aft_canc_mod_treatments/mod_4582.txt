PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # CHF (ef 40% on TTE [**8-26**], class III) # [**Month/Year (2) 2091**] - on dialysis # CAD s/p CABG [**75**] years ago c/b sternal wound infection # Extensive PVD # DVT - now on Coumadin indefinitely # Obesity # Hyperparathyroidism # Hypothyroidism # Anxiety # Type 2 DM # COPD # Benign Hypertension # Anemia (Hct baseline high 20s), also had a GI bleed back in [**2177**] requiring 12 units.
T3 (thoracic 3) vertebral body- mild anterior wedging and superior end-plate depression.
[**7-19**] CXR: FINDINGS:  The right-sided hemodialysis catheter has been removed.
She was treated with dexamethasone to suppress inflammation.
It was recommended that the patient should be on seizure prophylaxis with dilantin.
Although the patient has multiple comorbidities, neurosurgical intervention was thought to be potentially life-saving.
The patient was given a 500mg IV bolus of dilantin.
On [**7-19**] the patient was transferred to the neurosurgical service and went to the OR for a craniotomy and resection of tumor.
She was discharged on a Decadron taper.
#  [**Month/Day (4) 2091**]:  The patient was continued on HD M,W,F.
She was also started on Nephrocaps.
On [**2177-7-21**], the patient had Hemodialysis and 7 liters were taken off.
# CAD s/p CABG [**75**] years ago c/b sternal wound infection:  EKG unchanged.
The patient's home medications were continued.
Given the fact that her intracranial mass was going to be surgically resected, it was decided that IR placement of IVC filter was indicated, as anticoagulation would have to be avoided for a few weeks postoperatively.
# Type 2 DM: As per the patient, has not been taking any medications since starting HD.
The patient was maintained on insulin sliding scale during the hospitalization.
However, after her dexamethasone was increased, her sugars remained very elevated, and ultimately she was started on long acting Lantus 30 units daily, in addition to sliding scale while she was an inpatient.
