HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 74 year old male with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lungs, embolic cerebrovascular accident history with residual left-sided paresis, atrial fibrillation, status post failed cardioversion times three, left ventricular hypertrophy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2169-1-22**] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decompensated on the floor and was in severe respiratory distress and was intubated on [**2169-1-26**].
The patient there received radiation to the chest for two weeks and suffered radiation burns to his back.
The patient was also treated for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and Clostridium difficile there.
He was transferred here for evaluation of placement of a stent palliatively.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs diagnosed in [**2161**], status post two cycles of IL2 and status post nephrectomy, embolic cerebrovascular accident with residual left hemiparesis, atrial fibrillation status post unsuccessful cardioversion times three on Lovenox for anticoagulation, left ventricular hypertrophy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, nasal polyps, thyroid disease not otherwise specified, adrenal nodules.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Flovent 100 mcg inhaled b.i.d., Cardizem 120, 60, 60 q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneously b.i.d., the patient only on Coumadin at home, Reglan 10 p.o.
6, Vancomycin 750 mg intravenously q.
Flagyl 500 mg intravenously t.i.d., Respalor tube feeds start [**2-8**], at the outside hospital, Colace, Senna, Lasix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d., Silvadene ointment to back, Albuterol and Albuterol nebulizers, Morphine prn, Milk of magnesia and Ativan prn.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed temperature 98.0, blood pressure 117/32, respiratory rate 23, pulse of 123, pulse oximetry 94% on EC ventilation 400 cc by 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure 5, 50% oxygen.
He was started on a sepsis protocol with an initial lactate of 4.9, white count increased from 13.4 to 16.5 and the patient was in atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
The patient was restarted on Vancomycin, kept on Flagyl and placed on Ceftazidime to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Gram stain and sputum culture were sent off and came back positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
He is continued on his Ceftazidime and Vancomycin.
As he began to do better in terms of his sepsis profile, his atrial fibrillation became the next issue preventing him from going to the Operating Room for his rigid bronchoscopy with stenting.
He was initially given fluid and was started on Diltiazem and Digoxin and anticoagulated with Lovenox.
Electrophysiology Service was asked to see him and they recommended adding a beta blocker and checking an echocardiogram and discontinuing the Digoxin.
The beta blocker was added, Lopressor 5 mg intravenously q.
6 hours, after which his atrial fibrillation remained under reasonable control with less rapid ventricular response and no more episodes of supraventricular tachycardia versus ventricular tachycardia and Electrophysiology felt that he was stable to go to the Operating Room.
He was also given a percutaneous tracheostomy at that time.
He tolerated the procedure extremely well and returned back to us on the ventilator.
He then proceeded to put out copious amounts of secretions and with initial attempts to wean the ventilator after the procedure were futile and he was kept on pressure support ventilation 15 and 5 with good ventilation at that time.
The patient was given fluids and the creatinine improved to .8.
Tubes, lines and drains - Right PICC was placed on [**2-10**].
The patient is on an orogastric tube on tube feeds, rectal tube, Foley catheter and a left arterial line was placed on [**2-20**].
Lingering issues - It is thought that the patient should have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed prior to discharge to rehabilitation.
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy may be placed next week.
Status post interventional pulmonary procedure with placement of two bronchial stents, one in the left main stem bronchus and one in the right bronchus intermedius.
