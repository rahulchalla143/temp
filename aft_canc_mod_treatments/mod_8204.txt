Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo female with history of ER/PR positive breast DCIS s/p ex lap, resection of tumor, infragastric omentectomy, left hemicolectomy, end colostomy, BSO for advanced ovarian cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for post-procedure extubation and hypotension and another ICU admission for flash pulmonary edema.
#ICU admission #1 for hypotension, intubation, require intense monitoring immediately post-operation: 2 liters of ascitic fluid was drained upon opening of her abdomen, estimated blood loss for the surgery was 1 liter.
During the surgery, patient transiently dropped her blood pressure during the procedure to 50s/30s, she was initiated on phenylephrine gtt through peripheral IV.
She received 10 liters NS IVF during her procedure, ~2 liters NS while in PACU, 2 units PRBCs, 2 units FFP.
Pt was gradually weaned off the phenylephrine gtt.
IV Lasix was administered with good urine output during her 2nd ICU stay.
She was placed on IV Nitro drip for a period of time for SBP in the 150-160's.
Nitro drip was weaned off and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily was initiated.
Cardiology recommended aspirin of 81 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, continue with home medication Lisinopril 40 mg daily and Simvastatin.
BiPAP was gradually weaned off and pt was transferred out of ICU with saturation in her 90's on NC of 2-3L.
Pt will follow up as outpatient with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 32255**] (cardiologist) [**2159-8-16**] for medication adjustment and possible outpatient perfusion imaging versus catheterization.
# Hypotension: she had large volume fluid shifts during surgery and hypovolemia due to blood loss.
She received 12 liters IVF resuscitation, and was placed transiently on phenylephrine gtt for pressure support and on propofol for sedation.
Her sedation and vasopressors were weaned without any difficulty, and her blood pressure remained normal at the time of transfer out of the ICU and continue to be stable prior to discharge to rehab.
She received aggressive fluid resuscitation due to hypotension (see above) and some component of her HCT drop is likely dilutional.
She was transfused with 4 units blood cells and 2 units of FFP throughout her hospital stay, and her HCT was stable at 41 at the time of transfer to rehab.
# s/p Intubation: Patient was intubated for surgical procedure and was admitted to the ICU sedated with propofol.
# Advanced ovarian carcinoma: s/p ex lap with resection of tumor, infragastric omentectomy, left hemicolectomy, end colostomy, BSO, and optimally debulked.
She will continue treatment as outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15759**].
#Ostomy care: s/p consult and teaching from ostomy nurses.
Chronic issues: # Hypertension: continued home med lisinopril, additional anti-HTN meds were added due to the heart failure ( Lasix 20 mg daily, Carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily)  # Asthma: continued home meds fluticasone and nebs PRN  # Depression/anxiety: Continued home meds bupropion and sertraline  # Hypercholesterolemia: Continued home meds simvastatin   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
