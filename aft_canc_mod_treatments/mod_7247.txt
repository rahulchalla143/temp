Likely secondary to use of steroids used for possible brain met.
Patient maintained on insulin sliding scale.
Truvada on hold given renal failure, Kaletra on hold given risk of resistance.
HAART held on discharge, however given CD4 < 200 he will be started on pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Wound care team consulted, provided assistance for management on discharge.
Patient could receive heparin due to concern for GIB, Venodynes used instead.
[**Month (only) 116**] be partially due to use of dexamethasone, however this remained elevated throughout admission regardless of antibiotic use.

You were transferred here from a hospital in [**Country 4754**], where you had been treated for pneumonia, nausea, vomiting, and fever.
You had recently completed a course of chemotherapy, but given your kidney injury and infection, it was not possible to continue this treatment.
The rapid progression of your disease despite chemotherapy did not support further treatment.
Our Renal team saw you and did not recommend dialysis for your kidney failure.
During your stay, you were treated with antibiotics for infection, IV fluids and bowel decompression for your bowel obstruction, and pain and nausea medications.
You received a duodenal stent to keep your bowel open and to allow you to eat and drink.
While here you were started on multiple medications.
The medications are: - Albuterol and iprotropium nebulizers to help with your breathing.
- metoprolol to control your heartrate - ondansetron and olanzapine as needed to help with nausea - docusate and senna to help with constipation - aluminum hydroxide to prevent your phosphate from getting too high - pantoprazole to lower the acid in your stomach and prevent bleeds - lorazepam as needed to help with anxiety - potassium chloride to prevent low potassium levels - pentamidine once a month to prevent lung infections - oxycodone as needed for pain  You should NOT take your HIV meds for the time being.
If your condition improves, you can discuss possibly restarting these medications in the future with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**].
