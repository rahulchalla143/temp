Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and gynecological oncology mentioned to the patient that she was not a candidate for surgical resection of her disease because of the wide spread metastases on her CT of the chest.

In [**2190-3-11**], her treatment with FOLFIRI plus Avastin had to be held because she underwent toe amputations related to her diabetes mellitus.
