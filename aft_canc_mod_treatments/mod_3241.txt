Because of significant fluid and blood administration (3u pRBCs) intraoperatively, 10 mg of IV furosemide were also administered.
His blood pressure was adequately controlled on prn IV hydralazine as well as IV lopressor.
He progressed slowly with his post-operative course - his pain was initially controlled on a combination of a dilaudid PCA and a Bupivicaine PCEA.
Nevertheless, the patient was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.
He was started empirically on a seven-day course of levofloxacin.
His amlodipine was increased to 10 mg daily, and his hypertension was improved after he underwent auto-diuresis of the fluid resusication that he received immediately postoperatively.
On POD 3, some erythema was noted around his L flank incision and IV vancomycin was started.
This was D/C'ed before discharge, as the erythema was completely resolved and the patient remained on levofloxacin.
His nasal cannula oxygen was weaned to off before discharge with ambulation and chest physiotherapy.
He was discharged ambulating, with his pain adequately controlled on PO pain meds, tolerating a regular diet, and with his foley catheter draining well.
He was given explicit instructions to call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the day after discharge to arrange for a follow-up appointment within one week for staple and foley catheter removal.
The rehab facility was also given instructions not to remove his foley catheter until his follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
