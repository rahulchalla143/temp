LCX: occluded OM2, 50% LCX RCA: Occluded  Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who presented with an STEMI s/p catheterization and was incidentally found to have multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Her TIMI risk score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.
Due to the timing of the SVG placement over 20 years ago, it was thought that her LAD had managed to self revascularize and was partially supplied by the RCA.
She was started on routine ACS medications: eptifibatide for 18 hrs, plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, captopril, and atorvastatin.
Initially, patient  was started on coumadin for ventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly discontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit.
CXR showed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole.
Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl of which she completed a 10 day course.
Respiratory status remained tenuous, patient requiring high flow O2 with 6LNC with desaturations to high 70s with activity.
A shovel mask may be used to assist with oxygenation as needed.
A tissue diagnosis was not attained given the patient's high oxygen requirement and anticoagulation with plavix/asa in the setting of recent BMS placement.
Empiric therapy with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] chemotherapy was initiated on [**1-7**] with Pemetrexed.
She received dexamethasone on [**1-8**] to prevent rash.
She was treated prophylactically with mucomyst prior to and post IV contrast dose.
