EGD demonstrated angioectasias in the 2nd part of the duodenum which was the likely source of blood loss - a clip was placed in this region.
Following these procedures, his blood counts remained stable, and he was discharged to home with an increased dose of protonix and instructions to discontinue aspirin until instructed otherwise by his PCP.
He was transfused with pRBC to maintain Hct>27.
It was recommended that he avoid ASA secondary to bleeding; his BB and ACEI were also held given his low blood pressure and active GIB.
b) Afib: Continued Amiodarone, follow QT intervals with serial EKGs; held anti-coag given active bleeding c) CHF/hypotension: Pt has been evaluated in the past for TVR though he was not felt to be a candidate given comorbidities.
Restarted outpatient diuretics once Hct and BP were stable.
d) PPx: as above, and continued statin  Abdominal ascites: This was evaluated in the past and was felt to be secondary to R-sided CHF from 4+TR rather than cirrhosis.
He received an uncomplicated paracentesis during which 7 liters of fluid were removed - this was mainly performed for the patient's comfort.
Standing doses of spironolactone and lasix were restarted prior to discharge.
This was improved with IVF and blood transfusions - creatinine trended towards his baseline of 1.3.
Hypothyroidism: Continued outpatient dose of levothyroxine  Access: 3 peripheral IVs  FEN: Advanced diet slowly following GI procedures, and he was given lasix as needed with his transfusions.
PPx: He was given pneumoboots and PPI [**Hospital1 **] for prophylaxis.
