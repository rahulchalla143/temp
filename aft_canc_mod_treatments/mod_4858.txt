He was given one day of vancomycin but this was stopped when blood culture was consistent with contamination.
Pt was initially started on cefepime.
On hospital day #1, pt had no further fevers and coverage was changed to cipro/Flagyl for better abdominal coverage.
Pt was continued on empiric cefepime.
After full discussion with the primary oncology team and surgery, it was determined that paracentesis would be extremely risky.
Given pt's worsening functional status, a family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] occurred and the pt and his family agreed that if the pt did not improve over the next couple days that pursuing comfort measures would be the pt's desire.
On [**2118-2-11**], the pt and family decided to pursue comfort measures only.
