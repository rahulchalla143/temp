The patient has been complaining of right pleuritic chest pain, cough, and fevers.
A biopsy of this consolidation showed that it was a mucoid mycosis, and consequently Thoracic Surgery was consulted on [**8-14**] to evaluate the need to resect the right upper lobe.
The patient was started on AmBisome and Levaquin while he was admitted on the Oncology Service.
The patient was placed on Levaquin and AmBisome by the Oncology Service on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   He has been receiving chemotherapy during his admission to the Oncology Service.
After much discussion, the decision was made to go ahead with this thoracotomy and resection of his right upper lobe.
The patient was then consented for this procedure and was taken to the operating room on [**2115-8-16**].
Initially, the patient's ventilator was placed on pressure control ventilation, trying to control his airway pressures so that the stump of the side where the pneumonectomy was performed would not be blown out.
Moreover, his blood pressure began to drop, requiring the addition of Neo-Synephrine to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure.
In the morning of [**8-19**], the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s despite very high doses of Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.
Status post right pneumonectomy.
