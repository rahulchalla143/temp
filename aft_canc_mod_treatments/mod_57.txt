A few squamous cells, histiocytes, scattered lymphocytes,   and many red blood cells.
There are calcifications along the right, the left anterior descending, and the left circumflex coronary arteries.
Widely metastatic disease with innumerable peritoneal implants, including a large left upper quadrant mass, and bulky iliac and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old woman with CLL, multiple new abdominal masses, new bladder mass, with RLL PE, with concern for anticoagulation given hematuria.
Patient has now presented with right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and with concern for anticoagulation given hematuria.
IVC filter placement was requested.
RADIOLOGISTS: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**], the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising throughout the entire procedure.
After injection of local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and using ultrasound guidance, access was gained into right femoral vein with a 19-gauge needle.
A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance and the needle was exchanged for a 5 French Omniflush catheter.
Using Omniflush catheter and guidewire, access was gained into left common iliac vein and IVC venogram was obtained.
Based on these venographic findings, it was decided to place IVC filter at L3 level.
A 5 French catheter was removed and guidewire advanced into the upper IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
A 7 French delivery catheter was advanced over the wire into the IVC.
A G2 IVC filter was advanced through the catheter, and it was deployed in the immediate infrarenal IVC at L3 level.
Final abdominal x- ray demonstrated proper location and position of IVC filter in infrarenal IVC.
Vascular catheter was removed and manual compression was held until hemostasis was achieved.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
Urology consult service followed, recommended urine cytology for diagnosis.
3-way foley placed and clots ultimately cleared and urine returned to regular color.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3176**] was very clear in her desire to pursue comfort measures only.
The main symptoms were pain and dyspnea both were treated with oxycontin and oxycodone.

She did not want to take morphine secondary to previous side effects.
Palliative care team was involved as well and they recommended starting ritalin, dexamethasone as well.
Constipation - on senna, colace and lactulose.
Please give a dose of lactulose when patient arrives at rehab today([**2125-2-19**]) as pt had not had a bowel movement in 2 days.

Prednisone was not administered given stable hematocrit and risk of steroids with unknown malignancy, on recommendations of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
(However, eventually dexamethasone was started per palliative care recommendations.)
Celexa, klonapin continued at home doses.
