She was placed on strict non weight bearing to both lower extremities.
She was also seen by Ophthalmology per recommendation of Plastics to assess for entrapment given her orbital fracture and none identified.
She was transferred to the Trauma ICU postoperatively where she remained sedated and vented.
She was noted to have delirium tremors and was started on IV benzodiazepines per CIWA protocol.
She was eventually weaned and extubated and continued to exhibit signs of DT's.
She at this time was requiring high doses of Valium; Clonidine was also added to help regulate agitated behaviors.
At this point Haldol was added to her regimen and Trazodone to help regulate her wake/sleep cycle.
While she was beginning to show some mild improvements as far as her mental status and behaviors were concerned she was still quite delirious.
During the surgery a bladder injury occurred requiring consultation with Urology where they performed repair of the injury and placement of indwelling Foley which was to be left in place for at least 2 weeks.
A review of her medications was done and it was decided to stop the OxyContin and Valium as it had been greater than 96 hours since her last drink.
She was noted with a thrombocytosis and Hematology was consulted.
It was felt that the thrombocytosis was likely reactive; possibly due to trauma, inflammation or blood loss and it was recommended to continue to monitor her platelet counts, monitor for any signs of clotting, and to continue the 325 mg of aspirin daily.
She was discharged to home with her boyfriend and was given explicit instructions on her restrictions and information for her follow up appointments.
