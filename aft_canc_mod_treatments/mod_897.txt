He is currently s/p an 11 hour radical cystoprostatectomy with regional node dissection and ileal conduit.
His 11-hour operative course was significant for ~1800mL of blood loss, 8 liters of Crystalloid, 500mL of albumin and 2 units of pRBCs.
Past Medical History: TIAs, R Carotid Endarterectomy [**2176-3-22**] Obstructive Sleep Apnea Duodenal Ulcer Hypertension Gout Glaucoma   Social History: The patient is married and lives with his wife in [**Location (un) 55**].

He did have one night of delirium and confusion that required administration of haldol.
An ostomy bag was placed over the wound, with output > 1L/day.
A urethral catheter was placed to drain the abdominal cavity.
A catheter was also placed into the ileal loop to decompress the loop.
In fact, creatinine checks of the abdominal drain after catheter decompression of the loop were NOT consistent with urine (all creatinines were <1.5).
The patient's urine leak was therefore managed conservatively with catheter decompression of the loop.
The ostomy appliance was changed before discharge, and the catheter in the urostomy was replaced and sutured to the ostomy appliance.
Of onte, three days before discharge, the output from the pt's abdominal drain appeared milky.
Before discharge, the patient completed a seven day course of ceftriaxone for empiric prophylaxis against forming infected fluid collections in the pelvis.
On discharge to rehab, he was walking without difficulty, including traversing stairs, his urostomy was draining well with catheter decompression, and his urethral catheter was removed.

Please do not manipulate the foley catheter that is in his ileal conduit - this is essential to his treatment and should not be manipulated.
His ostomy appliance will be changed at his next urology outpatient appointment.
Please keep the ostomy bag to gravity drainage to a foley bag at all times unless the pt is being transported.
Please call if the pt's creatinine is increasing > 1.2, as this may be an indication of an ongoing urine leak 6.
Please take Tylenol in addition to oxycodone, and transition to Tylenol as pain improves.
