This was thought to be related to colon CA, she was started on Flagyl and vancomycin IV for a total of 14 days on [**7-23**].
On her admission she was still on Flagyl and her vanco level was in the 30s, so this was not given in the ED.
Her lactate was initially elevated at 5.6 and was trending down with IV fluids.
She was found to have new small pleural effusion on her left lung base on cxray and was started on levoquin.
Her lactate was elevated and this was thought to possibly be due to hypovolemia and dehydration, since it had been trending down with IV fluids.
She also had been covered with vanco and flagyl for the last 9 days.
She was continued on Flagyl and then her Abx were broadened to Zosyn/Clinda.
