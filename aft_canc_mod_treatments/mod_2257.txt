She was admitted at that point on [**6-19**] for bronchoscopy for biopsy of the right mainstem endobronchial lesion.

The patient was oxygenating and ventilating well on a ventilator when she arrived, and this was kept on those settings on the first night and switched over to pressure support ventilation.
She received a CT of the airway with reconstruction and preparation for the rigid interventional bronchoscopy.
She went to Interventional Bronchoscopy on [**6-22**], which revealed a mass within the right mainstem bronchus occluding the origin of the right upper lobe bronchus, measuring approximately 13 x 9 mm in diameter.
This was excised by Interventional Pulmonology, and the patient returned to the MICU status post excision without endobronchial stent.
She remained ventilated with intravenous sedation and was gradually weaned off and extubated on [**6-23**].
Initially she did have some thick secretions through her stent which was sent to microbiopsy for speciation, and these eventually grew out pseudomonas sensitive to everything except for ...................  She therefore had initially been started on Zosyn, as well as Levofloxacin and Vancomycin upon admission for the leukocytosis, and gradually her antibiotic regimen was narrowed down to just Zosyn for the pseudomonas pneumonia.
At the time of this dictation, she is currently on day #7 of a 10-day course of intravenous Zosyn for the pseudomonas.
After extubation on the 5th, the patient continued to have some respiratory distress and required face mask, as well as sedation.
She was diuresed gently with a one-time dose of 40 mg Lasix and also given high-dose steroids and nebulizers to improve some bronchospastic disease.
She continued to do well on this regimen, and two days prior to discharge, she was lucid and oriented and pleasant, doing well with nasal cannula.
She did not require any further diuresis.
She was kept on Captopril for hypertension at her Lisinopril dose equivalent.
She was switched on the day of discharge back to her standing Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
Her Digoxin, which was presumably prescribed by her physician for congestive heart failure, was discontinued for risk of any arrhythmia affects; however, she was continued on her Lipitor and Lisinopril.
She may need to restart Lasix at a future date and should be followed closely by her primary care physician.
She will be given inhalers with bronchodilators and inhalers for control of her reactive airway disease.
Nutrition:  The patient was temporarily fed with tube feeds and tolerated a normal diet two days prior to discharge.
