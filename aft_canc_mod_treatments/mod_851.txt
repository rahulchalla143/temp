Hemoptysis and worsening "burning" rash is what prompted his presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He was previously requiring O2 via nasal cannula to max of 4L, but since yesterday evening, has had increasing oxygen requirement overnight so that he was placed on a NRB.
Throughout the day, he has been maintaining O2 sats on NRB in the mid to upper 90s, however, with movement and with removal of mask he promptly desaturates to the 80s.
A CT scan was obtained today given his broad coverage, but persistent respiratory decompensation which showed b/l consolidations and ground glass opacities.
They also felt that bactrim was not indicated given low risk of PCP.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 63yo M with h/o NSCLC, CLL, and CAD p/w fevers and shortness of breath x 5 days with worsening hypoxia despite broad coverage antibiotics.
Ground glass opacities concerning for superimposed infection and even postobstructive pneumonia given progression of disease.
Had episode of desat to 80s with increased WOB secondary to likely mucus plugging as he improved s/p expectoration of small amount of blood-tinged sputum.
Trial of 20mg IV lasix on [**7-17**] failed: pt dropped SBP to 80s from 100s with no improvement in O2 requirement.
Broad coverage antibiotics were continued with cefepime/vancomycin/ flagyl/ and voriconazole as per ID recs with azithromycin for atypical coverage.
The team had been in touch with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] (outpt oncologist) regarding rec's, and it was felt that there were no further treatment options to treat his underlying disease.
# CAD:  s/p CABG in [**2114**].
On statin alone, not on ASA (unclear reason, but potentially while undergoing tx) nor BB ([**1-16**] to hypotension in past).
The patient was maintained on a statin, with ASA held given hemoptysis .
This was monitored, with benadryl as needed for pruritus .
The patient was maintained on thryroid hormone replacement .
# FEN: The patient was kept NPO for intubation, and was maintained on D51/2NS at 50cc/hr maintenance fluid.
# PPx: SC heparin, PPI were used.
pt received 1mg atropine given with HR 40 --> 130 and restoration of BP.
Etiology was unclear: perhaps vagal episode from ETT tube, but this appears to be  unlikely given proper placement on CXR.
