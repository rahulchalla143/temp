via the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
The tenderness and erythema near her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site was nearly resolved.
The patient had mild peripheral edema which had improved on Lasix over the course of her postoperative recovery.
She communicated via a marker board, but was being trained in how to use the fenestrate tracheostomy tube.
Sodium of 135, potassium of 3.5 (her potassium may need to be followed on Lasix), chloride of 95, bicarbonate of 32, blood urea nitrogen of 20, creatinine of 0.4, blood glucose of 119.
Termination of the chest tube will be dependent on Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
The patient had a failure to wean postoperatively, and her postoperative course was complicated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter pneumonia.
A tracheostomy was performed on [**6-20**].
On [**7-1**], she began to tolerate tracheostomy collar for prolonged periods of time.
She was receiving tube feeds via a postpyloric feeding tube.
She received a full course of vancomycin and ceftazidime.
She received a bronchoscopy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed.
Her central line was removed at this time as well.
She was noted to have a cellulitis around her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site.
A small drain was placed beside the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site, and some pus was removed.
She was on a regular diet, but her calorie counts have been somewhat low, so she was receiving tube feeds.
She is presently receiving 45 cc per hour of full-strength Respalor tube feeds through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
As her oral intake improves, we anticipate that her tube feedings will be able to be cut down and eventually stopped.
A fenestrated tracheostomy tube was placed on [**7-8**].
She was receiving vigorous physical therapy and was able to walk across the length of the Intensive Care Unit unassisted.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Her tube feedings should be weaned as her oral intake improves.
