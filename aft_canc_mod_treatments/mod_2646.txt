He was also seen by the rheumatology in consultation and they recommended continuing the current dose of Prednisone as well as avoiding increasing the Allopurinol dose.
The patient was also evaluated by physical therapy on hospital day three and treatment was instituted.
Also the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.8 which brought his hematocrit up to 27.0.
On [**2153-8-30**], the patient was started on low dose ARA-C for palliation.
The patient was continued on this palliative chemotherapy with some symptomatic improvement.
He underwent repeat bilateral arthrocentesis of both knees on [**2153-9-3**].
The recommendations were to keep the patient NPO, to start him on Imipenem, to obtain a CT. Assessment by the surgical attending, the patient has a surgical abdomen and he was deteriorating rapidly with a heart rate in the 160s, respiratory rate 32 on nonrebreather with oxygen saturation 90%.
He was deemed too unstable to undergo a CT scan and taken to the operating room for emergency exploratory laparotomy.
At the time, the patient was taken to the operating room he was on multiple pressors and Nitroglycerin for hemodynamic instability.
The patient underwent a sigmoid colectomy and sigmoid colostomy and mobilization of the splenic flexure and [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch.
He had five liters of crystalloid and two units of packed red blood cells during the case.
At that point, he was on Neo-Synephrine drip, Levophed drip, Hydrocortisone 100 q8hours, Ampicillin one q6hours, Levaquin 500 mg once daily, Flagyl 500 mg three times a day, Acyclovir 400 mg three times a day.

On postoperative day two and one, the patient was on Levophed 0.175, Vasopressin 0.04, also on Cefepime, Flagyl, Levaquin, Ampicillin and Acyclovir for his antibiotics.
The patient's abdomen was left open with a bag type dressing for closure.
At this point, the patient was also developing multiorgan system failure with adult respiratory distress syndrome, and the patient was put on low protective ventilation.
Later that day after discussion with the patient's oncologist as well as his family, we were all at the bedside, the patient's prognosis was felt to be nonsurvival given this catastrophic abdominal event in the setting of his recent chemotherapy and large cytokine response.
It was felt that aggressive measures would be unable to salvage the situation and the decision was made with the family to change the patient's code status to comfort measures only.
He was made comfortable with narcotics and his pressors were discontinued.
