He states that he has also noticed frequent brusing without apparent trauma.

[**2109-8-23**] Bronchial washings cytology: Clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli, favor reactive pneumocytes.
[**2109-8-15**] Bone marrow cytogenetics: FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for PML at 15q22 and RARA at 17q21 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 31/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this probe in our laboratory.
Technically suboptimal study, nevertheless, with evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli including probable right main pulmonary artery embolus as characterized above.
While atypical infectious etiologies (ie PCP) could have a similar appearance, given bronchoscopy findings, this is most consistent with ongoing/recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

# APML: given history, started on ATRA initially 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
After bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry confirmed suspicion for APML, patient started 7+4 with daunorubicin and cytarabine.
Pt also started on dexamethasone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] as prophylaxis against ATRA syndrome, as on [**7-15**] the patient became short of breath and CXR showed pulmonary congestion.
He was enrolled in the ECOG low to moderate risk APML protocol, and underwent sternal bone biopsy.
He was started on Cytarabine and Daunarubicin 7+4 on [**7-17**].
His cell counts dropped subsequent to this, and he was supported with PRBC and platelet transfusions.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and recommended keeping supporting platelet count through transfusions, without other intervention.
Resolving left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, now measuring 5 x 2 mm.
Antibiotics were largely guided by ID consult, and at various times, included: aztreonam 2g IV Q8, voriconazole 400mg IV Q12, vancomycin 1g IV Q8, levofloxacin 500mg PO Q24, daptomycin, micafungin, flagyl, bactrim, and cefepime.
Cefepime was later substituted with aztreonam on [**7-31**] due to development of a drug rash.
On discharge, patient had completed at least a 14 day course of vancomycin and levofloxacin for HAP.
# Multifocal pneumonia: imaging showing multifocal consolidative and ground glass opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, consistent with multifocal infectious process, requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer at one point (on 4-5L NC).
PCP was less likely given only one side of the lungs was affected, but he was started on bactrim therapy as well.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was placed on now Day 4 Vanco/aztreonam/voriconazole and Day 3 levaquin but cultures had been negative.
He never required intubation and was weaned off of O2 without difficulty.
Patient completed extensive antibiotic regimen (as noted above), and completed at least 14 day course of vancomycin and levofloxacin.
Given his aspergillus versicolor positive fungal culture on [**8-17**], patient will continue PO voriconazole 400 mg Q12 for 11 more days on discharge.
Bronchoscopy washings for cytology done [**2109-8-23**] showing "clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli, favor reactive pneumocytes."
Pt started on heparin gtt, and transitioned/discharged on lovenox.
He was started on prednisone 40 mg, with taper, as treatment for gout, with improvement.
Initially started on IV steroids, and then tapered, with clinical improvement and resolution of hemoptysis.
# Chronic back pain - continued home oxycodone and oxycontin .
The patient was given sarna lotion which improved the pruritis.
Patient started on valtrex 1 g [**Hospital1 **] until resolution of all lesions.
He is then to continue suppressive regimen of 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] while immunosuppressed.
Patient was counselled on transmission and implications of HSV.
