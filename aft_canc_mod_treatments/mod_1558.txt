Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 49 yo M HTN p/w R adrenal gland bleeding hematoma w/ extension of the bleed into the retroperitonium s/p right adrenal artery coiling/embolization by IR.
His hospital course during this admission is as follows:  1 Adrenal Hemorrhage: unclear why he would have spontaneous adreanl hemorrage; (no known adrenal mass from CT 1 yr ago); He was intubated intially, and taken to IR  s/p IR embolization of right middle adrenal artery for right adrenal gland enlargement and hemorrhage with active extravasation of contrast on presentation into the surrounding retroperitoneum -> successfully extubated on [**2118-4-27**]-> trasnferred to medicine service on [**2118-4-28**]; CT with evidence of R adrenal enlargement w/ surrounding hematoma, difficult to assess whether underlying mass is present and/or whether adrenal enlargement can be completely attributed to bleed (reviewing of the CT scan films again with staff radiologist once on the medicine floor, no adrenal mass seen on CT scan 1 year ago ([**2116**]), and currently adrenal enlargement can be attributed to acute bleeding, recommended follow CT or MRI after resolution of this bleeding 1 month).
On one end, patient with history of poorly controlled HTN x 25 years, however, he is a smoker, obese, poor diet and medication compliance which all can be contributed to his hypertension.
Patient without Type B symptoms of weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats to suggest neoplasm, and he tolerated the procedure really well, ambulating and tolerating PO, no complaints of any sort.
