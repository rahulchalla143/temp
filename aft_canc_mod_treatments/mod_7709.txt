In parallel, he was treated for a COPD exacerbation with oral steroids and azithromycin, and continued on spiriva.
He did not tolerate the BIPAP through the evening, and the plan was to discontinue this (notably, he did not tolerate bipap in sleep lab either).
Plan was also put in place for ENT evaluation of his vocal cords to look for vocal cord dysfunction potentially related to tumor involvement.
Was not hypoxic on the floor but was continued on a 3 day steroid course for possibility of COPD exacerbation as well as azithromycin for five days.
He was also treated with his home nebulizers and guiafensin to mobilize sputum.
Leukocytosis was thought to be secondary to prednisone course and the PCP was notified to follow up on his WBC count post discharge.
Speech and swallow was consulted; they recommended a soft solids diet.
