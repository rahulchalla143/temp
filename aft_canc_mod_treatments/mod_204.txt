She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated and recovered in the PACU prior to being transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
Three chest tubes were placed during the procedure and a postoperative chest x-ray showed expected right pneumothorax post surgery with three chest tubes in place.
She was started on a clear liquid diet, her pain was controlled with an epidural and she was started on her home medications.
On POD 2 she was noted to have increased somnolence which was thought to be related to her pain medications so her epidural was turned down and narcotics for breakthrough pain were discontinued.
She was given a unit of PRBC for a Hct of 20.3 with an appropriate increase to 24.4 and improved somnolence.
On POD 3 metoprolol was started because of elevated systolic blood pressures.
Her epidural was discontinued and her foley catheter was removed.
She was started on oxycodone and tramadol for pain.
By POD 4 the air leak had stopped in the anterior chest tube so it was removed.
The posterior chest tube was removed on POD 6.
She was given metoprolol once without effect and was then given IV diltiazem once with return to sinus rhythm.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and she was monitored with telemetry without recurrence.
On POD 8 the air leak had resolved in the basilar chest tube so it was removed.

Please take the prescribed pain medication as needed.
Constipation can be a problem with narcotic use, therefore drink plenty of fluid to stay well hydrated and use a stool softener while taking narcotics.
Do NOT drive while taking narcotic pain medications.
We also started you on a new medication called Metoprolol for your high blood pressure and new dysrhythmia, please ask your primary care doctor if you need to continue it.
