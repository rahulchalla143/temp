During this admission he was initially treated with high dose short course of steroids.
His pain was controlled with the addition of increased gabapentin, addition of methadone and oxycodone.
As his pain would worsen when the steroids were weaned off, he was kepts on 3mg po dexamethasone as a stable dose for one week prior to discharge.
While he was on a sliding scale due to being on steroids, he did nto require any insulin and therefore this was stopped at the time of discharge as he was on a stable regimen of steroids.
-Will require follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for ongoing care for this -Will continue dexamethasone 3mg po BID  #MDS- patient has history of therapy related MDS.
He was started on Revlimid on [**8-2**] and tolerated this well.
-Will require frequent lab work to determine if transfusions are required -Will continue revlimid 10mg po qday  #Dysuria- patient has significant dysruia and negative UA with unclear source of the pain.
He was found to have hemoptysis and was Bglucan positive so was started on voricanozole and continues this at the time of discharge.He was on IV Vancomycin and meropenem and these were weaned off in the week prior to discharge and he was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg po BID a few days prior to discharge and remained afebrile with stable WBC.
-Continue voricanozole -Continue ciprofloxacin  # Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated in the ED to allow for aggressive volume resuscitation.
He continued to require intermittent transfusions throughout his course.
-This will be monitored by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name **] office  # Volume overload: Secondary to new left ventricular dysfunction and acute systolic heart failure as well as POEMS syndrome with likely capillary leak, hypoalbuminemia, and initial aggressive volume resuscitation.
