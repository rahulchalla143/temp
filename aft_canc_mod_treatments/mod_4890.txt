His dexamethasone was changed to daily solumedrol upon return to the floor [**2192-8-11**].
Rituxan was initiated on [**8-14**] to decrease his tumor burden and was repeated on [**8-17**].
Tumor lysis labs were followed and Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 11752**] was continued on allopurinol therapy.
The initiation of standard therapy could not be initiated until his liver function improved.
The goal to initiate therapy was a total bilirubin of 2, so as to not compromise standard therapy of R-CHOP through significant re-dosing.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] tolerated the therapy well, he was treated with 5 days of high dose steroids after chemotherapy and experienced a slight increase in LFTs likely as a result of the therapy.

Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] foley catheter was not removed or replaced at this time, because of significant edema, ongoing chemotherapy and the need to follow urine out-put during chemotherapy.

He responded well to IV Lasix.
# Right Inguinal Node Biopsy Site:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] developed poor wound healing at the site of his lymph node biopsy at an OSH.
Evidence of a hematoma or seroma was visualized on CT.  General Surgery was consulted to examine the wound, antibiotic therapy was deferred and wet to dry dressing was applied three times a day.
Wound culture grew MRSA, he was treated for several days with IV Daptomycin, as Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] reportedly has a vancomycin allergy,  which was discontinued as the culture appeared more consistent with a contaminant.
A wound vacuum was applied for almost a week to help with wound healing.
The vacuum was discontinued prior to discharge.
