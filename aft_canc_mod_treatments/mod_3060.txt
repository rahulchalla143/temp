Past Medical History: Stage I myeloma not requiring treatment found during hypercoag work-up.
Bone marrow bx [**10-31**]: approximately 30% of the marrow cellularity is comprised of plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction.
Each dendritic cell vaccine accompanied by three days of growth factor.
Beta-2 microglobulin has been stable over two years about 2.7 (most recent [**12-31**]) His Free kappa has been stable at 9.4 and free lambda stable (elevated) at 600 (most recent [**12-31**]) The ratio, as expected, is low at 0.2.
Of note, hypercoagulable workup negative (negative, [**Doctor First Name **], lupus anti-coagulant, ATIII, protein C, protein S, Factor V Leiden, PT gene mutation and anti-cardiolipin) .
PMH: 1. multiple myeloma- currently on dendirtic cell fusion vaccine therapy 2.

Because of the presence of these thromboses, augmentation tests were not performed.
Started on heparin with PTT goal of 60-80.
- Started on heparin, maintain PTT >70 to finish 5 day overlap of heparin and coumadin - with goal INR to be therapeutic at [**3-1**].
Hence, he was sent home on lovenox at 1mg/kg and his coumadin was increased to 7.5mg from 5mg.
Liver hypodensities and soft tissue mass in abdomen also found.
- Abdominal CT with contrast to look for other primary malignancy was negative - Repeat hypercoag workup: anti-cardiolipin Ab, PT mutation, Factor V Leiden, Protein C and S (may not be accurate in setting of clot)  - to be followed up by outpatient oncologist.
# PPX: Maintained on heparin and protonix.
# Dispo: Because the patient was stable for 4 days on our service, it was felt that clinically he was sound enough to go home and reliable enough to use lovenox shots, despite his INR not being above 2.0.
