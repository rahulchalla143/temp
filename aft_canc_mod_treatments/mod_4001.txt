He was started on ceftriaxone and azitrhomycin for community acquired pneumonia and steroids for COPD exacerbation.
After he developed hypotension, his antibiotics were broadened to levofloxacin/metronidazole/vancomycin.
These antibiotics were continued at the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

His steroids were tapered down and he was discharged on 7.5 mg of prednisone daily.
He was started on heparin drip.
An repeat head CT performed following transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was concerning for an infectious process and he was treated with vancomycin/zosyn.
This was likely a delirium in the setting of prolonged effects of sedating medications (both from intubation), and infection in the setting of organic brain disease.
He was treated with prn beta blockers.
The hypotension was thought secondary to adrenal insufficieny however, he underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**]-stim test with an post-stim change of ~13 units.

He was started on heparin for the potential stroke and 13 hours later had a platelet count of 71,000.
Anti-platelet agents were held.
The most likely cause of his thrombocytopenia was a combination on non-immune heparin induced thrombocytopenia and sepsis induced marrow suppression.
His Hct was supported with occasional transfusions and was stable prior to discharge.
This was broken with diltiazem gtt.
