Following the procedure she continued to have fevers and thus vancomycin was started after ID consultation.
Her fever curve continued to worsen despite broad spectrum abx and her wbc rose as well and thus the decision was made to proceed to the OR for surgical management.
Her antibiotic coverage was broadened.
On [**2163-11-9**] she was taken to the operating room for an ex lap, TAH, BSO, and LND.
She was on broad spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, vancomycin, and cipro.
She remained on pressors until the following morning when they were successfully weaned.

Her leukocytosis improved, her antibiotics were narrowed and she was subsequently treated with levo/flagyl.
