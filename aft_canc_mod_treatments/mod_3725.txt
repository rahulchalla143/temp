Later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep, he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a curtain descending down over his abdomen.

MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM: IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at T7-T8.
There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of bone fragments into the ventral part of the spinal canal.
The aorta is calcified with relatively thick mural plaques ranging up to 4 mm, some of them ulcerated, for example in the proximal distending thoracic aorta, series 2, image 26, 27; at the level of the aortic arch, series 2, image 21; in the distending aorta, series 2, image 31.
Ground-glass opacity at the left base consistent with reexpansion edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.

Calcium Phos  Mg [**2101-1-1**] 06:30AM          7.0*   2.9 2.0   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygeal fracture, and CAD, who presented with back pain of 2 weeks duration, found to have a T7-T8 epidural mass on MRI.
He subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent colpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by post-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper extremity venous clot, and delerium.
Given the possibility of infection he was started on broad-spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyl IV.
Ortho spine followed the patient and he was provided with a TLSO brace given his T7 collapse.
When organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and flagyl were discontinued.
He was continued on vancomycin with goal troughs 17-20.
When sensitivities returned MSSA the vancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4h.
A TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential and was negative.
Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both negative.
He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and stabilize his spine (please see op notes from [**12-10**] and [**12-13**] for details).
He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin to end on [**2101-1-20**].
His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.
His cardiac regimen was adjusted to include aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur.
He received CPR as his DNR status had temporarily been changed peri-operative.
An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead in the RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis was being treated.
pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by EP and found to be working well.
He can follow-up with his PCP for potential referral to GI for colonoscopy as an outpatient.
## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to medications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in sleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.
The patient's agitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol as well.
Other sedating medications such as narcotics and benzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible.
He was started on an aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of large amount of narcotics.
This bowel regimen was weaned down over the course of his hospital stay.
Since being on the antibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in place.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous catheter.
Warm compresses and arm elevation should be used to limit propagation of the clot.
## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.
## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and pneumo-boots with slow GIB.
Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to medications and loose stools.
He will receive standing potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly after discharge to adjust the dose.

Discharge Instructions: You have been evaluated and treated for an infection in your vertebral column.
You underwent 2 surgeries to remove as much of the infection as possible and to stabilize the spine.
Your course was further complicated by a very slow heart rate that required a pacemaker to keep you rate fast enough.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
You will need to continue the nafcillin until [**2100-1-20**].
You should follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2101-1-5**] as below to determine if lifelong antibiotics will be needed.
You will need to have several things followed up with your PCP:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 70074**] from cytology of the pleural (lung) fluid            -vitamin B12 levels            -colonoscopy            -follow up with vacular surgery ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8343**] in 6 months for ultrasound to evaluate iliac artery dissestions    Completed by:[**2101-1-1**
