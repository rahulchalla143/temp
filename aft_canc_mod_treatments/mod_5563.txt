Rate control was attempted with Lopressor and then subsequently with diltiazem.
Her rate did not respond to these blocking agents, and she had exquisite blood pressure sensitivity with frequent hypotension whenever she was given one of these agents.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit on [**2148-7-12**] because of atrial fibrillation with a rate up to the 180s and a blood pressure drop to 80/palp with IV diltiazem.
Status post XRT for left iliac metastases.
Status post partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease.
Metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
Risperidone 0.5 mg q.h.s.
Ceftriaxone 1 gram q.
Azithromycin 250 mg q.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the unit her temperature was 97.1, heart rate 139, blood pressure 126/48, respiratory rate 31, 95% on two liters nasal cannula.
General examination was alert but oriented x self only, recognizes and interacts with her husband, appears fatigued and in mild respiratory distress, easily tearful and agitated.
Calcium 9.1, phosphorous 4, magnesium 1.8.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is an 82-year-old female with widely metastatic lymphoma with abysmal prognosis admitted to the intensive care unit for atrial fibrillation with RVR and difficulty controlling rate secondary to blood pressure sensitivity to nodal-blocking agents.
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  The patient was rate controlled with amiodarone and Lopressor.
It was felt that she was a poor candidate for long-term anticoagulation and she was not started on heparin or Coumadin.
Throughout her intensive care unit stay she has been stable on two liters nasal cannula.
The family entertained trying one last cycle of chemotherapy although they were advised that this would at most buy them a little time and at worst cause clinical side effects.
However it was felt that the husband would not be able to handle having the patient at home and placement in a hospice bed has been under way.
After several extensive discussions in the presence of Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 98248**] and his daughter, he clearly voiced that she never wanted to be maintained on life-support or with chronic feeding tubes, and he definitely wanted his wife to be comfortable.
Per his request, all all blood sticks, intravenous access, and chemotherapy were discontinued and focus care on comfort.
She is not being fed or given intravenous fluids or any medications.
