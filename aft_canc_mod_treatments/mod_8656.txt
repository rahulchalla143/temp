VQ scan done showed approximately 80% ventilation perfusion from the left lung and approximately 12% ventilation perfusion performed by the right lung.
The patient had also undergone attempted embolization of the mass due to suspected bleeding; however this was not performed since there were no vessels identified.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed metastasizing benign leiomyoma of the right lung, benign left breast cyst, G6PD deficiency, history of ventricular premature beats, and status post total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and left pelvic mass resection with rising CA-125.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 12.5 mg q.d., ibuprofen, multivitamin, Levofloxacin.
She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2187-8-14**] where she underwent right pneumonectomy with bovine pericardial patch.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no intraoperative complications.
She was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition having been extubated with an epidural catheter in place and bilateral chest tubes.
The patient's right chest tube was removed on postoperative day #1 and the left was removed on postoperative day #2 without incident.
However her EKG changes were suggestive of pericardial involvement and she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with the elevation in CKs and troponin thought to be secondary to intraoperative cardiac manipulation.
Of note, the patient had some intraoperative arrhythmias for which she was started on Amiodarone intravenous load and switched to p.o.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post right pneumonectomy, leiomyosarcoma with negative nodes and negative margins, G6PD deficiency, benign left breast cyst.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol 12.5 mg q.a.m., Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d.
