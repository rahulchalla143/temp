This was mutlifactorial, initially due to hypercalcemia, with components related to deconditioning and then post-operative state as discussed below.
She worked with physical therapy and will continue to do so on an outpatient basis.
# Hyperparathyroidism: Patient's hypercalcemia was initially treated medically.
Given her symptoms and social concerns, she remained monitored in the hospital and underwent parathyroidectomy on [**2187-5-16**] (details in operative report).
She was discharged on 1500 mg of calcium carbonate TID, 0.25 mg of calcitriol, and 800 units of vitamin D daily, as well as her home dose of furosemide.
Her warfarin was held for surgery and resumed post-operatively.
Her digoxin and carvediolol were continued, however several days after surgery she was noted to have rapid ventricular response when exerting herself with rates to 130-140 (70-80 at rest), without symptoms.
She was given intravenous fluids, and after a chest x-ray was completed that was concerning for pulmonary edema, was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
It was felt that her hypotension was likely due to poor PO intake surrounding her surgery, in addition to receiving her usual home medications.
After transfer back to the floor, her anti-hypertensives were slowly reintroduced, and intravenous fluids were discontinued.
Her home regimen of furosemide, enalapril, and carvediolol was continued, with increase in carvedilol as noted above.
# Osteoporosis: Continued calcium carbonate, vitamin D as above.
# Hypercholesterolemia: The patient was continued on her home statin .
