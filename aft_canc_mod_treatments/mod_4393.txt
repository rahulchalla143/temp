Cough and febrile neutropenia post transplant D2  treated with IV cefepime, vanc, micafungin and cipro w acyclovir and had progressive resp decompensation requiring MICU admission and intubation - intubated for 12 days and successfully extubated on [**11-20**].
GVHD and was treated with steroids.
She was still overloaded re volume status but urine output improved and fluid status improved with boluses of furosemide on advice of renal.
Her diet was advanced and was latterly able to eat normally and take oral meds by [**12-5**].
All antibiotics were stopped on [**12-27**].
Respiratory decompensation [**12-21**] and CT showed pulmonary edema and responded to aggressive diuresis with considerable improvement in fluid status.
Although she was still requiring frequent transfusions of platelets and blood and needed to continue micafungin, it was felt that the pt was stable enough to be discharged to the apartments with daily monitoring at the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome/Myeloproliferative disorder: allo SCT [**2167-10-27**].
Patient underwnet pre-conditioning treatment with Busulfan/Cytoxan.
She tolerated Busulfan well, but started to experience nausea and abdominal discomfort with Cytoxan.
Required pRBC and platelet transfusions during times.
Total bilirubin was elevated (direct bilirubin elevated) at one point, but abdominal ultasound was negative.
Solumedrol was continued, but bactrim (for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]) was held secondary to profound neutropenia.
Acyclovir was also held as per BMT recommendations.
In he ICU, the patient had a baseline anemia [**3-10**] BM suppression s/p transplant, but developed a falling hct and a small amount of vaginal bleeding in the context of low platelets (plts 7).
Gynecology recommended vaginal U/S that was done on [**2167-11-23**].
She was put on neutropenic precautions and treated with filgrastim.
She was treated with broad spectrum abx as discussed above under respiratory failure.
The patient was thrombocytopenic throughout her ICU course and has been refractory to platelet transfusions.
She remained on meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin until she was no longer neutropenic.
Had IH pentamidine [**12-4**] for prophylaxis.
Started Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] [**12-9**] and stopped cefepime [**12-10**].
Stopped atovaquone [**12-19**] and started dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
CMV 1070 copies - started treatment dose IV gancyclovir [**12-24**].
Initially was started on vancomycin, cefepime and micafungin, but she continued to have fevers and developed a cough that continued to worsen.
Micafungin was changed to Voriconazole on [**11-4**] for coverage of aspergillus.
She was put on neutropenic precautions and treated with filgrastim.
She was treated with broad spectrum abx as discussed above under respiratory failure.
On return to BMT floor from ICU, patient remained on meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin while still neutropenic.
She was planned to continued micafungin as an outpt at the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic .
The patient was intubated for hypoxemic resp failure and ventilated for 12 days.
The patient was given mucinex prn for cough.
Her resp status nevertheless continues to be good and she remained clinically stable in this regard on RA until her episode of decompensated pulmonary edema on [**12-21**] (see note on pulmonary edema for details).
Pt developed acutely worsening renal function after intubation and the cause was felt to be ATN secondary to hypoperfusion during an episode of hypotension during intubation.
She developed worsening hypervolemia, hyperkalemia up to 6.3 and a Creatinine level of 4.1 in spite of intravenous fluids and treatment for hyperkalemia.
The pt was treated w/ CVVH and volume was successfully removed over 8 days.
However the pt's renal function continued to be poor and the patient was switched to intermittent HD when the patient was off pressors and relatively stable.
While on the floor, she was dialysed with HD as needed for fluid removal and for uremia when renal function did not significantly improve.
Patient was noted to have altered mental status likely [**3-10**] uremia as this improved after dialysis sessions.
Effusions improved with aggressive diuresis although by [**12-26**] right effusion still present and small-moderate.
On advice of renal she was slowly started on IV furosemide boluses to help her fluid status.
After an episode of acute pulmonary edema, she as aggressively diuresed from [**12-21**] onwards with 80-100mg IV furosemide and her fluid status greatly improved.
Dialysis line removed with platelet cover [**12-24**].
# Confusion: This was considered likely multifactorial given a high Bili which improved, a high BUN on dialysis and the possibility of infection.
She was treated for infectious etiologies and [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/mica/vanc stopped [**12-4**].
Since she had been refractory to platelet transfusions, she was given doses of amicar and DDAVP to avoid further bleed.
Her blood pressure was controlled initially with IV hydralazine and ;latterly has been transitioned to oral labetalol.
D/W renal changed hydralazine to labetalol 100mg tid, stopped famotidine, stopped fluconazole and changed to mica iv, stopped metoclopramide and olanzapine PRN.
In the ICU, cyclosporin levels were checked qAM and cyclosporin was redosed if level <100 as per BMT recs.
On her arrival in the ICU, the patient was treated with Voriconazole in the context of neutropenia and a possible pneumonia.
This was stopped because of possible hepatotoxicity and micafungin was used instead.
In the course post return rom the ICU, we tapered IV methylpred and stopped on [**12-5**] Cyclosporin levels were taken daily and dose was adjusted accordingly.
Restarted IV MP [**12-7**] at 30mg qd.
Changed to oral cyclosporin 11/4nd increased dose to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] [**12-11**] and to 125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-13**].
Due to nausea, changed to cyclosporin  IV 75mg [**Hospital1 **].
Changed IVMP to oral prednisone 40mg qd [**12-11**] and pred decreased to 20mg [**12-16**].
Changed tto cyclosporin 75/100 on [**12-18**].
Cyclosporin changed to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] [**12-20**] and good level [**12-21**].
Increased to cyclosporin 175/150 on [**12-25**].
# Pulmonary edema: Respiratory decompensation [**12-21**] dropped sats to 88% RA and now 94% on 2L O2 with initially high RR36 which also settled.
but gradual over last 3 days - CT showed pulmonary edema and aggressively diuresed total 100mg IV furosemide [**12-21**].
Further 100mg IV furosemide [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] to good effect and symptomatic improvement.
Isosorbide dinitrate 10mg tid started [**12-24**] for decreasing afterload.
If decompensates for further furosemide and trial of CPAP +/- nitro IV infusion.
Her volume status improved and on [**12-30**], lasix was discontinued.
#Cough and changing GGOs on CT: Persistent since admission ?
infectious started on regular albuterol nebs [**12-5**] and incentive spirometer.
Repeat CT chest 1 week and started cough suppressants [**12-9**] with guaifensain/dextro QID regularly and added codeine PRN [**12-10**]  which improved matters.
Started oral levofloxacin [**12-15**] and antibiotics changed to IV cefepime and [**Doctor Last Name **] given bowel concern.
She was initially continued on levofloxacin and then switched to cipro at discharge.
Antibiotics chaged to IV cefepime and metronidazoel (possible concern for c difficile given increased stool output) [**12-17**] and negative.
ID recommended stopping IV cefepime [**12-18**] and adding IV levofloxacin and keep IV metronidazole.
Started IV gancyclovir [**12-24**] and increased to 2.5mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-25**].
In the setting of her recent transplant and low platelets, no intervention at this time, but they recommended that she followup with a gynecologist after discharge.
#HTN: Given SAH [**11-24**] strict BP control was required.
IV hydralazine to control.
Changed IV hydralazine 20mg to oral 50mg on [**12-5**].
Changed to oral labetalol [**12-10**] and BP thus far controlled.
