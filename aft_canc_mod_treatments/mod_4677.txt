Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Tracheal Y-stent placement [**2150-8-5**] - Esophageal stent placement [**2150-8-6**] - Bronchoscopy [**2150-8-7**]   History of Present Illness: In brief, this patient is a 76 yo M former smoked admitted on [**8-3**] from [**Hospital6 1597**] for worsening dyspnea and 60 pound weight loss over 4 months and found to have a moderately differentiated squamous cell lung CA compressing the right mainstem bronchus and esophagus.
Was treated with a 15 day course of levofloxacin for post-obstructive PNA and received 3 doses of radiation therapy.
He developed solid food dysphagia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for esophageal stenting, but was determined to need tracheal stenting first.
Tracheal stenting was performed on [**8-5**] followed by esophageal stenting on [**8-6**], afterwhich he developed atrial fibrillation.
He was started on metoprolol for rate control, then spontaneously converted back to sinus.
He was started on a diltiazem gtt which was stopped on [**8-2**] and transitioned to diltiazem PO; currently in and out of afib/sinus rhythm.
Currently on steroid taper since transfer for COPD exacerbation.
Esophageal stent is partially occluded but he is tolerating a ground dysphagia/thin liquids diet.
Past Medical History: - Lung cancer - Epilepsy (age [**11-10**] yrs, was on Dilantin and stopped) - Appendectomy  Social History: - Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility by himself but able to manage ADL without assistance.
Findings are non-specific and may be within normal limits but cannot exclude possible chronic pulmonary disease.
Status post esophageal stent placement, which is collapsed at its waist, and nearly completely occluded, with air-fluid levels, proximal and distal to the waist of the stent.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M with long hx of tobacco smoking, appendectomy, and epilepsy in youth presenting from OSH after x4 radiation treatments, 15 day Levofloxacin course for pna, and steroid taper for COPD exacerbation presenting for tracheal and esophageal stent placement for lung carcinoma.
Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Pt received x4 sessions of XRT at [**Hospital6 1597**] prior to transfer.
During the patient's admission, he tolerated esophageal and airway stenting, but developed atrial fibrillation with RVR during his course.
On discharge to Rehab, the patient will need to continue palliative XRT at [**Hospital3 **] under the care of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 87328**], MD, who can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87329**].
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Post-stenting, the patient developed AF with RVR requiring MICU transfer for diltiazem gtt.
He was converted to a standing oral regimen on transfer to the general floor, and was noted to be in sinus with 1:1 conduction for the duration with intermitent episodes of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation.
He will need to continue diltiazem on discharge.
Given multiple recent interventions performed, aspirin therapy was deferred during his admission, but can be considered on discharge.
COPD exacerbation: Patient was transferred on prednisone for a presumed COPD exacerbation.
His was stable from a respiratory standpoint during his admission on a baseline home oxygen requirement of 2L nc (unchanged from prior to admission), and he will be discharged on a prednisone taper.
The directions for his prednisone are: Prednisone 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4 days, then STOP  4.
Urinary retention: Following tracheal stent placement, the patient developed urinary retention.
A foley catheter was placed and Tamsulosin was started [**2150-8-6**] with successful voiding trial.
Pneumonia: Patient completed a 15 day course of levofloxacin during his admission.
Smoking cessation: Patient continued on nicotine patch during admission.
He will have a repeat BMP as well as urine electrolytes, creatinine and osmolality checked as an outpatient to determine appropriate course of action.
Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during admission.
