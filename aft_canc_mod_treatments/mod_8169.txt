The last two days prior to admission, the patient had been on business in [**Location (un) 5354**].
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for workup of the abdominal mass noted on CT scan, for treatment of diarrhea, and for evaluation of superior mesenteric vein clot.
The patient was begun on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
It was thought superior mesenteric vein thrombosis necessitated a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
It was decided at that point to transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells to the patient; although, there was no hematuria or bright red blood per rectum, and there was no obvious source for his bleeding.
On the [**4-18**], the patient was continued on his heparin drip; however, it was decided to start anticoagulation of the patient with Coumadin on [**4-18**].
The patient was transfused an additional unit of packed red blood cells at this time.
The patient was on levofloxacin on day three of admission.
On [**2180-4-19**], per the Blue Surgery Service, it was felt the patient would benefit from going to the angiography suite for thrombolysis of the clot in the superior mesenteric vein, and the patient was to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit status post procedure with continuous infusion of t-PA to keep the superior mesenteric vein open.
On [**2180-4-19**], the patient underwent a retrograde thrombolytic therapy procedure.
During this procedure, a successful transhepatic recanalization of the superior mesenteric vein using angioplasty and thrombolysis was done.
An infusion catheter was placed in the superior mesenteric vein for overnight infusion of t-PA.
The patient was transferred status post procedure to the Trauma Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's t-PA drip was noted to be going at 0.5 mg per hour in addition to 200 units of heparin being transfused intravenously per hour.
This procedure was complicated by a transient occlusion with thrombolysis catheter which demonstrated a kinking of the catheter within the sheath.
His antibiotics included ceftazidime, Flagyl, and Levaquin.
The patient returned to Interventional Radiology on [**4-20**] for assessment of his superior mesenteric vein thrombus.
The patient returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit following this re-imaging on [**4-20**].
On [**4-20**], an Infectious Disease consultation was obtained by the Surgical Intensive Care Unit team given the patient's positive blood cultures from admission as well as continued fevers while on intravenous antibiotics.
The assessment was this was a 71-year-old patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission with a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and with anaerobic gram-negative rod bacteremia.
They felt he was improving on broad spectrum antibiotics.
It was felt that his current regimen would cover gut anaerobes and aerobic bacteria; but, however, was suboptimal for enterococcus, but since there was no enterococcus isolated so far, and the patient appeared to be better, there was no need to change his antibiotic regimen.
Infectious Disease recommended awaiting the speciation of the final gram-negative rod from the blood cultures in order to consolidate antibiotic therapy into a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Status post procedure, the patient was found to be comfortable and doing well off t-PA and catheter removal by the Angiography Service.
On [**4-21**], the General Surgery Service recommended repletion the patient's electrolytes and to begin another heparin drip to elevate the patient's PTT to a value of 60 to 80.
The patient's heparin was held at 6 a.m. for these procedures.
At this time, it was decided to switch the patient to monotherapy of Unasyn 3 g intravenously q.6h.
The patient also received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2180-4-24**].
He underwent a successfully fine-needle aspirate of a pelvic lymph node with cytology present.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Discharge medications included Lovenox, Coumadin, and  Augmentin.
Question recurrent Hodgkin's disease; status post fine-needle aspirate of pelvic lymph node with cytology positive for malignant cells, consistent with involvement by Hodgkin's disease.
Status post CHOP therapy times seven cycles for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Superior mesenteric venous thrombosis; status post thrombus embolization with t-PA.
