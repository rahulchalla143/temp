The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
The left kidney measures 11.9 cm.
CVVH was initiated in the MICU, and patient was temporarily on pressors to maintain blood pressures with renal replacement therapy.
Diuretic regimen was  uptitrated slowly to 60mg lasix + 100mg spironalactone, which she tolerated well.
She was initially treated with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl with concern for possible polymicrobial infection, but vancomycin and flagyl were tapered off after 5 days of persistently negative cultures.
Cefepime was transitioned to po ciprofloxacin 750mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2205-5-15**], and patient was discharged with plan for total antibiotic course at least 14 days.
She will follow up with Infectious Disease specialist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in clinic next week, at which point he will decide how much longer to continue antibiotic course (day #1 antibiotics [**2205-5-5**]).
Day# 14 antibiotics would be [**5-19**], though total course is yet to be determined.
There was concern that perhaps this was a manic episode in the setting of taking citalopram for depression as this medication had apparently only been started several months back.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended haldol for agitation and to help w/sleep, minimizing interruptions.
[**Name (NI) **] pt was agitated and had risk of bleeding due to bleeding diathesis, decision was made not to LP pt or do paracentesis (no fever or WBC elevation at that time, and she was covered with cefepime for pseudomonas).
One dose Haldol had improved agitation and pt was marginally able to partially tolerate a brain MRI but this was relatively unrevealing showing possible enhancement of basal ganglia often seen w/hepatic encephalopathy; however, pt's labs had generally shown improvement since leaving the ICU she did not have asterixis on exam.
Concern for possible medication effects was also high as pt had past hx of medication sensitivty.
Efforts were made to minimize medications and the following medications were stopped: voriconazole, citalopram, sildenafil, midodrine.
Pt improved in setting of getting more sleep after haldol dose.
Lactulose was briefly given but stopped given pt's return to baseline mental status, though she was continued on rifaximin.
Treated with rifaximin 550mg [**Hospital1 **] and ursodiol.
Lactulose was held given anal surgery.
In setting of delirium (see above) lactulose was restarted.
Pt was able to be titrated up to 60mg of lasix + 100mg spironalactone to help w/diuresis and improvement of ascites.
Continued empirical antibiotics as above with NC prn.
Patient's home sildenafil was held in MICU and restarted on floor at home dose 10mg [**Hospital1 **]; however, in the setting of delirium and ?facial swelling (which pt had had in the past w/this medication), decision was made to stop sildenfil (see above).
[**Month (only) 116**] need reinstitution of Amicar if going for any procedure with risk of bleed.
# h/o high fungal markers: repeat beta glucan and galactomannan markers were sent and will be followed up by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**].
Patient was initially continued on voriconazole which was later discontinued in setting of delirium.
