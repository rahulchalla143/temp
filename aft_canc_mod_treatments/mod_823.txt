Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] was admitted with hypotension and intubated in the ED for altered mental status, though there was some report that he had throat swelling after an injection of dexamethasone.
His norepinephrine was weaned off and his lactate/central venous O2 were noted to worsen to 3.2 and 44% so the norepinephrine was restarted.
Cardiology was consulted for rising cardiac enzyems his CK peaked at 647 and troponin 1.59.
Cardiology thought that this was most likely secondary to demand and given his 3vd he would not benefit from catheterization, they recommended calling cardiac surgery to redisscuss a CABG as he had been turned down for unclear reasons in the past.
He was switched from vancomycin to unasyn.
He received wound care, with a recommendation for dry dressings and his antibioitics were switched to augmentin for a total antibiotic course of 10 days.
He was seen by physical therapy, with a plan for weight bearing while wearing a post operative shoe, and continued outpatient physical therapy.
Given the host context, he was treated with p.o vancomycin for this.
He has follow up planned with vascular surgery as well as his primary care doctor.
For his Coronary Artery disease, his simvastatin was increased to 80mg daily from 20 mg daily for cardioprotective purposes while revascularization surgery continues to be considered.
