His last cycle of ESHAP was [**Date range (1) 79455**].
He was discharged to [**Hospital3 105**] and returns because of a falling platelet count and inability to keep up with his transfusion needs while maintaining anticoagulation with lovenox.
Since discharge the patient reports that he has had difficulties with episodes of dry heaves and was started on marinol the day prior to transfer.
He states he was placed on oxygen 2 days ago, but has not had any shortness of breath.
He has been working with physical therapy at [**Hospital1 **], but is not up walking yet.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by the development of tamponade physiology, and the patient ultimately underwent a pericardial window.
The patient was initiated on R-CHOP on [**2126-7-26**] and received six cycles between [**7-/2126**] and [**10/2126**] and is also status post five cycles of high-dose methotrexate and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate.
He received a total of 3 cycles of ESHAP chemotherapy and two doses of intra-thecal ARA-C.  His last cycle of ESHAP was [**Date range (1) 79455**].
Other Medical History: # Large B Cell lymphoma as above # Recent C Diff Colitis # Hx of DVTs, upper & lower extremities, on Lovenox # Strep viridans bacteremia (1 bottle; PICC-associated?

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p multiple cycles of treatment, most recently his third cycle of ESHAP chemotherapy with a history of upper and lower extremity DVTs, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and recent C. difficile colitis who was admitted with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and inability to keep up with his transfusion requirements.
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma - The patient is s/p multiple cycles of chemotherapy, including several cycles of intrathecal chemotherapy that were felt sufficient for CNS prophylaxis.
However, when the patient developed hypercalcemia and delerium it was felt that his Diffuse large B cell lymphoma had likely recurred.
His hypercalcemia eventually responded to pamidronate, fluids and calcitonin.
Given the patient's likely disease recurrence despite multiple rounds of chemotherapy, it was felt that the patient was unlikely to benefit from additional chemotherapy.
#  The patient had multiple other medical issues that required treatment during this admission.
He was placed on neutropenic precautions while he remained neutropenic.
The patient required multiple transfusions of platelets during this admission.
His dose of lovenox had to be lowered in order to continue anticoagulation while the patient's platelets were so low.
The patient was initially kept on the metoprolol regimen that he came from [**Hospital1 **] on.
After a couple of days in the hospital the patient had a rising oxygen requirement and was given several small doses of lasix to remove extra fluid from his multiple transfusions.
He over went into afib with rvr in the middle of the night and usually responded to 25-50 mg PO of metoprolol tartrate.
Cardiology was informally consulted and they recommended returning to the patient's prior regimen of metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg Q midnight and stopping diuresis.
The patient responded very well to this regimen initially.
Pt had sustained afib with RVR and required transfer to ICU on [**5-26**].
He required Neo gtt to maintain his MAP >60.
Hypoxia - The patient did not require oxygen during his previous admission, however, he was on 2L NC when trasfered from the OSH.
Lasix was used to try to remove some of the extra fluid and the patient's oxygen requirement did decrease such that his O2 sats were 95% or greater sitting up during the day, however, he continued to require oxygen while lying in bed and sleeping.
The patient also underwent pulmonary function testing due to concern for emphysema based on CT scan and prior smoking history and need for such testing if stem cell transplant were to be considereed.
