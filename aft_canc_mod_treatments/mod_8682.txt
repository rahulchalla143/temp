Pt received vitamin K IV 10 mg x 1 in ED.
On [**2138-11-17**] the pt went for EGD/colonoscopy which showed diverticuloses in colon and two polyps which were removed with pathology as above.
The prep was considered limited and GI recommended a repeat colonoscopy for further evaluation as well as a capsule endoscopy to evaluate the small bowel in the near future.
Pain was only an occasional complaint during admission and was relieved with small amts of narcotics, lidocaine patches, and Tylenol.
The pt was seen to be ambulating the halls with a walker and able to climb stairs without difficulty.
HTN--All HTN meds were held on admission.
Subsequently Propanolol and Valsartan were added back.
However, other bp meds Lasix, Hydralazine, and Nifedipine continued to be held and this will need to be addressed by PCP.
Type 2 DM: Pt was seen to have 2 episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia which resolved with juice and crackers.
Her insulin regimen was made less aggressive on admission to the floor with an regimen of NPH [**12-2**] in the am/pm and sliding scale insulin as well.
On discharge, we lowered her home regimen of Humalog 75/25 from its original dose of 25/40 in the am/pm to a lower dose of 15/30 in the am/pm.
Rate was also controlled with Propanolol which was added back when her Hct was stable and it was clear she was not bleeding.
The pt's Coumadin was also held in the setting of active bleeding, and was not restarted while admitted.
This was discussed with the patient and the patient agreed with the management.
[**Name (NI) 94062**] pt was seen to be chronically anemic, with a picture consistent with anemia of chronic disease and was given a dose of erythropoietin on the advice of her nephrologist.
She was NOT given a prescription for this on discharge and this will need to be followed up, likely by her nephrologist or PCP.
Acute on Chronic Renal [**Name (NI) 94059**] pt's Cr on transfer from the ICU was within limits of her baseline and by discharge was also within limits of baseline.
Continued Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation  # CODE: DNR/DNI  (confirmed with patient)  IN CONCLUSION: For the outpt provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] are several considerations after discharge.
We have her back on 3 of her 5 home HTN meds (Valsartan and Propanolol) but Lasix, Nifedipine, and Hydralazine were not added back, please check her bp.
We changed her original insulin regimen as above to a less aggressive regimen.
She received Epogen while in house, may want to consider continuing   Medications on Admission: Atorvastatin 20 mg po daily Digoxin 125 mcg po daily Folic acid 1 mg po daily Lasix 60 mg po daily Hydralazine 67.5 mg po BID Hydralazine 50 mg po qhs Humalog 75-25 - 25 units q AM, 40 units q PM Nifedipine ER 60 mg po daily Propanolol SR 80 mg po daily Valsartan 320 mg po daily Coumadin 2.5 mg po daily or directed by [**Hospital **] Clinic Calcium carbonate 1000 mg po QID Tylenol OTC   Discharge Medications: 1.

After you stabilized, you underwent a procedure to visualize your GI tract.
While you were admitted, your anticoagulation medicine Coumadin was held because it can aggravate bleeding problems.
[**Name2 (NI) **] of your blood pressure meds were also held due to concern of low blood pressures.
You were kept on Digoxin, Propanolol, and Valsartan, but Lasix, Hydralazine, and Nifedipine were all held.
Your insulin regimen was also made less aggressive as it was seen that your blood sugars were occasionally too low.
After discharge, you should temporarily lower your insulin regimen to Humalog Mix 75/25 --> 15 units in the morning and 30 units in the evening.
You were started on Erythropoietin shots, which will help your bone marrow make more blood.
