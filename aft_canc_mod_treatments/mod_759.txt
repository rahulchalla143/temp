Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 38 year-old woman with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative ALL, previously on chemo-therapy status post induced remission with relapse of disease on bone marrow biopsy [**2135-6-13**] status post reinduction chemotherapy as inpatient [**Date range (1) 18555**] presenting with abdominal pain, fever and neutropenia.
Reinduction chemotherapy with hyperCVAD part B was started (D+1 was [**2135-7-12**]).
She was kept on allopurinol and sodium bicarbonate IV hydration to prevent methotrexate-related renal toxicity.
She was started on filgrastim.
The decision was made by her outpatient oncologist to pursue an allogenic bone marrow transplant, so screening for bone marrow transplantation was undertaken she had a TTE, PFTs and an HIV test.
Unfortunately she started to have recurrent fevers as described above and her bone marrow biopsy on [**8-1**] showed relapse so it was decided to treat her with clofarabine to attempt to induce remission so she could undergo a transplant in the near future.
As above, patient received one 2 mg dose of IV cefepime in the ED.
Blood cultures were drawn; one of four samples grew gram positive cocci so she was started on IV vancomycin.
Speciation returned as coagulase negative staph; vanco was stopped but her coverage was later broadened to cefepime and caspofungin due to her persistent fevers and low white counts.
Her PICC line was removed and cultured.
Blood cultures remained negative on broad spectrum antibiotics but she continued to spike fevers overnight.
She was restarted on IV vancomycin for continued fevers and also developed diarrhea and was found to be C. diff positive and so was started on po flagyl.
She continued to have fevers while being treated with clofarabine, however her fevers resolved a few days after her course of clofarabine was completed.
Approximately two weeks after clofarabine completion on [**8-16**], with an ANC of 0, the patient again developed fevers.
Linezolid was initially started but switched to daptomycin out of concern for linezolid-induced bone marrow suppression.
On [**8-18**], her tachypnea was worsening, and she was transferred to the ICU for further management.
She had had a MRI to evaluate a possible new nodule seen on abdominal US, however the MRI showed no liver pathology except for iron deposition.
An abdominal CT showed pancreatitis so she was made NPO and given aggressive IV hydration and dilaudid for pain control.
TPN was started for nutrition.
Flagyl was stopped as this could exacerbate pancreatitis.
She was started on po flagyl and her diarrhea resolved.
She was continued on flagyl as she remained neutropenic on broad spectrum antibiotics.
She was switched to po vancomycin when she developed pancreatitis.
She had received an injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate in clinic 2 months prior to admission(this is a q3 month injection), but this was ineffective.
When her bleeding and fevers continued, GYN was consulted for recs regarding additional progesterone therapy and work-up for gynecologic cause of fevers and abdominal / suprapubic pain.
Pelvic exam was negative for cervical motion tenderness.
Progesterone/estrogen injections as well as GnRH analogues were deferred due to the thromboembolic risks and the low liklihood of any benefit to be had from either therapy in the setting of recent progesterone therapy.
Her menstrual bleeding continued until GYN returned for a reevaluation and recommended using a low-dose estradiol patch.
# Initial epigastric pain:  Differential diagnosis for abdominal pain at presentation included peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or gastritis (viral or chemical).
She had been on protonix, but still may have developed gastric ulcerations or mucosal lesions secondary to steroids (per chemo), viral ulcers, or infection.
We continued her pantoprazole and treated her pain with PO dilaudid.
H. pylori serology and RUQ ultrasound were negative.
# Genital Herpes:  Shortly before presentation, she was diagnosed with vaginal herpes for which she was being treated with acyclovir.
# Hypertension:  The patient was initally on her outpatient metoprolol dose, however she had elevated pressures while hospitalized and so had her metoprolol increased to 50 mg daily and 5 mg of amlodipine added.
Her BP medications were held during her pancreatitis as she was NPO.
She was hypertensive in this setting and was treated with hydralazine and metoprolol IV.
# Diabetes:  We held her glimepiride and started her on a humalog insulin sliding scale for tighter glucose control.
Her home glargine was decreased from 20U to 18U qPM as she had a few episode of midnighttime hypoglycemia.
Insulin in the TPN was titrated upward, with adequate control of hyperglycemia.
This recommendation was balanced with her respiratory distress and anasarca in response to aggressive fluids.
She did recieve tube feedings and TPN for nutritional support.
Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 37.5mg po qday Acyclovir 400mg po Q 8 hours Glimepiride 2mg po BID Lantus/Humalog sliding scale  Discharge Medications: Pt expired on [**2135-9-18**].
