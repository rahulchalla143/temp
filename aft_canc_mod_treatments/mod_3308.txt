A second chest tube has been inserted on the right.
The second chest tube terminates medially near the right lung apex.
A PICC line has been pulled back and now terminates at the level of the superior vena cava.
IMPRESSION: Right pneumothorax no longer apparent post placement of a second right chest tube.
PICC line has been pulled back.
A right-sided PICC line and dual lead pacemaker are unchanged.
Ejection fraction and stress images not obtained.
Limited views of the lung apices demonstrate striking centrilobular emphysematous changes with several peripheral bullae noted.
High grade stenosis of the left renal artery and celiac trunc as described above.
3D reformations were not available at the time of this dictation.
# PTX: Patient had had a spontaneous PTX at the OSH, which per CXR report on transfer, had resolved s/p chest tube placement.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and the patient eventually received two chest tubes with resolution of the pneumothorax after removal of the chest tubes.
Patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen with appropriate saturation for the remainder of his hospitalization.
Tracheostomy was perfomed as well.
Given the patient's inability to swallow, he was made NPO and started on TPN before eventual G tube placement.
Upon transfer back to the floor, he underwent several speech and swallow evaluations.
Thus, he is NPO with only mouth swabs and ice chips.
Respiratory failure: The patient did well after his tracheostomy and quickly transitioned to trach mask.
There was concern for developing pneumonia on the R lobe of the lung and for this reason unasyn and vancomycin were started.
He completed a 10 course of vancomycin and zosyn, although all cultures remained negative: urine, blood, sputum, and pleural fluid.
He underwent thoracentesis which yielded exudative fluid with [**Numeric Identifier 73096**] RBCs and no malignant cells.
The patient received several blood transfusions for continuously dropping hematocrit.
Furthermore, patient was unable to tolerate PO medications [**3-11**] mass.
Patient was not symptomatic with this hypertension and was continued on IV/TD antihypertensives with SBP goal of 160- 170: permissive hypertension given chronic elevation as an outpatient.
Patient was on Digoxin as an outpatient and serum levels were appropriate.
Patient was continued on an Insulin sliding scale as well as received Insulin in his TPN.
After TPN was discontinued, once his tube feeds were at goal, his sugars became elevated >200.
He was then transitioned to glargine as well as RISS, with better sugar control.

You had two chest tubes placed in order to treat your collapsed lung and this was successful.
A tracheostomy was placed in your throat so you can breathe easily.
You cannot take anything per mouth except ice chips, as you run the risk of a fatal pneumonia if you do that.
Take all of your medications as directed.
