While in the ICU, she was intubated and extubated 4 different times.
An etiology of her respiratory failure was never established, although she was treated for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pneumonia, and CHF.
She would initially recover with mechanical ventilatory support and then worsen 2-7 days post-extubation, requiring reintubation.
Her course was complicated by what was felt to be chemo-related CHF with an EF of 20%, which improved on a subsequent echo.
