At that time she was on aztreonam and azithromycin (given penicillin allergy for coverage of pseudomonas) .
She was placed on CPAP however her symptoms did not improve.
She had an episode of hypoxia while attempting to replace ET tube down to the 60s.
Eventually the patient was successfully intubated by anesthesia by a fiberoptic.
She was given propofol during intubation and then sedated with fentanyl/midaz following.
Initial ABG following intubation revealed respiratory acidosis (7.17 pCO2 65 pO2 117 HCO3 25), however after increasing tidal volume and rate, ventilatory efforts have improved (pH 7.34 pCO2 32 pO2 68 HCO3 18 with a Lactate of 5.3).
Cardiology fellow performed bedside echo which demonstrated globally decreased function with questionable wall motion abnormality of anterior and septal walls with trivial pericardial effusion and no impairment of the RV, new compared to normal echo in [**2114**].
Cardiology recommended heparin, however the patient has not had head imaging recently so heparin was held until Head CT could be performed.
A central femoral line was placed.
