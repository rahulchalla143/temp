In short, he underwent balloon angioplasty of the SVC and during stent placement, the stent migrated to the heart, requiring emergent vascular surgery consult.

He was started on heparin gtt anticoagulation, transitioned to enoxaparin injections and oral warfarin.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will be checking your INR level and telling you how to adjust your coumadin dose.

Warfarin belongs to a class of medications called anticoagulants, which help prevent clots from forming in your blood and or keep grafts open.
You are taking warfarin because you have a medical condition that puts you at risk for forming dangerous blood clots, or to keep open vessels that have stents and or vessels that allow blood to flow for ischemic leg symptoms.
Write the day of your missed dose on your calendar and let your health care provider know at your next visit.
INR, which stands for International Normalized Ratio, is a blood test that helps determine the right warfarin dose for you.
Many drugs can potentially interfere with warfarin and may cause your INR to change, putting you at risk for bleeding or a clot.
These drugs include prescription medications, over-the-counter medications (like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), and dietary and herbal supplements.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should take your Aspirin as directed.
The amount of vitamin K in your diet may affect your response to warfarin.
Certain foods (like green, leafy vegetables) have high amounts of vitamin K and can decrease your INR.
His staff will call you with directions on how to adjust your coumadin dose, and when to stop lovenox.
