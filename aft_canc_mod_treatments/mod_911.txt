A repeat CT at that time showed no significant change, however, the patient also had an episode of coffee-ground emesis and was placed on a nasogastric tube, and the Gastroenterology service was consulted.

Lopressor 5 mg intravenously as needed  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired general practitioner, who lives with his wife at [**Location (un) 5481**].
Gastrointestinal:  Given the findings on the patient's CT, which were felt to be most consistent with either ischemic vs. infectious colitis, the patient was continued on intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
The Gastroenterology service was consulted and suggested a nasogastric tube on low intermittent wall suction and rectal tube for decompression, as well as antibiotic therapy.
A neoplasm at the splenic flexure could not be excluded.
The CT also demonstrated some improvement in the degree of small bowel dilatation, without obstruction of the splenic flexure, and non-visualization of the splenic vein, likely related to splenic vein thrombosis given the finding of a stable splenic infarct and perisplenic fluid.
Given these findings, colonoscopy was considered the next step in evaluation.
A KUB demonstrated continued dilated small bowel loops, however, as the nasogastric tubes did not have significant output on wall suction, the nasogastric tube was discontinued on hospital day four.
Antibiotics were discontinued after hospital day seven, as the patient continued to be afebrile.
As for the colonoscopy, the patient's colonoscopy was delayed on several occasions, initially due to an INR in the 2.5 range, which was thought secondary to malnutrition, as the patient's Coumadin had been held since the date of admission, and the patient was given oral vitamin K and one dose of 1 mg intravenously of vitamin K which decreased his INR to 1.5.
This was felt likely due to the patient's worsening depression, as he had not received any sedating medications during that day.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse granularity, erythema and congestion of the mucosa, with no bleeding in the stomach, body and antrum, compatible with gastritis and nasogastric tube trauma, as well as a markedly angulated stomach, suggesting potential extrinsic compression.
Given the partial nature of the obstruction, he will be allowed to have clears and a trial of clear liquids as tolerated.
Immunology/Allergy:  On [**9-12**], the patient was given two units of fresh frozen plasma in an attempt to temporarily reverse the INR for colonoscopy.
He was given 150 mg of Solu-Medrol as well as 50 mg of intravenous Benadryl.
The hospital course of the patient following [**9-15**], as well as the medications on discharge and the discharge diagnosis will be dictated in a separate discharge addendum.
