Her oxygen was weaned O2 3L -> 2L.
The patient was monitored on telemetry with continuous oxygen saturation monitoring.
On [**2156-10-28**] the patient attempted to be weaned of oxygen however oxygenation saturation remained in the 80's and the patient was 90-93% on 3L of oxygen.
An nasogastric tube was placed which immediately had 1500 cc of bilious output.
The patient was made NPO and intravenous fluids were restarted.
Frequency of nebulizing treatments were increased.
On [**2156-10-29**] Started Ceftazamide to cover possible respiratory source with the intention of if WBC was stable [**10-30**] antibiotics would be discontinued.
[**2156-10-31**] clamp trial preformed with 300 cc residual and the patient's WBC continued to be 20.6.
The nasogastric tube was removed.

The patient was given intravenous Zosyn and vancomycin.
The WBC was monitored and continued to be elevated it was decided that on [**2156-11-6**] radiology would preform CT-guided drainage of peripanc and perirectal collections.
These collections were drained and the drains were left in place.
On [**2156-11-10**] the patient was stable for discharge with all drains in place however, at time of discharge, the perrectal/pelvis drain was noted to be cracked in a portion of the drain catheter that cannot be replaced.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the inpatient colorectal surgery service after open proctosigmoidectomy, takedown splenic flexure, splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy, colonic jejunal pouch to anal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy to surgicall treat your rectal cancer.
You continued to have some elevation in enzymes and this required leaving the surgical drains in place near the spleen bed/pancreas.
This caused your white blood cell cound to rise and 2 radiology placed drains were placed in your abdomen and these will stay in place until at least your follow-up appointment.
It is imprortant that the drain sites are clensed daily by applying a saline soaked gauze around the skin where the drain is inserted and then apply a dry sterile gauze dressing to the site.

Please keep track of the output of these drains as shown by the nursing staff.
You will take the antibiotic Augmentin by mouth for a total of 14 days, your last day of antibiotics will be [**2156-11-22**].
You have recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to return home.
You will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment.
You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth.
The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration.
You must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks.
The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output.
You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain.
Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily.
