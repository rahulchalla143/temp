Blood and urine cultures sent and initiation of Zosyn and Vancomyocin empirically.
[**2154-4-3**] = Patient initially doing much better, maintaining pressures, improved mentation, improving creatinine and urine output, better pain control w/PCA.
Received central line secondary to non-functional peripherals and possible need for future fluid boluses/reliable line.
Continuing zosyn/vanc, with cultures pending.
Relieved w/nitro and rate controled w/10mg of IV lopressor(pushed 5 and 5).
Heparin drip started, cardiac enzymes cycled.
