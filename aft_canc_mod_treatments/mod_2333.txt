The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolisms for which he had been on Lovenox 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] (1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]) for months.
His CT Head was negative for obvious brain metastases, so he was started on a Heparin drip, then bridged to Lovenox 120 mg [**Hospital1 **], as one study has shown that a 20-25% increase in dose may prevent future recurrences in patients with LMWH failure.

His PICC catheter tip was cultured and had no growth.
