Admission Date:  [**2181-9-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-1-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Iodine / Lisinopril / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: SOB, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: 79 year old woman with history of severe oxygen dependent COPD, and recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer (diagnosed on imaging, no biopsy yet) who presents with 2 days of difficulty breathing, fatigue, slight confusion, and irritablity.
The patient was non-responsive, and was intubated for airway protection.
She was started on PCV with FIO2 40%, Peep 10, Rate 18, Inspiratory pressure 35.
She received 1 dose of vancomycin and zosyn for likely pneumonia.
No biopsy was performed, as the patient would likely be a poor candidate for both surgery and chemotherapy.
Multiple goals-of-care discussions were held between the family and the patient's PCP that resulted in "full code" status for the time being, in accordance with the patient's prior wishes.
However, the family is now considering a "do not resuscitate" order given her poor prognosis.
Patient was intubated and lightly sedated.
She has a significant smoking history of one to two packs over 50 years; however, she quit in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2178**] when she first was initiated on supplemental oxygen.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Endotracheal tube, left PICC line and nasogastric tube are in unchanged position.
She was intubated in the ED for airway protection due to unresponsiveness.
She completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.
Her peak airway pressures remained quite elevated and she required a large amount of sedation in order to be comfortable.
She could not ultimately be weaned off the ventilator prior to her passing.
Rather than continuing to give enemas, these measures were stopped in favor of comfort measures.
