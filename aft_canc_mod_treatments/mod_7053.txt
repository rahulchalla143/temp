At Discharge: ________________  Pertinent Results: [**2105-7-3**] CT head 2.5-cm hyperdense extra-axial mass extending from the inner table of the left posterior frontal/anterior parietal bone with small surrounding subarachnoid hemorrhage and possible internal hemorrhage.
[**2105-7-4**] MRA brain 2.5 x 2.2 cm extra-axial mass with surrounding meningeal enhancement and associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe with edema as described above.
The extra-axial location and involvement of the adjacent bone is suggestive of a meningioma but other forms of more aggressive extra-axial masses should be considered in the differential diagnosis given the presence of extensive hemorrhage which is somewhat unusual for a meningioma.
However, hemorrhage would be unusual with a simple meningioma and an aggressive meningioma should be suspected.
Status post left parietal craniotomy and resection.
