There is a small amount of simple-appearing free pelvic fluid and a heterogeneously enhancing structure within the lower pelvis which may represent a fibroid uterus; pelvic ultrasound is recommended for further assessement as indicated.
Cardiac Echo was performed in anticipation of surgery which was WNL with EF > 55%  On day 4 of the hospitalization she spiked a fever to 101.9.
She was treated with 5 days on Unasyn and fluconazole.
On [**2175-2-28**] she was taken to the OR by Drs [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Right hepatic trisegmentectomy and median sternotomy by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**].
A right trisegmentectomy with clear gross margins was done.
-Immunostains of the tumor cells within the areas of epithelioid differentiation are diffusely and strongly positive for HMB45, Mart 1 and S100, and negative for actin, desmin, LCA, EMA and cytokeratin cocktail.
Given the patient's history of previously excised invasive malignant melanoma of the right mid-back (which also demonstrated epithelioid differentiation within the vertical growth phase; see prior report S02-[**Numeric Identifier 37915**]), the tumor morphology and immunophenotype support a diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma.
-Portal lymph node, excisional biopsy: One lymph node with no malignancy identified.
Drains were tested for bilirubin on POD 5 and found to be consistent with serum, the medial drain was removed on POD 7.
IV fluid was restarted on POD 9 at 1/2 cc/cc as weight was down 8 kg after the surgery.
