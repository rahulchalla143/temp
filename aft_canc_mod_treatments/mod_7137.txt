Further evaluation of the patient with bronchoscopy and/or close follow-up with chest CT in [**4-18**] weeks after antibiotic therapy is reccomended.
Respiratory distress: Her respiratory distress was thought to be due to a combination of pneumonia (MRSA on sputum [**4-9**], klebsiella on BAL [**4-20**]), influenza (positive influenza A [**4-11**]), her underlying COPD, and a non-small cell lung cancer and associated right sided effusion discovered during this admission.
She was intubated in the ambulance on her way to the ED and remained intubated until [**5-1**] (see below).
Her MRSA pneumonia was treated with vancomycin and her klebsiella was treated with a seven day course of levofloxacin.
Her COPD was treated with albuterol, atrovent and steroids.
Her NSCLCa was treated with five doses of palliative XRT (finished [**4-30**]).
Her right effusion which was thought to be due to her malignancy was treated first with a therapeutic thoracentecis ([**4-25**]) and eventually IP was consulted to place a pleurex catheter ([**4-29**]) for continued drainage.
Despite all of this treatment she required excessive settings on the ventilator including FiO2 up to 70% and a PEEP of 15 to keep her O2 sat in the 90s.
