He was discharged subsequent to that and was treated on an outpatient basis with ciprofloxacin for question prostatitis.
He was admitted to the hospital upon discovering this in [**2152-12-24**] and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
He underwent computed tomography-guided drainage of the abscess collection that grew out enterococcus in two strains; of which one was vancomycin resistant.
He had a follow-up computed tomography which demonstrated another abscess adjacent to the previously drained collection was noted on repeat computed tomography done at this time.
He was admitted to the hospital and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics consisting of levofloxacin and Flagyl and scheduled for percutaneous drainage of the second collection.
Status post angioplasty times two.
Glucophage 1000 mg twice per day.
Glipizide 10 mg twice per day.
Actos 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Spironolactone 50 mg by mouth once per day.
Diltiazem 180 mg by mouth once per day.
He had a drain in place in his left upper quadrant with dark serous fluid.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the abdomen showed an increase in the left upper quadrant fluid collection with a significant amount of air and fluid; consistent with an abscess with the percutaneous catheter inferior and posterior, and no communication with between the abscess collection and the percutaneous drain.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Based on the patient's clinical presentation, he was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous levofloxacin and Flagyl.
He was made nothing by mouth and placed on intravenous hydration and pan-cultured.
He was taken the following day for a computed tomography-guided drainage of the left upper quadrant collection.
He continued to spike fevers, and the decision was made to take him to the operating room for definitive resection and drainage of the abscess.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2153-2-6**] where he underwent a en bloc excision of the abdominal tumor with a transverse colectomy, partial gastrectomy, splenectomy, and distal pancreatectomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Recovery Room intubated and sedated.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  He had an epidural catheter placed intraoperatively, and this was run with good pain control.
He was also maintained on low-dose propofol for additional sedation.
However, on postoperative day two, he spiked a fever to 101.2, and his epidural catheter was removed by the Acute Pain Service.
He was changed to intermittent boluses of Dilaudid for pain which he tolerated well.
His propofol was discontinued, and he was maintained on Dilaudid only.
However, on postoperative day 12, he had an episode of acute confusion and was given Narcan, and all of his narcotics were discontinued.
At the time of discharge, he had cleared and was oriented times three with all sedative medications discontinued.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient reported a history of bronchospasm with beta blockers, and thus was maintained on a diltiazem drip for heart rate control.
After his tube feeds were being tolerated, he was changed to intermittent oral diltiazem with good heart rate control in the 70s and 80s.
He was stabilized, and his ventilator was slowly weaned on pressure support.
He received aggressive pulmonary toilet with chest physical therapy and was weaned down to room air at the time of discharge.
He was placed on a nonrebreather with improved oxygenation.
After transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, he was able to be weaned off his oxygen.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  He underwent the above-mentioned procedure including a splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and transverse colectomy.
He was started on tube feeds on postoperative day four.
His nasogastric tube was self-discontinued on [**2-15**] and was replaced without incident, and his tube feeds were resumed.
After he stabilized from a respiratory standpoint, this was removed, and he was started on an oral diet.
Because he continued to have a persistent white count, his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] fluid was sent for culture, and this subsequently grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and his antibiotic regimen was changed.
GENITOURINARY ISSUES:  The patient received several fluid boluses during the early postoperative hours for a low urine output.
This stabilized, and he was deemed ready for diuresis on postoperative day four.
However, he was found to respond better to bolused doses of Lasix and was changed back.
His Foley was discontinued on postoperative day sixteen.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  As stated above, the patient received multiple fluid boluses for low urine output during postoperative days one through two.
However, he was subsequently changed to maintenance fluids, but these were discontinued when his tube feeds were advanced to goal.
He tolerated goal tube feeds throughout most of his hospital course and has now been changed to an American Diabetes Association diet.
ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient was initially placed on an insulin drip due to a high serum glucose.
He was changed over to NPH when his tube feeds were at a steady state with an accompanying sliding-scale; however, he needed intermittent periods with an insulin drip due to difficult glycemic control.
His oral hypoglycemics were restarted on [**2-21**]; however, he continued to have elevated glucose levels.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation was obtained with recommendations to continue the patient on his oral hypoglycemic medications with close monitoring of his blood sugars and consideration to add a basal insulin such as Lantus should there be problems with glycemic control and continue to hold the Actos.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  He was transfused 2 units of blood preoperatively, and postoperatively remained stable with the exception of transfusion of 2 units for a hematocrit of 26 and 27 from presumed blood loss anemia.
For deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, he was placed on three times per day subcutaneous heparin at a dose of 5000 units.
However, due to his obesity and immobility, he was considered at high risk and changed to Lovenox 30 twice per day on postoperative day eight.
He was started on aspirin on [**2-19**], and his platelet count is currently trending down.
The initial abscess, as stated above, had grown two species of enterococcus of which one was vancomycin resistant.
His intraoperative cultures grew enterococcus, and his culture from his second preoperative percutaneous drain grew gram-negative rods of two morphologies; Proteus and Enterococcus that was vancomycin sensitive.
Based on these presumptive cultures, he was placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl postoperatively until the final intraoperative cultures came back.
Because of his persistent fevers and elevated white blood cell count, vancomycin was started on [**2153-2-8**] to provide additional coverage for Enterococcus.
His sputum culture from [**2-8**] grew Klebsiella pneumoniae that was highly resistant and essentially only sensitive to meropenem to cover him for a ventilator associated pneumonia.
He was maintained on wet-to-dry dressing changes; however, the swab from that incision grew Klebsiella that was gain highly resistant and enterococcus that was resistant to levofloxacin, and penicillin, and ampicillin and sensitive to vancomycin.
His levofloxacin was discontinued when the meropenem was started.
At the time the sensitivity came back, he was than changed to linezolid on [**2153-2-19**].
Of note, because of his splenectomy he received his post splenectomy vaccines on [**2152-2-21**]; consisting of meningococcus, pneumovax, and haemophilus influenza type B.
Of note, he is to stay on antibiotics for a total of two weeks from [**2153-2-19**] to consist of linezolid 600 mg intravenously twice per day and meropenem 1 gram intravenously q.8h.
The left subclavian triple lumen should remain in to facilitate the administration of his intravenous antibiotics and should be removed after 14 days after his antibiotic course is completed.
