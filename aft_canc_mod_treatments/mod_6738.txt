Sepsis:  The patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis during IR extrahepatic biliary drain placement.
It is likely that the patient became bacteremic during this procedure, given his hypotension and rigors.
CVL was placed, and he was started on Vanc/Zosyn.
His SBP initially responded to IVFs, though his UOP then decreased so he was placed on Levophed / Vasopressin / Neosynepherine.
On [**8-28**], he had a cortisol stimulation test and was placed on stress dose steroids for inadequate cortisol response.
At this time, there was also a verbal report of Pseudomonas growing in the bile culture, so he was placed on Cipro for double Pseudomonas coverage.
He was intubated for respiratory failure on [**8-29**], and his pressors requirement gradually increased.
He was placed on ARDSnet ventilatory parameters and ultimately expired secondary to severe sepsis as described above.
Biliary Obstruction:  The patient has tumor obstructing the afferent limb of the pancreaticobiliary anastamosis, now s/p stent placement.
The stent initially drained serosanguinous fluid and then became bilious.
His UOP continued to decrease, so he was started on CVVH on [**2178-8-28**].
# DM2:  He was initially continued on a HISS.
He was thus started on an insulin gtt.
