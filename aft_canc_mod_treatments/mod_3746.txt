Due to concern for thrombus risk in his prosthetic aortic heart valve, heparin was started and then bridged back to coumadin when it appeared he was not having large amounts of bleeding.
He was receiving blood transfusions almost daily to maintain his hematocrit 26-30% Sutent 50 mg was started on [**12-11**], which was the dosage recommended by his Oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 76148**].
He had Coil and Gelfoam embolization of the 3rd to 4th order inferior branch off the replaced right hepatic artery resulting in occlusion of one of the arteries supplying hepatic/hepatic flexure mass.
Following the procedure his hematocrit has remained 28-33%.
He received an additional 2 units on [**12-22**].
Bowel movements since the time of the procedure have been brown with no evidence of bleeding.
His coumadin was only held on the 11th and he has otherwise received 8 mg daily with goal INR 1.5-2 (has aortic valve).
