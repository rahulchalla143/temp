The most likely cause of your low blood pressure may have been due to over-dialyzing with peritoneal dialysis at home resulting in removing too much fluid.
During your hospital course you were started on antibiotics for presummed septic infection but these medications have been discontinued given no signs or symptoms of infection.
You were also started on high dose steriods because your body could not produce these steriods on its own during a stressful event such as low blood pressure.
