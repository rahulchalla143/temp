Bone marrow biopsy [**4-23**]- Markedly hypercellular marrow with trilineage dysplasia in keeping with persistent involvement by patient's known myelodysplastic syndrome, with  increased pronormoblasts worrisome for an evolving pure erythroleukemia (see note).
Note: Increased abnormal early pronormoblasts are seen comprising approximately 40% of aspirate differential and nearly 60% of core cellularity.
# MDS, transformed to acute leukemia: s/p 2 cycles decitabine and revlimid (5q- cytogenetics) with evidence of transformation to acute erythroblastic leukemia with 60% erythroblastic core.
TTE performed to establish baseline prior to chemotherapy and was unchanged from prior.
The patient was continued on ciprofloxacin and fluconazole prophylaxis initially, but both were discontinued in case they were precipitating delirium.
She was started on acyclovir prophylaxis.
She required intermittent transfusions throughout admission to maintain hct>21 and plts>10.
Per neurology's recommendations, a continuous video EEG was initiated which showed encephalopathy.
However, patient's lithium and fluphenazine had both been decreased during last admission, so there was concern that these medication changes may have precipitated change in mental status.
24hr urine performed on admission and GFR calculated at 55-60% which is consistent with Cr.
Nephrotoxic medications were avoided throughout admission.
# Bipolar disorder: Patient on lithium, fluphenazine and trihexyphenidyl.
For delirium fluphenazine was halved to 5mg qhs and trihexyphenidyl was halved to 1mg po BID for extrapyramidal symptoms.
# DM2: BS well controlled during last hospitalization on glargine [**Hospital1 **] and ISS.
The patient was continued on lispro sliding scale.
She was continued on glargine qAM and qHS for basal coverage.
She continued to require frequent PRBC and platelet transfusions to maintain a hematocrit >21 and plt >10.
She was given Dexamethasone without any improvement in her mental status.
After several meetings with her HCP and no significant improvement in her mental status the decision was made to transition this pt to comfort measures only.
