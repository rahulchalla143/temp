Groin did not reveal any palpable lymphadenopathy.
The EKG showed sinus tachycardia with borderline LVH  and  some  minor  T-wave abnormalities.
He had a central  line  placed  by  the Surgical House Staff and began total  parenteral nutrition almost immediately.
In addition, he  was  encouraged to eat until his operation was scheduled.
During the preoperative period, the  patient did require a radiologic guided paracentesis for symptomatic  ascites.
Once  he was adequate rehydrated and received  approximately a week of total parenteral nutrition, he  went  to  the operating room and underwent an exploratory laparotomy  with  resection  of  this mass and debulking with Argon beam coagulation.
The  mass  was  noted to be adherent to the transverse colon, therefore, a transverse colectomy was performed.
A peritonectomy was not performed.
However,  after approximately a week of managing this patient in the Intensive Care Unit using percutaneously placed drains and intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy, it was clear that the patient's sepsis was not going to resolve without laparotomy.
During  this  time,  the patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotic  and antifungal therapy.
He  was intermittently on pressors during this time.
Due to the patient's critical condition, and the fact that he was  not  improving  with an anastomotic leak on nonoperative therapy,  the  family  was  reapproached and the decision was made  to  take  this  patient  back to the operating room for urgent diversion.
The  drainage  catheters were exchanged for sterile catheters to   continue  antibiotic  irrigation  in  the  postoperative period.
The  patient  expired on [**2185-3-17**] after support was withdrawn.
Pneumothorax  status  post  central  line  placement, requiring temporary tube thoracostomy.
