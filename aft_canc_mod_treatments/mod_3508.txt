Surgical clips project along the left axilla.
A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe global hyopokinesis suggestive of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging dedicated to the area of pain demonstrated.
Internal vascularity is demonstrated with color Doppler imaging.
There is calcified and noncalcified plaque at the origins of the internal carotid arteries, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.
The patient is status post laminectomy at L3 and L4.
PROCEDURES/INTERVENTIONS: [**2134-6-29**] - Right basilic vein approach- double lumen PICC placement under IR guidance  [**2134-6-30**] -CXR: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an OG tube that extends well into the distal stomach.
Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5.1 cm above the carina.
PARATHYROID SCAN Study Date of [**2134-7-5**] RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 21.5 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi ([**2134-7-5**]); INTERPRETATION:  Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes and 2 hours.
A right pacemaker is in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old woman with past medical history of etoh abuse, primary hyperparathyroidism s/p left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection in [**2127**], AF and sCHF p/w hypercalcemia, [**Last Name (un) **], elevated troponin, ruled out for ACS with hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
Improved with IV fluids and lasix.
she has a known baseline of hypercalcemia between [**10-19**].
She was treated with calcitonin, cinacalcet, brief course of hydrocortisone (100 mg q8h) as well as aggressive IVF balanced with lasix (for volume).
She was placed on a low calcium diet.
Her previous left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection operative reports and surgical pathology from [**Hospital3 **] were reviewed among her inpatient and outpatient endocrinologists, surgery, and radiology.
The decision was made to pursue  an exploratory surgery for resection of the neck tumor on [**2134-6-30**] rather than FNA alone, for concern of possible seeding if it were to be a malignant tumor and the ultimate goal of treatment.
Pt was maintained on IVF and intermittent lasix dosing, to gently diurese and allow for slow calcium excretion.
A decision was made to stop her cinacalcet given her calcium normalization and to monitor her calcium daily at rehab.
Her calcium values will be faxed to her Endocrinologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was subsequently re-intubated and started on dopamine drip.
Pt previously had a PICC line, but was found to be not working well.
A Central venous line was therefore placed.
Hypotension was unlikely acute coronary syndrome with troponin downtrending since admission.
This could have been exacerbated in the setting of intubation and initiation of propofol.
She received large volume IVF for treatment of hypercalcemia with frequent dosing of Lasix.
However, her lasix was held on the day of the CT neck/torso for renal protection given the contrast load, and the rate of the fluid was decreased slightly to avoid acute exacerbation.
The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix.
She was restarted on 40 mg PO Lasix and 6.25 mg PO carvedilol, but her blood pressure dropped to the 80's, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
These medications were held on discharge, but can be restarted as needed.
# Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease.
It improved while she was on treatment for hypercalcium, likely due to improved forward flow.
Lasix was held on the day of her CT neck/torso given contrast dye being a nephrotoxin.
She has not taken warfarin for about 1 month prior to admission.
She was started on ASA instead.
Pt was restarted on coumadin post-operatively and will need follow up.
Carbamazepine was initially held given underlying AMS, but it was restarted as her confusion was resolving.
Her home medications were held.
She was placed on insulin sliding scale.
She is discharged on her home anti-diabetic agents except for metformin given her kidney disease and Cr 1.5 on discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -daily Ca and PTH for 5 days after discharge -fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 **] -follow up with surgery as directed -Full code -Coumadin restarted -> continued INR monitoring as outpt -home carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID and furosemide 40 mg PO daily were discontinued due to borderline blood pressure (SBP 80's-90's) after aggressive diuresis, may need to restart  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

This was treated with fluids, lasix, and several other medications.
