It was felt to be difficult to extubate the patient given edematous airways and aggressive diuresis was begun.
On [**9-3**] the RISBI was 73 and the patient strongly desired the tube out; the patient was extubated on [**2103-9-3**].
She was clear in her wishes to not be reintubated, and was begun on bipap and then on cpap overnight.
Morphine was administered to ease her breathing.
2)A-fib/AVR - Coumadin was held until after procedures.
IV heparin was restarted [**9-1**], and coumadin was restarted [**2103-9-3**].
The plan was to resume OP meds when extubated & taking PO meals.
She was offered an NGT to begin tube feeds, but given her daily reevaluation for extubation, she preferred not to begin tube feeds.
She received maintainence fluids while not taking PO's.
Received fluid boluses but did not respond with increased urine output.
On [**9-2**] oliguria improved, questionably due to position of Foley catheter.
8)Access - 2 peripheral IV's, Foley catheter.
