HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2165-1-11**] where radical cystectomy, left radical nephrectomy was performed.
A Foley catheter, suprapubic tube, two JPs and right ureteral stent were placed intraoperatively.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells in the OR.
His NG tube was DC'd without complications.
His Foley and SP tubes were being flushed with normal saline tid.
He started on oral pain medication which seemed to be working well for him.
BUN and creatinine continued to rise.
It was felt that the patient's BUN and creatinine rise was probably a combination of systemic absorption of urine in the peritoneum, as well as some edema in the ureter post stent removal.
He was put on fluid restriction.
His output had changed and he was now mostly putting out urine out of Foley and JP tube.
There was a consideration for percutaneous drainage of right kidney due to acute renal failure; however, on the evening of postop day #9, the patient's BUN and creatinine started to decline, so it was decided to hold.
The patient was placed on oxygen, antibiotics and heparin for anticoagulation.
His Foley and SP were irrigated more aggressively and some mucous came out, after which the patient's symptoms have resolved.
