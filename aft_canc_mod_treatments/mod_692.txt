Since the patient had SOB, chest pain, and a R apical pneumothorax after his mediastinoscopy at [**Hospital1 1474**], it was decided that the giant lymph nodes found on CT Torso, the lung lesion, and 2 liver lesions would not be biopsied, in case the results of the bone marrow aspirate were sufficient for diagnosis.
T- and L-spine XR showed neither a pathologic fracture nor lytic lesions.
During admission, the pt experienced a fall, in which he was "walking normally, and then all of a sudden my legs went numb, and I went to take a step and my legs buckled like the batteries had been taken out of them".
Pt was started on steroids with communication with Hem-Onc.
Pt has a h/o spinal fusion surgery [**30**] years ago, and an LP under fluoro was attempted to rule out carcinomatous meningitis.
EPISTAXIS: Diff Dx:  Epistaxis that does not stop after several hours, with a plt count of 56, in a non-uremic pt is unusual, and suggestive of myeloma, lymphoma, bone marrow aplasia, DIC, qualitative plt defects.
Epistaxis ceased only after infusion of 1 unit plts.
PURPURA: Diff Dx:  Purpura diffusely over the chest, abdomen, and legs, with a plt count of 56, in a non-uremic pt is unusual, and suggestive of myeloma, lymphoma, bone marrow aplasia, DIC, qualitative plt defects.
The pt presented with green-yellow purpura on his chest and abdomen, as well as petechiae on his abdomen with no h/o trauma.
Pt's pain was successfully controlled on a morphine PCA pump at a maximum of 10 mg/hr.
He had been maintained on Metoprolol and ASA, but no ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **].
Pt's ASA was discontinued due to pt's bleeding tendency.
DM: Pt was maintained on Insulin SS.
COPD (Emphysema): Pt has a 50 pk-yr smoking history and emphysema, and was maintained at >95% O2 sat on 2L O2 nasal cannula alone.
PROPHYLAXIS: Due to pt's bleeding tendency, pneumoboots and no heparin sc were used.
