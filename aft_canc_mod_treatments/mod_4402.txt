Left frontal large heterogenous lesion with calcification and with hematocrit levels(suggesting subacute to chronic hemorrhage), consistent with left frontal mass with hemorrhage.
9mm rightward midline shift with subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
Compression of the left lateral ventricle and third ventricle with enlargement of the right lateral ventricle, consistent with obstructive hydrocephalus.
Mild prominence of the fourth ventricle  MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST [**2199-10-14**] Known Left large frontal lobe mass with internal hemorrhage as detailed on concurrent CT with patient status post resection at time of this review.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2199-10-15**] The patient is status post frontoparietal craniotomy with subtotal resection of a large hemorrhagic left frontal mass.
In addition, there is unchanged 10mm rightward subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
Stable marked rightward shift of midline structures with subfalcine herniation, left uncal herniation, and entrapment and dilation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and right lateral ventricle.
The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with subtotal resection of large hemorrhagic left frontal lesion.
There is a large residual cystic component containing layering hemorrhage resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus that is intervally worsened and stable rightward subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
CT HEAD POST ASPIRATION [**2199-10-15**] Status post frontal craniotomy with subtotal resection of hemorrhagic frontal mass and subsequent stereotactic-guided cyst aspiration.
There still remains a large residual hemorrhagic cystic component with associated obstructive hydrocephalus, enlargement of the right lateral ventricle occipital and temporal horns, rightward subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
CT HEAD S/P CRANIOTOMY AND MASS RESECTION [**2199-10-15**] 1.
Status post left frontal craniotomy with subtotal resection, hemorrhagic frontal mass and subsequent aspiration of hemorrhage in situ, now with drain in place; interval improvement of hemorrhagic collection with increased left frontal region pneumocephalus.
Persistent post-surgical appearance of craniotomy, repeated mass resection and cyst aspiration with decreased pneumocephalus, but stable heterogeneous appearance of edema and blood product at the surgical site in the left frontal lobe with persistent 11 mm rightward shift of midline structures and uncal herniation.
Interval decrease in size of visible portion of the right lateral ventricle with a drainage catheter in place.
There is a heterogeneous fluid surrounding the mid portion of the drainage catheter; however, distal tip does not seem to have significant fluid around it.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical workup.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], patient was very lethargic and declined very quickly, he was taken emergently to the OR for L craniotomy for mass resection.
He was therefore taken to the OR again on the evening of [**10-15**] for left craniotomy for resection of residual tumor.
A post-op head CT was done which showed improved midline shift and resection of the mass.
On the morning of [**10-17**] his exam was unchanged and his intracranial drain was at 5cm H2O above the tragus.
A mannitol wean was also started on [**10-17**].
On [**10-19**], patient's Decadron was weaned and he was encouraged to start IS and take in more PO.
