Admission Date:  [**2120-3-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Allopurinol And Derivatives / Vancomycin / Ciprofloxacin / Augmentin / Azithromycin / Linezolid / Cefepime / Iodine / Meropenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Febrile neutropenia and meropenem desensitization     Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cycle 13 of decitabine   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome with acceleration to AML s/p clofarabine induction therapy with prolonged remission then recurrence, s/p 12 cycles of decitabine, presenting with febrile neutropenia for meropenem desensitization in the ICU.
He was supported with pRBC and platelet transfusions.
Upon his return visits to clinic for the last 2 days, he has required further platelet/RBC transfusions for plt counts of <10, Hct<30, with appropriate bumps to transfusions (Plt 6 --> 50 this AM).
Prior to transfusions, he has been receiving Benadryl and Tylenol, which he did receive the morning prior to admission before getting his platelets.
He is able to tolerate Daptomycin and Clindamycin.
However, if broader coverage is needed (Aztreonam or Meropenem), he must undergo a desensitization protocol in the ICU.
In [**2119-10-4**], he underwent a successful meropenem sensitization after developing a drug-induced hypersensitivity rash while on Cefepime.
Linezolid desensitization has been unsuccessful in the past.
Cefepime and allopurinol should be completely avoided.
He also strongly recommended standing doses of H1 and H2 blockers (diphenhydramine 25 mg q6h or hydroxyzine 25mg PO q6h + famotidine 20 mg q12h) and to continue these agents through the length of his antibiotics.
Blood culture was drawn from his portacath, U/A and urine culture done, but they were unable to draw peripheral cultures prior to receiving his 1st dose of Daptomycin 450mg.
Received Tylenol 650mg and 1L NS.
Since that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow cellularity.
He has completed 12 cycles of decitabine, with the 8th cycle complicated by pneumonitis and deterioration of lung function, requiring home oxygen use.
He has previously opted not to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant due to quality of life desires.

Brief Hospital Course: 59M with hx of MDS with transformation to AML s/p clofarabine and decitabine chemotherapy and multiple antibiotic allergies, now admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia for meropenem desensitization.
Febrile neutropenia and antibiotics hypersensitivity.
ANC of 64 on admission, s/p recent decitabine infusion, with fever to 101.4.
Due to the patient's numerous antibiotic allergies, he cannot receive Cefepime for treatment.
He also has a portacath and has been exposed to health-care associated pathogens recently, so he needs covererage for GPs but cannot receive Vancomycin due to allergy.
He has tolerated Daptomycin well in the past.
In the ICU patient underwent Meropenem desensitization per protocol and treated with Daptomycin for GP coverage.
Given his extensive history of allergy to antibiotics, and after extensive consultation with both Allergy and ID, the patient was started on tigecycline.
After discussion with patient, BMT, Allergy, and ID, the patient was started on oral levofloxacin, starting with a 10% dose and progressing to a full dose.
He remained afebrile since [**3-17**] when the oral levofloxacin was started (D1 = [**3-17**]) and tapering of prednisone to 10 mg was started on [**3-18**] per Allergy recommendation given his clinical improvement.
However, by [**3-21**], intense erythroderma again spread to include his face, which he reports never had before with prior antibiotics hypersensitivity, his body ached, and his LE became more swollen.
Given that patient had not spiked a fever since [**3-17**] and his hypersensitivity appeared worsened, levofloxacin was discontinued (total 4 day course) and prednisone was uptitrated to 20 mg daily on [**3-21**].
He was restarted on home doxycycline on [**3-22**].
His prednisone was again tapered to 5 mg on [**3-28**].
He was discharged with home doxyycline and voriconazole.
He was given instruction on the prednisone taper and petrolatum for protective barrier for his skin.
Meropenem desensitization: The patient had undergone a successful desensitization to Meropenem previously, when a decitabine cycle was complicated by a COPD exacerbation.
Cefepime is not tolerated well by the patient and he requires Pseudomonal coverage for febrile neutropenia.
In the ICU pt initially underwent meropenem desensitization per protocol including standing benadryl 25mg IV Q6H and Q12 hour standing H2 blocker.
B-blocker was held to prevent blunting of allergic response.
Meropenem was stopped, and the patient was given an additional dose of diphenhydramine and started on low-dose (20mg) prednisone.
See above for the remaining of his neutropenia and associated antibiotics hypersensitivity.
At admission, he was s/p 12 cycles of decitabine with persistent, transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia.
He was transfused with pRBC and platelet frequently to maintain Hct of about 30 and plt > 10.
He was started on hydroxyurea on [**2120-3-28**] and cycle 13 of decitabine on [**2120-3-29**] because of increased WBC (~11,000) and blast counts (~75%).
Hydroxyurea was discontinued on [**3-30**] as his WBC improved.
Acute kidney injury: Initially, his creatinine was 1.2, which is slightly elevated above his baseline.
Home tiotropium and albuterol were continued.
He was also started on monteleukast.

Subsequently, tigecycline was tried, but you continued to have significant skin reaction.
Therefore, you were started on levofloxacin because you tolerated similar medicine in the past.
While you experienced the allergic effect from the failed desensitization, you were started on medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
You are currently on a prednisone taper as your skin reaction improves.
Your white blood cells and blasts begin to rise during this hospital stay.
You were started on hydroxyurea and the 13th cycle of decitabine.
Hydroxyurea was stopped before your discharge.
Please note the following changes in your medications: - Please START diphenhydramine 25 mg (Benadryl) tab, 1 tab, by mouth, every 6 hours as needed for itching skin.
Take 10 mg (2 tabs) once a day for 5 days, then 5 mg (1 tab) once a day for 5 days, then 5 mg (1 tab) once EVERY OTHER DAY for 5 days.
