Mass causes mild effacement of the fourth ventricle which is displaced towards the right and asymmetry of the quadrigeminal plate cistern.
CXR [**2106-7-19**] The Port-A-Cath catheter has been inserted through the right subclavian approach with its tip at the level of superior mid SVC.
CT head [**2106-7-20**] Expected small amount of blood at the surgical site in the left cerebellar hemisphere with expected postoperative pneumocephalus.
MRI [**2106-7-21**] Post-operative changes related to left suboccipital craniotomy and resection of the left cerebellar mass.
Post-surgical changes related to suboccipital craniotomy and resection of left cerebellar mass are noted.
Hyperattenuating rim in the resection bed likely represents small amount of post-surgical hemorrhage, unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 F with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p chemo/XRT (finished [**3-/2106**]) and recent LLL wedge resection ([**2106-6-22**] with biopsy +adenoca at [**Hospital1 34**]), COPD, [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital3 5365**] where she presented with frontal headache x 3 for cerebellar mass.
She was started on Dexamethasone 4mg every 6hrs.
On admission, her serum NA was 127, she was given IVF but her serum NA worsened, going down to 125.
On [**7-17**], her serum NA remained low (126) and IVF were stopped and she was fluid restricted.
Her fluid restriciton was lifted following this.
She was neurologically stable and transferred to the SDU with EVD drain in place.
Her Na began to drop so her fluid restriction was restarted.
Repeat Na check was stable at 127 so she was started on salt tabs.
Her salt tabs were increased and she was given a dose of lasix.
