#CT ABD/PELVIS [**2185-1-21**] STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.
Within the limits of a non-contrast study, the liver, spleen and adrenal glands appear normal.
BONES: Patient is status post posterior spinal fusion of L5-S1 with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year-old female with chronic anemia, prior MRSA UTI, and recent admission for RLL pneumonia admitted to MICU [**2185-1-21**] with [**Last Name (un) **], hypotension, leukocytosis/bandemia in context of recent nausea, poor PO intake, diarrhea, UTI.
MICU COURSE  In the MICU ([**Date range (1) 110500**]), she required fluid resuscitation and 1 unit pRBCs for hypotension.
She was treated for candidal UTI with fluconazole (initially cefepime, linezolid until culture data returned).
Initially also received vancomycin PO given concern for colitis based on symptoms and finding of bowel wall thickening on CT abdomen/pelvis on preliminary read; symptoms resolved, C. difficile toxin was negative, and final read changed to no evidence of colitis.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] persistent agitation/delirium, psychiatry was consulted and recommend haloperidol 0.5mg PO Q4-6HR PRN agitation and 0.5mg PO HS.
Although her admission urine culture grew out fungus and she clinically improved on fluconazole in the MICU, it seemed unlikely that fungal UTI was responsible for her sepsis (blood cultures showed no fungus growth, patient was non-toxic appearing).
With all of these findings, her fluconazole was discontinued.
Nephrology recommended conservative management with no IV fluids, renally dosed medications, and expected her recovery from ATN to be slow and perhaps incomplete given her age and the severity of the insult.
Her citalopram was discontinued, and she was started on mirtazapine 7.5 mg QHS.
She was taken off of her prn valium which had been given at her rehab and started on both PRN and standing PM haldol 1 mg QHS.
QTc was obtained prior to each haldol administration and was consistently normal.
Per psychiatric consult's recommendation, patient was discharged on mirtazapine, and Haldol as needed at bedtime, her valium and citalopram remained discontinued.
She was guiac negative on admission and was mantained on GI prophylaxis.
