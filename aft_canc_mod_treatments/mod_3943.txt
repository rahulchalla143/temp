Rate controlled now with po diltiazem, po amiodarone and s/p diuresis.
The pt was rate controlled with HR 60s-70s with a diltiazem drip IV, then transitioned to po diltiazem.
She was also given amiodarone drip IV, transitioned to po amiodarone, with a taper of dose.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix 40mg qd (she puts out 700cc-1L with this dose), and given additional doses depending on physical exam findings and oxygen requirement on nasal cannula.
Her blood pressure was tightly controlled, and she is on both a beta blocker and an ACEI.
Aspirin was held given her myelodysplastic syndrome.
The pt likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction, echo was completed and found to have EF 55%, mod dilated left atrium.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix (responds to 40mg IV lasix).
She is to continue her maintenance dose of 40mg IV lasix qd, with monitoring of electrolytes (chem 10) qday and repletion of lytes.
If the patient's weight increases >3 lbs, then give additional dose IV lasix 40mg X 1.

No anticoagulation given myelodysplastic syndrome, so hold coumadin.

Pt given 1g CTX IV and 500mg po azithro in ED, and this was continued on medical floor.

She was given ipratropium nebs q6h with no albuterol b/c of her Atrial fibrillation.
