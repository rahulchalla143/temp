Abdominal wound dehiscence - status post re-    exploration and repair.
He had already been scheduled for a prior colonoscopy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service and started on antibiotics which included levofloxacin and Flagyl for his bandemia and underwent a CT scan which showed some nonspecific circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon.
He therefore underwent his sigmoidoscopy with a variable colonoscope on [**2161-11-13**].
This was a limited exam of the left colon due to lack of bowel preparation but blood was noted in the colon with significant diverticulosis.
There was concern that he had had myocardial infarction, but given the fact that his septic state would not improve without surgery after consultation with General Surgery, Colorectal Surgery and Gastroenterology, it was decided that the patient should be taken to the Operating Room.
On [**11-13**], he underwent a left colectomy with a Hartmann's pouch and a transverse colostomy.
Although attempts were made to wean him off the ventilator with aggressive diuresis and various ventilator management strategies, the patient was never able to wean to extubation.
In terms of his cardiovascular issues, after his initial myocardial infarction, the patient continued to have a mild troponin leak.
We attempted to optimize his cardiac status medically, but the patient did require significant vasopressors including Levophed to maintain his blood pressure.
A variety of combinations of pressors were used including dobutamine to augment the patient's cardiac output.
The patient's initial problem of his colonic perforation was managed appropriately with his colectomy and transverse colostomy.
A VAC dressing was subsequently applied to facilitate with wound closure.
Hematologically, the patient did have an anemia secondary to a combination of blood loss, malnutrition and volume.
He required multiple transfusions for this.
He suffered from a series of pneumonias which included [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
The patient was found to have multiple episodes of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans growing on blood cultures even after his vascular access lines had been changed.
It was felt at this time, given his respiratory failure, his septic state, his adrenal insufficiency, his renal failure and his Candidemia, that the patient should be made a Do Not Resuscitate, but the family wanted to continue all aggressive medical care which the ICU team agreed to.
