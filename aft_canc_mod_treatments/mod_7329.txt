#2, LEFT TUMOR NODULE (including intraoperative smear #2 and frozen section #2):  Await processing.
NOTE: This tumor has several worrisome features, including its prominent nucleoli and nuclear pleomorphism.
Because this tumor had previously been treated with both radiation and embolization, it can no longer be accurately graded by formal WHO criteria.
Status post CyberKnife radiation therapy ([**2122-10-20**]) and embolization ([**2123-4-14**]).
The specimen is represented in D-G.   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo RH female with h/o HTN, glaucoma, and known parasagittal meningioma s/p cyberknife 5 months ago who returned after an MRI showed growth of tumor.
She is not a risk free candidate for surgery given the location of her tumor and its proximity to the superior sagittal sinus.
They understood and decided to go forward with the surgery after some consideration.
She was initially given dexamethasone given the swelling of the tumor, however, this was not continued in the hospital due to concern that it might impair healing and increase her chances of infection with surgery.
She was continued on her home dose of Keppra 125 mg [**Hospital1 **] which she is on for "dizziness" per prior clinic notes.
This is because her BP was on the low side and we preferred to have her on a beta-blocker peri-operatively.
She is taken to operating room for right craniotomy for resection of parasagittal meningioma on [**2123-4-15**] under general anesthesia.
She remained intubated on postoperative day one, she had a episode of seizure on postoperative day, in addition to Keppra, added dilantin, on postop day one Keppra increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] ultimately to 1500 [**Hospital1 **] for adequate seizure coverage.
Patient kept on high dose dexamethasone postoperatively due to vasogenic edema, and kept on 100% FiO2 for postop pneumocephalus for 24 hours .
Postoperative MRI suggests status post resection of parasagittal meningioma with small area of residual enhancement is seen in the left parasagittal region.
Blood products are seen at the surgical site with several venous collaterals secondary to resection of superior sagittal sinus.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] seen her while inpatient, she will be seen again in brain tumor clinic 2 weeks from surgery, will be remain on dexamethasone 4mg a day until then.
Patient developed worsening edema of both hands bilaterally [**4-19**] and her fluid balance was positive 1-2L.Her IVF stopped and started on Lasix for diuresis with improvement of edema and achieved evolumia.
Noted to have decreased urine output overnight and appeared dry, was then restarted on IV fluids with adequate urine output.
Continued on Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Phenytoin 100 TID.
