Diffuse surrounding enhancement and suggestion of wall thickening of the colon is of unclear etiology, but given the lack of preferential FDG uptake on PET findings, this more likely is attributed to a fibrotic process from prior radiation treatment and/or stricturing from superimposed ischemic episodes than a high grade tumor.
However, given the presumed recent onset of these findings, with the remoteness of regional radiation treatment, neoplasm as a cause of this stricture cannot be excluded based on imaging.
