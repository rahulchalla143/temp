Had stay in ICU for management of DKA, was unfortunately found to have metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and was transferred to oncology service for management.
ICU course is as follows, by problem: - DKA: Likely precipitated by insulin noncompliance (does not recall taking insulin prior to admission).
This improved with fluids and insulin drip and he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and oral food.
He was treated wtih steroids and keppra for cerebral edema.
He received 5 fractions of whole-brain radiation for suppression of CNS involvement.
He underwent orthopedic repair of his pathologic fracture on [**2162-10-22**], after which he received 5 fractions to his right femur as well.
Biopsy during this procedure revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He received one dose of radiation to a lesion in his distal right humerus as well.
To treat his CNS metastases, he completed 5 fractions of whole-brain radiation during his stay.
Cerebral edema was controlled with dexamethasone prior to and following WBXRT.
He was discharged on a regimen of dexamethasone 2 mg PO daily.
This procedure was unfortunately halted due to patient's extreme agitation and aggressive behavior during the procedure.
Unfortunately, he did not respond to these measures, and required periodic intravenous haloperidol.
Initially, standing and escalating doses of haloperidol were attempted to correct his agitation.
Haloperidol was exchanged for standing quetiapine at bedtime, which seemed to encourage normal sleep-wake cycle and did not create excessive sedation.
(As patient's mental status started to improve and agitation subsided, this medication was changed from standing to PRN - he infrequently required it by discharge).
He required restraints overnight due to acute agitation.
During this episode, he was actively removing his clothes, intravenous lines, therapeutic devices (ankle contracture-prevention boots and pneuamtic compression devices), and surgical dressings.
He managed to remove these mitts and continued with his agitation as above, necessitating wrist restraints.
These restraints were removed as soon as possible.
Hypercalcemia was corrected via a combination of continuous IV fluids and single doses of calcitonin and pamidronate.
IV fluids were discontinued prior to discharge.
Initial empiric antibiotics included vancomycin and meropenem.
His antibiotic regimen was tailored to ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID.
6) Pain control - Mr. [**Known lastname **] pain control requirement changed throughout his hospitalization.
Upon admission, he required analgesia for control of bony metastasis pain.
He underwent 2 surgical procedures for fracture repair.
He required a combination of oral hydrmorphone, intravenous morphine, transdermal fentanyl, and acetaminophen during his stay.
Upon discharge, his pain was adequately controlled with hydromorphone 2-4 mg PO Q4H:PRN.
7) Hypertension: Systolic BP initially elevated after extubation in the ICU.
Home doses of metoprolol were continued.
He was continued on his home rosuvastatin and metoprolol.
