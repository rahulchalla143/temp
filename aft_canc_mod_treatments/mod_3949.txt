Despite reporting history of chronic right sided pleural effusion, status post radiation therapy for thymic cancer.
Status post resection at [**Hospital6 1129**].
Status post chemotherapy times 18 rounds.
The patient's work-up was not clear; however, she was discharged with Dilantin as part of her medication list.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned above, status post thymus resection in [**2125**] for thymic cancer.
The patient also reports lumbar fusion and surgery in [**2113**].

There is a questionable history of valve replacement in her mother.
The patient's pathology slides from her esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2137-11-22**] was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, invasive.
After an extensive discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding the benefit and risks of surgical intervention, the patient consented to undergo Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] resection with neck anastomosis , given the irradiated mediastinum.
This was a high risk procedure due to the prior operation and radiation and comorbidities, but other options were very limited.
The patient presented to the operating room on [**2137-12-20**] with the following physical examination findings.
The patient was assessed to be volume depleted and was given lactated Ringers solution bolus with elevation in blood pressure to 100 systolic.
The patient was found to have stable vital signs; however, the patient was breathing rapidly with stridor and with difficulty.
The patient was given Etomidate and succylcholine prior to intubation and was successfully intubated using MAC-3 blade.
The patient's respiratory status was followed with frequent physical examination and serial arterial blood gases.
The patient was also cycled with cardiac enzymes, to rule out myocardial events.
The patient remained intubated overnight on postoperative day number zero and on ventilatory support.
The patient was seen by the ENT team for the finding of left vocal cord paralysis seen on intubation the day prior.
However, it wasn't clear whether this was a new finding after the surgery given her prior history of thymic resection.
The patient was treated with aggressive pulmonary toilette and was monitored very carefully.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay ranged from [**2137-12-22**] to [**2138-1-9**] and the Intensive Care Unit course will be summarized by systems as follows:  Neurologic:  The patient's postoperative pain was initially addressed with epidural combination of Bupivacaine and Dilaudid; however, this was turned off with ensuing events in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and the patient's Dilaudid was split off from the epidural and was administered with PCA.
Having achieved good pain control with Dilaudid PCA alone, epidural was discontinued on [**2137-12-23**].
The patient was treated with low dose intravenous Lopressor, given the nature of the surgery and the propensity for development of atrial fibrillation postoperatively.
Prior to her Intensive Care Unit on admission on postoperative day number two, the patient had been reintubated in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and then extubated on postoperative day number one.
She had an episode of respiratory difficultly which had resolved with aggressive chest physical therapy.
At this time, her PC02 was found to be rising and the patient was reintubated for her safety with 7.0 endotracheal tube and was placed on ventilatory support.
The patient did well on SMV support and was put on C-Pap trial which she tolerated well on postoperative day number five, [**12-26**], with arterial blood gases of 7.41/42/145/28/+2.
On C-Pap FI02 was 40% with pressure support of 15 and PEEP of 5.
The patient's pressure support was weaned down further and the patient was gently diuresed with intravenous Lasix drip given her positive volume status through this time on postoperative day number six, [**2137-12-26**].
Throughout that day, the patient was also given a T-piece trial for two hours which she tolerated.
The patient was put on increased oxygen with improvement in saturation; however, because the patient was breathing with much significant amount of work, the patient underwent a direct laryngoscopy which showed the same findings as prior with paramedian position of the left vocal cord and a subglottic edema that was visible.
Also on [**2137-12-27**], postoperative day number seven, the patient was noted to have changed in the quality of her right sided chest tube with suspicion for chylothorax.
Please see the gastrointestinal section for the intervention pursuant to this finding.
On [**2137-12-29**], postoperative day number nine, the patient successfully underwent a tracheostomy at the bedside.
The patient received a #7 Por-Tex trach tube for failure to be weaned off the vent and respiratory distress requiring reintubation three times postoperatively.
On [**2137-12-30**], postoperative day number 10 and 1, the patient's right sided chest tube fell out accidentally; however, there were no respiratory complications resulting from that event and there was no pneumothorax seen on the chest x-ray.
The patient did experience occasional subjective shortness of breath, associated with tachypnea and tachycardia, which resolved with aggressive chest physical therapy and good tracheostomy care.
Gastrointestinal:  On [**2137-12-20**], as part of her Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] procedure, the patient also received J tube placement and postoperatively, tube feeds were started without any problems.
On [**2137-12-27**], on postoperative day number seven as noted above, the patient was noted to have change in her right chest tube output and the patient was diagnosed as having chylothorax.
The patient's tube feeds were changed to Vivonex and the patient was started on Somatostatin.
Despite these interventions, the patient's chylothorax continued with increased right sided chest tube output and thorax surgery consult was called.
Based on the recommendation of the thoracic surgery team, the patient's tube feeds were discontinued and the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition on [**2137-12-30**], postoperative day number ten and one.
The patient continued to be treated with Octreotide (Simvastatin).
As noted above, also on that day, the patient's right sided chest tube accidentally fell out; however, there was no pneumothorax noted and the right sided chylothorax persisted with drainage out of the former chest tube site, in excess of 700 cc per day.
With continuing chylothorax, the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2138-1-3**] by the thoracic surgery team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] for right sided thoracoscopy with evacuation of pleural effusion and talc pleurodesis.
The patient succesfully underwent a right sided VATS with evacuation of pleural effusion and talc pleurodesis and replacement of the right sided chest tube on [**2138-1-3**].
Postoperatively, the patient was continued on her TPN and Octreotide and continued n.p.o.
The patient was also given medium chain triglyceride supplement as part of her TPN.
The right sided chest tube was kept to wall suction and the significant right sided chest tube output was replaced cc per cc with intravenous fluids/TPN.
On transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2138-1-9**], the patient's right sided chest tube continued to be relatively high but no longer was chylous, with a very low lymphocyte count and triglyceride level.
and was receiving TPN without fat supplement with a medium chain triglyceride and the patient did not receive any tube feeds.
Genitourinary:  The patient's urine output was monitored with Foley catheter and given her high right sided chest tube output, the patient's urine output was followed carefully and was replaced, as mentioned above, with intravenous fluids/TPN.
There was an episode of urinary tract infection to be described in detail under the infectious disease section, which was treated appropriately with antibiotics and resolved.
Hematology:  The patient was transfused one unit of PRBC on [**2137-12-24**], postoperative day number four, for decrease in hematocrit to 24.8.
This was attributed mostly to aggressive fluid hydration.
The patient was transfused two units of PRBC on [**2138-1-7**] on postoperative day number 18/9/4, when her hematocrit acutely changed to 21 from 33.
The patient received two units of PRBC with appropriate rise in hematocrit to 34.
Based on these findings, the patient was started on heparin drip and was titrated to a PTT value between 50 to 60 and eventually, the patient stabilized to a heparin drip with a value between 500 to 600 units per hour.
The patient blood culture, also from the same day, showed Staph coagulase negative; however, this was considered a contaminant, given that the catheter tip was negative.
Also, by this time, the urine culture from [**1-1**], came back with E. coli and Enterococcus and the patient was started on intravenous Levaquin and intravenous Vancomycin.
After the patient underwent left sided video thoracoscopy on [**2138-1-3**], the patient continued on Vancomycin and Levaquin.
The patient received a full course treatment of Levaquin for her urinary tract infection and continued on her Vancomycin through her stay in Intensive Care Unit.
Because the patient's right sided chest tube output continued to remain relatively high, despite having undergone talc pleurodesis on [**2138-1-3**], the thoracic surgery team performed a bedside talc pleurodesis on [**2138-1-9**].
The patient's right sided chest tube output was matched cc per cc by intravenous fluids/total parenteral nutrition and the patient was maintained relatively euvolemic with only minimal pedal edema on physical examination.
Soon after her transfer out of the unit, on postoperative day number 20/11/6, [**2138-1-9**], the patient's pleural fluid was reanalyzed and the patient was found to be losing approximately 10 grams of protein in her pleural fluid.
The TPN was adjusted so that the patient will be receiving an additional 10 grams of amino acid in her TPN.
On the floor, the patient continued on her intravenous Vancomycin that she had started on [**2138-1-1**].
The patient's pleural fluid triglyceride was rechecked with level of 17 on transfer out from the Intensive Care Unit, which was significantly decreased from the finding of 627 on [**2137-12-27**].
Based on these findings, the patient was restarted on her tube feeds, which was 2/3 strength Impact with 5 to 10 cc per hour.
The patient continued on these tube feeds.
The patient was started on Fluconazole.
The patient also was started on Levaquin on [**2138-1-12**] for suspicion of aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was continued on her Vancomycin, Levaquin and Fluconazole.
It should be noted that the patient's central venous line was changed on [**2138-1-14**], over a guide wire and the catheter tip was sent for culture; however.
With good oxygen saturations, with 100% on tracheostomy mask at 35% oxygen.
Given the patient's persistent elevated white count, despite being on Vancomycin, Levaquin and Fluconazole, other source of infection were investigated.
The patient would occasionally complain of right sided chest/right upper quadrant pain, which were considered to be pleuritic in origin given her chest tube there which was recently discontinued.
The infectious disease consult was called for rocommendations and their findings were to continue with Vancomycin and to discontinue the Levaquin and Fluconazole.
On the evening of [**2138-1-17**], postoperative day number 29/19/14, the thoracic surgery team came by around 6 p.m. and because the former chest tube site was leaking a good amount of pleural fluid, the area was stitched as per instructions of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
The patient was found to be breathing comfortably with oxygen saturation remaining over 97% on two liters nasal cannula.
The patient was also given a Passe-mural valve for trial, which she tolerated without any problems.
The valve was removed by the nursing staff prior to sleep; tracheostomy mask was replaced on the patient with 35% oxygen, with saturations greater than 97%.
The patient received her usual doses of intravenous Dilaudid with good relief of pain.
ACLS protocol was initiated at 3:40 a.m. and hospital wide code blue was called promptly.
The patient's trach tube was bagged with Ambu-bag and the patient was respirated.
The patient was given an amp of Atropine and an amp of epinephrine with continued ventilation and chest compression.
Right sided chest tube was reinserted at 3:52 a.m.
The patient received additional amp of Atropine and epinephrine and received another dose of Atropine and epinephrine.
