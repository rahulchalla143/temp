CXR [**8-13**] AP-ETT placement FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina.
CXR- [**8-13**] central line FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube.
The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included in the image.
The patient has also received a new right internal jugular vein catheter.
The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the stomach.
CXR [**2135-8-25**] Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.
Right jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo with obesity hypoventilation, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma presenting with somnolence, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, and shock.
He was empirically started on vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Pulmonary emobolism was considered, and although the patient had negative lower extremity ultrasounds, he was empirically started on heparin for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
After his renal failure improved (see below), he was CT scanned which was negative for a PE, and his heparin drip was discontinued.
His blood cultures came back positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus, and his antibiotics were weaned down to cefazolin.
Given multiple failed attempts at extubation, an open surgical tracheostomy was placed.
During the procedure extra-corporeal oxygenation was required.
His trach should NEVER be removed as it is unlikely emergent replacement or intubation would be successful.
Patient continued to require PEEP amounts between 10 and 16 cm of H20 for oxygen saturations between 86 and 92 percent.
*Was started on oral lansoprazole disolving tablet for peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis while on ventilator.
*Again - he can NEVER BE DECANNULATED given that another tracheostomy tube placement, should he need it, would be technically complicated if not impossible and highly morbid.
Given his associated renal failure, IVF boluses were provided, which helped increase his blood pressures.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable after IVF hydration.
A hemodialysis line could not be placed in femoral by MICU/renal teams.
IR placed line, and patient received dialysis, which corrected the creatinine and K+.
For assitance with agitation while intubated, he was additionally placed on quetiapine for several days, which was discontinued prior to [**Doctor First Name **] from the MICU as he appeared less agitated.
Has been receiving topical bacitracin topically, and can continue for the next 2 weeks (can discontinue around [**2135-9-9**]).
Chronic Issues Diabetes: on metformin at home.
Maintained on sliding scale insulin at home.
Restarted metformin at [**Month/Day/Year **].
Was taking aspirin 325 mg daily presumably for coronary artery disease risk.
Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:  At nursing home, patient was receiving 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] furosemide and metolazone 2.5 mg 1 tablet po daily.
Given issues with hypernatremia, his diuresis was held and he was supplmented with free water flushes via his tube feeds.
On [**Hospital1 **], his diuresis with furosemide was resumed, but his metolazone was still held.
Should be kept on low sodium diet with weights checked daily, with more acute diuresis with a 3 lbs weight gain in 24 hours.
Hypertension:  His lisinopril and metoprolol were held during his MICU admission.
Given the low dose medications (lisinopril 2.5 mg and metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]), they were discontinued in house while as his HR remained around 80 beats per minute and his blood pressures were around 130mmHg systolic.
At time of [**Hospital1 **], his metoprolol was resumed for management of chronic heart failure, and his lisinopril was held given complications with [**Last Name (un) **] at time of admission.
Code Status: Confirmed Full Communication: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 103310**] (HCP) - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103299**] cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103311**]  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES *Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:  Patient's diuresis was held while hospitalized due to hypernatremia.
Furosemide was restarted however metolazone was still held  upon [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
*Patient was on theophyline at nursing home prior to admission to the hospital.
His theophyline was DISCONTINUED while at the hospital and was continued to be held at time of dischare to rehab.
His metoprolol was held as well as his lisinopril given his inital hypotension.
Given his complications of acute kidney injury on presentation, his lisinopril was continued to be held at time of [**Hospital **], but his metoprolol was resumed (more so for management of his chronic diastolic heart failure).
Can reevaluate renal function and whether to start lisinopril at rehab.
*Regarding feedings and ventilation, the patient had a tracheostomy tube placed on [**2135-8-24**].
Speech and swallow was consulted who said the patient will need further evaluation first for a Passy-Muir valve, and then further speech and swallow evaluation to deterimine if he can receive PO feedings.
Thus, a dobhoff tube was placed to provide the patient with tube feedings and a route for oral medications while speech and swallow evaluation should be on going at rehabilitation.
*Regarding his tracheostomy tube, the patient had an open tracheostomy procedure.
If his tracheostomy tube should fall out, it is a medical emergency and will need emergent transfer to a facility for replacement of his tracheostomy tube.
As he had an open procedure, if his tracheostomy tube falls out attempts at reinserting his endotracheal tube SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED as there is a risk of cannulation of a false lumen and intubation of a tissue plane rather than his trachea.
Additionally, as noted above - he CANNOT BE DECANNULATED without clearly and unambiguously understanding that repeat tracheostomy (should he need it) would be technically complicated if not impossible, and decannulation would place him at great clinical risk including death.

Your breathing became so difficult that you were placed on a machine ("ventilator") to assit your ventilation.
Unfortunately, you were not able to adequately breath on your own without assistance from the ventilator, and required the placement of a tracheostomy tube.
You will be going to [**Hospital **] Rehab for further physical rehabilitation as well as assitance with your new tracheostomy, including speech and swallow studies.
Take your medications as directed.
