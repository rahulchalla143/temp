The progression of the consolidation has been also demonstrated on the chest radiograph when compared to [**2164-7-8**], thus further followup of the abnormality can be obtained with chest radiographs.
Right lung pulmonary nodules are noted in the previously consolidated area of the lungs, most likely representing residua of prior infection, with similar appearance in the left lower lobe and might be reevaluated in three months for documentation of resolution.

He underwent bone marrow biopsy [**6-27**] which showed new acute leukemia, AML-M2 with cytogenetics carrying translocations at ETO at 8q21 which is considered a to be a good prognostic indicator.
He was treated with 7+3 induction chemotherapy and tolerated chemotherapy well.
Concern for invasive aspergilosis was raised, ID was consulted and he was started on voriconazole (in addition to vancomycin and cefepime).
He had persistently high work of breathing during his second night, and failed treatment with BiPAP necessitating intubation.
As he failed to improve with broad spectrum antibiotics and fungal coverage, and as BAL failed to reveal a microbial pathogen on culture, a lung biopsy was initially pursued, though eventually postponed due to elevated PEEP and for fear of inciting pneumothorax in a tenuous patient.
Flagyl and ciprofloxacin were added for c diff prophylaxis and additive GNR coverage, respectively.
He received a single dose of steroids on [**7-22**] in treatment of questionable BOOP, though this was discontinued in discussion with the BMT team who felt that infection was still most likely.
He was transferred back to BMT on [**7-26**] and his antibiotics were stopped slowly.
He is being covered with posaconazole at the time of discharge, and will continue this medication until end of his consolidation chemotherapy.
Thought to be infectious with most likely source being in the lungs based on clinical presentation, imaging, and bronchoscopy.
See above for management of pneumonia.
He was started on broad spectrum antimicrobials.
C. diff was also suspected given his ileus and rapid rise in WBC; therefore, he was started on IV flagyl and vancomycin enema, although he has been unable to tolerate vancomycin enemea.
BMT service believes taht his leukocytosis and fever could be partly from robust return of his bone marrow s/p 7+3.
He was treated with metoprolol IV and PO and went in and out of sinus rhythm.
He was transferred to the ICU as above in atrial fibrillation, though spontaneously converted soon after transfer in response to IV lopressor.
He was placed on TID PO lopressor though again reverted to a fast atrial flutter at 150bpm during his second ICU night with hypotension to 80s systolic.
He received bolus diltiazem and then diltiazem gtt with levophed support, and he eventually reverted to sinus rhythm.
He began amiodarone loading to prevent further arrhythmia.
He received IV amiodarone until [**2164-7-20**] because of concern for ileus, resumed po as bowel sounds returned, but ultimately stopped on [**7-21**] as he was persistently in sinus rhythm and with increasing alkaline phosphatase, thought [**3-7**] medications.
These pressures had occurred with his tachycardia and nodal blockade, and he was eventually placed on pressors as we struggled to control his HR.
He was diagnosed with cellulitis and treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime for an extended course given neutropenia.
He completed a 24 day course of antibiotics and his cellulitis resolved.
At the time, he had been treated with cefepime for 14 days and drug rash was considered possible.
The rash was not severe and cefepime was continued given ongoing neutropenia.
# Social Issues: The patient was very hesistant towards treatment throughout his stay and required encouragement to start chemotherapy.
He benefited greatly from social work and chaplain support.
- off vancomycin enema as above - on mostly IV formulation for meds at this time - continue bisacodyl pr prn - continue TF, check residual  Medications on Admission: Trazodone Aspirin 81mg Terazosin Alprazolam   Discharge Medications: 1. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Xanax 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime.
You were treated with induction chemotherapy.
We also treated cellulitis with antibiotics and this improved greatly.
You developed neutropenia (low white cell counts) with chemotherapy and had fevers, for which you received antibiotics and had CT scan of your chest.
CT scan of your chest showed pneumonia (infection of lungs) in your right lung, which was treated with antifungal medications.
You also developed irregular, rapid heartbeat which were treated with medications, and your heartbeats are now normal.
You are still being treated with posaconazole for your pneumonia.
You will continue taking this medication through the second round of chemotherapy.
Please see attached list to know what medications you should be taking.
-STARTED Posaconazole suspension 200 mg by mouth every 6 hours for your pneumonia.
-STOPPED terazosin for your benign prostatic hypertrophy, you can restart this medication after discussing it with your primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 88669**] aspirin, please do not start taking this medication before discussing it with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**].
