Prior to this admission, the patient presented with LUE weakness after a visit to her chiropractor, s/p nephrectomy and chemotherapy, and was found to have a pathologic fracture of C7.
She was brought for embolization of tumor and C7 corpectomy (received solumedrol for cord compression), however, after this procedure, her course was c/b post-op inability to move any extremities.
On [**7-12**], she was intubated for respiratory distress with SBP 70s, HR 130s, and she was started on Diltiazem gtt with Neo for SVT with hypotension.
She also underwent a right sided thoracentesis on [**7-14**] with 700cc removed, and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for fevers and empiric tx for VAP.
She was extubated on [**7-15**], but then had a witnessed localized motor seizure and was started on dilantin which was transitioned to keppra.
She was taken by IP for flexible bronch for therepeutic aspiration of secretions and visualization of Y stent, where it was discovered that, after therapeutic aspiration was performed, the left limb of the Y-stent was patent without endobronchial lesions or active bleeding, however, on the right side, there was a tumor ingrowth to the distal end of the stent which was approximately 90% occlusive.
At night has anxiety induced dyspnea where she is placed on NRB and given ativan.

She was readied for the OR and on [**7-8**] went to neuro interventional radiology for pre-op embolization prior to OR.
After the embolization she remained intubated but appeared to have left leg weakness.
Her sedation was lightened on the way to the OR and she was unable to move all 4 extremities.
She was also started on solumedrol protocol for spine injury.
She tolerated the procedure and was kept intubated and transferred to PACU where she remained overnight for close monitoring.
She also underwent MRI of brain which demontrated the following: metastasis in the left frontal lobe and left occipital lobe.
Status post corpectomy of C7 with normal alignment of the vertebral bodies.
Decrease in size of the left paraspinal mass related to surgery and embolization.
Two days later she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for fevers and empiric coverage of VAP.
Family meeting held to decide on another trial of extubation and then trach if needed.
She required frequent bolus' of dilantin and was transition to Keppra for sz control.
Ultimately she did not require reintubation so this became a mute point.
She did express that she did not want hospice and that she would like to pursue agressive therapy and be transferred to rehab.
Her NGT was removed and she was placed on thin liquids and moist ground solids.
During their procedure they noted that the right mainstem bronchus was 50% occluded around the 13th and now is 60-80% occluded with blood clots overlying the protruding mass.
No intervention was performed during the procedure.
They would like to move forward with treatment of bronchial obtruction.
Her lovenox was discontinued in prep for intervention.
At night has anxiety induced dyspnea where she is placed on NRB and given ativan.
