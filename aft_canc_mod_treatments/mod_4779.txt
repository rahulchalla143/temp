New mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertain significance.
If the apppearance may be clinically significant based on laboratory data or clinical presentation, then MRCP could be considered or follow-up CT or ultrasound.
The finding continues to be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broad including eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, drug reaction, and less likely infection.
PATHOLOGY: [**11-17**] Bone marrow biopsy- MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, MOST CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.

# Lymphoma- Patient was initially admitted to the medical floor for expedited evaluation of presumed lymhoproliferative disorder in the setting of CTA which showed bulky lymphadenopathy and aortocaval large conglomerate mass with compression of IVC and right common iliac vein.
He was started on allopurinol and IVF due to concern for TLS.
A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern for worsening lactic acidosis, patient was transferred to the ICU.
Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs. infection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for pneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below).
He received [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were monitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on admission.
He received rasburicase for persistently elevated uric acid and new renal failure (creatinine 1.3 from 1.0) with improvement of his symptoms.
He had some mucositis which was managed with pain medications and mouth care.
He was started on vanco/zosyn/azithro and was continued on these antibiotics for 7 days after he was no longer neutropenic per pulmonary recommendations.
Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia, but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic and appeared well.
Triamcinolone was applied topically to the plaque with gradual improvement.
Fluid retention: Patient received fluids as part of his chemotherapy regimen.
He was restarted on lasix and sent home to continue diuresis with f/u in the outpatient clinic.
His pain was managed with lidocaine patches and oxycodone/oxycontin.
Patient was continued on finasteride and tamsulosin as his home BPH medications were not on formulary.
