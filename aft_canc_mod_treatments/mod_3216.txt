He had generalized tonic-clonic seizures shortly thereafter and was started on anticonvulsants.
He was treated initially with Antineoplaston in [**Country 149**] and finally had stereotactic brain biopsy in [**2167-8-24**].
He came to [**Location (un) 86**] to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in [**2167-9-23**], and temozolomide chemotherapy was started in [**2167-10-24**].
He appears to have been on chronic steroids since [**2167-2-21**] when starting the temozolomide.
He had a seizure and Dilantin was added, and therefore he was discharged on Keppra, Dilantin, and Depakote.
For this, he was switched from Dilantin to Topamax.
The plan at that visit was to eventually treat him again with adjuvant temozolomide.
He was observed on long-term monitoring, during which he did have some subclinical brief electrographic seizures.
He was finally tapered off Dilantin and sent home on increased Keppra, Topamax, and Dilantin.

Although he was on Neurontin and Keppra, as    well as Depakote, he was having at least two to three    clinical seizures a day on the neurology [**Hospital1 **], which    mainly consisted of right gaze deviation with some    twitching of the right side of the face.
Because it was felt that the patient was extremely encephalopathic and that the goal of the admission was to try to improve his encephalopathy, an attempt at aggressive seizure control was made and the patient was sent to the Neuro ICU for intubation and loading with I.V.
Meanwhile, he stayed on the same doses of Keppra and Neurontin.
At this point, he is on Keppra 1250 mg p.o.
For example, with the upcoming placement of a gastrostomy tube, he was able to ask how long the procedure would take, and what type of anesthetic they would use.
However, on    [**2168-5-11**], the patient had a percutaneous endoscopically    placed gastrostomy tube done by the gastroenterology    service.
Instructions will be to restart tube feeds if    necessary on the day after the gastrostomy tube placement.
It was felt that the    patient could enjoy an oral diet, but that the gastrostomy    tube would be there for backup nutrition needs, as well as    a reliable means of administering critical medications    such an anticonvulsants.
His stool    was checked for C-diff again on [**2168-5-4**] and this was    negative.
