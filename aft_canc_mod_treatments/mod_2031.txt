REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: infection, pulmonary edema INDICATION: CLL status post bone marrow transplantation with neutropenia.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the chest without and with intravenous contrast.
A dilated esophagus with distal mural thickening is filled with debris.
Multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacity suggest pneumonia.
Reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, red   blood cells and macrophages.
Tip of right PIC catheter projects over the SVC.
Treated with foscarnet and monitored daily for hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and renal function.
Fungal coverage then changed to ambisome and patient was treated for 5 days and changed back to voriconazole.
Continued to improve and went from requiring frequent IV dilaudid to no pain medications to no oral pain whatsoever.
Eventually the latter area eroded through his chin and formed on orocutaneous fistula.
ENT was consulted and did not recommend any change in management, and advised the patient to keep the area open and draining (no bandage as this would become saturated and a breeding ground for infection).
A sample of tissue was sent to pathology and microbiology and showed oropharyngeal flora, small amount of yeast, and small amount of fungal spores.
Continued on TPN during the majority of his admission for nutritional support, but this was stopped prior to discharge.
Treated with zosyn for broad coverage.
BAL showed enterobacter, sensitive to zosyn, and he was continued on this antibiotic.
Also had apergillosis fumigata, and he was continued on voriconazole at an increased dose of 300 mg PO BID, decreased to 200 mg by discharge.
Will be continued on voriconazole as outpt.
Zosyn stopped and patient changed changed to neutropenia prophylaxis with augmentin and cipro, the former discontinued prior to discharge d/t diarrhea.
#) CLL: Patient with borderline neutrophil count and pancytopenia, which remained stable throughout hospital course.
Continued prednisone for mild GVHD.
Patient had CHF exacerbation (d/t TPN and IV foscarnet and abx) with hypoxia, increased RR, tachycardia, which required ICU care.
By discharge the patient was on Toprol XL 50 mg PO QD and 37.5 mg PO TID of captopril, as well as 40 mg PO lasix QD, and maintained a relatively even fluid balance.
