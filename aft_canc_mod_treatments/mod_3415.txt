Right-sided frontal craniotomy for resection.
Transbronchial and endobronchial biopsy   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer treated with surgical resection and radiation in [**2120**], bladder diverticuli with resection, benign parotid tumor resected in [**2115**] who presents with two weeks of altered cognition.
Loaded with dilantin, decadron started.
In ER here, seen by neurosurgery who recommended dilantin, decadron, CT torso and bone scan for staging.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Prostate cancer in [**2120**] treated with resection and radiation Benign parotid tumor resected in [**2115**] Bladder diverticula requiring resection Aspirin allergy, nasal polyps--?Samter's triad.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "right lower lobe medial basal transbronchial biopsy" and consists of multiple fragments of tan-brown tissue aggregating 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, entirely submitted in cassette A.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "endo biopsy" and consists of multiple fragments of tan-brown soft tissue aggregating 0.2 x less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm, entirely submitted in cassette B. .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-6**] 8:07 PM Post right frontal mass resection and frontal craniotomy, with postoperative changes and small amount of hemorrhage, persistent vasogenic edema and shift of normally midline structures.
[**5-6**] brain biopsy: #1, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear): METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, consistent with metastasis from lung primary.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes as described.
On admission, with the help of input from neuro-oncology the patient was started on Decadron TID, dilantin and subsequent addition of Keppra.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neuro [**Doctor First Name **] performed craniotomy on Wednesday [**5-6**], without major complications.
Pt had been having short episodes of confusion lasting minutes with resolution, likely related to small seizures, pt started on kepra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] day two of admission.
He was kept on Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx.
The patient began to improve and have less confusion and weakness, and did well with the continuation of keppra for seizure prophylaxis and steroids for decreasing edema.
The brain biopsy pathology revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, presumptively from the lung (+adenoCa on bronchial washings as well), and he has follow-up with neuro-oncology and will at that time decide on a definitive treatment plan.
He was discharged on keppra and dexamethasone and he will have his staples removed at his neuro-oncology follow-up appointment.
At discharge his mental status was improved and he will have close follow-up at home with physical therapy and occupational therapy.
He was initially started on clindamycin and ceftazadime for pneumonia, but prior to discharge was transitioned to cefpodoxime and flagyl.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurosurgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] from oncology advised starting heparin without a bolus and having a low PTT goal.
Prior to discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] said the patient could be safely discharged on lovenox as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin with a goal inr 2-2.5.
The patient will have close follow-up by his primary care physician and local coumadin clinic.
The patient has a history of afib controlled prior to admission with digoxin and verapamil.
During his course he developed a rapid ventricular rate, he responded to IV metoprolol x 3.
He should continue digoxin and metoprolol as an outpatient and be closely followed for this condition.
Decisions regarding long term anticoagulation for PAF should be addressed after treatment of DVT is complete based on risk/benefit ratio at that point, as well as chronicity of Afib.
The patient was on HCTZ and verapamil as outpatient, but as stated prior verapamil was replaced with metoprolol perioperatively.
His beta-blocker was uptitrated for heart rate and blood pressure control and he was well controlled with the beta-blocker and HCTZ.
Thus his current hyperglycemia likely reflects the effect of steroids on top of his baseline insulin resistance.
Given the patient was to continue steroids as an outpatient he was instructed on how to test and administer insulin at home, and will have VNA help.
He will need close outpatient follow-up for this and may not need insulin once his steroids are stopped.
This should be followed in [**4-21**] months with repeat imaging.
