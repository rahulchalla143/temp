Admission Date:  [**2112-4-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-10-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / OxyContin  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis [**2112-4-3**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] is a 71 year old  transferred from OSH w/pericardial effusion found on CT which was associated with early tamponade physiology and pleural effusions.
Diagnosis: pericardial effusion  ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults): Upon arrival in the ED from [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, initially pt was tachy to 150, RR 23, BP 132/56, 97% on 4L NC (92% on 2L on admission) with a pulsus of 20mmHg.
Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery were consulted.
Cardiac surgery recommended window in the morning.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
PSH: Tonsillectomy at age 14 and a cholecystectomy at age 25, rotator cuff surgery at 64 and knee surgery at age 55. .
[**6-/2108**]:  Underwent bilateral mastectomy for what appeared to be multifocal disease in both breasts and had negative sentinel lymph node biopsy.
PERICARDIAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2112-4-4**]    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma (see note).
Note: The current specimen shows similar findings to the   prior pericardial fluid specimen (C12-5973S, [**2112-4-3**]), which   was reviewed for comparison.
Placement of a right Pleurx catheter with interval decrease in size of a large right pleural effusion.
No pericardial effusion after surgical drainage.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL SUMMARY: 71 year old female PMHx Breast cancer s/p bilateral mastectomy who presented w SOB, found to have pericardial effusion with tamponade, s/p pericardial window, also with L pleural effusion s/p pleurex placement, both cytology samples returning positive for adenocarcinoma, course complicated by hypoxia thought to be secondary to cancer lymphangitic pulmonary burden, now s/p initiation of taxol.
# Pericardial effusion: On admission, found to have effusion with tamponade physiology; s/p drainage of pericardial effusion on [**2112-4-3**] complicated by RV puncture and transient need for levophed (~3 minutes).
Initiated on amiodarone and metoprolol, converted to normal sinus rhythm with occasional episodes of A fib.
Pt has been well controlled on this regimen, although difficult to tolerate due to pressures, so metoprolol dose was decreased to 6.25mg.
Patient underwent daily drainage of pleurex (about 500cc daily) until [**2112-4-20**].
# RUE DVT: In setting of RUE edema, RUE ultrasound demonstrated nonocclusive clot around R PICC line; after discussion w primary oncologist, patient was started on therapeutic lovenox (planned duration = lifelong given ongoing onc issues)  # Hypoxia: Patient with hypoxia throughout stay, initially requiring 6LNC and face mask, thought to be multifactorial in setting of pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and lymphangitic spread of tumor to lungs.
Of note, patient was never officially ruled out for pulmonary embolism (had CT chest w contrast that was not protocoled for PE), but as this would not change management (already on therapeutic lovenox as above) CT PE was not obtained.
She had increased O2 requirement to 6LNC on [**2112-4-21**] which may have been from small PTX after L pleruex placement or increased R infiltrate which was possibly pneumonia, fluid or lymphangitic spread.
She was then placed on fluid restriction due to concern for SIADH with normalization of her sodium.
She should continue on a 1200ml fluid restricted diet.
# UTI: Ucx [**4-11**] grew pan-sensitive E. coli for which the patient was treated w IV ceftriaxone (d1= [**4-11**]) treated for 7-day course.
# Breast Cancer s/p b/l mastectomy (Her 2 negative, ER/PR positive) - She was continued on anastrozole, and as discussed above, started taxol chemotherapy while inpatient.

These were drained, with a procedure "window" to continue to empty the pericardial effusion done.
The fluid in these was found to be malignant and consistent with metastatic breast cancer, so you were started on chemotherapy to control this, which is called Taxol and you will receive this weekly on 3 weeks and then have one week off.
While you were in the hospital you also developed an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) and have been started on medications for this, as well as a DVT (clot) in your upper extremity) for which you were started on a blood thinner and a UTI that was treated for 7 days with antibiotics.
