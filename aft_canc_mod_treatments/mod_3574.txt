This will be comprehensive from the date of thoracic surgery involving the patient's care.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with hemoptysis after bronchoscopy.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management and for a tentative diagnosis.
Appendectomy 50 years ago.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  The patient takes Norvasc and Fosamax.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, the patient's temperature was 97 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 99, her blood pressure was 156/58, her respiratory rate was 22, and she was saturating 90% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at the outside hospital showed a white blood cell count of 10.3, her hematocrit was 28, and her platelet count was 543.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 74-year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with hemoptysis after bronchoscopy and biopsy for an occluding lesion of the left secondary main stem at the level of the secondary carina.
The patient is here for further diagnosis, workup, and management.
She required oxygen 5 liters by nonrebreather.
The patient was prepared for bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and video-assisted thoracic surgery by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].
The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy, rigid bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsy, and argon beam coagulation.
On hospital day three, postoperative day one, after mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy, the patient complained of a sore throat.
She was saturating 100% on a nonrebreather.
The plan for the patient was to wean off oxygen for a positron emission tomography scan.
The patient was scheduled for a possible positron emission tomography scan on an outpatient basis.
The patient was continued on aggressive chest physical therapy.
Nebulizer treatments and incentive spirometry were attempted.
On [**2182-3-25**], the patient went to the operating room again for a rigid bronchoscopy.
The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was hypoxic during surgery and required a high positive end-expiratory pressure.
The patient was also placed on a Neo-Synephrine drip for low blood pressures.
The patient was also given normal saline boluses when her blood pressure would drop.
On [**2182-3-26**], the patient was postoperative day seven from mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy and postoperative day one from second bronchoscopy.
The patient had experienced hypotension and hypoxia after bronchoscopy and intubated.
The patient was also given 2 units of packed red blood cells and a central line was placed.
The patient was given fluid boluses.
The Neo-Synephrine was weaned off for blood pressure support.
On postoperative days eight and two, the patient failed to wean from the ventilator; however, the patient was off the Neo-Synephrine drip.
Radiology/Oncology was consulted for possible radiation therapy while an inpatient.
Oncology felt there was little or no role for chemotherapy and felt that if anything she would be more of a candidate for radiation therapy.
The patient was transferred then from the Thoracic Surgery Service to the Medicine Service for further treatment of her left main stem bronchus mass.
The plan was for radiation treatment to decrease tumor burden.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported back to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Room.
On postoperative day one from left pneumonectomy, omental flap, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement the patient was stable postoperatively.
She was on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.8 and receiving beta blockade.
The patient was also on an insulin drip.
The patient was continued intubated and sedated.
On postoperative day one, the plan was to remove the left chest tube, wean the ventilator, and start her tube feeds.
Tube feeds were resumed with a goal of Impact with fiber at 60 cc per day.
The patient was on an insulin drip.
Once tube feeds were at goal, consider starting NPH.
On postoperative day two, the patient was still on a Neo-Synephrine drip for labile blood pressures.
The patient was started on tube feeds at 50 cc per hour.
Tube feeds were advanced toward goal, and the Neo-Synephrine was weaned on postoperative day three.
The patient was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip.
The patient was started on Haldol for agitation.
The patient was intubated again and started on a propofol drip.
The patient tolerated this well; however, she was kept intubated.
The patient was still on a Neo-Synephrine drip for labile blood pressures.
On postoperative day seven from pneumonectomy, the patient continued to do well extubated with oxygen saturations of 95% or better on 2 liters by nasal cannula or 50% shovel mask.
Lasix was given, and tube feeds were continued at 40 cc an hour.
The patient was continued with aggressive chest physical therapy.
The patient was working with Physical Therapy and was continued on tube feeds at that time.
The patient's Lopressor was increased to 100 mg twice per day.
On postoperative day ten, the patient required a Foley placement for an inability to void.
The patient was saturating 94% on 4 liters by nasal cannula.
The chest tube was removed on postoperative day ten.
The patient's Lopressor was increased again to 100 mg twice per day.
The patient was continued on her tube feeds.
The patient had some coarse lung sounds, but tolerated the removal of chest tube.
The patient had been discontinued from meropenem and was placed on ciprofloxacin.
The patient was day three of ciprofloxacin on postoperative day twelve.
The patient was tolerating the rest of her medications well.
