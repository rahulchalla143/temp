Dilaudid for cp.
She recently finished a 5 day course of Clofarabine (1st cycle) on [**2142-12-3**].
At that time she presented with SOB and CP and was intubated at [**Hospital3 **].
She required multiple thoracenteses for symptomatic control and eventually underwent induction chemotherapy (7+3), requiring a D+C as the patient was pregnant at the time, with complete remission and consolidation therapy with HIDAC.
Patient again underwent induction with 7+3, resulting in complete remission.
However, in [**2-/2142**] bone marrow bx demonstrated recurrent AML.
She underwent reinduction therapy with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine(MEC).
Hospitalizations have been complicated by admissions for neutropenic fever, VRE bacteremia, and C. difficile infection.
She finally underwent MRD-allo-SCT on [**2142-6-29**] for recurrent disease.
Patient did well until [**8-31**], when she presented with fevers and was treated for a S. Viridans and Bacillus cereus bacteremia.
During that admission, patient seroconverted with a positive CMV  viral load of 747 copies/ml.
Given these results, the patient was started on Valganciclovir.
For her relapse, she completed a 5 day course of Clofarabine (1st cycle) on [**2142-12-3**].
Currently maintained on hydrea 500mg [**Hospital1 **] and prednisone 40mg daily.

4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
The SOB however improved on steroids and may have been related to a post platelet tranfusion reation.
The Left pleural effusion was also not drained because the risk of a pneumothorax.
Patient was stabilized on 4-6L NC with O2 sats of 100%.
She received a total of 3 units of platelets in anticipation of a thoracentesis.
She then underwent reinduction with MEC followed by an allo-MRD [**Hospital Ward Name 3242**].
She was continued on prophylaxis with Bactrim, levofloxacin, acyclovir and voriconazole.
Her prednisone and allopurinol were also continued.
The MICU team felt that this might be due to low CO, therefore they held nodal blockers as she may have had compromised SV and need for adequate HR for optimal CO.
Hypertension: Metoprolol and lisinopril were held initially [**2-28**] hypotension, but that is resolved, so these were continued.
