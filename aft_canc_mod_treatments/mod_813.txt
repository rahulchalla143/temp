Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] was admitted to Thoracic Surgery on [**2158-10-16**] for an intrapleural, intrapericardial pneumonectomy with serratus muscle flap bronchoscopy and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
His course in the MICU was significant for afib/flutter which was controlled with verapamil and quinidine.
On POD#4, patient was seen by EPS for an occurrence of A-flutter; was refractory to metoprolol and was then treated with digoxin and diltiazem which converted patient's rhythm to sinus.
The digoxin and diltiazem was then subsequently discontinued with no need to start any antiarrhythmics at that time.
However, on POD#7, patient was noted to have A-fib and was started on quinidine 324mg (1.5 tabs PO Q8hrs), a heparin drip and coumadin for anticoagulation.
The patient was then moved to the ICU, a cardiac echo was done, a general surgery consult was obtained and the patient was made NPO and had a nasogastric tube and arterial line placed.
On [**2158-10-25**] patient underwent the exploratory laparotomy but was found to have no gross evidence of perforation.
On [**2158-10-26**] was restarted on a heparin drip, amiodarone and also extubated.
On [**2158-10-28**], patient was assessed for nutritional requirements and found to need TPN which was started that day.
On [**2158-10-30**] a post-pyloric Dobhoff feeding tube was placed by Int.
Radiology for concerns of aspiration while attending to the patient's nutritional requirements; TPN was discontinued on [**2158-10-31**] and patient was moved to the floor.
His pulmonary exam improved and begin to clear secretions much better throughout the remainder of his hospital course.
The feeding tube was then discontinued and patient's diet was advanced to ground solids with boost supplementation.
This was discussed with EPS who recommended that the patient be switched to amiodarone 400mg PO QD and be seen at his Rehab facility this week by Cardiology for possible AICD interrogation and further management.
His INR was therapeutic and he was placed on 4mg of coumadin PO QHS; the INR is to be checked twice a week on Thursdays and Mondays and the coumadin dosage adjusted accordingly.
Furtermore, he is to be discharged with a 7 day course of levofloxacin 500mg PO QD.
