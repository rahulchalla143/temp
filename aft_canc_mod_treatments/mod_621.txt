Status post sternotomy, status post valvular replacement.
Status post right mastectomy.
Bronchial cells and inflammatory cells.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 y.o woman with PMH of IPF,COPD,anemia, mechanical mitral valve,and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea, acute renal failure, and fluid overload.
Gastroenterology believed that it would be possible to perform a transluminal resection but that the procedure would have high risk of perforation and death.
She was started on nadolol for esophageal varaces.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Obtain 2x weekly HCTs and transfuse for HCT <21 -- Continue Fe supplementation and epo administration .
She was given IV Torsemide for diuresis with her packed red cell transfusions, and her home Bumex was held in-house.
Her home prednisone and nebulizers were continued in-house.
These were inconsistent, and associated with epistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloody post-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that she was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.
She was found to have evidence of a RUL HAP, so she was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime.
She underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative and her antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-23**].
After two days on the medical floor, she pulled out a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds, aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia and acidemia.
Due to increasing wbc and decreased stool output there was also concern for c.diff, which ultimately was positive, and the pt was started on flagyl/PO vanc.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**10-30**] with plan to complete a total of 8d of meropenem.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Continue meropenem thru [**11-3**].
-- Ongoing discussion regarding replacement of transtracheal catheter.
She was empirically started on IV flagyl and PO vanco which were continued when stool culture was positive for c.diff.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Plan to complete PO vancomycin 125mg PO Q6hrs as well as Flagyl 500mg Q8hrs; end date [**11-9**].
She received 5mg PO Vit K, and her INR down-trended to the sub-therapeutic range and she was started on a Heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve.
She was kept on a heparin drip for bridging on the medicine floor.
When the decision was made to pursue endomucosal resection of her adenoma, her warfarin was discontinued, however given this was put on hold, the pt was restarted on coumadin [**10-29**].
At time of discharge patient remained on hep gtt as well as coumadin 3mg daily; INR on day of discharge 1.9 OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- COntinue hep gtt and coumadin until INR therapeutic (2.5 - 3.5).
Peak   Cr 2.8 from a baseline of ~1.4, likely secondary to hypovolemia as well as renal hypoperfusion [**2-27**] anemia.
Initially Bumex was held and she was given IV hydration.
Creatinine increased from 1.8-2.7 in the setting of diuresis (as above) and bumex was held.
During hospital stay patient was intermittently diuresised and prior to discharge restarted on PO Bumex 5mg daily with creatinine of 1.7.
Patient placed on nadolol 10mg daily.
Decision made to hold home amlodipine 5mg daily as well as spironolactone 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge.
Patient with transtracheal O2 catheter as well as use of chronic steriods as an outpatient.
During 1st intubation transtracheal cath was removed.
In house patient received stress dose steriods which were weanted to home prednisone 10mg daily at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Continue chronic prednisone; consider need for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] Continue discussion re replacement of transtracheal cath .
Received free water boluses thru NGT as well as IV D5 with improvement.
The family wanted the patient to remain full code and to have aggressive management of her pulmonary disease.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== Health Care Associated Pneumonia treatment -- Continue on meropenem for planned 8d course, end date [**11-3**] .
C. Difficile infection -- Continue on flagyl and PO vanc for planned 10d course; end date: [**11-9**] .
Congestive Heart Failure -- Continue PO Bumex 5mg daily; monitor weights as well as renal function with weekly chem 10 panel .
Mitral Valve Replacement; goal INR 2.5 - 3.5 -- Continue hep gtt until bridged with coumadin, 3mg daily, to a therapeutic INR .
Arrythmia -- Restarting home dofetilide on discharge; primary cardiologist aware.
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: [**Month (only) 116**] consider starting PCP prophylaxis given chronic steroid use.
Patient has been on it in the past, but when she was on higher doses of PO steroids (~20 mg) chronically.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: GI bleed secondary to colonic lesion Health care associated pneumonia Acute on chronic kidney insufficiency COPD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Regarding the GI bleed, you were seen by our team of GI doctors who performed a colonscopy.
During the procedure a colonic lesion was seen and a plan was devised to proceed for excisional biopsy.
While in house your breathing became labored on several occassions which required intubation twice.
You were started on antibiotics with a plan to complete an 8d course.
Your transtracheal catheter was removed with plan to discuss replacement as an outpatient.
At time of discharge you were oxygenating well using supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS: START 10mg Nadolol daily for gastric varices CONTINUE MEROPENEM until [**2137-11-3**] CONTINUE VANCOMYCIN AND FLAGYL until [**2137-11-9**] STOP SPIRONOLACTONE and AMLODIPINE until told otherwise CHANGE COUMADIN to 3mg daily (goal INR 2.5 to 3.5) CHANGE BUMEX to 5mg daily (previously 5mg twice a day)  Again it was a pleasure taking care of you.
