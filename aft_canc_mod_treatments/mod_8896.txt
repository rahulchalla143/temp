Interval development of extensive hepatic venous thrombosis, intrahepatic venous collaterals, and ascites, compatible with Budd-Chiari.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 yo F with h/o essential thrombocythemia c/b bilateral LE DVTs, infrahepatic IVC clot, and L renal vein clot on coumadin presented with increasing LE edema and abdominal girth with MRI/MRA abdomen with findings suggestive of Budd Chiari now s/p IR visualization of portal venous system demonstrating extensive hepatic venous thrombi, with collateralization and drainage of the vessels via an accessory vein into the IVC switched to Lovenox for anticoagulation.
IR visualized extensive hepatic venous clots, with collateralization and drainage of the vessels via an accessory vein into the IVC.
Because of this, she could not be given local lysis with TPA.
She was transitioned to Lovenox from Heparin on the day of discharge with education as to how to administer self-injections.
She was discharged on [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox (100mg) for long-term anticoagulation and scheduled for follow up with heme-onc in 3 days.
As to our assessment she will need platelet suppression to prevent occlusion of the single draining collateral hepatic vein which could result in a disastrous acute on chronic Budd Chiari syndrome.
