...   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neurointensive care unit for close neuro-monitoring following an infusion of TPA for a left MCA stroke.
She is a [**Age over 90 **]yo W with a history of atrial fibrillation s/p AICD placement, CAD s/p CABG, presumed Alzheimer's dementia, old right occipital ischemic stroke and HTN who presented as a code stroke.
She was found about 30 minutes before EMS arrival with speech disturbance and left gaze deviation.
She was seen by the ED Neurology resident and received a CTA head/neck as well as CTP, the results of which are summarized below.
This was treated with local lidocaine/epinephrine injections and tight dressings.
She was admitted with standard post TPA protocol orders pertaining to q1hr neuro checks, blood pressure management, HOB angle and instructions for a stat head CT in the setting that her examination worsened.
She did not require additional labetalol for blood pressure control, and did require some continuous IV fluids.
She was started on ciprofloxacin for a dirty UA that was noted on admission, urine cultures showed fecal contamination.
Given the presence of diffuse soft plaque in bilateral carotid arteries (left>right), she was ordered for a heparin drip.
Bilateral soft wrist restraints were placed and in the absence of IV access, the patient received lovenox for anticoagulation.
Routine blood cultures revealed the presence of gram positive organisms (1/4 bottles, aerobic) and therefore, the patient was started on IV vancomycin.
The vancomycin was stopped on [**1-13**] as only 1 of 4 bottles grew bacteria, which was thought to be a contaminant.
A family meeting was held, and it was decided there would be no intervention on the foot, and that she would be switched from lovenox to Aspirin 325 mg, to reduce her bleeding from her foot.
Simvastatin 40mg po daily was also started for its anti-inflammatory properties and secondary stroke risk reduction.
