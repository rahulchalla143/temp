Per outside hospital report, he received 5mg ov valium and the seizure stopped.
En route, he received IV dilantin, but since the solution crystallized, he only got 500mg instead of the 1 gram.
-GERD -Hyperlipidemia -Recurrent hemarthrosis in his knees -question of ankylosing spondilitis -question of extra-pulmonary TB (stated on earlier visits that he had TB of the ankles as a child)   Social History:  Retired civil engineer.
Unable to test individual muscle groups, patient very agitated and had to place back on propfol as ED not comfortable extubating him.

MRI/MRA brain & neck [**9-10**]: FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:  There are areas of acute hemorrhage seen in the left temporal and occipital region.
Post-gadolinium images also demonstrate increased vascular structures in the suboccipital region on the left, best visualized on series 25, image 40.
Subtle fleeting filling defects in the left transverse sinus could be secondary to arachnoid granulations and are not likely due to thrombosis and as visualized on the MP-RAGE post-gadolinium images.
Anterior right ethmoid air cells are opacified.
The external carotid vasculature is suboptimally assessed.
DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite after the procedure was explained to the patient's wife and written informed consent was obtained.
IV sedation was given, and the patient was put under general anesthesia.
Through this catheter, two exchange-length control wires were placed, and a 7 French 90-cm shuttle sheath was placed into the distal common carotid artery.
Through this, using a combination of multiple catheters and multiple wires, the left external carotid artery was accessed using a 5 French Cobra 1 catheter and over a Glidewire.
This was then exchanged over an exchange-length Glidewire for a 057 DAC.
Super-selective access was then obtained of distal middle meningeal branches with a Synchro-2 wire and SL-10 microcatheter which were passed across the point of fistula into a venous pouch adjacent to the left transverse sinus.
Control angiogram through the DAC demonstrated multiple other feeders to the AV fistula, and thus the catheter was exchanged for a rapid transit and further embolization was undertaken within two distal middle meningeal branches with Onyx 18 with good penetration into the nidus.
Attention was then turned to the left occipital arterial supply, and a rapid transit catheter and gold-tip Glidewire advanced into a dominant supplying artery, and embolization was undertaken with Onyx.
Access was gained to the left common femoral vein with a 6 French sheath, and under careful guidance, access was gained to the left internal jugular vein using a VERT catheter and angled Glidewire.
An Echelon catheter and X-Pedion wire were then used to cross a stenotic portion of the transverse sigmoid sinus junction and into the left transverse sinus.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications and was sent to the ICU in stable condition.
The external carotid arterial system is hypertrophied, with especially prominent middle meningeal and occipital branches feeding a large dural AV fistula in the region of the left transverse sinus, with early anterograde drainage seen into the left transverse sinus and jugular vein, as well as retrograde drainage into two large cortical veins which eventually empty into the mid superior sagittal sinus.
LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY ARTRIOGRAM FOLLOWING EMBOLIZATION: Following embolization, stagnant flow is seen within the occipital and middle meningeal arteries.
IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname 12584**] [**Known lastname **] underwent cerebral angiography and embolization of a complex ([**Doctor Last Name 12585**] III) dural AV fistula with embolization of arterial supply from left middle meningeal, left occipital, and left vertebral arteries, as well as venous embolization of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses.
