The patient remained stable on lovenox prior to discharge.
Further discussion about anticoagulation, prognosis, and treatment was attempted in house, however Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] was unwilling to discuss his wishes.
Code status and further anticoagulation vs palliative measures will have to be further addressed as an outpatient with his primary oncologist and PCP.
10 days of lovenox was given (the maximum attentable free of charge) to allow Mr [**Known lastname 79303**] to be supplied until follow up.
However Coumadin may have to be considered if anticoagulation will continue.
