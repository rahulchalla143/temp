He received 2 units of blood during the procedure and was extubated on [**2115-11-15**].
His immediate post-operative period was complicated by several episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT which converted on various occasions with beta-blockade; he never required electrical cardioversion.
He was started back on Coumadin post-operatively for his atrial fibrillation and mechanical mitral valve.
He also underwent ultra-sound guided aspiration of 1500 cc of fluid from his left chest on post-operative day 5 which resulted in much improvement in his respiratory status.

His chest tubes were removed on post-operative day 7.
He had an esophogram study done on post-operative day 9 which revealed no leak from his anastamosis and his cervical JP drain was removed.
A video swallow study revealed paralysis of the left pharynx resulting in aspiration and the patient was kept NPO with tube feeds.
