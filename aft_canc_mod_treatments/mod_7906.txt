Regarding the hematuria, the patient reported painless hematuria with urine that was essentially dark red and never grossly bloody times one week.
He had started receiving weekly packed red blood cell transfusions seven weeks prior to admission and had started weekly Epogen injections three weeks prior to admission.
In the Emergency Department, the patient received one dose of gentamicin and oxacillin.
He was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma.
He was also given potassium chloride.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications included Epogen 20,000 units every Tuesday, colchicine as needed, multivitamin with iron, and Tylenol as needed.
He had a similar-appearing 5-cm to 6-cm pink plaque under his left axilla which; both of which were extremely tenderness to palpation.
He was initially treated with dicloxacillin for his skin lesions and started on intravenous ciprofloxacin for question pyelonephritis given the infectious-appearing urinalysis.
His coagulopathy was treated with transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  On [**7-30**], the patient was seen by his outpatient hematologist who questioned whether the patient's skin lesions and hematuria could be secondary to septic emboli.
His antibiotics were also changed from dicloxacillin to oxacillin.
On [**7-31**], the patient's coagulations were all evaluated despite vitamin K, and there was noted to be minimal correction of the anemia and thrombocytopenia despite transfusions.
The left axillary lesion was biopsied and sent for bacterial, and fungal, and atypical mycobacterial cultures.
The Dermatology consultation agreed with intravenous antibiotics.
On [**8-1**], the patient was felt to be functionally neutropenic; and given the question of Pseudomonas infection, he was started on intravenous ceftazidime.
He was also continued on intravenous oxacillin.
They also considered sporotrichum infections, mycobacterial infections, tick-borne diseases.
At that point, it was decided to treat the patient for 10 days with intravenous oxacillin.
A monoclonal intact immunoglobulin G lambda and monoclonal free lambda ([**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]).
The Hematology Service recommended starting the patient on Decadron but holding off on melphalan.
They said that overall, the association between myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple myeloma is not known, but they felt that people with malignancy and myeloma could develop severe disseminated intravascular coagulation which was consistent with the patient's clinical picture.
Previously, he had only required transfusions prior to procedure.
At this point, he required transfusions to stop bleeding from his intravenous sites and from his biopsy sites.
Also, the issues of access were raised given that the patient had only one peripheral intravenous line and was in need of multiple blood products.
At that point, a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed in Interventional Radiology.
On [**8-9**], the patient had a repeat bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Subsequently, from [**8-9**] to [**8-15**], the patient continued to require aggressive blood product support through his disseminated intravascular coagulation with daily transfusions of platelets, packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation laboratories were checked twice a day, and factors and cells were replaced liberally as the patient continued to ooze through his peripherally inserted central catheter site and biopsy sites.
The patient was boluses with fluids and received blood products with a return of his blood pressure to the 140s.
On [**8-16**], the patient was started on medications for toxoplasmosis consisting of sulfadiazine, Pyrimethamine, and folinic acid.
He was also started on G-CSF given his profound neutropenia and the possibility of a granulocytosis with a sulfa regimen.
However, on [**8-16**], the patient was started on vancomycin for an enterococcus urinary tract infection.
The patient was maintained on his toxoplasmosis medications as well as vancomycin.
He was also on Flagyl at this point for stools positive for Clostridium difficile.
His chest pain was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, and Ativan.
Troponin were cycled and found to be elevated.
The patient was also tachycardic to the 180s and was given intravenous diltiazem with minimal effect.
The Medical Intensive Care Unit Service was consulted and recommended cardioversion with amiodarone.
However, the amiodarone could not be administered on the floor, and the patient required transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for cardioversion.
He was also placed with a femoral line given that his peripherally inserted central catheter line was infected and felt to be the source of his Staphylococcus bacteremia.
On the following day, the sensitivities of the patient's blood cultures revealed the organisms were resistant to oxacillin, and the patient was continued on vancomycin.
The patient was requiring fewer blood transfusions and was maintaining his counts for longer periods of time status post transfusions.
This was later changed to comfort measures only on [**2126-8-21**].
However, while the patient expressed a clear understanding of this, he wanted to continue with his decision to be comfort measures only.
At that point, all intravenous fluids, medications, blood draws, and blood product support were withdrawn.
He was ordered for intravenous morphine as needed, and for intravenous Ativan, and Valium as needed.
