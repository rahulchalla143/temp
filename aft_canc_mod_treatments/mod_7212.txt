Admission Date:  [**2136-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-12-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Right frontal hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left-sided emergent external ventricular drainage placement.
Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 64yo right handed man with PMH significant for HTN, DMII, HCV, and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for ataxia presents from [**Hospital3 **] with altered consciousness.
He was intubated for airway protection.
He was receiving tPA [**Hospital1 **] via EVD until [**9-3**].
The patient has been covered with Vanco and Ceftazadime.
The patient had to have tracheostomy and PEG tube placement for failure to wean from vent.
His ICU course was also c/b elevation in LFTs and statin was held.
He eventually was weaned off the vent and has been stable on 35% trach mask.
Past Medical History: * HCV -- genotype 1 initially diagnosed in [**2128**], likely secondary to h/o IVDU in [**2089**]; currently on trial with PEG interferon; liver biopsy [**3-/2133**] showed stage-IV disease * HTN * Diabetes type II * Retinal embolus * Gout * Left ankle osteochondral defect (will have surgery involved grafts from patella) * Pruritis   Social History: lives alone, separated from wife, grown children.
Physical Exam: PE: VS: BP 180/76, HR 65, RR 17, SaO2 100%/FM Genl: lying in bed, not moving HEENT: NCAT, MMM, facemask in place CV: RRR, nl S1, S2 Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly Abd: soft, ND, BS+ Ext: warm & dry .
Neurologic examination: MS: required noxious stimuli for responsiveness, able to say his name, dysarthric, unable to understand answers to other orientation questions.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-9-26**] 4:15 PM Again seen is a right medial frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema with expected evolution of blood products.
[**2136-9-17**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Repositioning of PICC line as described.
[**2136-9-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard placement, approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach.
Endotracheal tube terminating 6.4 cm above the carina.
More optimal positioning would be achieved if the tube is advanced 1-2 cm.
Overdistention of the endotracheal tube cuff at the thoracic inlet.
[**2136-9-7**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Dobbhoff tube now in the expected location of the gastric fundus.
[**2136-9-7**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Feeding tube has been withdrawn to the level of the thoracic inlet that needs to be repositioned.
Stable appearance of bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages and of intraparenchymal hemorrhages within the right centrum ovale and recent catheter tract.
Status post ventriculostomy removal.
ET tube is in standard placement and a feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
[**2136-9-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Endotracheal tube located approximately 6 cm above the carina, as detailed above.
A Dobbhoff catheter is seen with the tip just below the left hemidiaphragm high in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
MRI/A brain ([**8-31**])- The previously described intraparenchymal hematoma on the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2136-8-16**] has enlarged.
CT head ([**8-30**])- Large right parenchymal hemorrhage with blood dissecting into the ventricles, with associated hydrocephalus.
The patient received TPA through his drain every 12hrs.
Seizure - Pt was started on oxycarbamazapine and Keppra, and EEG was ordered to r/o possibility of subclinical seizures, but results were suggestive of global encephalopathy (repeated [**9-11**] w/o significant change).
Seizure meds were subsequently discontinued, and neuro consultation continued to follow w/o further recs regarding this issue.
Increased ICP - Neurosurgery was consulted for possible IC cath blockage (possible ALOC due to increased ICP), but ICP was unremarkable; EVD was discontinued on [**9-5**], and neurosurgery signed-off w/o ability to explain declining MS.  Pt also received a f/u CT head on [**9-11**] with improved ICH and no signs of increased ICP.
ID - Given intracranial instramentation, both bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis were considered.
Per neuro and ID recs, pt was changed to ceftriaxone (with vanc continued) for possible bacterial meningitis on [**9-11**]; pt was then switched to ceftaz with vanc to complete a 2 week course (from [**9-11**] start date).
Pt continued to spike fevers until [**9-14**], but after that day, remained afebrile (but for occassional low-grade fevers) throughout the remainder of his ICU course.
LFTs only began to rise on [**9-11**], with significant elevation on [**9-19**]; however, this change was not temporally associated with pt's ALOC, and was not considered to be causative.
Renal consultation and testing concluded that acute on chronic renal failure was secondary to septic ATN with possible acyclovir toxicity (given appearance of acyclovir crystals in urine).
Acyclovir was discontinued, copious diuresis was initiated to pass crystals, and pt was transfused to improve renal perfusion/oxygenation.
# UTI - Pt was found to have a UTI while Foley cath was in place on [**9-8**], with UCX failing to reveal insulting pathogen (likely due to broad-spectrum coverage of abx prior to drawing of samples).
Pt was treated empirically by continuing cefepime and vanc (initially started for fever of unkwown source).
# Hepatitis w/ Pancreatitis - LFTs and amylase/lipase were noted to be elevated in an obstructive pattern on [**9-19**]; RUQ U/S failed to reveal cholelithiasis or CBD dilation; CPK was assayed, and was elevated, which in the context of elevated LFTs and pancreatic enzymes, was highly suggestive of statin toxicity.
Pt's statin was discontinued, and LFTs began to resolve.
# Hypertension:  Initially very difficult to control on multiple medications, including nicardipine gtt as needed to keep SBP < 160.
Ultimately, pt's BP began to stabilize, nicardipine drip was discontinued [**9-14**]; from there, BP was well-controlled on amlodipine, hydral, labetalol, and isordil.
Pt was maintained on AC with multiple failed attempts to prepare for extubation.
Ultimately, a tracheostomy was placed on [**9-14**] by IP service (please see operative report for details), and maintained on trach mask at FiO2 0.4.
# DM:  Pt's insulin requirement varied, and glycemic control was difficult to stabilize.
Pt was placed on an insulin drip on [**9-17**], with drastic improvement in glycemic control.
Insulin requirement was totaled, and pt was transitioned back to SC insulin with much-improved control upon transfer to the floor.
Pt was on Epo and iron, and as HCT slowly trended down during the course of his MICU stay, he received a transfusion of 2 PRBCs on [**9-19**].
# HCV: Last viral load 11,500,000 in [**5-31**].
# FEN: tube feeds, PEG placed [**9-14**], electrolytes repleted prn.
-When patient transferred to floor [**9-22**], vanc/ceftriaxone for possible meningitis, with tracking eye movements, afebrile, trach mask 35%, hypernatremia resolving, renal failure improving, PEG tube in place, diabetes controlled on regimen, but  course complicated by question of seizures, and lower GI bleed.
Ativan given and dilantin loaded.
Started on Dilantin 100 TID with continuing of jerking movements continuous, leaning towards a status epilepticus picture, vs myoclonic jerks.
Dilantin increased to 100 QAM, 100 QPM and 200 QHS.
To follow dilantin levels and Ativan as needed by rehabilitation center with close monitoring and neuro follow- up.
Grade II external hemmorhoids as well.
Polypectomy performed at colonoscopy [**9-27**] with guiac negative stools subsequently.
#Meningitis/[**Name (NI) **] Pt started on [**9-12**] with Vanc and ceftriaxone for temp to 103 and numerous WBC's on lumbar puncture.
Antibiotics for 16 day course.
Subsequent LP not performed prior to stopping antibiotics as per neuro recs.
#Htn- BP to highest SBP 195, patient had not received calcium channel blocker during episodes of lower GI bleed.
With dilantin level to be checked daily until stable, insulin regimen to continue, and monitoring for bleeds, with increasing in antihypertensives as needed for goal SBP<150.
