Robotic-assisted minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with intraoperative ultrasound.
Urgent exploratory laparotomy, oversewing and repair of splenic artery, and placement of intra-abdominal drain.
Her pancreatitis was attributed to elevated triglycerides, and she was put on gemfibrazil.
The patient desired to proceed with surgical management, and the plan was made with the patient to perform a robotic assisted distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: NAD, AOx3 CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR, no m/g/r LUNGS: CTAB ABDOMEN: soft, non-distended, mild peri-incisional tenderness to palpation, incisions healing well with no erythema or drainage, JP drain in place with minimal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] serous fluid in bulb and no surrounding erythema or drainage at insertion site.
EXTREMITIES: warm and well perfused, no edema   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 y/o female with a history of multiple episodes of pancreatitis and a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas who, after being seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], decided to go forward with surgical management of her pancreatic cyst.
On [**2131-10-10**] the patient underwent a robotic-assisted minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with intraoperative ultrasound with no intraoperative complications.
After a brief stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids with a foley catheter, and a dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Given her persistent tachycardia and falling hematocrit, she was transfused one unit of blood and received a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on the morning of [**2131-10-11**] that showed the presence of hematoma adjacent to the divided pancreas without evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma related to the inferior epigastric artery.
After discussion of the risks and benefits of surgery with the patient, and 2 telephone attempts to contact her significant other, she was taken to the operating room for urgent exploratory laparotomy.
On operation, she was found to be bleeding from the edge of her intact splenic artery staple line, and underwent oversewing and repair of the splenic artery with placement of an intra-abdominal drain.
She was transferred to the ICU and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn, where she remained for 2 days receiving antibiotics another one unit of packed RBC's.
She was transferred back to the floor, where she continued antibiotics and was started on a clear liquid diet while awaiting return of bowel function.
On [**10-18**] her creatinine bumped to 1.4 from a baseline of 0.4, so her Vanc and Zosyn were stopped given she had received a 7 day course of antibiotics and was now experiencing acute kidney injury.
She also became increasingly distended and had 3 episodes of bilious emesis, so an NG tube was placed to suction with an immediate return of 1.5 liters of bilious gastric fluid.
It was felt that her renal failure was likely pre-renal azotemia and not a manifestation of bowel ischemia, and she was aggressively rehydrated and a renal consult was placed, who agreed that she was likely dehydrated and pre-renal due to rapid fluid shifts and fluid losses in the setting of a small bowel obstruction.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed that showed a high grade small bowel obstruction in the LUQ in the area of the surgical bed, but given that she was only one week post-op it was felt that conservative management with NG tube and IV fluids would be the best course for the time being, and she was also started on TPN for nutrition.
Unfortunately, after 3 days of NG tube suction she developed coffee-ground output with intermittent episodes of bright red bloody output from her NG tube despite being on a PPI twice daily, became tachycardic, and her hematocrit began to fall despite receiving 1 unit of packed RBC's, with a nadir of 18.0 on [**10-24**].
After surgery she returned to the ICU, where she developed an anemia post-operatively on [**2131-10-26**] and was transfused with two units of ABO compatible pRBCS.
Without premedication, she was transfused with two complete units of pRBCs between 10:05 and 12:05AM on [**2131-10-26**].
At about 20:00, her O2 sat dropped to 92% and her O2 was increased to 6L with duoneb treatment.
Suspecting possible fluid overload, 20mg of IV lasix was also administered.
Her O2 sat dropped transiently to 60% at 7AM the following morning and she was placed on a face mask for better oxygenation.
By [**10-29**] her pulmonary infiltrates were resolving on her chest xray, her creatinine was trending down, and her hemodynamics were overall stable with some tachycardia and episodes of hypertension that were treated with and responsive to lopressor and IV hydralazine, and she was ultimately deemed stable for transfer back to the floor.
Her NG tube output was significantly decreased at the time of transfer, and the decision was made to remove it.
Her platelet count continued to be in the 1000-1400 range and her GI bleed was resolved, so she was started on aspirin 325mg daily for anticoagulation in addition to her subcutaneous heparin.
She continued on TPN for nutrition, and on [**11-1**] began passing flatus with a non-distended abdomen.
Her JP drain amylase was checked after she took in a full liquid diet and was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 15614**], but her JP drain output was consistently less than 10cc per day and it was felt that she was ready for a regular diet.
She remained stable hemodynamically, was ambulating and voiding without assistance, and her pain was well controlled on PO oxycodone.
On [**2131-11-4**] she was deemed stable for discharge home, and the patient felt comfortable managing her JP drain at home given its low output and her experience with having JP drains at home in the past for her prior mastectomy, so she did not desire home services.
She had already received her post-splenectomy vaccines pre-operatively in clinic, and her laparotomy staples and PICC line were removed just prior to discharge.
She was given prescriptions for her new medicines, notably her oxycodone, PPI, and stool softeners, and was instructed to follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks and to follow up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible, and was advised to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with any questions or concerns.
Also, please take any new medications as prescribed.
In particular, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking your pain medications.
You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
Make sure to keep the drain is attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
Please also follow up with your Primary Care Doctor as soon as possible, ideally within one week from discharge, for a wellness check and to go over your recent hospitalization and medication changes.
