As above, the patient was diagnosed and treated with chemo/XRT and biliary stenting.
The patient has undergone placement of a plastic stent in her metal stent with decrease in episodes of cholangitis.
The patient has had hepatic collection cultures revealing for Klebsiella oxytoca and Strep Milleri on [**7-31**] for which patient was on CTX and levofloxacin.
Repeat smapling in [**11-30**] revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] for which patient was treated with fluconazole, IV CTX was changed to Augmentin on [**2123-1-12**] and appeared to be doing well ultimately on a regimen of Augmentin, Levofloxacin, and Fluconazole.
The patient seemed to tolerate transition from IV to PO meds although ID note on [**2123-2-24**] noted rising trend in WBC concerning for worsening of underlying infection.
The patient was seen by her gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2123-3-19**] with plan for interventional radiology consultation for evaluation of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for biliary drainage, impression that repeat ERCP would be of limited utility given obstructing metal ducts.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx:  She was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in [**2112**] after presenting to [**Hospital6 1708**] with painless jaundice.
ERCP was unsuccessful in stenting the lesion and she underwent bilateral percutaneous cholangiograms with external drain placement and eventual internalization of the drains.
She underwent cholecystectomy with pathology confirming the presence of cholangiocarcinoma.
She was treated with 5-FU and radiation therapy.
PMH: Osteoporosis Glaucoma Appendectomy Tonsillectomy Adenoidectomy  Social History: The patient is married, she lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) **], MA.

Apparent occlusion of the indwelling biliary stents is again associated.
76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema, dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**] complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.
She is s/p bronchoscopy and a small piece of food (likely meat) was suctioned from her LUL which corresponded to her LUL collapse on CXR.
Her sputum was sent for cx and is growing yeast with pseudohyphae and gram + cocci in pairs.
Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite PO Augmentin, Levofloxacin, Fluconazole at home.
There was concern for infection/abx failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
Her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole on admission.
In light of the duodenal obstruction found on ERCP her failure of her home antibiotics were likely due to poor absorption continued on vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole until decision for [**Date Range 3225**] confirmed  .
Patient had a stent placed in duodenum.
She was started on reglan and was started on TPN.
