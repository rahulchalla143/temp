The patient's chest x-ray showed left midzone consolidation/collapse and a large left-sided pleural effusion which is new from previous x-rays but has been seen on x-rays here as recently as last year.
Given the concern for possible tuberculosis infection, the patient was placed on respiratory precautions the following day.
At this time, they are awaiting further stains to determine whether it is metastatic or lung cancer as this will determine possibility of further (palliative) treatment.
They felt that the malignant effusion and pneumothorax warranted a pleurex catheter with pleuroscopy and possible pleurodesis.
The patient was treated with Protonix and sucralfate and this appeared to improve her symptoms dramatically.
She was started on levo and Flagyl for a possible postobstructive pneumonia.
She should be continued on the Levo and Flagyl for at least ten days and possibly until after the interventional pulmonary procedure is completed.
She was given some IV fluids but secondary to CHF, the patient was encouraged to take p.o.
DISPOSITION:   Due to the fact that the patient is on Plavix and it was discontinued on [**2169-5-18**], she will need five to seven day stay before Interventional Pulmonary can do the pleurodesis and pleuroscopy.
Therefore, the patient will go to an acute rehabilitation facility and then return and at that time special stains that will diagnose the patient's cancer will be available and treatment options can be discussed as well as possible consultation with the Palliative Care Service.
