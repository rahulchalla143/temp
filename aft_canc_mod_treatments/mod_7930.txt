Minute fragmented biopsy consisting of proliferating bile ducts and hepatic parenchyma with massive necrosis and collapse (reticulin stain evaluated).
[**8-16**] COLONOSCOPY A.  Transverse colon polypectomy: Adenoma.
COLONOSCOPY [**2128-8-16**]: Polyp in the distal transverse colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the splenic flexure (polypectomy) Polyp in the proximal descending colon (polypectomy) Polyps in the mid-descending colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the rectum (polypectomy) Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids No evidence of diverticulum, masses or angiodysplasia Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  EGD [**2128-8-16**]: Erosion in the lower third of the esophagus No evidence of varices or Barretts Mosaic appearance in the stomach body and fundus compatible with portal gastropathy No evidence of varices, ulcers or active bleeding Erosions in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum No evidence of ulcers or active bleeding Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  PFTS [**2128-8-17**]: Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are normal.
DLCO: The Diffusing Capacity corrected for hemoglobin is normal.
CT head [**2128-9-1**]: Through a right frontal approach an ICP catheter has been positioned with its tip that appears to be within a right frontal sulcus and does not appear to enter parenchyma.
24-hour EEG [**2128-9-15**]: C/w encephalopathy.
Removal of an intracranial pressure monitor.
CXR [**2128-9-17**]: Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position.
Hepatitis: Patient initially presented from OSH for further evaluation and treatment after found to have elevated AST and ALT into the 1000.
She underwent evaluation for liver transplantation and was successfully listed.
Transplant surgery followed as well.
Patient was started on entecavir for hepatitis B.
A dophoff was also placed to help optimize nutritional status prior to surgery.
Patient was initially started on nafcillin 2 g IV q6 hrs.
This was changed to cefzolin after 3 days given development of AIN.
A PICC line was placed on 16. .
Patient was given cryoglobulin for fibrinogen < 100. .
Likely [**1-7**] to AIN from nafcillin although hepatorenal may be contributing.
Antibiotics were changed from nafcillin to cefzolin and AIN resolved.
Patient did not respond to NS bolus or albumin.
On [**2128-8-30**], the patient became markedly encephalopathic and was transferred to the surgical ICU under the care of the transplant surgery service.
She underwent infectious work-up and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically.
On [**2128-8-31**], she was intubated for waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Her coagulopathy was reversed with transfusions and an intracranial bolt was placed the following day for ICP monitoring.
While the bolt was in place, her coagulopathy was corrected with transfusions of FFP, platelets, and cryoglobulin as needed to maintain an INR <2.0, Plts >75, Hct >25 and Fibrinogen >100.
Norepinephrine gtt was used to maintain CPP >60.
ICPs stabilized <20 spontaneously without sedation, hypertonic saline, mannitol, hyperventilation, paralysis, and hypothermia.
Antibiotics were changed from vanc/cefep/flagyl/fluc/entecavir to vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/flagyl/mica/entecavir.
On [**2128-9-17**], she became hypotensive, requiring the maximum dose of norepinephrine gtt.
Ms. [**Known lastname 90708**] remained on maximal levophed gtt requirement throughout the evening of [**9-17**].
Medications on Admission: ASA 81 mg, Calcium, MVI, Glucosamine/chondroitin.
