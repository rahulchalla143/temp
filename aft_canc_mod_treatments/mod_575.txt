She states that she has been off coumadin since her last admission in [**Month (only) 462**]; it was supposed to be restarted but the prescription had not been filled yet.
She did have a recent UTI that was treated with an unknown antibiotic.
She used to be on procrit shots but has not had one since approx [**Month (only) 205**].
With regards to her TB history, she was dx with TB on her last admission to the MICU in [**Month (only) 462**].
She has been receiving multi-drug therapy and a special "TB nurse" has been coming to give her her meds at home each day, including a medicine that makes her urine "pink."
Tuberculosis in the setting of methotrexate and remicaid treatment for RA.
Treated with DOT for four months.

Small mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, which do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
A second of these appears more wedge-shaped than peripheral, and may reflect an area of infarction (series 2, image 57).
There is soft tissue swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, surgical drains, and overlying skin staples, consistent with recent surgery.
Her hospital course was length and involved treatment for Tuberculosis, fevers of unknown origin, a total R hip replacement  and the finding of a reversible defect on pMIBI.
Further history revealed that the patient has not been getting her long-standing Procrit injections for over a month, since the time she was discharged from [**Hospital1 **].
Her Hct remained stable until [**11-7**] when she received an additional unit for crit 23.1.
She was restarted on Epogen and continue on folic acid 3 grams per day, Vit B12, B6.
As her hospitalization moved into [**Month (only) 404**], the patient required intermittent blood trasnfusions.
Prior to her R hip replacement, she had a pMIBI which showed a small reversible defect.
As such, it was decided to ensure that her HCT should be maintained above 30 given her propensity for ischemia.
The patient was initially placed on respiratory precautions because of continuous cough productive of white sputum.
DOT and medication doses were comfirmed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the physician overseeing patient's TB therapy.
Patient was adherent to TB medication regimen.
In the hospital, she was continued on home regimen of INH, Rifampin, ethambutol, and Pyrazinamide.
The patient was initially afebrile (although she was started on standing Tylenol on admission because of hip pain), but then started spiking fevers to over 103.
Both consultant teams felt that progression of active TB is extremely unlikely given pan-sensitive organism, DOT, and duration of therapy she has received.
Question of possible brochoscopy vs surgical biopsy was discussed w/ pulm.
During the early part of admission, they felt that for the relative invasiveness of not only the surgical bx but also the bronchoscopy, and for the probable low yield of procedure, that the procedure should not be done.
In [**Month (only) 1096**], her regimen was changed from ETH/PZA to Levo/Strepto.
Out of concern for a possible eosinophilic pneumonitis her regimen was changed to INH/levofloxacin/ethambutol to see if her fevers and eosinophilia would resolve.
She is to remain on this regimen for at least 4 more months per the ID service.
Pt was afebrile on admission but was started on OTC tylenol for persistant R hip pain.
Shortly after admission, she began to spike fevers to around 102-103 while still on OTC tylenol.
Diagnostic tests performed including serum aspergillus galactomannan Ag, B-glucan, histoplasma antibody and urine histoplasma antigen, CMV VL, HBV viral load, c diff, stool Oand P were all negative.
Pt was started on Levo empirically given pulmonary finding on CT, but continued to have fevers.
She was then started on 7-day course of meropenem for ESBL E.coli in urine, but was still febrile after completing the course.
On [**11-28**], we changed her TB meds for possible drug fever.
On [**12-1**] - more bottles positive for coag-neg staph; started 2 week course for presumed line-related bacteremia (although line tip negative) with vanco.
Because of her eosinophilia in the setting of fevers, on [**12-6**], she was treated empirically for strongyloides with 1 dose of ivermectin.
To evaluate a potential oncologic contribution to the fevers/eosinophilia, Heme/Onc repeated the bone marrow biopsy which was consistent with her known diagnosis of MDS and AFB stain was negative.
Her bone marrow was also negative for lymphoma.
Outpatient regimen had included methotrexate and remicade which were stopped in [**2138-7-15**] when she was diagnosed with TB.
Patient was given oxycodone, lidocaine patch and OTC tylenol for pain control.
[**11-9**] the plain hip film was performed and revealed no fracture but with a superior and lateral subluxation of the right femoral head.
Ortho was consulted as request of other teams for possible synovial bx/ hip aspirate to question the significance of R hip pain and possibility again of extra pul TB manifestation causing fever.
Intially, ortho believed best approach would be for scheduled outpt hip replacement/synovectomy since hip has far advanced arthritis/capsule restriction, it would preclude arthroscopic distension and distraction needed, so would need open procedure.
As her hospitalization progressed into [**Month (only) 404**] and her fevers continued to persist, the issue of doing hip surgery was revisited and agreed upon.
The patient was also agreeable to this procedure because of her severly limited mobility [**1-16**] pain.
Hence, she had a pMIBI prior her her surgery which demonstrated a small reversible defect.
She tolerated the procedure well.
She thus received 3U PRBC during the procedure as well as approximately 6-7L IVF during/perioperatively.
Vancomycin was started [**12-1**] and the patient's PICC line was removed.
She was given 2 wks of Vancomycin .
# Cough: Pt w/ cough and productive sputum of unclear etiology, has been receiving active TB treatment and CXR on admission was otherwise clear except for some mild b/l effusions.
Was thought it could also be viral URI, pertussis possible as pt without fevers on admission although on high dose standing tylenol for R hip pain.
The patient was put on isolation/resp precautions for TB as diagnosed on previous admission.
We restarted TB meds at home doses of rifampin, ethambutol, INH and Pyrazinamide and gave her guaifenesin/codeine for a cough.
Pt still with cough, appears not to be responding despite antibiotic therapy.
Resolved with hydration in ED.
Pt with borderline BP during admission having to hold metoprolol on multiple occasions.
This was originally thought to be AVNRT, noted on last admission, when the patient was started on metoprolol, digoxin and verapamil.
She was continued on metoprolol.
Pt's Dig and verapamil were originally discontinued, given only one episode of previous SVT and concern for drug fever.
However, the patient developed several episodes of SVT to the 160's, and therefore the metoprolol, verapamil and digoxin were titrated up.
The patient and already on beta-blocker.
During the month of [**Month (only) 404**], the patient's rates were well controlled with metoprolol, verapamil and digoxin.
The digoxin was held perioperatively given concerns for arrhythmogenicity per cardiology attending.
Digoxin was then discontinued as the cardiology team questioned the diagnosis of AVNRT.
On discharge, her rates were well-controlled to 70-90 with verapamil 40mg PO TID and metoprolol 50mg PO TID.
Bilateral PE in [**2134**] on 1 + years of anticoagulation with coumadin.
Given massive PEs the plan was to continue life-long anticoagulation with goal INR 1.5-1.9 Coumadin had been held on last admit, for unclear reasons.
Coumadin was held throughout much of this admission, and enoxaparin was given.
After her surgery, she was bridged from enoxaparin to coumadin.
Statin was held due to history of transaminitis and risk of hepatic toxicity from TB meds.
Held aspirin until sure pt is not having hemolysis [**1-16**] G6PD, patient also has aspirin documented as allergy.
Metoprolol was restarted.
pMIBI prior to ortho procedure showed mild reversible defect.
However, given the severe nature of the patient's longstanding pain, it was agreed upon by the team and the patient that the procedure should still be done.
H/o urge incontinence, continued on home oxybutinin dosage.
Given her multitude of drugs, this was considered as one possible source of her eosinophilia.
She was treated with 1 dose of ivermectin for potential strongyloides (though her titre was negative).
Connective tissue diseases were also entertained, and she did have an elevated [**Doctor First Name **], but of uncertain significance.
