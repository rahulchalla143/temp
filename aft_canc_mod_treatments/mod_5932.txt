Give the persistent hypotension, he was given a bolus of heparin over a concern of a pulmonary embolism.
He was also given antibiotics over concern of sepsis, but these were stopped after he demonstrated no clear source of infection.
He was bolused with intravenous fluids, and then transferred to the intensive care unit.
After several liters of intravenous fluid, his blood pressure remained stable at his baseline.
It was felt that his hypotension was a combination of poor PO intake peri- and post-operatively, coupled with fluid shifts from surgery and possible reaction to his pain medications on post-operative day 2, as he had a macular truncal rash at that time.
His creatinine had bumpted from 0.9 to 1.9 at time of ICU transfer, however had returned to baseline after intravenous fluids and normalization of his blood pressure.
Hematology consult was eventually obtained for assistance in explaining his anemia.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2129-3-19**] and his Hct remained stable thereafter.
He had no localizing signs of infection so antibiotics were not started.
He was transfered to the medicine floor where he progressed with physical therapy to be able to be discharged home with PT.
His blood pressure medications were restarted without complication.
