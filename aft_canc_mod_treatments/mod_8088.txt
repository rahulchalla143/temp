Admission Date:  [**2109-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-3-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / acetaminophen  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Oxygen desaturation   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] is a 77 year old female with a history of left pontine stroke with residual right sided weakness and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2109-5-8**] to [**2109-5-10**] who presents from rehab with fever to 101 and desaturation to 89% on 2.5L NC at rehab.
She had a left lower lobe opacity on her CXR in our ED and was started on hospital acquired pneumonia coverage, receiving cefepime/levofloxacin in the ED and vancomycin when she came up to the floor.
She was treated empirically for heart failure with iv diuresis.
We continued the levofloxacin which she had been taking and added vancomycin/cefepime for possible HCAP.
Given this, and her lack of fevers/leukocytosis, and lack of improvement on the levofloxacin, this was felt unlikely to be a bacterial pneumonia so the antibiotics were stopped on [**5-14**].
She was started on methylprednisolone 1000mg daily for 3 days (day one recieved in the MICU on [**5-17**]) and will require a slow taper over the period of a month if her shortness of breath is improving.
We continued aspirin 325mg and atorvastatin 80mg.
They were amenable to PICC placement for IV steroids in case this will improve Ms. [**Known lastname 111944**] respiratory symptoms, but overall are interested in measures to make Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] more comfortable.
It may prudent to transition to comfort measures only in the coming days depending on her response to steroids.
Transitional Issues: - Ms. [**Known lastname 35227**] was started on IV methylprednisolone 1gm x 3 days(day 1 [**5-17**]), and she will start prednisone 60mg daily on [**2109-5-19**].
