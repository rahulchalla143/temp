He was transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, and now presents with post-ictal confusion and excitement.
The situation was discussed in detail with the family and once due to the dementia of the patient, a first line resection was denied.
After extensive discussions of the pros and cons, the family wished a serial stereotactic biopsy to be done so that a definitive histological diagnosis could be obtained and any further measures could be decided upon on the basis of a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and the pertinent prognostic outlook.
During his pre-operative course the pt was intubated and sedated during imaging.
Preoperatively, Dilantin was started for seizure prophylaxis as well as decadron.
