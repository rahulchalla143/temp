Admission Date:  [**2129-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-6-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Zocor / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Biliary obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic retrograde pancreaticogram (ERCP)x 2 Endoscopic ultrasound Transjugular liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59 year old male with a history of CAD, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, Hodgkin's disease in remission, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD implant in [**2123**].
He was transferred from [**Hospital3 29818**] for possible ERCP after having an elevated TBili and RUQ ultrasound showing borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation and borderline CBD dilation 6 cm.
He was recently discharged home from rehab on [**2129-7-26**] after a one month stay following a brief hospitalization for a CHF exacerbation.
He was given Ativan 5 mg PO x2 and Tylenol 975 mg PO.
He was given IV fluids with improvement in his pressures.
Labs showed creatinine 1.5, Hct 27.3, and D-dimer 906.
He was transfused a total of 3 units PRBCs with his Hct remaining at 34-35 afterwards.
He was treated with empiric Flagyl and Levofloxacin given the concern for colitis noted on CT.
He denies any chest pain, pressure, palpitations, cough, or SOB.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: # CAD # PTCA at [**Hospital1 112**] ([**10/2123**]) -- DES to RCA # Ventricular Tachycardia s/p ICD implant ([**2123**]) # Atrial Fibrillation # Paroxysmal SVT # Mitral Regurgitation ([**2127**]) # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Rhematoid Arthritis ([**2103**]) -- treated with Methotrexate # Hodgkin's Lymphoma s/p chemo and radiation ([**2117**]) -- currently in remission # Shingles ([**2119**]) # Inclusion Body Myositis ([**2125**]) -- weakness primarily of left arm # Left Foot and Ankle Fusions   Social History: He is single and lives alone.
He uses a walker or motorized wheelchair at baseline.
Resolving ecchmoses at Heparin injection sites.
A biliary stent was placed.
ERCP ([**2129-8-3**]): Impression: Biliary stent in good position appropriately draining bile.
Mild canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis with focal bile duct damage and proliferation with associated neutrophils (immunostains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 are examined to better highlight biliary epithelium).
Minimal lobular mixed inflammation including lymphocytes, neutrophils and rare eosinophils.
Mild sinusoidal fibrosis demonstrated with trichrome stain without portal fibrosis.
Sphincterotomy and brushings were not performed at that time given clinical instability.
A stent was placed however.
Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl had been given empirically given the colitis and biliary involvemnt, these were stoppped on [**8-3**].
The exact cause of his liver dysfunction is not completely clear but it is likely that much of his liver injury was from the biliary stricture itself, with possible contribution from drug injury, specifically from antibiotics that he received at the outside hospital.
His hematocrit again drifted down to 25 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during his stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
# Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was on NSAIDs and methotrexate at the time of admission to the hospital.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and stool was sent to C. Diff.
He was given Vitamin K at OSH without significant improvement in his INR.
Fibrinogen was checked given concern for a consumptive coagulopathy, but the level was high, which would not be consistent with such a process.
2 units of FFP were administered prior to ERCP per ERCP team request.
# Metabolic Acidosis: He was noted to have a non anion gap metabolic acidosis at OSH with bicarb [**12-21**].
Medication effect or renal tubular acidosis is a possibility.
Atenolol was changed to metoprolol.
No statin given acute hepatitis.
# Hypotension: He was hypotensive to the 60s systolic on presentation to OSH, with improvement after receiving blood and IV fluids.
He was transferred with a regimen of Atenolol 12.5 mg PO BID and Losartan 12.5 mg PO daily with strict holding parameters.
His home anti-HTNsive were held and he was given multiple IVF boluses to maintain BP in the early part of his hospitalization.
Ultimately, his blood pressure stabilized, however, and he tolerated continued beta blockade as well as diuretics (see below).
ASA 325 daily was continued while in the medical intensive care unit.
Patient was intermittently in Afib w/RBBB while in the ICU, requiring IV lopressor for rate control.
He was treated with IV metoprolol, which was subsequently transitioned to oral metoprolol with good HR control.
He eventually converted to NSR, and he was continued on metoprolol to help suppress ectopy.
This was likely multifactorial--he appeared to have low oncotic pressure (albumin low of 2.2) and received large amounts of IV fluids due to his low blood pressure, he also has a history of right sided heart failure.
As his blood pressure gradually stabilized, he was carefully started on low dose Lasix with good diuresis.
Lasix was gradually increased in dose and frequency to [**Hospital1 **], and his edema gradually improved.
He continues to have significant edema at the time of discharge and he should continue to receive diuretics.

You should have a colonoscopy and repeat upper endoscopy as an outpatient.
You still have a lot of extra fluid and this will need to be removed with ongoing diuresis when you are at the rehab facility.
Followup Instructions: ** You will need to get an endoscopy and colonoscopy by your gastroenterologist for anemia with blood in your stool.
