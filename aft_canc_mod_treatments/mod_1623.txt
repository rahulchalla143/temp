It seems that everything started with some narcotic pain medications causing oversedation.
To treat your heart you were started on several medications that thin you blood and in this setting you started bleeding from an ulcer in your stomach.
Because the kidneys were not clearing toxins and this was leading to confusion, you had an emergency IV placed and were initiated on hemodialysis, of which you had 2 sessions.
Meanwhile it was noted that your chemotherapy port that you have had for years appeared infected and you were shown to have bacteria in your blood stream.
Because of this infection it was necessary to remove both your port and your new dialysis line which may have been harboring bacteria.
You were started on antibiotics and responded very well, with all furthur blood cultures negative.
Because the antibiotics are cleared through the kidneys and your kidney function was changing daily, it was necessary to measure the level of your antibiotics daily to determine appropriate dosing.
You will need to continue antibiotics for 2wks total, ending on [**3-12**].
