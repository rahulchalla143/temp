She was initially treated with daunorubicin, Ara-c and etoposide.
She was then referred to [**Hospital 4415**] for further evaluation, where she received further induction on chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine in 07/[**2175**].
She underwent a MUD transplant on [**2176-10-4**].
Her transplant course was complicated by grade 1 acute graft versus host disease of the skin as well as acute renal failure.
She has been treated for this with Rituxan and more recently with Pentostatin.
She has also had a persistent ulceration in her right upper buccal mucosa which has not healed despite a course of famvir and oral diflucan.
Past Medical History: 1) Acute monomyelocytic leukemia s/p allo-MUD transplant 3 years    ago as above.
2) CAD: s/p MI and stentx2 one year ago in [**State 1727**].

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initially started on Ambisome for empiric coverage of fungal infection such as aspergillus.
She was also started on levofloxacin.
She was taken for VATS on [**2179-11-15**] for biopsy of the lung nodules seen on chest CT.  A bronchoscopy with lavage was also performed during the procedure.
Her antifungal regimen was changed from Ambisome to Voriconazole and Caspofungin.
* 2) PLEURITIC PAIN: Throughout her admission, the patient continued to complain of right sided pleuritic pain.
She was started on MS contin 15 mg PO BID, which was later titrated up to 30 mg PO BID.
The pain service was consulted and recommended starting a lidoderm patch as well as neurontin.
They recommended starting NSAIDS for anti-inflammatory effect.
The patient was started on Ibuprofen 400 mg PO BID and her pain significantly improved.
A thoracentesis was considered to remove fluid from her effusion; however, it was decided that there was an insignificant amount of fluid for the procedure to be performed safely.
She was already on antifungal coverage for aspergillus.
This was reportedly chronic, and has been followed with serial U/S in the past.
She was started on vancomycin and the rash resolved.
During this admission, the patient needed to be taken off of these medications so she could have surgical procedures performed.
Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to see if the aspirin and [**Name (NI) **] could be held.
She was continued on her beta-blocker.
Her aspirin was restarted on [**11-30**].
Later, a Hickman catheter was placed on [**11-28**] and the right IJ was removed.
She was restarted on levofloxacin and Flagyl was added for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Antibiotics were continued and she was started albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.
She was started on albuterol and atrovent nebs, as well as humidified air and chest PT to break up secretions.
At this point in her hospital course, she was transferred to the ICU for further managment.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was unable to intubated because of significant upper airway anatomical obstruction from her GvHD, so an emergent tracheostomy was performed.
)Respiratory failure -- Multiple factors were felt to contribute, including aspiration, GvHD/capillary leak syndrome, invasive aspergillois, and decreased chest wall compliance (from GvHD/anasarca/obesity).
For GvHD, her mycophenylate and tacrolimus were continued, and for aspergilossis, her caspofungin and voriconazole were continued, and for chest wall compliance, a gentle diuresis was effected.
On this regimen, her oxygenation and ventilation gradually improved and she was switched to pressure support ventilation, that was gradually weaned down.
In addition to possible sepsis, she was also felt to be intravascularly dry despite massive total body volume overload.
In addition, sedation and high pressures of mechanical ventilation played a role.
Initially on phenylephrine, norepinephrine was added.
Eventually, the patient was unable to be weaned off the ventilator.
She had severe third-spacing, and after a family discussion, she was made comfort measures only.
