Brief Hospital Course: 41 year old gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] following episode of altered mental status early on day of admission, [**12-24**], that led to intubation for airway protection.
He was started on high-dose Decadron and was followed by Medical Oncology, Neuro-oncology, and Radiation Oncology.
His presenting symptoms were considered a consequence of his worsening lymphoma.
Given his previous treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy, he was not considered a candidate for chemotherapy.
He began palliative full brain XRT on [**2144-12-28**].
He was initially treated with Acyclovir for HSV, however this was stopped due to low clinical suspicion.
Endotracheal intubation/extubation: He was intubated for airway protection at an OSH prior to admission.
He remained off ventilatory support and became hypoxic three days prior to death but was made comfort measures only.
Vancomycin and Cefepime were started on [**12-25**] for a planned 8 day course, which was stopped early when the goals of care were changed.
Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:  He had a history of a pituitary adenoma and surgical resection had been planned for future.
Code Status: He was initially full code during this hospitalization, but after he clinically worsened with severe alteration in mental status, he was made DNR/DNI and eventually comfort measures only.
