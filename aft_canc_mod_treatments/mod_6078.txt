Therapeutic thoracentesis performed on [**1-28**].
Flex bronch on [**1-28**] demonstrated considerable airway obstruction with no possibility for endobronchial stent placement, as well as a posterior wall defect in the right bronchus intermedius.
He was treated symptomatically with Spiriva and Atrovent nebulizers, steroids, as well as low-dose morphine PRN to decrease air hunger.
He was evaluated by IR for possible SVC stent placement as a palliative measure for his respiratory distress, however given his respiratory distress and inability to lie flat, a stent was not attempted.
He was given 2L bolus of NS, Tylenol, Vanc & Cefepime for neutropenic fever.
Pt was presumed to have post-obstructive pneumonia process for which he was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
He will need to complete a 7-day course (ends on [**2-4**]).
# Pancytopenia: Likely late response to chemotherapy and radiation.
Edema worsening s/p chemo and radiation treatments, for which these have been held.
SVC stent placement was considered, but after discussion with the patient, his wife and IR, it was felt that the risks of anesthesia would outweigh the potential benefits of the procedure.
The head of his bed was kept elevated, and lasix was given, if blood pressure permitted, to minimize fluid retention.
