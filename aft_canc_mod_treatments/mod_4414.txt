POST BYPASS The patient is receiving milrinone and norepinephrine by infusion.
He was cleared by hematology and subsequently was seen by the renal team and dialysis was started preoperatively for his worsening renal function.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**12-29**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.
The initial plan was to proceed with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, but in the Operating Room he was found to have adhesive pericarditis and he was also becoming hemodynamically unstable and it was decided to proceed with the operation on full cardiopulmonary bypass.
He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4.
He was started on a Lasix drip on POD#1 due to a low urine output.
He was started on an Amiodarone drip due to ventricular arrythmias and EP was consulted due to his low EF.
H estabilized and vasoactive medications were weaned off and he was started on Norvasc and low dose beta blockers.
He has had no further ventricular ectopy on Amiodarone 200 mg daily.
A tunnelled hemodialysis catheter was placed for long term hemodialysis needs uneventfully.
Medications were adjusted for his renal failure and as he had rhythm issues postoperatively and the LFTs rose before Amiodarone was begun it was not discontinued completely.
He continued M-W-F dialysis without problems.
His urine output is minimal and the Foley catheter was removed.
He may require periodic straight catheterization after discharge.
He has been covered with sliding scale insulin postoperatively and not been restarted on his long acting insulin (Lantus 26 units [**Hospital1 **]) at discharge as his oral intake and appetite have been subpar.
He is very deconditioned and was transferred for further recovery and continued dialysis before eventual discharge home.
