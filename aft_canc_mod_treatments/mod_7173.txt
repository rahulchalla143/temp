Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left radical nephrectomy and excision of tumor thrombus from left renal vein and IVC.
CTA of the chest, which had been done in preparation for left nephrectomy (scheduled for [**2128-9-6**]) revealed PE in the RUL, w/ multiple wedge shaped consolidations concerning for pulm infarcts.
The decision was made to transfuse 1 unit PRBCs to bolster the pt's baseline HCT, then treat w/ heparin for PE and monitor HCT closely.

Tumor invasion of perirenal fat and Gerota's fascia and tumor thrombus in left renal vein extending to junction of IVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Pulmonary embolism: Patient had above CTA results on admission and was started on a heparin drip for anticiagulation.
2) Renal Cell Carcinoma- plan for L nephrectomy on Monday.
The patient was given dilaudid for pain control.
Patient was anticoagulated on heparin gtt.
6) Diabetes type 2: metformin and glyburide were discontinued on admission in preoperative period.
Pt was maintained on weight based insulin: NPH twice daily, humalog before meals, and a humalong sliding scale.
She should resume her oral antiglycemics as an outpatient.
Ms [**Known lastname 4610**] was transfered to the care of the Urology service after her surgical procedure.
She was prepared and consented for surgery as per standard.
As a result, she was admitted to the hospital 5 days ago and was started on IV heparin.
At this point she presents for left radical nephrectomy and removal of tumor thrombus.
She was slowly weaned from oxygen  by postoperative day six, and physical therapy regularly started to see her.
Initially, her oxygen saturation would drop (lowwest of 78%) during exertion; however, this improved over the course of 3 days until she was able to walk on her own, without oxygen supplmentation and assistance.
Instead, per pulmonary consult, anticoaguation with coumadin was decided on with a target INR between [**3-12**].
She was told to hold coumadin the night of her discharge, and VNA was arranged in order to monitor the INR levels in the next week.
These results will be sent to her PCP who will then adjust her coumadin dose as necessary.
