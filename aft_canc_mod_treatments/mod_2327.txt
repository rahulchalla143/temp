Admission Date:  [**2185-10-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-11-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-5-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an addendum to discharge summary dated [**2185-11-5**] for [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7990**], a 61 year-old female with chronic lung and liver disease who presented with acute adult respiratory distress syndrome after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Respiratory failure:  The patient received a tracheostomy on [**11-4**].
She continued a slow weaning off mechanical ventilation, which required massive diuresis including Furosemide intravenous drip.
It is noted that she diureses well to Furosemide 80 mg intravenous push.
Beginning on the evening of [**11-11**] the patient was able to tolerate tracheostomy collar with oxygen mask for short periods of time.
Starting on [**11-18**] the patient was able to tolerate tracheostomy collar and oxygen mask continuously and has been free of mechanical ventilation for three days.
Typical vital signs on tracheostomy collar with Passey Muir speaking valve, respiratory rate 15 to 28, oxygen saturation 94 to 100% on 10 liter tracheostomy mask, arterial blood gas 7.49/37/110.
The patient should have her Passy Muir valve on with tracheostomy cuff deflated during the day and valve removed with tracheostomy cuff inflated at night.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had hypotension earlier on admission as detailed on prior note.
She continued on Hydrocortisone and Fluticasone for relative adrenal insufficiency through [**11-8**].
However, after corticosteroids were stopped, her pressure became mildly low requiring intravenous Vasopressors.
Hydrocortisone was restarted at 50 mg intravenous q 6 hours and continued for another seven days through [**11-15**].
On this regimen the patient was no longer hypotensive and all pressors were discontinued on [**11-9**] and hs not been started since.
Arterial line was discontinued on [**11-19**] and cuff pressures have been stable since.
The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring a Digoxin load earlier in the admission.
Digoxin was again loaded and the dose was increased to 0.25 mg intravenous q.d.
Digoxin was switched to po on [**11-19**] and the Digoxin level should be repeated on [**11-24**].
The patient has been on intravenous heparin anticoagulation throughout her hospital stay.
The intravenous heparin drip was being discontinued on [**11-21**] and the patient should be started on Warfarin 2.5 mg po q day tonight.
Infectious disease:  The patient remained on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime from [**10-31**] through [**11-10**] for ventilator associated pneumonia.
On [**11-15**] gram positive coxae grew in one of four blood culture bottles and this happened again in one of four bottles on [**11-18**] as well as gram positive coxae growing from the tip of the arterial line discontinued on [**11-13**].
She is discharged on low doses of Furosemide and Spironolactone.
The patient has also received multiple doses of subcutaneous vitamin K for elevated INR on this admission.
We are currently titrating up the patient's NPH insulin to cover hypoglycemia caused by nocturnal tube feeds.
As of today her insulin dose is adjusted up to 8 units subQ q.a.m., 18 units subQ q 6:00 p.m.  Finger stick blood glucoses should continue to be monitored and NPH insulin adjusted accordingly.
She is beginning to exhibit signs of anxiety and/or sundowning and has been started on Sertraline 50 mg po q day with prn Zolpidem.
Further therapy for anxiety and insomnia should be considered based on the patient's clinical presentation.
Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient received aggressive Furosemide diuresis as above.
This resulted in multiple electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia requiring aggressive potassium repletion as well as Acetazolamide for severe metabolic alkalosis and Spironolactone.
As the patient reached uvolemia the need for Furosemide, potassium and free water decreased.
All free water supplementation has been discontinued although Lasix and Spironolactone are continued at low doses as described above.
The patient's serum sodium should be monitored twice weekly along with potassium, and oral anticoagulation management as described above.
Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine should be monitored as well.
Nutrition:  The patient tolerated a blue dye swallowing study without aspiration on [**11-18**].
A Dobbhoff nasogastric narrow bore feeding tube was placed and the patient is to be given tube feeds nocturnally, Promote with fiber at 90 ml per hour until 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  During the day, her Passy Muir valve should be in and she should be allowed to eat a low sodium consistent carbohydrate diet of pureed and thin liquids.
Feeding tube can be discontinued at such time as the patient is able to take sufficient po to nourish herself.
Access:  Subclavian central venous and radial arterial lines have been discontinued.
Tracheostomy dates to [**11-4**].
The patient has had an indwelling Foley catheter since admission, which should be discontinued at such time as the patient is able to manage her own urination.
Prophylaxis:  The patient should receive Coumadin with monitoring of international normalized ratio for both deep venous thrombosis and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.
She should continue to receive a proton pump inhibitor as she was on this as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid 1 mg po q day, Thiamine 100 mg po q day, Lansoprazole 30 mg q day, Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d., Coumadin 2.5 mg po q.h.s.
Sertraline 50 mg po q.d., NPH insulin 6 units subcutaneous q.a.m., 18 units subcutaneous q 6:00 p.m., please monitor finger stick blood glucoses and adjust NPH dose as needed.
Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day please check Digoxin level on [**11-24**] and adjust dose if needed.
Furosemide 40 mg po q day, Spironolactone 100 mg po q day, please monitor daily weights and fluid status as well as twice weekly serum electrolytes BUN and creatinine, adjust diuresis as necessary with the potential with the discontinued diuresis entirely if the patient does not require for uvolemia.
Zolpidem 5 mg po q.h.s.
prn, Lactulose 30 ml po q 4 hours prn, Combivent MDI prn.
