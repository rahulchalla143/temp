His laboratories were notable for a hematocrit of 26.0, potassium 5.6, blood urea nitrogen 61, creatinine 1.5.
For the patient's lung and brain masses, the patient was started on intravenous Dilantin on the advice of neurology, and a chest CT was ordered.
He received a total of three units of packed red blood cells, and then was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
For his alcohol withdrawal, he was started on Oxazepam protocol and given multivitamin Thiamine and Folate.
On [**2134-1-24**], he became hypertensive to 210/130, requiring control with Nitroglycerin paste and Clonidine.
In order to stabilize for transfer, he required sedation with Propofol and consequent endotracheal intubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 70 year old male with new brain lesions, apparent lung mass with endobronchial obstruction, ETOH withdrawal requiring deep Propofol sedation and endotracheal intubation for interhospital transfer.
Given these imaging findings and the patient's changed mental status, he was given a very poor prognosis with his Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer.
However, because the family was able to communicate with the patient and actually saw some improvement in his mental status over the past several weeks, especially since extubation, they decided to hold off on head radiation therapy, understanding that radiation therapy while it could provide further improvement in his mental status, it could also have negative effect too.
Instead, the patient was kept on Dexamethasone which was eventually tapered down to 4 mg four times a day.
Other sources of mental status change included high Ativan load with poor clearing, effect of Dilantin, Wernicke's syndrome.
Once again, the family held off on head radiation therapy given the patient's improving mental status.
He was kept on Clonidine at 0.5 mg p.o.
He received swallowing evaluation with nasogastric tube in place and was noted to be a silent aspirator.
The patient was kept on aspiration precautions given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
