After an initial evaluation by the medicine service, she was transferred to Oncology for initiation of chemotherapy and consideration of radiation.
She was not a candidate for radiation given metastatic presentation.
Paraneoplastic syndrome was the presumed etiology of her weakness given characteristic EMG findings.
# Urinary retention - Prior to this hospitalization, had been treated with antibiotics for UTIs, however, most recent culture from [**2-16**] without growth.
Opted to not remove again during stay while she was so weak given concern for skin breakdown with incontinency.
Cast was subsequently removed for better imaging with replacement of substitute cast.
Per orthopedics, should continue with touch-down weight bearing as tolerated.
Should also continue PT/OT in rehabiliation facility.

Restarted colchicine suspected flair.

Continue on 1.2L fluid restriction.
Continued with good oral care and Nystatin QID PRN.
