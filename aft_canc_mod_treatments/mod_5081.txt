Admission Date:  [**2181-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) Bilateral IR guided nephrostomy tube placement 2) exploratory laparotomy, resection of pelvic masses, bilateral salpingoophorectomy   History of Present Illness: 47yo F with abdominal pain for ten months worsening over the last week.
US at OSH demonstrated a 20cm mass in abdomen as well as lab abnormalities including hyperkalemia (K 6.1) with ECG findings, renal failure (creatinine of 11.5), hyponatremia (Na 121), leukocytosis (WBC of 20.1) and anemia (Hct of 17 s/p one unit of PRBCs) leading to x-fer to [**Hospital1 18**].
The pt also received fentanyl 50mcg IV x1, and ativan 0.5mg IV x1 prior to transfer.
The pt also admits to 55lb weight loss during this span, constipation, n/v and decreased PO intake.
She received 2mg ativan and 2mg dilaudid after which, she became somewhat lethargic requiring 0.4mg naloxone x2.
She was given insulin/D50, calcium gluconate, and kayoxalate for her hyperkalemia and sodium bicarb for her acidosis.
Renal was consulted in the ED and recommended correction of underlying acidosis with barcarbonate infusion and continuation of treatment of hyperkalemia with kayexolate, lasix, calcium gluconate and insulin/D50.
Urology was consulted in the ED and recommended bilateral ureteral stents.
Brief Hospital Course: Pre-op Course: The pt was admitted to Medicine for pre-op stabilization.
ARF: As ARF was thought to be [**1-17**] bilateral obstuctive hydronephrosis, bilateral nephrostomy tubes were placed by IR.
Renal was consulted, and the pt initially required IV bicarb and bicitra, in addition to aggressive NS hydration, for tx of a metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.
Hyperkalemia resolved after administration of kayexelate, insulin, glucose, and D50 in the ED, and acidosis resolved within the first few days of hospitalization.
However, cr began to improve on HD #6 and HD was ultimately not required.
Pyleonephritis with bacteremia: Pt grew pan-sensitive E coli from R nephrostomy tube and blood cultures, and was treated with a 2 week course of Levofloxacin.
Pain from the mass was treated with PO Oxycodone with good effect.
Pt was managed conservatively with an NGT to suction, was kept NPO, and a PICC was placed and TPN administered to maintain nutrition pre-op.
The pt initially required multiple transfusions to increase her hct to > 30, which was Gyn/Onc's goal given anticipated blood loss in the OR.
Hyponatremia: This was felt to be [**1-17**] ARF + dehydration, and resolved with NS resuscitation.
The pt was then transferred to the gynecologic oncology service on [**12-28**] for an exploratory laparotomy, resection of pelvic mass, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lysis of adhesions.
CV:   The pt required aggressive fluid resuscitation intraoperatively.
She was extubated on POD#1 and was gradually weaned off of oxygen, requiring no supplemental O2 by POD#3.
Her Hct and INR were followed serially postoperatively, and she received an additional 3u pRBCs and 2u FFP in the ICU to maintain a Hct of 25 and a normal INR.
Her Hct remained stable at ~30 until POD#7 when it slowly drifted down over several days to a nadir of 26; she was transfused an additional 2u pRBCs to achieve a Hct of 30 in order to optimize her response to chemotherapy.
Her R nephrostomy tube continued to have a low output; her L nephrostomy tube was very productive, accounting for virtually her entire urine output.
ID: The pt was started on empiric coverage w/ Levaquin and Flagyl after her surgery.
Her NG tube was left in place postoperatively, and its output decreased to ~250cc in a day.
She had heparin and Pepcid in her TPN.
When the TPN was D/C'd, SC heparin and PO PPI were initiated.
Ovarian cancer:  Given the pt's diagnosis of unstaged clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, chemotherapy was initiated during the [**Hospital **] hospital stay.
On [**2182-1-8**], the pt underwent her first round of chemotherapy w/ carboplatin alone given concern for the increased toxicitiy of combined carboplatin w/ taxol.
The pt's CA125 level was checked on [**2182-1-25**] prior to her second round of chemotherapy and was found to be eleveated at 103 (increased from 72 on [**2182-12-13**]).
The pt underwent her second chemotherapy cycle on [**2182-1-30**] and was treated w/ both carboplatin and taxol given the pt's improvement in overall functional status.
Psych: Psych was consulted postoperatively given concern for the pt's episodic anxiety as well as depressive symptoms.
Psych felt that the pt's symptoms most closely resembled an adjustment disorder w/ depressive and anxious components, and recommended starting the pt on celexa as well as clonopin 1mg tid.
The pt was started on celexa w/o difficulty but was noted to be very somulent w/ the clonopin to the point where she slept all day and was not able to get out of bed.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] in 3 weeks for her 3rd chemotherapy cycle, as well as for a nephrostomy tube change on [**2-25**].
