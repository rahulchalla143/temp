He was initially treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with cefepime/azithromycin, switched to ceftriaxone after urine legionella negative.
Regarding right hilar mass, bronchoscopy postponed due to increasing oxygen requirement.
Per oncology consultation, concern for NSCLC vs SCLC vs post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.
Hospital course also complicated by hypercalcemia improved with IVF and pamidronate, delirium suspected secondary to infection/malignancy.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 36565**] is a 53 year old gentleman with Alport's Syndrome s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2147**], PPD+, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] [**2151**] who was admitted with respiratory distress in the setting of a new right hilar mass.
Patient was treated with 14 days of Vancomycin and Zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia (day 1 = [**2153-4-1**]).
He was weaned off of oxygen and was satting well on room air on discharge from the ICU [**2153-4-4**].
After bronchoscopy [**2153-4-5**] he again desaturated twice to O2 sats in the low 80s, but improved quickly and was able to be weaned off of oxygen quickly.
This was thought to be due to mucous plugging as his CXR was unchanged, so he was started on guaifenesin 1200mg [**Hospital1 **].
[**2153-4-9**] he had an increased oxygen requirement in the setting of aggressive fluids for hypercalcemia, and a CTA chest was done.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy by IP after he was ruled out for TB for which tissue from a cervical lymph node and brushings from the large mass were sampled.
He was initiated on XRT and transferred to the oncology service [**2153-4-10**].
Patient denied any pain, sob, chest pain, dizziness or LH.
Patient was then transferred to East ICU for further management.
In the ICU, pt was on NRB and had both audible and palpable rhonchi B/L.
Morphine gtt was initiated and pt passed comfortably at 0130 on [**4-16**] in the presence of his loved ones.
The cause of death was rapid respiratory compromise from a very aggressive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung, which may have been especially aggressive in the setting of pts post-transplant immunosuppression.
Patient was given pamidronate 45mg on [**2153-4-1**] at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.
He was treated with IVFs and lasix and his calcium improved to 10.3.
25-0H Vitamin D level was low, and 1,25-OH vitamin D levels were pending.
His hypercalcemia initially improved with IV fluids and lasix in the ICU, and was stable with PO intake on arrival to the floor [**2153-4-3**].
His calcium then trended up and he was restarted on IV fluids (NS 200cc/hr) with PRN lasix (typically 60-80mg IV total/day).
He was started on daily calcitonin [**4-7**] and pamidronate was re-dosed [**2153-4-8**].
# Altered Mental Status: Patient often with hallucinations in ICU.
Chronic kidney disease s/p cadaveric transplant: Patient was transplanted by [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2147**].
Renal transplant was consulted and followed pt in house.
They titrated his tacrolimus as needed to maintain therapeutic levels and continued mycophenolate and Bactrim ppx.
Medications on Admission: - Tacrolimus (Prograf) 2mg [**Hospital1 **] - Myfortic 180mg PO BID - Simvastatin 80mg PO daily - Bactrim DS 800-160 PO daily - Atenolol 50mg PO daily - Losartan 50mg PO daily - Norvasc 10mg PO daily - Flomax 0.4mg PO daily - Folic acid 1mg PO daily   Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory distress Right hilar mass Adenocarcinoma of the lung   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: expired  Followup Instructions: expired   Completed by:[**2153-4-17**
