She went urgently to the OR and underwent AVR tissue valve and replacement of the ascending aorta.
She was hemodynamically stable and weaned from vasoactive medications quickly, she was kept paralyzed and sedated because of the open chest.
Precedex was initially used to treat her anxiety, she has a significant pre-op history of anxiety and depression and was on Ativan and Elavil.
Precedex was eventually weaned and she was transitioned to Ativan and PRN Haldol.
She was very difficult to wean from the ventilator and she self extubated on POD #4 but was reintubated a few hours later due to respiratory distress and hypoxia.
Leukocytosis soon followed and a line tip grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] for which she was placed on course of Micafungin.
She was again extubated on [**1-28**] and continued with aggressive pulmonary management.
Oral care and humitification were maximized, no steroids were given.
She failed several of her speech and swallow exams and therefore tube feeds were continued.
She continue to be hyppertensive and meds were adjusted as needed.
She also had episodes of PAF and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin.
Her rhythm stabilized and she the Coumadin was discontinued.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complications.
[**Name (NI) 92172**] and Ativan were adjusted.
She was seen by ENT again for f/u examination and while her glottal edema had resolved she was noted to have a concerning amount of dessicated secrections on her vocal cords and was at a very high risk of obstructing her airway.
She was therefore emergently intubated on the floor and transferred to CVICU.

She was started on Colace tid to the effected ear for 3 days and was then irrigated afterwards.
