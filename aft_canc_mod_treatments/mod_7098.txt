A Swann-Ganz catheter was left in place.
Anasarca in the subcutaneous soft tissues, may be due to hypoalbuminemia.
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: A Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.
This is also consistent with decreased response to oxygen and nitric oxide on right heart pressure as measured by Swan-Ganz catheter.
She was stable on nasal cannula and transferred back to the floor for monitoring prior to discharge.
Newly diagnosed, with symptoms x 1 month, however RV dilation and hypertropy suggest longer chronicity.
Swan catheter placed in cath lab prior to arrival, with persistantly elevated PAP and no response to NO.
Initially diuresed with a lasix gtt and placed on a dobutamine gtt with overall improvement in cardiac function, however PAP remained elevated in the 80s/30s.
Sildennofil was started and goal dose of 20mg TID achieved within one day.
S/p antibiotic course for CAP.
Respiratory status improved with aggressive diuresis and maintained on daily lasix.
Persistant O2 sats in low 90s on NRB, and high 80s on NC but without subjective SOB.
Mild proteinuria and abnormal microscopy with RBCs and WBCs.
Albumin 3.6 (though 2.9 on admission).
Hypertension   At baseline takes nifedipine 30 mg CR and toprol XL 50 mg, held in setting of low BP.
Reviewed meds, and consulted Dermatology: Lasix and sildenafil unlikely offenders, but most likely is from contrast given pt's known history.
Written for medications as described in the medication list.
Desired rehabilitation and deferment of decision about Hospice.

This resulted in the determination of a new medication regimen that now includes sildenafil (Viagra) that acts to dilate and reduce pressure within lung blood vessels.
In the intensive care unit on these medications your breathing improved and you returned to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **].
There you were stable on about 6 liters of oxygen per minute delivered by nasal cannulae.
Please take your medications as directed: - We have added sildenafil (Viagra) and furosemide (Lasix) to your regimen - We have added some medications to help with the rash that you developed.
It will be very important that you come to the hospital if you contract the common cold or another illness, because your capacity to compensate for any worsening of your breathing will be very limited.
