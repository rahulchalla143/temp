Cholecystectomy clips and left upper abdominal curvilinear calcifications are better seen on today's exam.
Port cath tip growing MSSA.
# GPC/MSSA sepsis: Port is likely source of infxn given purulence when it was examined in ED; was improving initially after starting on vancomycin.
Transitioned to PO prednisone from stress-dose steroids on admission.
MSSA organism initially treated with vancomycin, now transitioned to IV Cefazolin 2g q12h per Infectious Disease consultant recommendation (increased from 1g IV).
The pt will continue IV cefazolin 2g IV q12h until seen by ID ([**2108-6-6**]) by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
She is to continue prednisone 5mg po bid until seen by her oncologist (see follow up appt).
Her stress dose steroids were tapered to po prednisone, and she will continue with 5mg po bid on discharge.
She will continue IV Cefazolin until seen by Infectious Disease as an outpt.
# Hypotension, resolved: At baseline, BP fluctuates given hx of Addison's.
However, considered other etiologies for hypotension - sepsis, adrenal insufficiency (s/p IV steroids tapered to po prednisone), cardiogenic given cad history (unlikely), hypovolemia/bleeding - hematocrit drop likely secondary to fluids.
BP increased during her admission so pt restarted on outpt BP regimen (ACEI, BB, [**Last Name (un) **]).
At discharge, her blood pressure was within the normal range on her antihypertensive regimen (atenolol, lisinopril and valsartan).
Her IV Cefazolin should be continued.
We continued her steroids, tapered down to 5mg po bid, and she will see her PCP or endocrinologist as an outpatient, where further steroid taper can be addressed.
She continued albuterol prn, cont steroids.

We continued to taper her prednisone dose while she was admitted.

# PVD/TIA-- continue aspirin .
# PPX: heparin sc, protonix with steroids, ISS .
