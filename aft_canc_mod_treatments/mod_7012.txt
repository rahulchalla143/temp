Secondary: Hypertension Diabetes mellitus, type 2 Hyperlipidemia Complete heart block status post pacemaker Bilateral adrenal adenomas Diverticulosis Antral polyps Cholelithiasis Status post right CFA pseudoaneurysm repair   Discharge Condition: Afebrile.
You underwent cardiac catheterization and were found to have narrowing in your coronary artery (LAD) at the place where you had a prior stent; a new stent was placed in this location.
After the procedure you developed trouble breathing related to fluid overload and required an overnight stay in the intensive care unit for dialysis.
Your dialysis schedule will be increased to 3 times per week according to your renal doctors.
The location of this heart dysfunction increases your risk of stroke and therefore starting a medication to thin your blood (coumadin) was discussed with you.
Please take all medications as prescribed 2gm sodium diet; fluid restriction 1500ml Measure weights daily, call your doctor if increase > 3 pounds New medications: Changed medications: Discontinued medications: .
You will go for hemodialysis tomorrow (Friday [**2144-12-4**]) at your regular outpatient dialysis center.
