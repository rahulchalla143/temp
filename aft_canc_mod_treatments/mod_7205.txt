The stent was removed with a snare and frank pus drrained from the ampulla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter and contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
A 8cm by 10mm covered wall stent biliary stent was placed successfully across the stricture into the proximal CBD over the guidewire.
Two plastic biliary stents were placed within the metallic biliary stent.
Biliary Drainage from [**Month/Day/Year **] (Final [**2149-5-25**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo woman w recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer thought to be metastatic to the liver s/p recent [**Month/Day/Year **] and placement of metal stent for enterococcal cholangitis complicated by septic shock who presented with fevers, increased WBC, RUQ pain, and jaundice along with a CT of the abdomen showing significant enlargement of CBD and intrahepatic biliary tree.
Throughout her stay, the patient experienced repeated episodes of cholangitis stemming from stent migration and compression from her known pancreatic mass.
A specific organism was not isolated on culture so she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
She eventually defervesced on this regimen and remained afebrile for 2 days on an oral regimen of levofloxacin, flagyl and fluconazole prior to discharge.
After multiple thoughtful discussions between the inpatient oncology team, GI oncology, [**Name (NI) **] and the patient, the patient decided that she would not want to undergo further procedures that were not likely to significantly lengthen the amount of quality time she would be able to spend at home.
As she was afebrile and pain free, she was discharged on levo, flagyl and fluconazole to be continued indefinately.
Consistent with the belief that these lesions were metastatic, the patient began to develop worsening liver function with INR [**3-4**] refractory to vitamin k repletion.
Given her elevated bili and worsening liver function, she was not a candidate for gemcitabine or alternative chemotherapy regimens.
She was instructed to continue vitamin K supplementation at home.
At discharge, she was instructed to continue fentanyl patch with PO dilaudid for breakthrough.
She was also given a script for morphine oral solution and anti-emetics should she develop worsening pain, the inability to take POs or nausea.
She was fluid restricted and placed on salt tabs with some improvement in her sodium.
Ranitidine and omeprazole were continued .
Nicotine patch was continued.
