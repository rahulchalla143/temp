HIV-1 Viral Load/Ultrasensitive (Final [**2180-3-13**]):       HIV-1 RNA is not detected.
This test is approved for monitoring HIV-1 viral load in known       HIV-positive patients.
In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at sometime       with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA antibodies.
Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
Patients       in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may not produce       detectable levels of antibody.
Patients with clinical history and/or       symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in [**2-16**] weeks.
Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
hemorrhage, rhabdomyolisis, ARF, transaminitis with a L parietal lesion on MRI representative on edema w/o [**Year/Month/Day **] enhancement.
Patient treated empirically with Acyclovir/CFTX/Vancomycin as per ID recommendation for possible coverage of HSV encephalitis (atypical presentation), possible meningitis and/or endocarditis with vancomycin.
Lyme serology and CSF were negative Olygoclonal bands were obtained with concern for atypical ADEM and were negative.
EEG was obtained and showed spikes nearly Q1-2mins w/o NCSE, thus patient was continued on Dilantin with goal of > 10 corrected for albumin, which was later changed to keppra which was continued as outpatient.
was treated with D5HCO3 and NS titrated to goal UOP of > 200cc/hr with aid of lasix.
He was empirically treated with IV ABx for etiologies concerning above, however no clear source was identified.
He was continued on oral antibiotics for total of 7 days for presumptiveaspiration pneumonia.
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Levofloxacin 250 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO Q24H (every 24 hours) for 3 days.
Metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) for 3 days.
You were evaluated by renal team, and treated with IV fluids with very good response.
You were found to have aspiration pneumonia for which you recieved/will be recieving antibiotics for total duration of 1 week.
You were started on a medicine called keppra for control of seizures which you will be taking even after discharge.
