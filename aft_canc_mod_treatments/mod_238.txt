Admission Date:  [**2197-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2144-10-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma stage II, status post radiation in [**2187**] who was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma with fine-needle aspiration in [**2196-6-6**] after CT scan revealed a right lung mass in the setting of elevated tumor marker with CEA up to 16.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was initially thought to have radiation-induced pneumonitis for which she was treated with steroids, but she also received Levaquin for presumptive pneumonia.
She has been on steroids for chemo-induced hemolytic anemia and radiation-induced pneumonitis.
She also received several transfusions for hemolytic anemia.
She was switched to Amphotericin B on [**2196-12-31**] secondary to failure to improve.
She was also started on triple regimen on [**2197-1-4**] for atypical Mycobacteria infection.
The triple regimen included Rifabutin, ethambutol, and Clarithromycin, but the CT scan showed progressive cavitary lesions in the upper right lower lobe and dense consolidation in the base of right lower lobe.
She was started on vancomycin on [**2196-12-31**] after acute aspiration episode but the vancomycin was discontinued on [**2197-1-2**].
In addition, she was also started on meropenem on [**2196-12-31**] for Enterobacter UTI.
Since her symptoms had no response to the broad antibiotic coverage and her cultures here remained unremarkable, triple antibiotics for atypical bacterial infection were discontinued and meropenem and the vancomycin were switched to levofloxacin and clindamycin to cover likely postobstructive pneumonia.
Amphotericin B was also switched to p.o.
After a long discussion between Infectious Disease, Pulmonary and Thoracic Surgery, the decision was made not to pursue open lung biopsy given her critical condition.
She was scheduled to go for a bronchoscopy on [**2197-1-20**] for both diagnostic biopsy and therapeutic stenting of the collapsed bronchial.
However, the patient continued to deteriorate and required pressors for blood pressure support.
