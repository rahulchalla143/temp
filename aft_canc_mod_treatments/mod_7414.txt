Recieved 1L NS, Tylenol 1gm, Levofloxacin 500mg IV, and Flagyl 500mg IV.
CTA showed PE and heparin gtt was started.
Was treated with cisplatin and etoposide x 2 cycles and repeat CT's showed overall large mass having shrunk in size, but increase in the number of pulmonary nodules.
She has recently decided to enroll in a clinical trial but has not yet started chemotherapy treatment.

She is on folic acid and received vitamin B12 shot last week in anticipation for starting therapy.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo F with Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) status post chemo and radiation who presented with worsening dyspnea and intermittent chest pain.
Malignant Effusion The IP team initially performed a thoracentesis that removed 1L of bloody fluid that was positive for malignant cells.
During the procedure it was noted that the pt had multiple loculated effusions and an irregular appearing pleural surface which would make it ineffective for successful pleurodesis to occur.
The procedure was complicated by a loculated hemothorax.
CT surgery was consulted and subsequently the patient underwent a VATS with removal of a large clot (coagulated blood from hemothorax), lysis of adhesions and placement of a chest tube and a Pleurex catheter.
The pt's oxygenation was noted to gradually improve but she was informed of the low likelihood of successful pleurodesis.
The chest tube was removed, and with the Pleurex catheter still in place, the pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **].
Pt subsequently had her Pleurex catheter drained twice while she was an inpatient, and was sent home with close follow up in CT [**Doctor First Name **] clinic for prn Pleurex catheter drainage as needed.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: The pt was noted to have a filling defect at an early bifurcation to the posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe on CTA on initial presentation.
The pt was treated with a heparin drip and was transitioned to Lovenox.
The consolidation/collapse could have represented atelectasis vs. post-obstructive pneumonia, and patient was placed on Levaquin/Flagyl for empiric post-obstructive PNA coverage.
ECHO dense pericardial effusion: The pt was noted to have a small, loculated (mostly anterior and medial) pericardial effusion.
No further intervention was undertaken.
The pt has been treated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (in medical oncology) with Cisplatin and Etoposide x 2 cycles and repeat CT's have shown an overall decrease in size of the mass, but increase in the number of pulmonary nodules.
She has recently decided to enroll in a clinical trial but has not yet started chemotherapy treatment.
This new regimen comprises of Alimta, bevacizumab, and oxaliplatin.
She was on folic acid and received vitamin B12 shot a week prior to admission, in anticipation for starting therapy.
