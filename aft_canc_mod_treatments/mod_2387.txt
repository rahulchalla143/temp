Admission Date:                   Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  UROLOGY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 39315**] is a 53-year-old gentleman who presented on [**2121-6-28**] for cystectomy and neobladder diversion.
Aspirin 250 mg q.d.
Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.
Levoxyl 300 mcg once a day 4.
Paxil 40 mg once a day 5.
Lipitor 20 once a day  ADMISSION LABS:  CBC of 9.3, 43.6, 252.
Liver enzymes:  ALT 23, AST 18, alkaline phosphatase 101, albumin 3.8, total protein 7.4.
Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated with a septic picture that deteriorated, requiring pressor agents.
The patient returned to the Operating Room on [**2121-7-8**] for an exploratory laparotomy and excision of an infarcted neobladder and resection of a nonviable segment of small bowel x2, creation of a jejunal conduit.
A left cutaneous ureterostomy was created.
Postop he had bilateral nephrostomies inserted and continued to have an extended stormy ICU course.
A tracheostomy was necessary because of hi need for prolonged ventilator support.
Bowel function gradually returned allowing for tube feedings.
Multiple courses of antibiotic therapy were given during his hospital stay.
NEUROLOGICALLY:  By system, neurologically the patient is status post a left internal capsule infarct with residual right sided weakness.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is status post myocardial infarction in [**2109**] and he did not have a myocardial infarction during the course of his stay in-house at the hospital and he was ruled out by enzymes with no acute electrocardiogram changes.
The patient is not on clonidine, nor is he on Lopressor currently and his pressure is tolerating, basically being on nothing.
The patient had been on pressors immediately because of sepsis which was weaned off slowly during the course of his stay.
He has not been on pressors for the previous month.
He is postoperative his three operations and has been slowly weaned down to a pressure support of 40 with a CPAP pressure support with 405 FIO2 with a PEEP of 5 and a pressure support of 5 with tidal volumes ranging from 550 to 650.
At that point, he had also been on antibiotics with this course.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient is not able to eat on his own and has a left Dobbhoff tube and is suffering from short--gut syndrome requiring B12 injections.
The patient is currently tolerating his tube feeds of Impact at goal rate of 90 cc an hour and is having some stool output.
The patient is receiving all his feeds through tube feeds and is not a candidate for a PEG given his previous abdominal surgery.
His right ureter is tied off secondary to the leak and he has a right nephrostomy tube which was changed on [**9-16**] as well as his left nephrostomy tube.
His ureterostomy tube on the left side was changed on [**9-18**].
The patient has a left nephrostomy tube in addition to the ureterostomy of the left side and does not have a Foley inserted into his neobladder obviously because of drainage from that point of view.
The patient basically had deep venous thromboses x4 and was started on a heparin drip continuously to resolve his deep venous thromboses and heparin drip was continued until Coumadin was started in the last two weeks of [**Month (only) **] prior to his discharge.
The patient is being discharged on Coumadin with the hope of achieving an INR of approximately 2 to 2.5.
The most recent INR was 1.3, came back on [**9-18**] and the patient continued to receive Coumadin until he reaches his goal without any heparin.
He was on triple antibiotics which were actually discontinued on [**2121-8-29**].
The patient was started immediately on vancomycin, Zosyn and fluconazole until cultures came back.
Blood cultures and catheter cultures came back revealing that the patient had been infected and was handling what was later decided was probably urosepsis for Klebsiella.
Based on this, the patient resumed a 10 day treatment cycle of Levaquin based on infectious disease's recommendation and the other antibiotics were stopped.
This is actually day 8 of 10 of his levofloxacin course and as of [**2121-9-19**] the patient will be receiving two more days of Levaquin.
The patient upon discharge is afebrile and his surveillance blood cultures have come back negative even though his nephrostomy tubes which were changed showed some fungal colonization growth.
During his stay, other cultures sent off included blood flowing through his catheter lines which were negative except for that one change which was required on [**9-8**] after he became febrile.
It is hoped that he will get a PICC line before he is discharged to rehabilitation today and his central line will be taken out.
Glutamine 5 mg p.o.
tube feeds to prevent excessive stool, secondary to short-gut.
Thyroxine 200 mcg p.o.
Vitamin C p.o.
Insulin sliding scale 2, 4, 6, 8 which is not being used much.
Paxil 20 mg nasogastric tube q.d.
Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenous to be continued for another two days hopefully.
Tincture of iodine 10 drops to every 500 cc of tube feeds.
He received 2.5 mg of Coumadin last night.
He has not received any recent Dilaudid or albuterol nebulizer treatment.
He is receiving KCL 40 mg intravenous prn for low potassium of less than 4, magnesium of 2 gm intravenous prn for less than 2.0 magnesium levels, last dose on [**9-18**], as was the last dose of potassium.
The patient has not been requiring any Ativan or Dilaudid or sedation as of recently.
On this date, [**9-19**], Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 39315**] is basically receiving in addition to just the glutamine 5 mg tube feeds, Synthroid which are outlined and he is also getting Protonix 40 mg intravenous q.d.
for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, as well as Coumadin to keep an INR of 2 to 2.4 for prophylaxis.
We also hope that he will eventually no longer require ventilatory support and a collar could be used on him as well as eventually assume breathing on room air.
Multiple postoperative complications, including intestinal perforation with peritonitis, neobladder infarction, sepsis, vascular instability with hypotension, DVT, and renal insufficiency.
