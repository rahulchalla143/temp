CT Surgery was consulted and it was felt that there was no indication for surgical intervention, recommended medical management only.
The patient was started on heart rate and blood pressure control with Nipride and Esmolol.
The patient lost intravenous access prior to initiation of these intravenous drips.
Before the central access was obtained, his heart rate increased to the hundreds and his systolic blood pressure into the 210s.
A right femoral central line and a right radial arterial line were placed without complication.
The patient at that point resumed on his intravenous blood pressure medications with a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to 120s and heart rate to the 70s.
Metastatic prostate cancer status post radiation therapy with radiation proctitis with resistance to androgen therapy.
Borderline hypercholesterolemia.
Glyburide 2.5 mg twice a day.
Hydrocortisone 20 mg q. a.m. and 10 mg q. p.m. 3.
Hytrin 5 mg twice a day.
Indomethacin 25 mg p.r.n.
Ketoconazole 400 mg twice a day.
Leuprolide 22.5 mg every ten weeks.
Zoledronic acid 4 mg every ten weeks.
ALLERGIES:   He has an allergy to Niferex which causes anaphylaxis and an allergy to ACE inhibitors which causes angioedema.
Repeat CK was 31 with troponin of 0.4.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was medically managed for his aortic dissection with blood pressure and heart rate control.
On transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's Esmolol drip was changed to Labetalol for dual blood pressure and heart rate control with titration and the patient was continued on Nitroprusside drip.
On the third hospital day, both the Nitroprusside and Labetalol drips were turned off secondary to low systolic blood pressure and heart rate.
anti-hypertensive regimen starting with p.o.
Labetalol at 200 mg p.o.
Hytrin was also started at 5 mg twice a day given the patient's history of benign prostatic hypertrophy as well as anti-hypertensive effect.
The patient's Labetalol was increased to 300 mg twice a day.
The Labetalol was discontinued and the patient was started on Metoprolol, initially at 25 mg p.o.
His Amlodipine was increased to 10 mg p.o.
The patient developed pain secondary to bladder irrigation and his systolic blood pressure would rise during his spastic pain episodes.
The Metoprolol was increased to 75 mg three times a day and the patient was given one dose of 5 mg of Metoprolol when his systolic blood pressure reached the 170s.
The patient was given Hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg q. day.
The patient also had Minoxidil at 10 mg twice a day added.
On the above medications, the patient had adequate blood pressure and heart rate control, however, his systolic blood pressure then began to fall; the patient was given repeated fluid boluses with minimal improvement.
His anti-hypertensive medications at that point were withheld and his blood pressure began to rise but still remained less than one systolic blood pressure of 130.
When the patient's blood pressure began to rise with clinical improvement of his sepsis, he was restarted on low dose Metoprolol and adjusted accordingly for elevation in his heart rate and systolic blood pressure.
q. day; Hytrin was started at 5 mg p.o.
The case was discussed with Cardiothoracic Surgery who recommended that the patient follow-up with CT scan in one month in order to evaluate.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he was found to have a fever, at which point he was pan cultured with chest x-ray.
The patient, at that point, was started on Vancomycin.
His right radial arterial line and right femoral lines were both pulled secondary to erythematous appearance and likely source of bacterial infection.
The patient was taken off of the Vancomycin and then started on Oxacillin intravenously.
He received two doses of intravenous Oxacillin prior to leaving the hospital, after which he was given a prescription for Dicloxacillin.
antibiotic therapy versus two weeks.
This was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia, but there was concern for renal artery ischemia secondary to presence of aortic dissection, decreasing renal clearance secondary to intravenous contrast dye insult.
The patient was given fluid boluses with minimal increase in his urine output.
The patient was given pre-hydration and post-hydration fluid given the second dye load.
The patient was started on Ditropan and morphine for pain.
Urology was consulted who recommended that a 20 French Foley be placed with continuous bladder irrigation, titrating to clear.
His bladder spasm symptoms resolved and his hematuria improved, but did not resolve.
The patient was continued on his Ketoconazole 400 mg twice a day for his prostate cancer therapy.
The patient was also given one dose of Leuprolide 2.5 mg given that it was the time for this dose.
He was placed on an insulin drip with titration to keep his blood sugars between 80 to 120.
He was weaned off the insulin drip and started on NPH at 35 units in the morning and 14 units at bedtime with regular insulin sliding scale adjustment according to fingersticks.
His NPH was withheld secondary to bouts of hypoglycemia during his sepsis because of somnolence and decreased p.o.
However, as the patient began to take in full p.o., his standing insulin doses were resumed.
Given that the patient left early, he was not able to be transitioned to an oral diabetic [**Doctor Last Name 360**], or taught how to administer insulin.
Therefore, he was instructed just to continue his outpatient dose of Glyburide 2.5 mg twice a day.
He was maintained on a bowel regimen during his hospital course secondary to his narcotics to avoid constipation.
He did not require supplemental oxygen.
Given the chest x-ray findings which were felt to be likely secondary to atelectasis, given that the crackles on his lung examination cleared with the coughing, the patient was started on incentive spirometry.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had a change in mental status during his sepsis.
It was felt that his increased somnolence was likely secondary to his infection as well as morphine administration secondary to pain.
The morphine was discontinued and the patient was given Tylenol only p.r.n.
The patient had an episode of agitation for which he was started on Zyprexa.
This was discontinued whenever patient returned to his baseline.
He had consistently low magnesium levels for which he was started on magnesium oxide standing at 800 mg p.o.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on Protonix and Pneumo boots throughout his hospital course.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   He was given prescriptions for the following medications: 1.
Metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o.
Amlodipine 10 mg p.o.

Hytrin 5 mg twice a day.
Ketoconazole 400 mg twice a day.
