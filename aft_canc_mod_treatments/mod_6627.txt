This continued for nearly two weeks in trying to decide the patient's disposition and whether the need for anticoagulation was a clear benefit to the patient.
It was ultimately decided by the patient, health care proxy, and team that the patient would continue anti-coagulation with lovenox.
He was placed on a tight fluid restriction, given salt tablets, and given a one time dose of lasix, which improved his sodium.
Once the heparin gtt was discontinued (which contained D5W) his sodium markedly improved to normal range.
His fluid restriction was lessened to 2 liters per day and his salt tablets were discontinued.
