#Agitation: Delirium was initially thought to be due to large amount of narcotics that patient was recieving in ICU and patient was started on haldol.
On the oncology floor, the haldol was initially stopped and the pain regimen was modified but the patient continued to have agitation and restlessness.
The patient's agitation/restlessness tended to improve greatly with prn pain medications and/or suctioning.
He was started on prn olanzapine for agitation as well.
Our recommendation is to avoid restraints, hold vitals overnight, provide a bed next to a window if at all possible, use pain medications and suctioning as first line treatment for agitation and to use olanzapine as back-up.
His pain was managed with a fentanyl patch and SL morphine.

A doboff was placed but he pulled it out and the decision was made in conjuction with the family not to pursue another doboff.
He failed repeat speech and swallow including video swallow study, which was attributed more to post-op changes/neck swelling rather than mental status.
