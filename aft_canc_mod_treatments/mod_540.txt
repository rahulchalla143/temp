She underwent rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and balloon dilatation on [**2175-9-12**] that was complicated by post-procedure hypoxemia requiring intubation in the OR.
She was then transferred to the T-SICU, requiring small amounts of pressors felt to be related to the use of anesthesia and sedatives.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed on [**9-13**] to remove clot and continue debridement with argon plasma coagulation laser that resulted in opening the left mainstem with a residual 50% airway obstruction.
An endobronchial stent placement was attempted but was removed after noting it did not seat well within the airway without obstructing the left lower lobe.
She initially failed spontaneous breathing trials for hypoxemia, however on [**9-16**], she performed well on pressure support trials and was then extubated in the early afternoon of [**9-16**].
She developed hypoxemic respiratory distress and stridor in the first 30 minutes following extubation, that was not responsive to bronchodilators, racemic epinephrine, Heliox, or a dose of IV steroids.
Several attempts to intubate by the senior staff were unsuccessful, using traditional blades, bronchoscopic-guided intubation, and a Glide-Scope.
After nearly 30 minutes of attempts and worsening hypoxemia, the patient underwent an emergency cricothyroidotomy by the surgical service with stabilization of the airway and a slow return to normoxemia on 100% FiO2.
In detailed discussion between the health care proxy and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], it was learned that the patient would never want a tracheostomy for any reason.
The need to convert to a proper surgical tracheostomy was therefore declined.
She was then transitioned to IV morphine for comfort, expiring within hours of terminal extubation.
