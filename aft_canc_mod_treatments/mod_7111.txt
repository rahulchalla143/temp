Admission Date:  [**2126-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-8-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-3-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: E-Mycin / Penicillins / Chlorpromazine Hcl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**] Chief Complaint: Vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion and removal of Mirena IUD, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophrectomy   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 107101**] is a 49-year-old gravida 0 woman who reports a long history of worsening irregular menstrual cycles.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  [**Known firstname **] has a number of medical problems including schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, tobacco abuse, sleep apnea, morbid obesity, and now the endometrial cancer.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had eye surgery in [**2104**].
CXR [**8-13**] The ET tube tip is 3.3 cm above the carina.
Heart size is still enlarged, could be in part due to patient position and AP technique.
Incentive spirometry was given to the patient, but despite this, her oxygen saturation remained low.
There was a concern for the possibility of an inability to wean the ventilator upon completion of surgery and again the possibility of pulmonary issues postoperatively.
As it was not initially clear when the procedure could be rescheduled, the patient was consented for and underwent placement of a Mirena IUD.
The Mirena IUD has been shown to be somewhat effective in treating some endometrial cancers, but in this case, it is more of a temporizing [**Doctor Last Name 360**] given her significant vaginal bleeding.
She was given a nicotine patch and a pulmonology consultation was obtained.
Her medications were optimized, with the addition of a course of steroids and 7 days of levoquin, which she completed.
Actos was discontinued and lantus was added, along with a more aggressive insulin sliding scale.
She was maintained on her bi-pap overnight.
Her levoquin was d/c'd following the surgery, but prednisone was continued until tapering was started on the day of discharge.
She also received scheduled albuterol and atrovent nebulizer treatments.
The team felt that she was likely difficult to arouse at baseline secondary to her lung disease and that the combination of narcotics, psychiatric medications, and benzodiazapenes were contributing.
Holding parameters for these medications (including no benzos/narcotics after 6pm) were applied.
*) EKG changes: An EKG obtained during an episode of sedation revealed T wave changes.
She was maintained on telemetry and had multiple episodes of sinus arrhythmia, but the character of such was deemed overall benign by the medicine consultants.
*) T2DM: The [**Last Name (un) **] service continued to follow this patient and insulin regimen was adjusted prn.
She will continue metformin, lantus insulin, and sliding scale insulin on discharge, but should not be restarted on actos.
*) Psych: She was maintained on her home medications.
These medications do likely contribute to her somnolence and prn medications were held for sedation.
The patient was discharged on HD#13/POD#7 for transfer to a rehabilitation facility.
