ET tube 6 cm above carina.
Endogastric tube side port just at the GE junction, would recommend advancing approximately 5 more cm to ensure that it is within the stomach.
Rigid bronch report ([**2111-12-12**]): Once the patient was relaxed, the rigid bronchoscope was introduced into the oral cavity and followed along the double lumen endotracheal tube until the cords were visualized.
A Cook catheter was introduced through the rigid scope.
The rigid was removed and a single lumen a tracheal tube introduced via direct visualization by Anesthesia.
The tube was then confirmed to be approximately 2 cm above the carina via bronchoscopy.
The procedure was ended with no complications.
Brief Hospital Course: -please check CBC and CHEM 7 in 1 week to monitor for resolution of isolated thrombocytosis, check renal function, potassium after starting ACE-i .
# Hemoptysis: Resolved s/p right bronchial artery embolization.
Initially unclear etiology, with broad differential including bleeding in setting of bronchiectasis on dabigatran and overlying infection.
On admission to the MICU was s/p bronch demonstrating large clot in RLL with oozing.
Double lumen endotracheal tube was in place to protect the left lung from future bleeding and underwent emergent IR bronchial artery embolization of right bronchial artery embolization using 300-500 mic embospheres -> enlarged hypertrophic arteries suggestive of bleeding.
Her hematocrits remained stable and after consultation with her PCP it was decided that she would no longer be an anticoagulation candidate but could be restarted on asprin 325mg daily for stroke prevention in setting of AFib with recent TIAs.
Intitially was intubated in the setting of hemoptysis however once bleeding resolved she continued to have RLL collapse on XRay concerning for another process.
She was treated with Vanc and Zosyn until sputum and BAL cultures grew out two strains GNRS and antibiotics were broadened to Tobramycin.
When speciation and sensitivities grew out two strains of pseudomonas antibiotics were weaned to Zosyn.
She had a difficult time weaning from the vent and diuresis was initiated in the hope of improving her respiratory status.
She was successfully extubated on [**2111-12-20**] and weaned to baseline O2 requirement without issues.
Patient with history of cerebral bleed on coumadin and TIA without anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation was held in the setting of hemoptysis and as above after consultation with her PCP she was restarted only on Aspirin 325mg daily for CVA ppx.
Metoprolol titrated up to 150mg daily for improved rate control.
# Diarrhea: In setting of tube feeds via NGT while patient was being cleared by speech and swallow.
Resolved after stopping tube feed.
Patient was on atorvastatin 80mg as an inpatient, but switched to simvastatin 40mg on discharge in light of LDL of 119, lisinopril 5mg for improved BP control, cardiac/renal protection.
She was continued on home nebulizers.
Metoprolol and diltiazem were later restarted.
Metoprolol increased as above, started lisinopril 5mg daily.
Home demeclocycline briefly held in ICU, but then continued.
