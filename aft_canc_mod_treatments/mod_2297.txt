# Pyriform sinus squamous cell carcinoma: # Stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the right piriform sinus: S/p Cycle 2 of TPF (taxotere, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**5-30**].
He required special preparations of his 5-FU with normal saline, not D5W given his hyponatremia.
Discontinued dexamethasone 2 days early given steroid psychosis.
The patient was discharged with antibiotic prophylaxis (Cipro) as well as Emend.
# Hyponatremia: The patient has a long history of hyponatremia which has been extensively evaluated by renal and found to be consistent with SIADH with unclear underlying cause, possibly due to his malignancy and worsened in the past (and this admission) with chemotherapy session.
During his last admission, he was treated with lasix, salt tabs, and fluid restriction.
He was once again treated with Lasix, salt tabs, and fluid restriction (although patient occasionally found drinking fluids in the nutrition room with question of ability to comply).
Given his recent chemotherapy, as well as current bandemia, chills, and cough with RLL crackles, he was given azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl in the ED.
This regimen was changed to cefepime and azithromycin in the ICU.
After monitoring the patient overnight, it was felt that pneumonia was very unlikely, and antibiotics were stopped.
# Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial from hyponatremia and possibly toxicity from his chemotherapy may be contributing.
It was later felt, also, once the patient started his next cycle of chemotherapy that the steroids (dexamethasone) made him emotionally labile, alternatively frustrated, anxious, tearful.
He was started on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI with improvmenet in his symptoms.
# HTN: His home atenolol was held given hypotension.
