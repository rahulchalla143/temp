Biopsy not done due to need for anticoagulation for acute stage of PE.
She was seen in oncology clinic today and was felt to not be a candidate for chemotherapy given her low performance status.
She was noted to be sob in clinic and was admitted for further evaluation.
She felt OK initially and using supplemental oxygen intermittently.
She has been taking all of her medications and her last INR was 2.5 2 days prior, and notably has never been subtherapeutic since starting this coumadin.

She has been independent with her ADLs until recently including cooking and grocery shopping.
Since the patient was continuing to develop thrombus in the setting of a therapeutic INR, it was felt an IVC filter should be initiated immediately.
The patient was started on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] and tolerated the procedure well.
She was tachypneic and required 6L NC to maintain sats.
A CXR revealed progressive accumulation of effusion and she requires a thoracentesis which drained 1.2 Liters of transudative effusion.
She was continued on Lovenox with an IVC filter.
Pleurex catheter placement was considered for a subsequent right-sided pleural effusion but it was felt there was not enough pleural fluid to warrant placement.
She was also diuresed after returning to the floor with Lasix and her SOB improved, although oxygenation remained stable.
Sphincterotomy performed as well as a stent placement in the common bile duct.
She was not felt to be a candidate at this time for chemotherapy given her respiratory status and overall weakness.
She was discharged to rehab with plans to readdress goals of care and chemotherapy in 2 weeks with her primary oncologists.
