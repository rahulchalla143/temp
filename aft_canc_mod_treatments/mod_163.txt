Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7509**] is an 81 year old male with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
# Respiratory failure: Patient required intubation in the ED on [**4-21**] for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Etiology felt likely combination of IVF resuscitation in the setting of CHF, afib with RVR, likely PE and profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to compensate for (initial pH on arrival to the ICU 7.16).
The patient was gradually weaned to pressure support and successfully extubated on [**4-30**].
Patient required levophed for several days which was eventually weaned off when he was receiving ABX and rate control.
Although the patient may have had a component of cardiogenic shock, he did not much benefit from a diltiazem gtt or metoprolol PO/IV.
The patient was initially rate controlled on a diltiazem drip.
His home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension while requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
He was transfused 2 u pRBCs on [**4-26**] per Cardiology who felt the patient was intravascularly volume depleted, and started on amiodarone.
After his blood pressure stabilized, he was restarted on metoprolol which was uptitrated from 12.5 TID to 50 TID.
The rehab center should continue to titrate metoprolol as his blood pressure will tolerate for a goal rate of 70s.
He was discharged on amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 **], and follow up with cardiology was arranged.
Initial fever on presentation may have represented worsening of this process vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious process.
The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn on [**4-22**] for his initial decompensation.
He was started on fluconazole for his positive beta-glucan on [**4-27**].
He was C.diff neg x 2, and had no residuals with tube feeds that were initiated per surgery recommendations.
Renal did not feel that lasix was indicated and felt that the patient's sodium should be managed with free water.
At the time of transfer to the floor the patient had an excellent urine output off all diuretics and his creatinine had improved markedly.
Warfarin was increased to 2.5 daily but the patient then became supratherapeutic (3.6 to 4.8 to 4.0 on the day of discharge).
Warfarin has been held since Monday [**5-2**].
At [**Hospital 100**] rehab they will continue to monitor INR, and restart warfarin as indicated.
Patient will require lifelong anticoagulation.
# Pancreatic mass: Followed as an outpatient and appears to have been stable on repeat imaging.
