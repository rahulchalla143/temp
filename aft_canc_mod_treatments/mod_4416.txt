Past Medical History: - "lazy eye" - s/p Pneumovax, a meningococcal vaccine, flu shot in fall [**2149**]   Social History: Non-smoker; previously drank alcohol socially, however has not been drinking since [**52**]/[**2149**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old gentleman with history Myelofibrosis who had a long and complicated hospital course including a failed allogenic stem cell transplant from his brother and then a failed double cord transplant on [**4-21**].
# Myelofibrosis s/p Failed Allo Stem Cell Transplant s/p Double Cord Transplant - Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for allogenic stem cell transplant for treatment of his myelofibrosis.
On admission, he had a tunneled catheter placed by interventional radiology.
He received ablative therapy with Fludarabine, ATG and Busulfan.
He recieved his stem cell transplant without complication.
Prophylactic acyclovir, fluconazole and cipro were started per protocol as well as cyclosporine.
He was then initiated on splenic radiation therapy on [**3-19**] in the hope of aiding engraftment.
After transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-19**], the patient was given a 2 cord stem cell transplant on [**4-21**] without complication, while intubated for fluid overload.
Due to renal toxicity of cyclosporine, patient was maintained on IV methylprednisolone [**Hospital1 **] dosing in addition to his mycophenolate mofetil.
He ultimately died from spesis with DIC.
# Neutropenic fever/sepsis: The patient experienced several episodes of neutropenic fever, first on [**2-20**] at which time he was placed on Cefepime and Vancomycin.
Acyclovir was initiated at the time of admission, but was held when his Cr rose above 1.5.
ID was consulted and per their recommendations, his antibiotics were broadened to Daptomycin, Meropenem, Voriconazole, & Flagyl.
An infectious work-up was negative and the patient never exhibited hemodynamic instability.
In the context of low cell counts, the Infectious disease team later review the patient's medications and recommended discontinuing his Flagyl and switching his Meropenem to Ciprofloxacin to prevent any medication driven reduction in his cell counts.
His antibiotics were changed per ID recommendations several times during his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, and he returned to the BMT service on [**4-26**] on acyclovir, atovaquone, cefepime, micafungin, and vancomycin.
He was started on Ambisome on [**5-8**] for positive yeast culture in blood and urine.
He had Hickman cath removed on [**5-9**] by IR.
On [**2151-5-10**] changed micafungin to voriconazole.
ID was consulted overnight and his antibiotics were broadedned.
A central line and arterial line were placed and he was started on pressors.
He had developed acute on chronic renal failure, lactic acidosis of 11.7, acidemia with pH 6.95 and was intubated for a respiratory rate near the 40s.
A catheter was placed for HD.
However, the following morning, his family decided to change his goals of care to comfort measures only.
All medications were stopped.
A Vancomycin trough was found to be elevated to 40.6 in conjunction with the patient's Cyclosporine.
At that time, the patient was given a dose of Lasix & a single dose of Acyclovir and his Cr began to rise again reaching a peak of 2.3.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the cyclosporine was stopped, patient's renal function continued to worsen and he was briefly placed on CVVH, to facilitate handling the fluid boluses he was receiving with antibiotics and stem cell transplant and to help diurese him in the setting of acute systolic CHF.
Patient was started on IV methylprednisolone dosing [**Hospital1 **] instead of cyclosporine to avoid further cyclosporine toxicity.
# GI bleed: One week after transplant, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an acute drop in hematocrit.
He was placed on IV PPI, transfused 2 units PRBCs and continued on fluids.
Stool was documented as gauiac negative and hematocrit stabilized, and an IV PPI was discontinued.
Of note, patient received >50 units of pRBCs and >80 units of platelets during this hospitalization.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended aggressive IV diuresis and beta blockade, as well as holding ace inhibitors, given acute kidney injury.
Because he could not undergo paracentesis in the setting of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, patient was given furosemide one-time doses to attempt diuresis.
# Abdominal Pain: Patient was started on oxycontin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] due to chronic pain from myelofibrosis.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress [**4-19**], his pain medications were held, given his respiratory status.
Following extubation, he was complaining of significant epigastric abdominal pain, and was given PRN doses of IV dilaudid.
Following transfer back to the BMT service, his pain was controlled with a morphine PCA pump.
Because patient could not undergo therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis in setting of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, slow diuresis was attempted with furosemide prn doses.
