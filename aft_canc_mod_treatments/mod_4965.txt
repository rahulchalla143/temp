He was prescribed an antibiotic on [**2147-7-8**] and took it for several days, but did not improve.
He returned to his PCP who prescribed Clindamycin and steroids.
ROS: Endorses fever and loose stools, but denies chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
Past Medical History: Appendectomy [**2142**] (complicated by ruptured appendix) Knee surgery on R & L knees .
[**2147-7-28**]: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
White cells predominantly consist of large immature forms with moderate basophilic cytoplasm occasional vacuoles, [**Doctor Last Name **] chromatin and prominent nucleoli suggestive of immature monocytic precursors.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and exhibits near total replacement by blasts and promonocytes.
Occasional maturing normal hematopoietic elements including maturing myeloids, rare erythroids and megakaryocytes are seen.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD15, CD117, CD11c, CD64, CD56, CD71, lymphoid associated antigen CD7, are CD10 (cALLa) negative, and are negative for CD5, CD19, CD20, CD3, CD13, CD14, CD41, Glycophorin A.
[**2147-8-10**]: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
DIAGNOSIS: MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW CONSISTENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY INDUCED ABLATION.
A limited 50 cell differential was performed.
The overall cellularity is <5% and comprised predominantly of lymphocytes and plasma cells.
[**2147-8-17**]: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS:     Hypercellular bone marrow with maturing erythroid-dominant trilineage hematopoiesis     5% blasts highlighted by CD34, see note.
Glycophorin highlights all the red cell precursors as sheets and large aggregates, including the atypical blast-like cells.
Erythrocytes are decreased and show mild poikilocytosis with occasional microcytes, dacrocytes, rare spherocytes and nucleated red cells seen.
Erythroid precursors are relatively increased and exhibit normoblastic maturation.
Marrow clot section is not submitted.
# AML, monocytic type: He initially presented with leukocytosis from OSH and a 2 week history of enlarged tonsils treated with Clindamycin for possible pharyngeal abscess.
He was started on Hydrea and hydration on the evening of [**2147-7-27**], which brought his white count down.
He was evaluated by ENT who did not see any drainable abscess, but started him on Dexamethasone and he was transferred to the ICU for airway management.
He was also started empirically on Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Meropenem for possible infectious causes of airway narrowing.
He required desensitization for Meropenem given his history of penicillin allergy.
Prior to ICU placement, he was started on 7+3 induction chemotherapy on [**2147-7-28**].
He improved on Dexamethasone and no intubation was required.
In terms of his ongoing AML management he had started his 7+3 regimen and was on day 4 of his chemotherapy with Cytarabine/Anthracycline when he was sent to the ICU for the 2nd time.
During this time, he required several bags of cryo, platelets, and PRBC transfusions.
He returned to floors on [**2147-8-1**] on a steroid taper.
He finished his 7+3 induction, and repeat bone marrow biopsy on day 14 showed a markedly hypocellular bone marrow consistent with chemotherapy induced ablation and no features of involvement by acute leukemia.
He required several platelet transfusions and PRBC transfusions throughout this time due to his pancytopenia.
Concern for returning leukemia prompted a day 21 ([**2147-8-17**]) bone marrow biopsy which showed hypercellular marrow with maturing erythroid-dominant trilineage hematopoiesis and 5% blasts highlighted by CD34.
He received several transfusions of cryo and platelets.
# Tonsillar Enlargement: The patient came in after recently completing a course of clindamycin for a possible pharyngeal infection.
With his development of worsening pharyngeal edema on [**2147-7-28**], he was started empirically on Vancomycin and Aztreonam, with later addition of Clindamycin.
ID was consulted, and Meropenem was started with desensitization in the MICU given his history of Penicillin allergy.
He was given Dexamethasone which improved his swelling.
Steroids were stopped briefly and the he required readmission to the MICU for airway monitoring.
Clindaymcin and Aztreonam were stopped, and he was continued on Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Micafungin for the duration of his chemotherapy induced neutropenia.
The antibiotics were discontinued as his white count recovered.
Medications on Admission: Recently on Clindamycin and steroids.
Acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours).
You were given chemotherapy medications in order to treat the leukemia, and bone marrow biopsies were performed in order to evaluate your response to the chemotherapy.
For part of your hospital stay, you were sent to the Intensive Care Unit for part due to swelling in your throat and concern that your airway could become obstructed.
You were treated with IV antibiotics and this improved over time.
You were kept on a regimen of several strong antibiotics during most of your stay.
After discharge, you should continue taking Acyclovir for prophylaxis  Followup Instructions: A followup appointment has been scheduled with your Oncologist, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**], for [**2147-8-28**] at 10:00AM.
