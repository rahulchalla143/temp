Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 64 year-old female with a PMHx sx for open ASD repair c/b sternal wound infection and post-operative AF who was initially admitted through the ED with SOB and back pain, with CTA in the ED demonstrating diffuse LAD and post-obstructive PNA concerning for malignancy.
#) Post Obstructive PNA - The patient was treated with a 2 week course of vancomycin and zosyn to cover for hospital acquired organisms, which ended on [**2-26**].
Oncology was consulted for further recommendations on workup/ management.
The patient underwent palliative XRT for an 11-session course.
She also initiated [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol therapy on [**2-23**].
300 and was started on Neupogen 300 sc daily until [**3-5**].
The patient will follow-up in clinic for restaging and further discussion of chemotherapy regimen in 2 weeks.
This was controlled initially in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and the patient was then transferred to the floor on metoprolol 50 mg tid.
While on the floor, she had a bronchoscopy performed which showed external compression of her left mainstem bronchus, and she had a biopsy/FNA performed, which showed large cell carcinoma.
She was then readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with atrial fibrillation with HR 130s, and was started on a diltiazem gtt.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was started on po diltiazem, which was rapidly uptitrated to 60 mg qid with good effect.
She was briefly called out, but developed HR 160s, w/EKG c/w AF with RVR, for which she received metoprolol 5 mg IV x2, followed by diltiazem 10 mg IV x2 without conversion.
She was put back on a dilt gtt, and shortly thereafter an amiodarone gtt was begun with plan to continue with po load.
She was put on po metoprolol and po diltiazem which was aggressively uptitrated with good effect.
However, she experienced an acute respiratory decompensation which precluded her from taking her po medications, and in that setting experienced RVR to the 140-150s again.
The patient was again transferred to the floor on regimen of diltiazem 120mg q8h and metoprolol 100mg po tid, where she remained somewhat tachycardic.
Her blood pressure was low-normal on this regimen (90s-100s/ 50s-60s), so she was started on digoxin 0.0625mg for additional HR control with good effect (HR ~ 100 by time of discharge).
Anticoagulation was not pursued as the patient has a high risk of bleeding given large tumor burden and a CHADS score of 0. .
# Hypoxia - The patient began to suffer worsening oxygenation with desaturations on [**2-23**].
She required BiPaP for an ABG which showed hypercarbia to 60.
Low suspicion for PE given that she was on a heparin gtt for afib at that time.
She was also treated for a COPD exacerbation, including nebs and incidental administration of high dose steroids (from chemotherapy for nausea ppx) without much success.
Her code status was briefly changed from DNR/DNI to focus on comfort measures, but this was reversed as the patient spontaneously had a return in mental status towards baseline and an improvement in O2 saturations.
# C diff colitis - The patient was continued on po vanc for an additional 2 weeks after resolution of broad spectrum treatment for post-obstructive PNA.
She treated with a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and H2 blocker with magic mouthwash before meals.
Low dose dexamethasone may be started if symptoms persist.
The aptient was continued on magic mouthwash and liquid oxycodone prior to meals.
PO meds were changed to liquid when possible.
