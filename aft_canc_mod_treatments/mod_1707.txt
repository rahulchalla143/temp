Brief Hospital Course: The patient had an open right colectomy for her colon mass.
The patient was baseline anemic from her colon cancer, and she had an expected drop in her Hct with the addition of IVF resuscitation.
She received nebulized ipratropium and xopenex, with little improvement.
Diuresis was initiated with lasix, and she put out about 450cc in about the first hour.
NEURO/PAIN: Immediately post-operatively, the patient had an auto-infusing bupivicaine pump at her incision.
She was also was maintained on IV pain medication until she was able to tolerate PO pain medication.
For a short period of time after intubation on POD#1, the patient required phenylephrine for blood pressure support, but this was discontinued the same night.
Medicine consulted, and she was eventually well-rate-controlled (HR 70s-90s, with only occasional few-second periods of tachycardia) on PO metoprolol and diltiazem.
The patient should follow up with her PCP regarding future management of her metoprolol and diltiazem, as well as for further consideration of anticoagulation.
Following her second extubation, she had no further respiratory issues and saturated adequately on room air.
After being NPO during her ICU stay, she was gradually advanced as her bowel function returned.
She received electrolyte repletion as needed.
A Foley catheter had been placed intra-operatively and removed on POD#4, and she voided well.
Her Hct increased appropriately, and she required no further transfusions.
She was started on cefazolin and flagyl.
As her cultures were found to grow back group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, her antibiotics were changed to unasyn on POD#3, and then to augmentin on POD#4 when she was taking PO medications.
She will complete a 7-day course of augmentin (5 more days).
PROPHYLAXIS: This was maintained with subcutaneous heparin, aspirin when she developed elevated troponin, pneumatic boots, and ambulation when safe and cleared by PT.
On the day of discharge, the patient was discharged to a rehab facility, as recommended by PT.
