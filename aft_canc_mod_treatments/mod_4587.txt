Consider Infectious          Disease consultation for serious infections caused by          ESBL-producing species.
At this time, to provide continued hemostasis and re-establish biliary drainage, a fully covered WallFlex Biliary metal stent 10mm x 80mm was placed in the bile duct extending down from the left side of the hilar bifurcation.
