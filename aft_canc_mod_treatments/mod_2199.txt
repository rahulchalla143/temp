Admission Date:  [**2115-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-7-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for stenting of right mainstem bronchus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Bronchoscopy with bronchial stent removal.
History of Present Illness: 80 yo man w/ h/o Stage 3B lung cancer (s/p chemo, XRT, and stent placement [**5-12**]), COPD on home O2, CAD (multivessel disease and 80% LM stenosis), A fib, and LLE DVT who presents from OSH with obstructed right sided bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonia for possible stenting.
On transfer to the MICU, the patient was hypotensive to the 70's systolic which responded to IV fluid bolus.
Cardiology was consulted regarding his ST elevations and recommended medical management with addition of plavix for his left main disease.
Eventually, the patient was also started on low dose metoprolol and captopril after his blood pressure stabilized.
He was hemodynamically stable on arrival, and denied CP, SOB, abdominal pain, headache, or dizziness.
He was started on Vanco and Zosyn for treatment of pneumonia.
Chest CT the following day revealed bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), complete RUL/RML/RLL collapse with apparent obstruction of the bronchial stent within the right main stem bronchus.
Past Medical History: - Stage 3B Lung Cancer: dx [**2114-10-8**]; s/p 8 courses of chemo; s/p XRT; s/p stent in right bronchus [**5-12**]; s/p 5 therapeutic bronchoscopies (for reocclusion of stent) - COPD on home O2 - CAD: s/p cath [**2114-11-22**] showing multivessel disease, LM 80% - A FIB: started on digoxin 3 weeks prior to admission - s/p LLE DVT: [**2109**] and [**2114-12-8**] (s/p hernia repair); treated with coumadin and plavix in the past - s/p CVA x 2 - s/p hernia repair - s/p left eye surgery for ptosis (3.5 yrs ago) - s/p cataract surgery  Social History: Lives at home with his wife.
Family History: CAD CVA - sister and father [**Name (NI) **] cancer - brother (smoker)   Physical Exam: 98.4 - 112 - 95/44 - 13 - 99% (AC: 500/14/5/0.35); 79 kg Gen: Elderly man, intubated, awake and alert, appears comfortable HEENT: ETT in place, PERRL, anicteric, bilateral corneal arcus, +left ptosis, MMM Neck: right IJ in place, supple, no LAD, no JVD Lungs: course breath sounds, CTA on the left, decreased breath sounds on the right, no w/r/r Heart: irreg irreg, distant HS, no M/R/G Abd: NABS, soft, NT, ND, no palpable masses Ext: warm, dry, [**12-9**]+ pitting edema Neuro: CN II-XII intact with exception of mild left facial droop Rectal: guaiac negative brown stool   Pertinent Results: OSH LABS: WBC=5.0; Hct=23.8; plts=154 Na=135; K=4.0; Cl=110; CO2=22; BUN=9; Cr=0.8; glucose=163 INR=1.0 ABG = 7.44/31/87 CK = 30-->26-->25; CKMB = 4.3-->4.6-->3.9; Trop 0.45-->0.88-->0.64 .
2) Complete collapse of the RUL, RLL, and RML with apparent obstruction of bronchial stent within the right main stem bronchus and soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess likely representing patient's known lung cancer.
LABS ON ADMISSION TO [**Hospital1 18**]: [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   WBC-6.4 RBC-3.33*# HGB-9.7*# HCT-29.3*# MCV-88 MCH-29.3 MCHC-33.2 RDW-16.9* [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   PLT COUNT-164 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   PT-13.0 PTT-30.2 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   GLUCOSE-94 UREA N-9 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-109* TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-12 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   ALT(SGPT)-9 AST(SGOT)-15 ALK PHOS-52 TOT BILI-0.4 [**2115-7-2**] 11:09PM   CALCIUM-7.7* PHOSPHATE-2.5* MAGNESIUM-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: Pt bronched [**7-3**], showing right main bronchus stent frayed at distal end, blocking RUL and with thick secretions distally.
~20 min after dopamine started, patient went into RVR.
At this point, patient underwent synchronized cardioversion (200 and then 300 joules), did not convert to NSR, but rate became more controlled in low 100's.
Levophed started for BP control, subsequently weaned off [**7-4**], converted to NS on amiodarone drip.
Pt never weaned off mechanical ventilation through his hospital course.
The outcome of this was that pt would remain intubated but would also still be DNR and would be given no escalation in care including pressors or antiarrhythmics.
Unfortunately the patient was never sufficiently hemodynamically stable that this procedure could safely be performed.
It was explained that tracheostomy was not possible to perform safely and that the patient would probably spend the remainder of his days in the hospital.
In summary Mr [**Known lastname 24642**], is an 80 year-old gentleman with a history of stage 3b terminal lung cancer, atrial fibrillation and severe coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requring intubation that was secondary to total R bronchial obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia.
It became clear that efforts to treat his disease proved futile in the setting of his terminal disease, and eventually the patient placed in comfort measure only care and passed away.
