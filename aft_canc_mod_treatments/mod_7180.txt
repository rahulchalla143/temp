She states that she is to have an interventional procedure on Monday at [**Hospital1 112**] for on her vocal cords.
She recently completed course of antibiotics (levo/clinda, finished the day prior to admission) for aspiration pneumonia from her previous admission.
She also finished decadron taper yesterday for brain metastases/edema.
She was admitted for nausea, vomiting, dehydration.
Of note, she had a recent INR that was 5; she held her coumadin dose night prior to admission.
She then had a PET scan which showed this mass was FDG-avid, as were multiple bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes.
Ms. [**Known lastname 8957**] was then seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of diagnostic procedure (likely bronchoscopy +/- mediastinoscopy).
She was not symptomatic, so nothing was done urgently, but the plan was to proceed with the bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy in order to obtain tissue for diagnosis.
She was loaded with fosphenytoin and had a repeat CT scan which showed no additional change.
Of note, she had been taking wellbutrin (which lowers the seizure threshold) up until Friday [**2165-8-30**] for smoking cessation.
She is now status post 1 cycle of Taxol/Carboplatin [**2165-10-17**] and was due for her second cycle the day of admission.
She is also status post 15 session WBI.

This may be the result of aspiration as well.
The patient was on decadron and the taper ended the day prior to admission.
The nausea was felt also possibly secondary to delayed effect from chemotherapy versus medication effect (recently on course of ciprofloxacin/clindamycin, cycle 2 Day 8 carboplatin/taxol on admission).
Oral levofloxacin/clindamycin caused worsening symptoms and the patient was given antibiotics intravenously for a brief course.
Compazine, ativan, phenergen, and zyprexa were given as needed for nausea.
She was placed on phenytoin in addition to keppra.
In consultation with her neuro-oncologist, the patient was sent home on both phenytoin and keppra as she seized through the keppra alone.
It is hoped that her steroid regimen will also limit future seizure potential.
The patient was given albuterol, atrovent nebs, and oxygen as needed.
Detailed discussions by palliative care, primary teams and ENT were held with the patient and her family regarding consideration of a trach and PEG placement.
The patient was status post 14-day course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia from previous admission.
The patient was continued on keppra and started on phenytoin.
The patient initially refused to restart decadron due to past leg pain associated with this medication.
