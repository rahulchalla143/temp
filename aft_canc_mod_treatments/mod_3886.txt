Admission Date: [**2117-9-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2117-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-8-18**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old woman with past medical history significant for aortic stenosis and patent foramen ovale status post atrial septal defect repair and aortic valve replacement in [**2117-8-6**], that presents to the emergency room with complaint of abdominal pain and report of free intraperitoneal air on x-ray at her rehabilitation facility, [**Hospital2 57361**] [**Hospital3 **].
Briefly, this is a 76-year-old female who has multiple medical problems as described above, including hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and known lung cancer, that was recently discharged 2 days prior to [**Hospital1 57361**] Rehabilitation facility after a lengthy  hospital course in which she underwent an aortic valve replacement and an atrial septal defect closure.
Also of note, she also received before her prior discharge a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed by the general surgery service.
Of note, the patient continued to have free intra-abdominal air during her stay in the intensive care unit before her discharge.
However, her abdominal pain resolved, and she was able to resume her tube feeds per recommendation of the general surgery service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, right iliac artery disease, lung cancer, malignant pericardial and pleural effusions, pacemaker in situ, left carotid endarterectomy, hysterectomy, pericardial window, tonsillectomy, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, patent foramen ovale, and coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone, Lipitor, Warfarin, furosemide, lansoprazole, digoxin, aspirin, fluconazole, and vancomycin.
Vancomycin was for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that was growing out of her sputum prior to her previous discharge.
Her incision is noted to be well healed with Steri-Strips beginning to slough off.
This 75-year-old female recently discharged with an aortic valve replacement and atrial septal defect repair was brought back into the hospital for further evaluation of persistent intraperitoneal free air status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2117-9-1**], nine days prior to this at readmission.
A CAT scan was performed at this time that revealed no extravasation, though this did not satisfy our curiosity in regard to the possibility of anterior leak of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
We placed her PEG tube to gravity at this time with the plan to have a prone study performed the following day, and to continue to hold tube feeds at this time.
On hospital day #4 the patient continued to progress well and was noted to be comfortable and did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells at this time for a hematocrit of 25.6, noted to be down from 28 the previous day.
Thus, throughout the hospital course there was, at no point, that we could locate a definitive leak of contrast due to the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
It was determined that the patient could have her tube feeds resumed.
On hospital day #5 these tube feeds were resumed, indeed, and the patient tolerated them well and was slowly increased to her goal rate of 50 mL per hour of ProBalance with fiber.
Also at this time, the patient received a PICC line on the right side that was placed under interventional radiology due to her presence of a permanent pacemaker on the left side.
This venous catheter was removed after the procedure and the port remained in place in the left antebrachial area.
Then, on hospital day #6, the patient was evaluated again and had been continued on her tube feeds at this time.
She was spending significant amounts of time in her chair and was tolerating a tracheostomy mask at this time with continued plan for her to rest at night on the ventilator.
On hospital day #6, it was determined the patient was fit for discharge to rehabilitation facility on continued tube feeds.
The patient was to receive 1 more week of vancomycin for positive blood culture and yeast in sputum.
The patient was to continue on tracheostomy mask during the day as needed and to be placed on the ventilator as needed at night so that she could rest.
Fluconazole was not given necessary upon discharge.
Patient to continue on continuous positive airway pressure and pressure support for 12-14 hours a day goal and to receive assist control at night for rest.
Patient to receive tube feedings of ProBalance full strength at 50 mL per hour with checks every 4 hours for residuals, and tube feeds to be held for any residual greater than 100 mL.
Patient to have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] scheduled upon discharge from rehabilitation facility.
