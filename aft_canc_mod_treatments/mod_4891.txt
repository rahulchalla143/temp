[**2107-8-2**] Interventional Radiology for internal external drain placement   History of Present Illness: 78 y.o.
A pancreatic duct stent was placed as well as a PTBD.
The pancreatic duct was filled partially with contrast and appeared normal The distal most part of the CBD was filled with contrast and there was a tight 1cm malignant appearing stricture Cannulation of the CBD was not successful using a sphincterotome  A small pre-cut sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a needle-knife to aid in accessing the CBD Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique A 6cm by 5FR plastic single pigtail pancreatic stent was placed successfully to aid in CBD cannulation and decrease risk of acute pancreatitis.
Despite extensive maneuvering and use of different catheters and guidewires, the CBD was not able to be cannulated.
A modified 6 French external biliary catheter was placed with the pigtail formed and locked in the distal CBD and connected to an external drainage bag.
