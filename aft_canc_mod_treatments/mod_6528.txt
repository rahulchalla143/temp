No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
Dual-channel central venous catheter has backed out to the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
Existing catheter exchanged with a longer triple-lumen tunneled Hickman catheter with tip in the SVC.
Colonoscopy after treatment/resolution is recommended.
Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Liver/GB Ultrasound [**2126-5-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Right-sided central venous catheter, nasogastric tube, left IJ central venous catheter, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male who presented on D+27 of matched unrelated donor non-myeloblative allogeneic stem cell transplant with worsening GVHD and weakness found to have worsening acute GVHD.
As his rash had not improved on prednisone and he was having primarily weakness and some mental status changes at presentation concern for severe, acute GVHD was low and concern for infection was much higher.
Therefore prednisone was stopped on [**2126-5-12**].
On [**2126-5-19**] there was an attempt made to wean this steroids back in the context of potential improvement but his diarrhea once again worsened and bilirubin started to climb so that by [**2126-5-22**] he was back on 1mg/kg methylprednisolone per day.
On [**2126-5-23**] the patient was advanced to 2mg/kg IV methylprednisolone per day divided into two doses and on [**2126-5-24**] he was started on mycophenolate motefil for what was now considered steroid refractory acute GVHD.
Methylprednisolone dosing was was dropped back to 1mg/kg on [**5-26**] as there was minimal improvement and considerable concern about the risk of this high of a steroid dose.
The patient was allowed rice once again on [**2126-6-2**] as his stool output had dropped below 500 cc per day and bilirubin was back to less than 4.
PO diet was stopped and he was continued on TPN for nutrition.
Stools stopped once intubated (started on sedation and narcotics).
On [**6-26**], in the ICU, IR placed percutaneous cholecystostomy with pigtail.
# Weakness/Cough: At presentation the outpatient oncologist was quite concerned these symptoms could indicate occult infection given the patient was less than 1 month post transplant.
When CT torso revealed colitis the patient was empirically started on ciprofloxacin/metronidazole on [**2126-5-12**] though C diff assay was negative.
His hickman was also changed over a wire as the cuff was noted to be protruding from the skin though culture of the tip remained negative.
The patient remained afebrile thereafter, until [**2126-6-15**] when he spiked a temp and was started on cefepime and vancomycin for suspected pulmonary source.
Also found to have highly positive PCR in blood for adenovirus, and was started on cidofovir on [**6-21**] with pretreatement of renal protection with probenicid.
ID followed pt and also had changed micafungin to voirconazole on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], continued cefepime and discontinued Vancomycin.
BMT decreased steriods, cellcept and cyclosporine due to infection.
# Respiratory Distress: On the evening of [**2126-5-17**] while having his hickman changed the patient developed acute shortness of breath during the procedure associated with an anxiety attack.
The patient is quite claustrophobic and reacted poorly to being placed for the procedure but also developed brief hypoxia that resolved with supplementary O2.
The patient had another episode of respiratory distress on [**2126-6-17**] after being diagnosed with bilateral multifocal pneumonia.
Due to TPN and required medications patient was 21 L positive in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and difficult to diuresis.
Eventually required Lasix drip with pressor support.
While he was able to be weaned from pressors during his ICU stay, on [**6-29**] his requirements increased and phenylepherine and vasopressin were added.
Mechanical ventilation was discontinued.
All outpatient HTN medications were stopped.
Patient was started on Levophed for support, which was transitioned over to Phenylephrine due to tachycardia.
Patient was weaned off pressors but then became hypotensive and pressors were restarted.
# Acute Renal Failure: Patient developed renal failure following cidovir dose which is a known nephrotoxin.
His BB was weaned down over concern his dyspnea could have been due to difficulty augmenting his cardiac output in the context of standing with beta blockade but this wasn't particularly helpful.
He was supported with transfusions and cyclosporine was continued with addition of mycophenolate and prednisone as described.
# Hypertension: The patient initially required increased nifedipine dosing in the context of his increased steroid dosing and secondary worsening of hypertension.
Eventually, beta blocker was decreased due to concern of worsening his dyspnea.
During [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay patient became hypotensive and all outpatient HTN medications were held.
This was well controlled with PO oxycodone in the hospital.
# Prophylaxis: On presentation the patient was on voriconazole for fungal prophylaxis as there was concern fluconazole had worsened his rash.
Acyclovir was briefly stopped out of concern it contributed to rash but he remained on this throughout most of his hospitalization for viral prophylaxis.
He remained on ursodiol for VOD prophylaxis.
