There is no evidence of dissection, though it is not excluded given that no IV contrast was administered.
Video Swallow- Significantly delayed oral transit and pharyngeal swallow initiation.
Aspiration observed with swallowing materials and thin liquid.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M w/ COPD, CRI transitioning to HD, mult CVA, ongoing EtOH abuse, new dx of adenoca now txfx'd from the ICU following CHF exacerbation.
Originally admitted w/ pna after being ruled out for MI, neg CTA, hct drop during admission led to colonoscopy w/ polypectomy- one of which was positive for adenoca ([**Location (un) 6553**] B).
During that time pt rec'd lg volume resusciation after which he became increasingly SOB after diuresis held.
Completed 7 day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin, w/ subjective improvement and decreased O2 requirement.
During transfer to ICU [**2-2**] resp failure/CHF (see below) the patient was started on steroids for presumed COPD contribution (although no PFTs ever performed by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] previous O2 sat ever recorded in office, CT w/o bullae or hyperinflation).
He will complete the steroid taper tomorrow.
2) CHF- following volume resusciation for GIB (as discussed below) the patient was noted to have continued 2L oxygen requirement.
The attending physician had asked that diuresis be stopped as it was felt that the patient had a primary pulmonary process.
A Quintan catheter was placed and the patient underwent UF and HD w/ subsequent resolution of his SOB.
Plan to complete a steroid taper, as above.
3) Adenocarcinoma of colon- during admission, pt developed ongoing HCT drop w/ guiac positive stools.
Colonic resection was discussed with the surgical consultants on multiple occasions but it was felt that patient was not a surgical candidate.
4) CRF- on admission pt was being transitioned to HD and had already had an AVF placed.
He subsequently had a tunnelled HD catheter placed, which was functioning well on discharge.
He will continue outpt dialysis TIW.
Pt will need VNA services for med teaching and FS checks, as his BG has been running high while on the prednisone taper.
He should be assessed for DM as an outpt and started on oral hypoglycemics, if necessary.
