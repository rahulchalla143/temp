Interventional pulmonology recommended left pulmonary artery embolization in order to more effectively prevent tumor bleeding.
On [**2178-3-24**] patient underwent left artery embolization by interventional radiology with good effect.
Patient's aspirin is being held given his risk of bleeding.
# Hypoxia/Post-Obstructive Pneumonia/Bilateral Pleural Effusions: On admission patient determined to have postobstructive atelectasis and pneumonia on chest CT. PNA initially treated with unasyn and transitioned to levaquin for a total of 10 day course.
Hypoxia improved with treatment of PNA.
He underwent therapeutic thoracentesis on [**2178-3-26**] with good effect however fluid re-accumulated and patient underwent placement of a PleurX cathether on [**2178-3-30**] which can continue to be drained.
Patient is sating in the mid to high 90's on 2 liters of oxygen at time of discharge.
Oxygen via nasal cannula should continue to be weaned as tolerated to maintain sats >93%.
Patient treated with bolus doses of intravenous metoprolol and oral metoprolol titrated up to 100mg TID (100mg [**Hospital1 **] at home).
Patient was also continued on his outpatient regimen of digoxin.
# Back Pain: Patient has known metastasis to the spine with a particularly symptomatic lesion at T11 which he has received palliative radiation and more recently cyberknife therapy in [**1-23**].
Pain control much improved after patient switched from fentanyl patch 25 mcg/vicodin to fentanyl patch 50mcg/MSIR combination.
Patient may require continued increased titration of his current pain medication regimen to achieve comfort.
He will certainly require pulmonary rehab, pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry.
He was continued on his outpatient regimen of Fluticasone-Salmeterol.
His tiotropium bromide was changed to ipratropium bromide and Xopenex was added to his regimen for wheezing/shortness of breath PRN.
We prefer he receive Xopenex rather than albuterol given he has an underlying tachyarrthymia.
