Background dysplasia is noted, and correlation with clinical and cytogenetic findings is recommended to assess for an antecedent myelodysplastic process.
Erythrocytes are decreased in number, normochromic, and exhibit anisopoikilocytosis including ovalocytes, microcytes are rare dacryocyte.
Blasts have scant amount of cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, large round-to-oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli.
Myeloid precursors appear markedly increased in number and consists predominantly of blasts.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
The cellularity is greater than 90% and consists predominantly of a population of immature cells with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and prominent nucleoli.
[**2199-4-24**] FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, Glycophorin A, Kappa, lambda; and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 45, 56, 64, 71, 117.
A minor subset (17%) dimly co-express CD19.
T cells comprise 65% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 102 (usual range in 0.7-30).
The patient is noted to be status post bilateral central venous catheter placement with tips terminating within the cavoatrial junction.
[**2199-5-24**]: Bone Marrow Biopsy:  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:  HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT MARROW FOR AGE WITH LEFT SHIFTED MYELOPOIESIS.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a 1.3 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone with a variable cellularity ranging from 5-20%, overall 10%.
Erythroid precursors are increased and exhibit megaloblastic maturation.
Myeloid elements are decreased and exhibit left-shifted maturation.
Marrow clot section contain to few spicules for evaluation.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia presents for initiation of chemotherapy.
Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with an acute myeloid leukemia with normal cytogenetics so she was treated initially with Hydroxyurea and then with [**Doctor First Name **]/Ara-C 7+3.
She tolerated the regimen well without evidence of tumor lysis.
She was initially placed on Allopurinol, but this was discontinued after her chemotherapy was complete as she had no evidence of high or rapidly changing urate levels.
# Bilateral LL PNA: On admission, the patient was febrile and a CXR demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia, so she was placed on Cefepime & Vancomycin.
Overnight, after beginning IVF's with chemotherapy, she developed an oxygen requirement that progressed to a NRB and she required a brief transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia.
She responded immediately to IV Lasix therapy and returned to sat'ing well on RA.
# Ankle pain: On admission, the patient noted some right ankle discomfort with difficulty with plantar and dorsiflexion.
Rheumatology was consulted and attempted arthrocentesis of her ankle that did not yield joint aspirate and resulted in an ecchymoses.
# Rash: Patient developed acral erythema on day 8 of therapy with a few isolated blisters on her heels.
Dermatology was consulted and they felt her presentation was consistent with a chemotherapy induced acral erythema with id response.
Per their recommendations, she was placed on Clobetasol & Triamcinolone ointment and her antibiotics were switched to Vancomycin, Aztreonam, & Micafungin.
A review of medications did not demonstrate a source of ingested Phosphate, but the patient's Caphosol was held out of concern that it may have been inadvertantly ingested.
As the patient's Ca x Ph product was greater than 55, she was also started on Sevelamer on day 22 with an improvement in her serum phosphate.
Medications on Admission: calcium with vitamin D multivitamin   Discharge Medications: 1.
Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Multivitamin     Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day.
Sevelamer HCl 800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day: with meals.
Hair Prosthesis Hair Prosthesis  Acute Myelogenous Leukemia for Chemotherapy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia status post chemotherapy with Ara-C and Idarubicin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
