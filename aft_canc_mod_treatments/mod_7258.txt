He was treated with nebs without significant improvement in his tachypnea.
He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Past Medical History: - CLL (see above) - Bladder stones-->cystoscopic removal-->E coli sepsis described  in [**Doctor Last Name 410**] D/C summary from [**2194-9-27**] - Hypertension - Bronchiectasis and asthma, followed for both by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Family History: His mother died of colon cancer at [**Age over 90 **] years and his father died at 62 of a stroke (in context of hypertension).
Worsening volume overload with pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
A limited panel to assess B-cell clonality was attempted, however low cellularity and dim surface immunoglobulin staining precludes reliable assessment.
Pt intubated for airway protection given one episode of coffee ground emesis, had an episode of wide complex tachycardia peri-intubation and loaded with amiodarone.
His course in ICU complicated by sinus bradycardia, thought to be related to amiodarone loading and hypothermia, now improved to 50-60s.
He was evaluated by pulmonary who thought that a bronchoscopy was not necessarily indicated, and instead recommended symptomatic meausures such as, fluticasone, chest PT, aggressive incentive spirometry, and standing nebulizer treatments.
Patient was started on vancomycin/zosyn/cipro/flagyl/micafungin for coverage, and his cipro and fluconazole were discontinued on [**2-21**].
# hypotension [**1-29**] CMV adrenalitis: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was found to be hypotensive and he was maintained on pressors to keep MAP >60.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an infectious work up was pursued.
The patient was also started on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone per endocrine rec.
As his blood pressures improved, he was weaned off pressors and he maintained his blood pressure on his own.
He was found to have CMV viremia, and his other cultures did not grow anything by [**2195-3-1**] and beta glucan and galactomannan negative.
The patient was continued on empiric Vanc, Zosyn, and Micafungin, which were discontinued upon transfer to the BMT floor.
He was maintained on hydrocortisone and fludricortisone.
The patient was also continued on ganciclovir for his CMV viremia.
# Hypernatremia: Pt kept NPO after extubation as he did not pass his speech/swallow, and had worsening hypernatremia.
Considered stopping fludrocortisone given hypernatremia and low-ish K and concern for hyperaldosteronism, but as there was concern for adrenal insufficiency and did not want to completely withdraw mineralocorticoid action, was not stopped.
#AMS: Patient is sluggish in speech and with variable degrees of orientation after extubation.
The patient was started on IV ganciclovir induction dose and his CMV viral load was checked weekly.
Given history of heme malignancy and potential for immune dysregulation with dytsfunctional bone marrow, these drops in Hct may be a hemolytic process.
He was continued on pantoprazole 40mg IV BID and his hct was monitored.
He was slowly weaned off steroids and as his temperature improved, his bradycardia improved as well.
# Episodes of Vtach (8 beat runs) on telemetry, one episode of sustained Vtach / SVT: Sustained likely SVT occurring shortly after intubation (rate in 190s).
Sustained episode occurred immediately after pt being intubated and has not recurred.
He was loaded on amiodarone at that time but no long-term antiarrhythmic has been started as patient?????
Considering diarrhea resolved and distention in abdomen and tinkling bowel sounds, may have obstruction or partial obstruction, however these were not seen on CT. C.diff PCR negative, but CMV viral load~700copies/mL, suggesting possible CMV colitis.
His lytes were repleted prn and patient was started on TPN when his status improved.
Hepatology was consulted and it was thought that ascites could be in setting of gross volume overload.
The patient was started on Spironlactone and Lasix.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Cr 1.5, improving.
# CLL:  The patient was recently treated with Campath; however further treatment has been held until infectious workup is complete.
Continued on sodium bicarbonate 1300 mg PO/NG TID and his HCO3 was monitored daily.
# BPH: While in patient, the patient's finasteride and tamsulosin were both held.
A foley was also placed; the patient will be d/ced to rehab with foley in place given his swollen scrotum.
Of note, the patient was continued on Fluconazole for prophylaxis.
His Bactrim was stopped and he was started on pentamidine (first dose [**2195-3-18**]).
He was started on Lasix and Spironolactone; his lytes will have to be followed as an outpatient.
As per Hepatology recommendations, his lasix and Spironolactone will have to be uptitrated as an outpatient.
