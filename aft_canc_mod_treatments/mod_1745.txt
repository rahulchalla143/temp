Anastomosis included from the LIMA to the LAD, from the aorta via saphenous vein graft to the right PDA, and saphenous vein graft to the distal LAD and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
Bypass time was noted to be 85 minutes and cross clamp time was noted to be 71 minutes.

Shortly following arrival in the CSRU, the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication and was subsequently advanced to oral intake without incident.

On postoperative day number two, the patient's lines and chest tubes were removed without complication and the patient was subsequently cleared for transfer to the floor.
The patient's Foley catheter was removed without complication and he was subsequently noted to be independently productive of urine for the duration of his stay.
