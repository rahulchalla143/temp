Liver transplant on [**2130-12-5**].
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] was a 75-year-old woman status post orthotopic liver transplant in [**2130-11-15**] with a new diagnosis of colon cancer and probable hepatic abscess by ultrasound biopsy.
The patient was placed on a regimen of antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
The procedure was complicated by dissection, and the patient was returned to the operating room for hepatic artery reanastomosis.
After receiving a transfusion and multiple boluses, the patient returned to a normal blood pressure.
A repeat ultrasound showed normal blood flow to the liver, so it was decided to take the patient to the operating room for a right hemicolectomy for management of her cecal cancer.
Her antibiotic regimen at that point was vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for her history of Enterobacter cultured from her initial biopsy upon admission.
Given her new diagnosis of end-stage III-C T3 N2 M0 by TNM staging, Oncology recommended adjuvant chemotherapy of the cecal carcinoma with a chemotherapy combination of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.
