The patient presented with a productive cough, leukocytosis, increasing O2 requirement, and worsening SOB and a CXR suggestive of pneumonia.
He was initally treated with levofloxacin and flagyl, however he continued to require increasing amounts of oxygen, so his coverage was broadened to vancomycin and zosyn.
