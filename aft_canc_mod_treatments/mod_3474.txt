Admission Date:  [**2122-8-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-9-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-6-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: sob  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 75F with metastatic breast cancer, s/p recent chemo (last on [**8-19**]), CHF who gradually started to develop SOB 1d after chemo.
Per report she was bradycardic and with ?heart block, and received atropine x1.
En route SBP dropped (no documentation of SBPs), and pt was started on dopa gtt.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with VS: 97.8  70  106/56 18 96% NRB on dopamine gtt.
Her O2 requirement was weaned down to 6L, she was mentating appropriately per report.
Past Medical History: - breast cancer (mets to bone) dx [**2119**], s/p 2nd dose of chemo ([**8-19**], taxol, gemcitabine, seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Location (un) **] Muger [**Hospital3 **]), previously treated with XRT, Zometa, Arimidex.
- baseline HCT [**8-11**] WBC=4500, HCT 30, PLT 327, HgB 9.9.
- baseline creatinine 1.1 [**7-13**], 1.1 [**8-13**], [**7-27**] 1.38.
Ultrasound: FINDINGS: Portable bedside evaluation was performed with limitations secondary to patient respirations.
The left kidney measures 9.8 cm.
Peripancreatic fat stranding which may be related to anasarca given the patient's recent normal lipase value.
# Hypotension and sinus bradycardia: She arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on dopamine gtt, started en route in life flight (no documentation).
Initial concern was for sepsis vs volume vs volume loss (hct=23, baseline unclear, was 28 at OSH), concerning for GIB given guaic+ in ED vs RP bleed given femoral access at OSH vs tamponade (uremic, coagulopathic, and h/o breast malignancy) vs atenolol toxicity in setting of ARF [**1-9**] chemotherapy.
Given concern for GI bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and ARF, as well as rapidly improving O2 status, PE was felt less likely, and heparin gtt was not started.
She was weaned from dopamine gtt gradually over ~2d, though was found to be acutely sensitive to weaning with periods of bradycardia to 20s (including 1.5-4 second pauses) while weaning, these episodes were asymptomatic.
PaO2/FiO2 gradient = 90 / 0.40 = 360.  no effusion seen on bedside TTE.
given hypotension, diuresis was deferred.
repeat CXR on HD#3 showed ?increasing pulmonary edema (felt unlikley given clinical improvement), however was concerning for new consolidations.
Her volume status quickly improved with auto-diuresis, and she was weaned from NRB to 4L NC quickly overnight on admission.
Given her rapid imrovement, pt was empirically placed on a 7d course of cefepime/vanco with resolution of hypoxemia to room air.
# Afebrile neutropenia: For neutropenia, pt empirically started on cefepime and vancomycin on [**8-23**] for 7 day course, and blood, urine, sputum cultures were negative.
# Paroxysmal AFIB with RVR: EKGs at OSH were concerning for intermittent afib vs mat vs atrial tachycardia with intermittent block.
per report, pt had an episode of "my heart stopping" at OSH requiring atropine (no documentation).
on arrival, pt was in nsr, on doparmine, however, she was acutely sensitive to weaning of dopamine with sinus bradycardia (asymptomatic) when dopamine was weaned from 5mcg/hr to 3mcg/hr.
Pt seen by EP who felt pacemaker was not indicated.
Further, pt elected to not pursue further chemotherapy, and she was not felt to be a good candidate for pacemaker implant in setting of poor prognosis and neutropenia/thrombocytopenia.
Atenolol should be avoided if pt intendes to continue with chemotherapy given risk of atenolol toxicity [**1-9**] ARF.
emergent HD was declined given absence of pericardial effusion, as hyperK, acidemia, and uremia felt stable.
She required multiple platelet transfusions in setting of GI bleeding and conjunctival hemorrhage.
pt's mental status resolved with improvement in uremia and with antibiotic course as above.
# Metastatic breast ca s/p chemo x2: Recently s/p chemo (gemecitibine/taxol) [**8-19**] (only her second dose), neutropenic on admission, no reports of fever, though hypotension concerning for sepsis.
DIC labs were followed q8h and felt unremarkable in setting of onc diagnosis.
Per heme-onc she was started on g-csf for neutropenia with recovery of WBC.
Platelets were maintained initially at goal >50 for concern for bleeding, however given that her hct was found to be at her baseline, transfusion threshold was changed to 20.
Patient also noted mucositis and thrush, treated with magic mouthwash, peridex, nystatin swish and swallow, with returning ability to take small POs.
# Elevated LFTs - tbil mildly elevated 2.6, pt s/p cholecystectomy however, though felt she could still have CBD stone, CT ABD/PELVIS [**Location (un) 1131**] negative for significant hydro, CBD dilation.
on HD#3 renal recommended modest maintenance fluids to keep up with aggresive autodiuresis.
Per discussion with the family, the patient was made CMO and given low dose IV Morphine to reduce dyspnea.
