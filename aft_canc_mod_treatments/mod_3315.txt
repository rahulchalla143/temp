Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) Cardiac catheterization with left anterior descending coronary artery thrombectomy and drug eluting stent placement.
2) Left Internal Carotid Artery Stenting 3) Colonoscopy 4) Upper endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 78 year-old female with significant smoking history, no other past medical history, who presents from an outside hospital with acute onset sub-sternal chest pain at rest with radiation to the left shoulder and diaphoresis.
Her current pain was graded as [**11-15**], sharp, midline with slight radiation.
At the outside hospital ED, the patient was given nitro, morphine with improvement of her pain.
She received ASA 325, Plavix 600mg, heparin bolus, integrillin bolus x2 plus gtt at 2mcg/kg/min and lopressor 5mg IV x1.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Right Common Carotid Artery was patent.
Right Internal Carotid Artery with 60% stenosis.
Left Internal Carotid was stented with a [**7-14**] x 30 Acculink stent.
COLONOSCOPY ([**2113-8-28**]):  The patient was found to have Diverticulosis of the whole colon, external hemorrhoids, Polyps in the rectum (these were not removed as the patient was on Plavix.)
Patient will have to stop Plavix 5 days before and after the procedure.
She was treated with cardiac catheterization with LAD thrombectomy and placement of drug eluting stent in the LAD.
Patient with severe 3 vessel disease with smoking as an only known risk factor for coronary artery disease.
Percutaneous cardiac intervention at the outside hospital revealed:  80% prox LAD, 80-90% LCx, 80% RCA, 60-70% ramus stenosis.
The patient was started on aspirin, Statin, heparin drip, Integrilin, and metoprolol 12.5mg TID.
Plavix was held because of the possibility of CABG.
The patient was initially evaluated for a CABG by CT surgery.
Therefore, in the setting of the patient's recent anterior myocardial infarction and proximal LAD lesion, the patient was taken for a cardiac catheterization ([**2113-8-23**]) with LAD thrombectomy and drug eluting stent placement in the LAD.
Plavix was started before cardiac catheterization.
The patient will follow up with a cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**], at the [**Hospital1 **] cardiology group on [**2113-9-7**] for the possibility of stenting of the LCx and RCA.
Her blood pressure was too low on discharge to add an ACEI, but she may benefit from Lisinopril in the future.
An Acculink stent was placed in the Left Internal Carotid Artery with subsequent robust flow through this artery into the Middle Cerebral Artery.
The patient will continue on Plavix for at least one year and may need Plavix as a life-long medication.
The patient was treated with metoprolol 12.5mg TID to maintain a low heart rate and allow left ventricular filling.
She was given 2 fluid boluses with slight elevation of blood pressure and good urine output, but continued to have MAPs lower than 60.
At his point, she was initiated on neo-synephrine with good response.
Rhythm: The patient was placed on telemetry and remained in normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVC's.
The patient's SQ heparin was discontinued, she was placed on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], two large bore IV's were placed, she was typed an crossed, and then given two unit of packed red blood cells with a Hct bump from 24.6 to 29.1.
She will not be able to stop Plavix under any cirmcumstances for at least a year, so if plans are made for polyp removal, these must be done while the patient is on Plavix.
The patient was treated with Tylenol, tramadol, and oxycodone PRN.
The patient was maintained on Ipratropium and Albuterol.
FEN: The patient was started on a cardiac diet.
Medications on Admission: Tylenol prn Triamterene (unsure of dose) Tramadol (unsure of dose) Ibuprofen prn   Discharge Medications: 1.
Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Latanoprost 0.005 % Drops Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic HS (at bedtime).
Tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Dorzolamide-Timolol 2-0.5 % Drops Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).
Atenolol 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
We treated this with a cardiac catheterization and a stent in one of the coronary arteries.
This was treated with left carotid artery stent placement.
Even though you had a GI bleed, you need to stay on your aspirin and plavix.
During this hospitalization, you were started on several new medications to treat your heart and the arteries in your neck.
It is very important that you take all of your medications.
It is especially important that you take your aspirin and plavix everyday.
Under no circumstance should you stop taking your aspirin or plavix- unless you have spoken to your cardiologist.
If you become sick and are vomiting and cannot take your aspirin or plavix you should contact your cardiologist.
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, feel hot and/or sweaty, feel confused, are not able to speak, have a change in your vision,or are suddenly are not able to move or feel a part of your body-please contact your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.
Followup Instructions: 1) Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to evaluate your left carotid stent on [**2113-9-26**] at 3:20pm.
Please discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] if you need to start Lisinopril as an outpatient.
