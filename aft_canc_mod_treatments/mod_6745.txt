Admission Date:  [**2109-1-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-2-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nortriptyline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**] Chief Complaint: aspiration s/p intubation for [**First Name3 (LF) **]   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2109-1-8**] [**Month/Day/Year **] and intubation [**2109-1-11**] Placement of post pyloric Doppoff feeding tube [**2109-1-16**] Dobhoff replacement in post pyloric position [**2109-1-19**] Extubation [**2109-1-20**] Pulled Dobhoff feeding tube  History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after [**Hospital Unit Name **] complicated by aspiration and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Therefore, he was transferred back to [**Hospital1 392**] and underwent a laparascopic choleycystectomy.
He was intubated for his procedure.
During a successful stent placement he vomited and aspirated.
He was transferred to the ICU on a ventilator given concern he would develop [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS after his severe aspiration event.
JP drain in place, bilious fluid; no grimace to palpation.
Status post cholecystectomy with cholecystectomy clips and drainage catheter at the end of the cystic duct remnant.
On this study the tip of the endotracheal tube is near the right main stem bronchus however on radiographs from subsequent days, the tip of the endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.
The previously described abnormality in Morison's pouch likely represented the surgical drain in this region.
Although the study was not specifically tailored to assess the enhancement of the pancreas, decreased areas of enhancement in the head and body are again evident.
Prominence of the left intrahepatic biliary ducts in the setting of a biliary stent, could represent obstruction, but unchanged.
Anasarca and increase in bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).

Current active issues are treatment for line-associated fungemia, c.difficile colitis and recurrent ileus.
1) Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for [**Hospital1 **] after being somewhat hypoxic during his procedure.
As his hospitalization progressed he required large amounts of IV fluids for volume resuscitation in the context of vasodilatory shock.
His PaO2/FiO2 ratio never dropped below 100, however, and he was eventually successfully weaned to pressure support in the context of initiating diuresis.
He had been advanced to minimal settings with good oxygenation and ventilation but was maintained on CPAP for [**1-1**] more days while his mental status resolved.
2) Vasodilatory Shock: The patient was not hypotensive on his initial presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but over his first night in the unit developed severe hypotension with persistently low CVP's so that over his first two nights in the unit he required >15 L of NS and then LR in order to aim for a goal CVP of 15 and a MAP of >60.
Surgery strongly recommended avoiding the pressors in the setting of known pancreatitis and these were never required except for briefly on the night of [**2109-1-15**] when he received norepinephrine briefly in order to get enough blood pressure to allow furosemide bolusing.
His hypotension resolved and he required no further fluid boluses after [**2109-1-15**].
3)Choleycystitis/Cholangitis: The patient was febrile shortly after his arrival in the ICU and given his complicated procedure and the sequelae he was placed on pipercillin-tazobactam and vancomycin for cholangitis in this heavily instrumented patient.
The patient completed a 10 day course of pipercillin-tazobactam/meropenem and vancomycin for this problem.
4)Fevers/VAP: Despite being well covered for cholangitis and HAP organisms the patient remained febrile.
He defervesced slightly thereafter and he completed a 10 day course of meropenem for VAP.
Surgery was consulted and recommended NPO status, avoiding pressors, and supportive care.
Surgery recommends outpatient follow up in order to rescan his abdomen weeks in the future to look for developing phlegmon that may need eventual drainage.
He will perhaps form a pseudocyst that may potentially need drainage in the future.
This decreased subtsantially and his NG tube was removed, however the patient was not able to comfortably tolerate full liquids and after replacement of the NG tube on [**1-31**], the patient started have further bilious NG tube drainage.
The patient will be discharged with a NG tube with plan for enteral feeding via J-tube.
-Can remove NG tube when drainage significantly decreases and patient's nausea and vomiting improves.
8)Nutrition: The patient was started on PPN on [**2109-1-10**] and then advanced to TPN on [**2109-1-11**].
The patient then had a post-pyloric feeding tube and was advanced to tube feeds on [**2109-1-12**].
Unfortunately, we had repeated issues with the patient pulling out post-pyloric feeding tubes so he was put back on TPN on [**2109-1-20**].
Due to the patient's fungemia, his TPN was discontinued on [**1-31**].
Interventional radiology placed a J-tube on [**2-1**].
-Initiate tube feeds and advance as tolerated.
9)  Line-associated [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans Fungemia)  The patient is on a 2 week course of IV fluconazole to be completed on [**2-8**].
The patient was treated with IV flagyl with improvement in his symptoms.
