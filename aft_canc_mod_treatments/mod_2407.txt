Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-5**]:Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback, portal vein conduit from the recipient portal vein to the donor portal vein), common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis, donor common hepatic artery to recipient common hepatic artery end-to-end anastomosis [**11-7**]:Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra- abdominal hematoma, portal vein exploration, intraoperative ultrasound, Tru-Cut biopsy of the liver [**11-9**] 1.
Superior mesenteric vein to portal vein iliac vein conduit, donor common hepatic artery to donor #1 branch patch, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy [**11-13**] 1.
Debridement of necrotic muscle and fascia [**11-26**] 1.
Re-exploration of liver transplant with washout liver biopsy and Vicryl mesh closure of abdominal wall [**12-2**] 1.
She was taken to the operating room where she underwent a difficult liver transplantation that was complicated by primary nonfunction.
She was then taken back to the operating room and underwent AB/O incompatible liver transplantation and underwent temporary abdominal closure.
She underwent followup Doppler ultrasound that demonstrated patent vessels to the liver and, because she required a portal vein jump graft to the SMV to re-establish portal vein inflow, we placed her on heparin after she completed her abdominal closure.
Physical Exam: On physical examination,PRE TRANSPLANT she appeared tired.

Hepatic artery ap reared clotted and she also had a splenic infarct.At this time, without what appeared to be a significant insult that we did not believe was survivable, namely an identified hollow visceral perforation, portal vein and hepatic artery thrombosis in the setting of a 2nd liver transplant and infected necrotic pancreas, pancreatic necrosis, we did not believe that this was a salvageable situation.Pt was made CMO after discussion with health proxy abdomen was closed and pt was transferred to ICU where She expired short after.
