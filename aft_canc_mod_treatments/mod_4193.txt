CTA Chest [**2107-1-26**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: A right paratracheal lymph node measures 1.2 cm in short axis and is stable.
Note is made of multiple enlarged, necrotic-appearing left cervical lymph nodes as demonstrated on prior scans.
Persistent pneumothorax with anterior hydropneumothorax component on lateral radiograph  Initial TTE [**2107-1-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized, circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of tamponade (RA diastolic collapse, respiratory variation on tricuspid valve inflows).
Small echodense region appreciated near RV apex which is consistent with possible cellular debris (?hemorrhagic effusion in the setting of underlying malignancy versus shadow/artifact (clips 58 and 60)).
TTE [**1-29**], [**2-3**], [**2-4**] done for monitoring of pericardial effusion.
Superior and inferior vena caval filters and a mediastinal drain remain in place.
A PICC line is demonstrated coursing through the right brachial and axillary veins, which are widely patent.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87457**] is a 44 year-old woman with metastatic lung CA, recurrent malignant pericardial effusion, recurrent DVT and PE s/p IVC, SVC and brachiocephalic filter placement who presented with cough and dyspnea for 1 week and was found to have CTA concerning for PE and pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
She was taken semi-urgently to the catheterization laboratory for pericardiocentesis with balloon pericardiotomy and subseqnetly required surgical creation of 2 pericardial windows with internal drainage.
# Malignant Pericardial Effusion:  She presented with her third occurence of malignant pericardial effusion with evidence of tamonade physiology that required drainage and balloon pericardiotomy.
240ml of sanguineous fluid was drained from pericardial sac and she tolerated the procedure well.
A pericardial drain was left in overnight but removed the next afternoon when it had drained very little overnight.
However, later that day she again was noted to have an increased pulsus up to 32mmHg with doppler with recurrence of tamonade physiology with new RV collapse on bedside ECHO.
Overnight she was urgently taken to CT surgery for pericardial window with internal drainage.
In that surgery window was created draining into the L pleural space and a L chest tube was placed that initially drained 400cc of serosanguinous fluid.
Due to technical difficulties with window placement and concern that the window might not be effective, a pericardial incision was also made just righ of midline and 200cc of bloody fluid was drained from the pericardium and a pericardial drain was placed in that incision.
Pt was intubated for the proceedure and kept intubated overnight as a precaution, but was extubated without incident the next day.
After 24hrs the L chest tube was removed as it had decreasing drainage but the pericardial drain was left in place due to very high output (1L over first 24hrs and 500cc/day each of the following 2 days).
Pt also received 1 unit PRBC on [**2-1**] as her Hct had drifted down to 22.4.
There was concern that the window might not function when the pericardial drain was removed and the pt might go back into tamponade.
On [**2-4**] interventional pulmonology placed a pleurx catheter in the L pleural space and roughly 350cc was drained from the pleurx.
On [**2-5**], the pericardial drain was removed after ECHO confirmed that there was constrictive physiology but no hemodynamically significant effusion 36hrs after the tube had been clamped.
Although the initial plan was to drain every other day, the pleurx was also drained on the 19th due to significant weeping on the dressing where the pericardial drain had been in place.
On the floor, another 150mL of fluid was drained from pleurx which again was terminated due to pain.
She was given morphine po for these drainages.
She was discharged with follow-up at IP and with VNA services as well as prescription for morhine for continued drainages.
She received SVC and IVC filters and has been on chronic lovenox.
Because of the reaccumulation of her pericadial effusion with solid pericardial mass component, it was determined that the heparin drip should not be resumed immedicately.
From time of initial pericardial window, heparin gtt or other therapeutic anticoagulation was held until pt transfered back to OMED service on [**2-6**].
Upon transfer to floor, she was started back on heparin gtt and then transitioned to lovenox upon discharge.
However, with intubation and line placement, iatrogenic PTX is on the differential.
There was some concern for possible post-obstructive PNA in setting of known lung mass so initially started on vanco/cefepime for this on [**1-28**] and also knowing that pt would be going to OR and receiving operative instrumentation.
# Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma of the lung was discovered in [**6-/2106**], metastatic to right temporal lobe and now s/p stereotactic radiotherapy.
S/P cisplatin and navelbine last Tx 12/[**2105**].
Pt was kept on prednisone at oncology request due to her brain mets.
Upon transfer to oncology floor, she was started on chemotherapy with taxotere which she tolerated well.
She also had 3 days of increased steroids (dexamethasone 8mg [**Hospital1 **] x 3 days) at the time of chemotherapy and also received neupogen to increase her counts after chemo.
# S/P Cyberknife for brain metastasis: She was finishing a decadron taper on admission.
She received increased doses at 8mg [**Hospital1 **] x 3 days around the time of chemotherapy and was discharged back on dexamethasone 2mg daily until she meets with her neuro-oncologist for the swelling around her neck secondary to SVC syndrome.
She received a right PICC at the ICU for access.
Discussion was held with surgery and IV nurse regarding d/c-ing this right PICC given persistent DVTs.
However, pt had very poor access and it was not guaranteed that access could be obtained in left arm given clot in left IJ as well.

You were taken to the OR for a procedure where an incision was made in the pericardium so that the fluid around your heart could drain into your lung space.
Another drain was placed in the lung space to drain this fluid.
You will need follow up at Interventional Pulmonary as well as cardiology for these fluid collections.
You were sent home with home oxygen because your oxygen levels may decrease particularly when ambulating.
For the swelling around your neck, you should continue taking dexamethasone 2mg daily until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**].
The following changes were made to your medications: 1) START Dexamethasone 2mg daily until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] 2) START ranitidine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] 3) START docusate sodium, senna, miralax, bisacodyl as needed for constipation 4) START benzonatate 5) START ipatropium inhalers 6) START guaifenesin-codeine for cough 7) START filgastram 300mcg/mL injection daily for 4 more days 8) START morphine 15-30mg prior to drainages from your pleurex 9) CONTINUE enoxaparin 60mg injections twice a day  Followup Instructions: You will need to have an MRV to assess your veins for IV access as well as a repeat echocardiogram after discharge.
