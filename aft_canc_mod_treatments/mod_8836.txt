She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as she was intubated for respiratory distress at the OSH.
Pt was transitioned to CMO/hospice on [**2174-5-27**], with plan to discontinue vital signs and IV fluids.
She was continued only on her anti-epileptics and pain medication as needed.
She was given small doses of morphine for persistent right upper quadrant pain.
She was originally on oral keppra, but was observed to choke/gargle even with minimal quantity of the liquid; thus she was transitioned to standing lorazepam that could be absorbed orally.
In the ICU, she was treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl.
Patient had gallbladder drain placed, which was discontinued on [**2174-5-27**].
Following this, patient's over clinical condition improved.
She was narrowed to unasyn on [**2174-5-22**] to complete a 2-week course of antibiotics.
Patient was started on micafungin (day 1: [**5-15**]) and completed a 13-day course on [**2174-5-27**].
ERCP was unsuccessful in entering CBD so patient underwent biliary stenting and biopsy by IR.
[**Doctor Last Name **] opted for comfort measures and declined the biopsy, wishing to focus on hospice care.
She received 1U pRBC transfusion in the setting of coffee-ground emesis (see below) but was otherwise stable.
Heparin drip started on [**5-18**], which was later stopped after patient developed coffee-ground emesis.
Patient underwent IR-guided IVC filter placement on [**5-19**].
Her heparin drip was discontinued.
NG tube placement was attempted but not tolerated.
She received 1U pRBC transfusion.
She was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and GI was made aware, who felt there was no need for urgent intervention at this time as she was hemodynamically stable.
# Hypoxia/intubation: Pt was not intubated at the OSH for respiratory failure, but rather acidosis and increased work of breathing.
After her IR-guided biliary drain placement, she remained intubated for MRCP.
Her persistent hypoxia on the floor was felt due to a combination of ventilator-associated pneumonia, COPD, OSA, pulmonary edema, and possible aspiration events in setting of upper GI bleed.
She completed a course for VAP and was diuresed daily to help with volume overload.
She was continued on CPAP nightly for OSA.
She was initially NPO and kept on aspiration precautions until time of discharge, at which time it was felt that tube feeds were not in keeping with her goals of care.
There, she was maintained on Diltiazem drip and then transitioned to oral Diltiazem.
In the ICU, she entered into A fib with RVR, and eventually needed to be put back on a Diltiazem drip when boluses did not break the RVR.
Patient converted into sinus rhythm and was weaned off the Diltiazem drip.
# Previous hypotension: Pt was normo- to hypertensive on admission, but she had lower BP's to the 100's after being started on a Diltiazem drip.
This was similar to what happened at [**Last Name (un) 4199**], where she developed hypotension briefly requiring pressors while on Diltiazem drip.
She was started on pressors after her drain was placed, and her blood pressure continued to improve.
She was weaned off pressors and did not require any further pressors while in ICU.
CHRONIC ISSUES:  # OSA on CPAP: was initially intubated, and then continued on CPAP at night while on the floor.
# Developmental delay/Paranoia: Held risperidone while NPO  # Chronic pain: Held gabapentin while NPO  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI .
PO lorazepam dissolving, instead of PO keppra given pt's gargling/choking on even 2cc's of liquid keppra.

You were initially in the intensive care unit on medications to help support your blood pressure.
A drain and stent were also placed in your gallbladder to open up blockages, help relieve pain and help drain the infection.
Unfortunately, our surgeons and cancer doctors did not feel there was a safe treatment for this disease.
Please note the medication list which is attached as there have been many changes to your medications in order to make you comfortable.
