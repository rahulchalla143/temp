Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: Mr. [**Known lastname 17881**] was admitted post-op from right parotidectomy and right neck dissection with right abdominal fat grafting performed.
His post-op pain was controlled initially with Acetaminophen and Percocet, then he was switched to PO Dilaudid with more adequate control achieved.
His home dose of Citalopram 30 mg PO daily was resumed on HOD#7.
His home dose of Trazadone was held post-operatively.
We restarted his home blood pressure medication, Toprol XL 25 mg PO daily on POD#0.
He was placed on telemetry monitoring, given three 500 mL fluid boluses with adequate response (blood pressure increased to 100s/60s).
His beta-blocker was discontinued due to orthostatic hypotension.
RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated at the end of the operative procedure and maintained his oxygen saturations without issue.
We also prescribed Albuterol nebs PRN given his mild asthma history.
On HOD#2, the patient acutely developed tachypnea to the 30s and desatted to 74% on 5L O2 nasal cannula, and eventually required a non-breather without improvement in his oxygen saturations.
He was given a loading dose of Heparin at 5000 U and a [**2149**] U/hr gtt was maintained.
On HOD#3 the patient had rapid accumulation of a right neck hematoma attributed to leaky vasculature in the setting of heparinization for acute PE treatment.
The patient was again intubated in preparation for the OR on HOD#5, in preparation for a re-exploration of the right neck with hematoma evacuation.
He was kept intubated for airway protection and successfully extubated on HOD#6 without issue.
He was weaned from nasal cannula to room air on HOD#7.
FEN/GI: Immediately post-op/extubation (from his second hematoma evacuation) the patient was started on clear liquids and advanced, without issue, to regular diet as tolerated by HOD#7.
He was maintained on NS @ 100 cc/hr until he was tolerating PO intake and his IV was hep-locked.
On HOD#8 he experienced some epigastric disomfort most consistent with reflux esophagitis/GERD, and he was started Famotidine and TUMS/calcium carbonate.
GENITOURINARY: The patient had a Foley placed intra-operatively, which was subsequently removed HOD#8 and he successfully voided without issue.
There was some note of a greenish hue of his urine in the MICU around HOD#[**4-17**], which was thought to be attributed to a porphyria.
Sliding scale insulin was maintained while on steroids post-op.
HEME/ID: Two right neck [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were placed intra-operatively and maintained adequate drainage until heparinization on HOD#3 when he was heparinized for acute pulmonary emboli, at which time the output of the drains increased substantially (> 300 mL per day).
Given the need for anticoagulation in the setting of acute PE, the drains were monitored closely.
On [**2160-7-13**] (HOD#3), the patient was continued on 1400 U/hr of unfractionated heparin for acute pulmonary embolus.
It was noted that his drains had substantial sanguinous output, and that a right neck hematoma was rapidly collecting, without evidence of airway compromise.
He was brought to the OR emergently on [**2160-7-13**] (HOD#3) for evacuation of the right neck hematoma, after two sucessful attempts of bedside hematoma evacuation (350 mL total removed) with a pressure dressing applied.
Post-op on (HOD#6) [**2160-7-16**], the patient appeared to have minimal residual serosanguinous output from both [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains, he remained intubated for 48 hours given some intraoperative supraglottic edema.
On HOD#9 his heparin gtt was discontinued.
Coumadin 5 mg PO daily was administered on HOD#8 and HOD#9, at which time his INR was maintained in the 2.0 to 3.5 range, with a goal of [**1-15**].5.
On the date of discharge, HOD#11, the patient was given Coumadin at 2.5 mg PO daily, which will be recommended as the home dose, per medicine.
The patient's post-op hematocrit dropped after his first evacuation of right neck hematoma.
He had received a total of 4 units of packed red cells throughout his hospital course.
The patient was maintained on Clindamycin 600 mg IV Q8 while the right neck drains were in place to bulb suction.
Famotidine was administered for GI prophylaxis given the steroid treatment.
