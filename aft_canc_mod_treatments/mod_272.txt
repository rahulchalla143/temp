Patient has been in remission for one year after induction and re-induction chemotherapy.
Patient has lifetime limit of anthracycline dosing which should allow for MEC induction therapy.
Concern by outpatient hematologist that patient may develop urgent need for chemotherapy in next couple of days, which is why he was admitted today rather than on Monday night.
Pt started induction chemotherapy on Tuesday [**2153-6-19**] with MEC which was dose reduced and given with HD support with the renal team.
His line was pulled and he was treated with vanc.
Another line was placed and the pt was doing well until on [**6-30**] he developed acute neutropenic sepsis with 3/3 bottles of pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Per ID he was on vanc, cefepime, vori at this time (d/c'd cipro as no need for double coverage for pansens pseudomonas).
He was started on treatment dose IV acyclovir for HSV consideration, although leukemic involvement was also concerning given the pt's suboptimal chemo regimen due to premature interruption as noted above.
He continued on Vanc, Cefepime, and Vori and slowly improved mental status until he was considered to be at baseline.
Once he had completed more than the full course for F+N and had been afebrile x several days and was no longer neutropenic, the vanc and cefepime were discontinued and the patient remained afebrile for the remainder of his admission.
On discharge he continued to be platelet and blood transfusion dependent, and will have frequent followups and count checks in outpatient clinic to transfuse as necessary.
The pt's cough was stable and he was continued on his home PPI as well as Voriconazole.
Patient's basline creatinine 3.0-3.5 after temporarily requiring dialysis with previous induction therapy for AML in [**2151**].
With MEC chemotherapy regimen, there was concern for further nephtoxicity.
As noted above the pt had HD support with his MEC doses which were also renally dosed.
At one point the cr increased from 2.7 to 3.1 and acyclovir was changed to PO dosing after which cr returned to 2.7.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 9025**], You were admitted to the hospital because you had a recurrence of your AML, you received 3/5 doses of induction chemotherapy which was stopped due to a blood infection.

After discharge, you will require continued transfusions and physical therapy.
