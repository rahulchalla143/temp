CXR: There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 83 yr old female with hx of CAD, recurrent endometrial cancer s/p recent debulking surgery who presents with chest pain and abd pain, hypotension and found to have colitis on abd CT .
Serial abd exams were performed; surgery was consulted and felt that given clinical picture of diarrhea with toxic granulations, and pancolitis, most c/w C diff colitis, therefore recs po flagyl, no levo and nonoperative case.
The pt was started on levaquin and flagyl on [**2127-7-2**].
D/c'd levaquin on [**2127-7-4**].
She was continued on IVF  NS at 150cc/hour given her poor PO intake.
No anti diarrhea meds were administered as this could worsen infectious diarrhea, could precipitate toxic megacolon in c diff.
She continued to have abdominal pain and was maintained with increasing pain medications and IV Flagyl.
The family expressed wishes that she not be placed on a breathing machine.
In addition they did not want any further surgery under any circumstances.
She was started on IV fluids with no improvement of her pressure.
She was started on pressors for hypotension and transferred to the MICU for further management.
She was also treated with levofloxacin, metronidazole, and Zosyn for broad coverage.
Prn morphine was given for pain control.
Volume depletion was felt to be contributing as pt had been taking poor po.
A central line was begun in ER to monitor CVP.
Her BP remained stable on the floor, and her central line was discontinued.
Levaquin was d/c'd [**2127-7-4**], and flagyl continued as C diff colitis was felt to be the most likely source.
Anti-hypertensive medications were held.
She again became hypotensive on [**2127-7-7**] at which time she was tranferred to the MICU for pressors and further management as above.
She was continued on aspirin and lipitor.
Hypotension could also be contributing, causing ATN, if she has been hypotensive at home.
Her medications were renally dosed.
