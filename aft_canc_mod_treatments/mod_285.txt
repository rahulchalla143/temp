Admission Date:  [**2142-6-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-6-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-9-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] is a 77-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2108**], multiple transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the lungs, status post partial left nephrectomy and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion for the past four weeks.
Patient's blood pressure also rose to 230/120 requiring intravenous nitroglycerin drip.
Once the patient was stabilized, he was transferred to the floor for further care and management.
CT and MI scan revealed 3 cm mass in left upper pole and a 4 cm mass in upper right pole and patient is now status post left partial nephrectomy for cancer treatment as of [**2135-6-30**].
Patient's end stage renal disease is likely secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as renal cell carcinoma status post left partial nephrectomy.
He is currently on hemodialysis treatment at [**Location (un) 1468**] Dialysis Unit on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule.
Patient is status post myocardial infarction in the [**2108**] and had recent chest pain in the past which has been worked up.
This work-up was done on previous admissions.
Patient is status post bilateral cataract surgery.
He is status post suprapubic prostatectomy in [**2139-7-31**].
Hemicolectomy for massive gastrointestinal bleed secondary to CMV colitis exacerbated by aspirin.

Shortness of breath:  The patient was transferred to the floor on the day of admission for further care and management, however, after a couple hours, he complained of increased dyspnea on exertion and had an oxygen saturation of approximately 80% on 100% nonrebreather with systolic blood pressure in the 160s.
At the Medical Intensive Care Unit, Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] was continued on oxygen saturation with nonrebreather and face tent.
He received hemodialysis on [**2142-6-12**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**] and had three liters of fluid removed with significant improvement of his shortness of breath, but still complained of productive green-yellow cough.
Given his rapid improvement, the patient was transferred to the floor on [**2142-6-13**] with further management.
On [**6-14**], the patient received another hemodialysis session with 2.6 kg of fluid removed to a dry weight of 66 kg and Epogen administered.
However, three hours into the session, the patient experienced a dull pressure type of chest pain with no radiation, however, it resolved with oral nitroglycerin and morphine.
Pulmonary also evaluated the patient and felt that he did not need an interventional pulmonary procedures done at this time as his pulmonary function had returned to baseline and seemed to be continually improving.
Coronary disease/Cardiovascular:  Patient's blood pressure on initial examination at the Emergency Department was a systolic blood pressure as high at 230, however, a nitroglycerin drip was able to control his blood pressure throughout the Medical Intensive Care Unit course and his medication was adjusted with increase in Lopressor and hydralazine dosage throughout the Medical Intensive Care Unit course helped keep his blood pressure in the 140s to 150s.
He was continued on his current cardiac regimen which included Lopressor, hydralazine and ACE inhibitor.
He also had his medications filtered through a PVO filter given his new discovery of a right to left shunt on echocardiogram.
It seems that he may not have had sufficient fluid removal in the past, therefore, we aggressively tested his lowest possible dry weight as tolerated and it seems that he may need to have a new setting for his optimal dry weight given his recent weight loss secondary to his metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
