Due to the patients rapid decline and multi-system organ dysfunction, he was made comfort measures only and expired shortly after extubation and cessation of pressor support.
He was continued on a heparin gtt for treatment of ACS and possible PE given A-a gradient.
Diuresis with torsemide was started for possible pulmonary edema.
He was started on vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin to cover HCAP.
He was continued on peripheral levophed with goal MAP > 65.
An HD line with VIP port were planned for HD and pressor support.
Coreg was held and a full dose aspirine was continued.
Given that his smear showed mature lymphocytes, it was felt unlikely that leukostasis would have occured until the WBC > 400K and therefore not the cause of his acute respiratory failure.
His tymor lysis labs were planned to be trended.
After discussion with the patient's family regarding his clinical status, including his wife, multiple children and grandchildren at the bed-side, the decision was made to transition him to comfort measures.
He was extubated, antibiotics, diuresis and pressor support were discontinued.
