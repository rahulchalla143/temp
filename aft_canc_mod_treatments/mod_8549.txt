Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.1 L/minand 2.8 l/min/m2, respectively, using a measured oxygen consumption of 252 ml O2/min.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the L-PDA with a 2.5 x 12mm MicroDriver bare metal stent.
Significant interval worsening of lymph adenopathy in the mediastinum, right axilla, supraclavicular region, mesentery, retroperitoneum and pelvis 2.
Tunneled catheter in the right IJ, and subclavian Port-A-Cath, with vascular collaterals at the right shoulder.
He was started on IV Decadron and transferred to the oncology service.

He received IV dexamethasone, Oncovin ([**12-3**]) and Bendamustine ([**12-3**]), and Rituximab ([**12-4**]).
His chemotherapy was complicated by pancytopenia for which he was started on neupogen and tumor lysis syndrome for which he received allopurinol and rasburicase.
Patient spiked a fever while neutropenic and treated empirically with zosyn and vancomycin for febrile neutropenia.
Patient remained stable and neutropenia resolved and so antibiotics and neupogen were stopped.
He had a significant stenosis of the LAD and posterior descending artery and received a bare metal stent to the PDA, as this corresponded to his perfusion defect on stress testing.
His carvedilol was switched to metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], and he was started on captopril.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Non ST elevation Myocardial Infarction End Stage Renal Disease Congestive Heart Failure Low grade non Hodgkin lymphoma  with possible high grade transformation Hypotension Neutropenic Fever  Secondary Diagnoses: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus    Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain.
You received a bare metal stent to one of those arteries (posterior descending artery) to open up the blockage.
We think the lymphoma became very high grade and so we treated you with steroids and chemotherapy.
After your chemotherapy you had another heart attack.
You also developed a side effect of chemotherapy called tumor lysis syndrome and we treated you with rasburicase and allopurinol.
You also developed low white blood cell counts and so we treated you with a medication called neupogen and antibiotics.
We made the following changes to your medications:  (1) Increase Aspirin to 325mg by mouth daily  (2) Added Plavix 75mg by mouth daily  (3) Added Atorvastatin 80 mg daily  (4) Changed carvedilol to metoprolol  (4) Added MS contin and morphine as needed for pain.
(5) Added nephrocaps for your kidney disease  (6) Added senna and colace for constipation as needed  (7) Added lisinopril 10mg daily    IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE PLAVIX EVRY DAY.
PLAVIX WILL PREVENT FURTHER CLOT FORMATION.
