CT abdomen shows no bowel pathology, no e/o ischemic colitis but did have a suprapubic tube at his left ureter, with increased hydronephrosis on that side.
Will likely need percutaneous tube per [**First Name3 (LF) 159**] so IR should be contact[**Name (NI) **].

The suprapubic catheter tip terminates in the distal left ureter, which may be related to the the hydroureteronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 yo male with neurogenic bladder and suprapubic cath, multiple past UTIs and urosepsis presenting urosepsis and L kidney obstruction.
# Urosepsis: Patient was initially hypotense to the 50's, treated with aggressive hydration, CVL placement, vancomycin, zosyn.
They placed a L nephrostomy tube with drainage of a large amt of urine, and replaced his suprapubic tube.
He should finish a 14-day course of zosyn for gram negative UTI.
He will be seen in [**Month/Day/Year **] for removal of his nephrostomy tube.
If he has [**Month/Day/Year **] clots, the suprapubic tube should be hand irrigated.
However, given his past h/o of diagnosis and that he is asymptomatic with these high [**Month/Day/Year **] pressures, he likely has chronic hypertension, which will need periodic monitoring.
# Acute renal failure: obstructive; improved with IVF and with nephrostomy tube.
# Leg pain: continued on home regimen.
# Decubitus Ulcer: stage II, not infected.. - Wound care consult - Continue Zinc / Vitamin C  # SLE / Vasculitis: Patient admitted with chronic steroids, presumedly for his autoimmune illness.
