Patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the CSRU where she stayed until postoperative day two.
She required significant chest PT, nebulizers, and diuresis in the early postoperative period but improved both her mental status and respiratory status and was able to be transferred to the floor on postop day two.
She began physical therapy at this time.
Both her mediastinal chest tube and right sided pleural tube were removed without complication on postop days two and three with reassuring follow up chest x-rays.
The patient then rapidly progressed and was tolerating a regular diet, her pain was controlled with oral medication, and she was ambulating without difficulty.
One concerning issue was her difficult to control hypertension and her dose of metoprolol was increased to 75 PO BID(she came in on atenolol 50 PO QD).
She was ready for discharge on [**1-16**] and a rehab bed was found so she was discharged.
