A pleurocentesis was performed in the Emergency Room, yielding 1000 cc of bloody fluid, with a post procedure chest x-ray showing decreased size in the effusion and no pneumothorax.
Anesthesia was called and the patient was electively intubated for airway protection.
An arterial blood gas performed prior to intubation with dagging was pH 7.22, PCO2 54, oxygen saturation PAO2 465.
A neo-synephrine drip was started with an increase in her blood pressure to systolic in the 70s.
On transfer to the Intensive Care Unit the patient had been intubated and on a neo-synephrine drip with intravenous normal saline running wide open through a femoral line and a PICC line.
An arterial blood gas done after intubation on assist control with tidal volume 400, respiratory rate of 20, FIO2 of 100% was pH 7.38, PCO2 33, PAO2 410.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and a right sided chest tube was placed, which drain 2 liters of dark bloody fluid.
On her laboratory examinations she was noted to be slightly more coagulopathic with her INR rising from 1.3 to 1.9, PTT increasing from 27 to 35 and fibrinogen of 93 with a D-dimer greater than [**2196**].
The patient subsequently received four bags of fresh frozen platelets and two bags of platelets.
Her ventilator settings were changed to increase her respiratory rate to 34 to allow increased ventilation after which her arterial blood gas improved to a pH of 7.1, PCO2 of 37, PO2 of 194.
After receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells, her hematocrit increased to 36.
Her sedation was subsequently increased along with her paralytics with a slight decrease in her blood pressure and peak inspiratory pressures.
Lasix 20 mg intravenous was given after which the patient diuresed 1 liter and her peak inspiratory pressures decreased to 35 to 40 and her systolic blood pressure decreased to high 90s.
On [**2200-3-19**] bronchoscopy with biopsy revealed malignant melanoma.
On [**2200-3-20**] the patient was started on palliative radiation therapy to her spine.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa and Penicillin cause a rash.
Gram stain of pleural fluid without any polys or microorganisms.
Arterial blood gas on the above ventilator settings were pH 7.22, PCO2 54, O2 465.
Endotracheal tube was at the level of the carina.
She was found to have a recurrent large right pleural effusion status post pleurocentesis with removal of 2 liters of fluid about one and a half weeks ago.
She is status post recurrent pleurocentesis today with removal of 1 liter of bloody fluid.
The patient was found to be hemodynamically unstable several hours after her pleurocentesis with hypotension, shallow and labored breathing.
After stabilization in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was hemodynamically stable after chest tube placement and resuscitation with blood products and intravenous fluids.
The patient was resuscitated with 10 units of packed red blood cells and 11 liters of intravenous normal saline.
She was initially placed on a neo-synephrine drip, which was quickly titrated off and the patient subsequently never needed pressors during her Intensive Care Unit stay.
She was also placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with intravenous Levaquin, Flagyl and Vancomycin to cover for the possibility of septic shock.
The patient had intermittent episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures into the 70s, which responded well to intravenous fluid boluses.
Toward the end of her Intensive Care Unit stay it was decided not to administer any more intravenous fluid boluses as the patient was becoming increasingly edematous, which was decreasing her chest wall compliance and impairing ventilation.
She was placed on AC ventilation initially with intermittent increased CO2 levels, which corrected with increasing respiratory rate on the ventilator settings.
A transesophageal balloon was transduced revealing that her increased peak inspiratory pressures were likely secondary to extrinsic compression secondary to her increased abdominal distention and decreased chest wall compliance secondary to chest wall edema from massive fluid resuscitation.
Therefore her positive end expiratory pressure was maintained at 20.
It was decided not to treat her with Lasix for her total body volume overload as she was felt to have leaky capillary secondary to an inflammatory response.
The patient was finally tried on pressure support of 15 with a PEEP of 5 and failed.
The patient was covered broadly with antibiotics with Vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl.
It was decided to not further broaden her antibiotic coverage and to follow surveillance culture results and treat accordingly.
She was given Tylenol prn for her fevers.
She was broadly covered with Vanco, Levo and Flagyl to cover a possible abdominal sources for sepsis.
She was started on a bowel regimen and eventually started stooling toward the end of her Intensive Care Unit stay.
She was placed on an nasogastric tube to suction.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable after initial resuscitation with blood products.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess hemodynamics revealing increased pulmonary artery pressures to 50/30, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22, with a cardiac output of 6 and cardiac index of 3 and SVR of 665 indicating that the patient was retaining sufficient fluid in her intravascular space, but was still demonstrating ............ physiology secondary to a systemic inflammatory response.
She was initially treated with 2 amps of sodium bicarbonate.
