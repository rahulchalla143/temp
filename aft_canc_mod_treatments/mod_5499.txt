Admission Date:  [**2165-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-5-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-8-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Trazodone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, transfer from 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic malignancy,  who presents from the out-patient gynecology unit with complaints of progressive shortness of breath.
Further work-up included an abdominal MRI remarkable for an enlarged uterus, thickened endometrial stripe, and a vaginal mass.
Smaller usual myometrial fibroids are seen elsewhere.
Pathology [**2165-5-13**] Vaginal biopsy: Poorly differentiated carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma, involving lamina propria of squamous mucosa.
Empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl were initiated to cover for a possible pneumonia or post-obstructive process, even though no definite airway compression or obstruction was seen on imaging.
The pathology from her vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and per Hematology/Oncology, systemic chemotherapy was initiated with Carboplatin and Taxol (day 1 on [**2165-5-14**]).
She required continued mechanical ventilation, without clinical signs of improvement.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted, and systemic chemotherapy was initiated with Carboplatin and Taxol (day 1 on [**2165-5-14**]).
Following initiation of chemotherapy, she developed febrile neutropenia, and antibiotic coverage was broadened appropriately with Aztreonam and Vancomycin in addition to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Caspofungin was subsequently added given persistent fevers without a clear source.
She was given a granulocyte colony stimulating factor to help count recovery.
Unfortunately, given minimal radiographic response to chemotherapy, lack of clinical improvement, continued requirement for mechanical ventilation with obvious discomfort with any attempt to wean, and grim prognosis, support was withdrawn at the family's request, and a focus on comfort measures was instituted on [**5-30**].
