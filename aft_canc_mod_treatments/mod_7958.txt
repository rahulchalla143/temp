Brief Hospital Course: # Shock: The patient presented with hypotension with systolics in the 70s-80s compared to his baseline of 120s-130s in the outpatient setting.
His pressures did not respond adequately to fluid boluses.
A PICC line was placed and he was started on dopamine initially.
Dopamine was switched to vasopressin given concern for his recurrent ascites.
A definitive infectious source was never identified, though SBP was excluded with 2 large volume paracenteses.
He was also given stress dose steroids.
Fluid resuscitation was performed with crystalloid and colloid without success.
Norepinephrine was added on the day of intubation added without improvement in urine output.
After a family meeting, the patient was made CMO and vasoactive medications were discontinued.
He was intubated for respiratory distress, self-extubated, and was reintubated for continuing respiratory distress.
Versed, fentanyl, and propofol were used for sedation.
A family meeting was held in the afternoon and the decision was made to make him CMO given his poor prognosis.
Urine output did not improve after large volume paracentesis or after fluid resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid.
# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient required 2 large volume paracenteses to manage his malignant ascites.
Patient's outpatient oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of worsening status and the decision was made to not be aggressive with interventions given his worsening prognosis and lack of tumor response to multiple biologic therapies.
Patient's family was called on the day of intubation and arrived in the afternoon.
Discussion was had with the family as well as Oncologist NP and Palliative care and decision was made to terminally extubate.
