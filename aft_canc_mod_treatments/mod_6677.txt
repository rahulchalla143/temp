Surgery was deferred due to co-morbidities and a percutaneous cholecystostomy drain was placed.
The patient was then discharged to [**Hospital 582**] Rehab with a plan for possible outpatient cholecystectomy once the inflammation resolved.

A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed given her poor surgical candidacy, and she was discharged to [**Hospital 582**] Rehab facility.
Her perc cholecystostomy tube was removed unintentionally at rehab.
She was referred for ERCP and decompression but this was unsuccessful as the scope could not pass the edematous duodenal bulb.
She was admitted on [**2141-7-17**] for management of her obstructive jaundice.
Uncomplicated right-sided PTBD with 8-French internal-external drain placement was performed.
A this point, EGD with duodenal stenting was performed on [**2141-7-21**], to bypass the obstructing duodenal mass noted above.
She did have poor ability to clear secretions and given her extensive hospitalization, there was concern for poor respiratory status.
In an effort to determine the source, the biliart drain was uncapped, revealing foul-smelling bilious drainage and laboratory studies, along with cultures, were obtained.
Given all infectious sources, she was fluid resuscitated, started on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn following obtained cultures and transferred to the surgical ICU for further care.
She was transferred back to the floor on [**7-25**] after clinical improvement and antibiotic coverage.
Her bile culture speciated MRSA which was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
On [**7-27**], repeat PTC was performed and PTBD demonstrated persistent dilatation of the left biliary system, thus metal stenting was not attempted.
Given these findins, repeat PTBD was performed on [**7-28**] and left and right metal biliary stent placement was successful, and IR left an external drainage route at that time given her previous cholangitic issues and MRSA infection.
On [**5-27**] her PTBD drain remained capped with her metal biliary and duodenal stents in place on cholangiography.
She was evaluated by physical therapy and was noted to be suitable for a rehab facility.
She was to complete a 2-week course of Vancomycin and Zosyn given her RLL pneumonia concerns and her biliary MRSA infection.
