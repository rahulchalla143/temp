The patient was emergently intubated, underwent plasmapheresis and started on Cytoxan, Danarubicin, Vincristin, L-Asp on [**4-2**].
Vincristine therapy was held at this time but then completed few days prior to discharge.
The patient was succesfully extubated but then required re-intubation for airway protection in the setting of declining mental status.
She required intubation and was successfully extubated one day later.
Beta-glucan and galactomannan were negative.
The patient was initiated on broad antibiotics, including Caspofungin, Vancomycin, Meropenem and Acyclovir.
She completed a 10 day course of treatment dose (10mg/kg) IV acyclovir.
Of note she underwent intrathecal methotrexate therapy.
Given her diffusely altered mental status without focal neurologic deficits, it was felt (in consultation with neuro-oncology) that the patient likely had a toxic-metabolic explanation for her symptoms.
On [**2146-4-27**] after an apparent grand mal seizure, the patient underwent another LP revealing RBC's in tube 4 on a non-traumatic tap.
Prior sediment in the ICU with hyaline and granular casts.
The patient was started on Metoprolol and Furosemide.
Repeat echo on [**2146-4-21**] revealed a normalized EF and beta blocker was discontinued.
She was started on heart failure regimen including Metoprolol, Lisinopril, and aggressively diuresed with Lasix.
The patient received treatment dose acyclovir (10mg/kg) for 10 days with improvement in respiratory status.
The etiology was felt most likely a drug effect, including a possible delayed chemotherapy effect.
Further Vincristine therapy was held.
Discontinuation of the acyclovir was considered, but, this medication was continued as it very rarely causes liver toxicity and its clinical benefit in the setting of a likely HSV pneumonia confirmed by BAL was clear (and indeed the patient was improving).
Vincristine was held in the setting of a transaminitis.
Likely medication related, secondary to L-asparaginase.
The patient was maintained on hydrocortisone and levothyroxine replacement therapy.
On TPN and steroids.
The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale.
Blood sugars normalized after she came off TPN and was able to take in sufficient PO.
All antidopaminergic agents, including haldol and zyprexa were held.
She was placed on continuous EEG though failed to tolerate the test due to agitation.
She was weaned off Keppra prior to discharge.
