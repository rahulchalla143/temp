Admission Date:  [**2149-11-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-12-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-2-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Bactrim Ds  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis and anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement Upper endoscopy  History of Present Illness: This is a 72 year-old female with history of marginal cell lymphoma and aplastic anemia who was admitted with concerns for sepsis and severe anemia.
She was transfused 2 units of red cells and received six liters of saline.
Given her persistent hypotension, she was started on a levophed drip.
Her urine culture from [**10-28**] grew strep bovis and coag negative staph, for which she was treated with levofloxacin.
Marginal zone lymphoma- She had six chemotherapy treatments with protocol 03-294 including fludarabine and rituximab.
She completed this treatment in 04/[**2148**].
Her treatment course was complicated by pneumonitis felt to be due to her fludarabine.
Cold agglutinin syndrome- She is transfusion dependant.
She also received retuxin at that time without complication.
Status post TAH and BSO 5.
Status post appendectomy 6.
Status post cholecystectomy 7.
Status post resection of parotid tumor- [**2130**] 9.
Status post hernia repair in setting of strangulated hernia- [**11/2148**]  Social History: She lives with her husband and had family in area.
Chest x-ray: Volume overload, probably right lower lobe infiltrate, right IJ catheter in place.
She was initially treated with ambisome and voriconazole for severe [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 99813**]; however, the voriconazole was stopped secondary to elevated alkaline phosphatase.
She was also continued on Acyclovir for zoster prophylaxis.
Bactrim was started for nocardia coverage, but stopped due to nausea and vomiting.
She initially received stress-dose steroids when she was admitted to the ICU, however, these were tapered during the admission.
However, a serum galactomannin, urinary legionella, and sputum PCP were negative.
She was intially treated with daptomycin and gentamicin for the VRE and was later switched to linezolid when she was not clearing the bacteria.
She was continued on linezolid, aztreonam, flagyl, acyclovir, caspofungin empirically throughout the admission since she remained febrile and neutropenic.
She had several drops in her hematocrit while she wsa hypothermic, and these drops were attributed with cold agglutinin syndrome.
Therefore, red cells were warmed prior to transfusion.
IVIG treatment was attempted for treatment of hemolytic anemia, but she had a febrile and hypertensive reaction to it.
She subsequently was treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for her aplastic anemia; however, she had a hypersensitivity reaction that required emergent intubation for 2 days.
She underwent ATG desensitization in the ICU.
She was maintained on supportive red cell and platelet transfusions.
She was maintained on G-CSF for neutropenia.
Hypertension: Initially, her antihypertensives were held in the setting of sepsis.
There was concern for intracranial pathology; however, head CT was negative.
Her respiratory status subsequently improved without intervention on several occasions.
However, one episode of paradoxical breathing required intubation and mechanical ventilation for 5 days.
She was transitioned to lopressor for both rate control and blood pressure control.
She was intially started on heparin; however, after further discussions with the family, it was decided that the risks of anticoagulation were not worth the benefits.
She was transfused as needed to keep platelets and hematocrit up.
10) FEN: She was initially on neutropenic diet.
11) Access: She had several central lines placed and replaced during her period of persistent bacteremia.
A family meeting was held and it was decided to continued supportive measures with antibiotics and TPN to see if her immune system could recover to counter the [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus and other infections.
