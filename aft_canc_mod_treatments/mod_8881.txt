She had received her PEG and tracheostomy the previous day, both without difficulty.
Her ventilator was on assist control, 300 by 6 to 10, 40% and 5, and then pressure support 25 and 40%.
On [**2104-3-5**], the patient was found to be heparin antibody positive.
Her tube feeds were held.
Her tube feeds were held at that time.
Flagyl was restarted for possible C. difficile recurrence.
At CT scan of her abdomen with contrast was obtained and revealed no obstruction and no perforation; the PEG tube was in good position in the body of the stomach.
Her antibiotics were changed from Ceftriaxone to Ceftazidime 1 gram q.
Because the CT scan was negative for obstruction and perforation and demonstrated that the PEG tube was in good position, her tube feeds were restarted at 10 cc per hour and titrated up to her goal.
Her ventilator was continued at C-PAP of 5 with a pressure support of 12.
Surgery felt that no surgical intervention was needed at this time and signed off.
She was bolused with 500 cc of normal saline which increased her urine output to 30 cc per hour.
Her INR was 9.4, thus her Coumadin was held.
Her antibiotic regimen included Vancomycin one gram q.
24 hours, day two for Pseudomonas; Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
Three times a day three for Clostridium difficile and Bactrim Double Strength which was twice a day 11, for Stent Atrophodermas.
On [**2104-3-12**], the patient's pressure support was increased to 15, PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 50%.
Her INR was 8.2 and her Coumadin was continued to be held.
She would not receive defibrillation, CPR or pressors.
On [**2104-3-13**], the patient's temperature maximum was 99.2 F.; her oxygen saturation was 93 to 97% on pressure support of 15 with a PEEP of 7.5, FIO2 40%.
Her white count was 13.3, her INR was 8.0, and her Coumadin was continued to be held.
Her sputum was found to have Pseudomonas sensitive to Ceptaz, Imipenem and Piperacillin.
Her Vancomycin and Bactrim were discontinued as a 14 day course of each was complete.
She was continued on Ceptaz and Flagyl.
Her Coumadin was restarted at 2.5 mg q. h.s.
Her temperature maximum was 98.8 F.  Her ventilator settings were IMV of 300 by 10, pressure support of 15, PEEP of 7.5, FIO2 0.6.
She was continued on Ceptaz, Flagyl and Coumadin.
She received one unit of packed red blood cells for treatment of her anemia of chronic disease.
She was started on Zosyn in addition to Cephrazadime in order to better cover her Pseudomonas.
She was weaned down to a C-PAP of 5 with pressure support of 15 for five and a half hours before being put back on an IMV.
Her Coumadin was held.
On [**2104-3-22**], the patient was switched to Imipenem from Zosyn and Ceptaz for better coverage over Pseudomonas.
She was given 5 mg of Vitamin K subcutaneously for her persistently elevated INR.
She had tolerated seven hours of C-PAP and pressure support the previous day.
Her Flagyl was discontinued as she was on day 15.
Her Coumadin was restarted at 1 mg p.o.
She was continued on Imipenem for a Pseudomonal pneumonia; she was continued on Coumadin 1 mg q. h.s.
Temperature maximum was 98.7 F.; she was resting comfortably on an IMV of 300 by 10, pressure support 10, PEEP of 5; FIO2 of 0.4.
Her examination was unremarkable with the exception of diminished breath sounds in the right lung fields and two plus to three plus edema and anasarca which was unchanged.
Her ventilator will be weaned to C-PAP and pressure support today as tolerated.
She will be continued on Imipenem for Pseudomonal pneumonia.
She was continued on Coumadin 1 mg q. h.s.
She was continued on her tube feeds at her goal rate of 40 cc per hour.
She has a PICC line in place.
Respiratory failure and ventilator dependent.
Prevacid suspension 50 mg per G-tube q. day.
Colace 100 mg G-tube twice a day.
Celexa 20 mg G-tube q. day.
Albuterol and Atrovent MDI, two puffs four times a day.
Imipenem Sandostatin 500 mg intravenous q. eight hours times ten day.
Coumadin 1 mg G-tube q. h.s.
Flagyl 500 mg G-tube three times a day for 12 days.
