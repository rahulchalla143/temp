[**2169-10-7**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: As before, patient is status post left parietal craniectomy and evacuation of the left subdural space.
Low- density fluid within the left subdural space measures 7 mm in widest dimension with persistent foci of high density mostly near the area of craniotomy but also along the left temporal lobe.
Surrounding soft tissues again reveal postoperative changes and skin staples in the left parietal region.
Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening and mastoid air cells appear well aerated in the setting of a right sided nasogastric tube.
Nasogastric tube remains in standard position.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M s/p L occupital craniotomy and evacuation of acute SDH s/p fall on lovenox, plavix.
Renal US showed moderate hydronephrosis with bilateral stents placed [**7-29**](known bilateral hydronephrosis).
Originally Cr had improved from 3.9 to 2.3 with hydration as a component of the ARF was thought to be prerenal; however, the creatinine began to rise again and the worsening renal function was likely obstructive in etiology representing advancing prostate cancer.
Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were placed and the patient's Cr improved to 1.0.
His percutaneous nephrostomies can be in place up to 3 months; if needed, his outpatient urologist can pursue revision.
UTI: UA was suggestive of UTI and urine cultures grew enterococcus sensitive to amoxicillin and pan-sensitive to all antibiotics on culture and sensitivities.
# RUE weakness: RUE weakness was present prior to SDH evacuation but improved with surgery.
SDH s/p L occiptal craniotomy: The patient was continued on seizure prophylaxis with dilantin.
Then increase to 750mg po bid for [**10-26**], then increase to 1000mg po bid on [**10-30**] and continue until instructed to stop by neurosurgery.
To avoid withdrawal seizures, he should continue on dilantin 100mg po tid until the keppra is at goal, at which time the dilantin can be tapered.
Thus, on [**10-31**] and 10, his dilantin should be decreased to 100mg po bid.
On [**11-2**] and 12, he should be given dilantin 100mg daily.
Cardiology was consult and the patient was found not to be a candidate for either cardiac catheterization secondary to cormobities or IV heparin secondary GI bleed.
Medical management for MI was provided with BB and ASA.
Plavix was held in the setting of his SDH, and he should not restart plavix unless cleared to do so by neurosurgery.
It is important that his sodium and potassium be monitored at least every three days until he is stable on his tube feeds.
He was turned and reposition frequently and treated for a fungal infection with topical therapy.
It is recommended that his PCP address the possibility of further imaging of the bladder as appropriate.
# Medication changes: Many of the patient's home meds were altered during hospitalization: - Flomax stopped as no longer necessary given nephrostomy tubes - HCTZ and Norvasc replaced with metoprolol in setting of recent NSTEMI - Lipitor stopped as patient had elevated transaminases, appeared to decrease after holding statin.
- Lisinopril stopped for ARF, restarted at 5mg daily at discharge - plavix held b/c of SDH; do not restart without clearing with Neurosurgery  Medications on Admission: aricept 10 ativan 0.5 prn flomax 0.4 hctz 12.5 isodil 30 lipitor 40 lisinopril 20 glucophage 500" norvasc 5 percocet prn PLAVIX 75 LOVENOX 40   Discharge Medications: 1.
