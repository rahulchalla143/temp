Her bleeding worsened after being placed on a heparin gtt for PE, and in the setting of acute Lupron injection but and she was followed closely by the gynecology service while in the ICU.
Given her continued bleeding, myomectomy and uterine artery embolization were considered, however after discussion with the gynecology team, decided that as long as Hct was responding, we should wait for Lupron to work.
On HD#6, her hematocrit trended down to 25 and she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells as the goal was to keep her hematrocrit >25.
Her hematocrit showed an appropriate rise to 29.9 and it remained stable after that time and she did not require any additional blood products.
#PE: She was continued on the Heparin gtt until HD#9 at which time, her vaginal  bleeding had decreased significantly.
On HD 9 Comadin was started at a dose of 5mg per day.
On HD 11 her Coumadin was increased to 7.5.
She was discharged on 10mg of Coumadin and her INR was 1.8.
She was instructed to continue the Lovenox at home until she was therapeutic on Coumadin (with a goal INR of [**1-19**]).
She was started on Gentamyacin and Clindamycin on HD 7 but her fevers continued despite antibiotic therapy.
The antibiotics were discontinued on HD 10.
A urine analysis was initally negative but on HD11 the urine culture grew Gardnerella and she was started on flagyl 500 twice daily to be continued for 7 days.
Her pelvic pain, also attributed to degenerating fibroids, was poorly controlled on percocet alone.
The addition of ibuprofen helped to control her pain but did not relieve it.
Indomethacin was finally started which adequately controlled her pain.
# Dispo: On HD 13 She was discharged home in stable condition.
Her pain was well controlled and her vaginal bleeding was minimal to moderate.
