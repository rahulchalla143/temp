Unchanged appearance of low-attenuation foci within the liver, which may represent metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 65 yo M with metastatic poorly differentiated CA which likely NSLCA, CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, recent cauda equina syndrome treated with xrt and dexamethasone discharged [**4-5**] returned [**4-6**] with hypotension, mental status change.
No specific etiology was identified for his deterioration, which was likely multifactorial due to his widely metastatic cancer and multiple medical co-morbitities.
