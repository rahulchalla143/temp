CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2134-5-17**] 10:29 AM FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Although this study is not tailored for the evaluation of supradiaphragmatic contents, the visualized lung bases show bilateral consolidations/collapse on the right greater than the left with air bronchograms and trace bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the left.
The esophagus contains an enteric tube and otherwise appears unremarkable.
The spleen contains a 2.1-cm hypodensity with internal fluid density of 19 Hounsfield units, likely representing a splenic cyst.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is decompressed by Foley catheter in appropriate position.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2134-5-28**] 2:50 PM NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position.
Left PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC.
Supplemental oxygen was used.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Other linear erosion on the greater curvature of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma Duodenum:  Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.
Impression: Esophagitis in the GE junctoin compatible with mild esophagitis Linear erosion on the greater curvature of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma Erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: No clear explanation for the patient's GI bleed from this EGD.
The procedure was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes at the operating room.
The bronchoscope was introduced through an endotracheal tube and advanced under direct visualization until the tracheobronchial tree was reached.The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Colonoscopy [**2134-5-31**] Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
Supplemental oxygen was used.
The appendiceal orifice and ileo-cecal valve were identified.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by the fellow and the attending.
All his at home antihypertensives were held clonidine, monixidil, isosorbide dinitrate.
His atrial fibrillation normally treated with coumadin and diltiazem at home became Afib with RVR likely 2ndary to anemia (rates in the 120s to 140s).
he was intubated and then was stablaized.
He improved afterwards and was able to breath off of the ventilator without hemodynamic compromise.
His EGD showed esophagitis in the GE junctoin compatible with mild esophagitis, linear erosion on the greater curvature of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma, erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis.
No clear explanation of the GI bleed was discovered and a colonscopy was recommened in 6 months.
# Supratherapeutic INR: patient is on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
He was given vitamin K 10mg IV and multiple units of FFP.
He was continued without anticoagulation due to the GIB.
At the end of the hospitalization his coumadin was restarted at his home dose and will be continued to be montiored and managed as an outpatient.
He was managed as above for coumadin and rate controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.
#CHF Pt required large doses of iv lasix and lasix drips to treat vol overload and lost over 19 kilograms during the hospitalization likely due to a fluid overloaded state and LE edema that resolved by the time of discharge.
#Hypertension: History of htn he was treated before with clonidine, Isosorbide Dinitrate, Lisinopril, Diltiazem ER, Metoprolol, and Minoxidil.
He was treated with clonidine, diltiazem, metoprolol mainly, but several medicines were used on a prn basis including hydralazine and a nitroglycerin drip.
We discharged him with lisinopril, metoprolol, clonidine, and isosorbide dinitrate.
[**Last Name (un) **] could be due to renal hypoperfusion [**12-24**] acute/subacute blood loss.
Outpatient management should be continued.
Patient managed on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient.
Managed with 10 units of glargine and a sliding scale, may be continued as an outpatient or transitioned to oral medications.
-continued home meds and needs to continue outpt followup  Hypernatremia -Pt required free water flushes to resolve his hypernatremia.
UTI- He was found to have a E.Coli UTI and we decided to treat for 7 days with ceftriaxone staring on [**2134-6-1**].
Transitional issues: Colonoscopy with GI within 6 months Gi says the flexiseal- would be best to avoid, but can continue for patient comfort/ skin issues.
[**Month (only) 116**] start glipizide when taking PO, now discharging on insulin per regimen in the hospital Diet per Page 1: pureed and nectar thick with cuff deflated, no PMV Discharged on subq heparin for dvt prophylaxis will read address the issue of anticoagulation as an outpatient Pt was send out on 7 days on ceftriaxone for a UTI end on [**2134-6-8**].
PICC line Hypertension medications may need uptitration Holding lasix as patient diuresed during hospitalization over 20 pounds and was borderline hypernatremic at time of discharge, during cardiology appointment, reconsideration of restarting lasix.

You received several blood transfusions.
You were also seen by the gastroenterology doctors who recommended a colonoscopy that showed rectal ulcers, which may be where the bleed was coming from.
Because you stopped bleeding your coumadin was restarted on discharge.
Because you were critically ill, you were treated in the intensive care unit and were intubated for several days due to fluid in your lungs.
Since you had the breathing tube in for several days and it had been replaced several times, we changed your tube to a tracheostomy, which is the breathing tube that was placed in your neck.
Since you cannot eat safely right now, you have a feeding tube in as well which can be removed when you can safely swallow.
STOP taking glipizide STOP taking azithromycin STOP taking Lasix  CHANGE dose of lisinopril to 20 mg daily CHANGE dose of isosorbide dinitrate to 40 mg three times a day CHANGE metoprolol to three times daily  START taking heparin shots three times a day.
START taking lantus insulin 10 units at night and insulin sliding scale with meals.
START taking seroquel 50 mg twice a day as needed START taking ceftriaxone 1 g daily x 7 days, starting [**2134-6-1**], given in the ICU.
