PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post right hip replacement.
Status post appendectomy 30 years ago.
Prednisone 40 mg po q.d.
Valium 10 mg prn anxiety.
Surgical repair was by subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis.
So long as she continued on her intravenous steroids, however, pulmonary status appeared to be okay.
Physical therapy consultation confirmed that she would need to have some period of rehabilitation following discharge.
By postoperative day six there had still been poor return of bowel function.
At that time the decision was made to start the patient on total parenteral nutrition.
Ultimately she was placed on a standing regimen of mineral oil and glycerine suppositories and then started having regular bowel movements.
Her diet was gradually advanced, her total parenteral nutrition weaned and her staples removed.
Physical therapy reconsult at that time confirmed that the patient would need and still need considerable rehab and that there had been some deconditioning during her hospital stay.
Pulmonary status had been stable on her intravenous Solu-Medrol and it was felt that this could best be weaned at the rehab facility.
Status post subtotal colectomy for large bowel obstruction.
