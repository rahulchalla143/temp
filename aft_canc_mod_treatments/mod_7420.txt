Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted with a serious diverticular bleed which required several transfusions and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The bleeding could not be stopped by interventional radiologists, but eventually ceased after severl clips were placed in your sigmoid colon.
As we discussed, you should stop both aspirin and plavix for now.
As you know, you take these medications to reduce your risk of stroke, but they do predispose you to bleeding.
The decision about whether to re-start aspirin and plavix requires careful balancing of the risks and benefits.
While you were here, you did not receive lisinopril or amlodipine.
Summary of medication changes: - Stop ASPIRIN and PLAVIX for at least one week; discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to re-starting either of these.
- Hold LISINOPRIL and AMLODIPINE until you follow-up in geriatrics clinic.
You should not have an MRI for at least one month.
