He received Levaquin 500mg IV x1, Vanc 1 gm IV x1, and Flagyl 500 mg IV x1.
During his time in the ED, his SBP decreased to 75-85, but increased with a NS fluid bolus.
In the ICU pt's BP remained stable w/ NS and he was able to be restarted on his antihypertensives.
His right nephrostomy tube was repositioned on [**9-24**] by IR.
The most likely source of his infection is related to his recent nephrostomy tube replacement given the time course of his symptoms.
He was initially covered for GN, GP, and anaerobic organisms b/c of a reported h/o abd pain.
His triple abx therapy was changed to levo (questionable pna) and liezolid (vanco was d/c'ed on [**2163-9-26**] when the urine sensitivities returned).
Right nephrostomy tube adjusted by IR on [**9-24**].
Tx remained palliative and the pt was set up with home hospice care to start the day following his discharge.
His oral hyperglycemics were held, FS were checked QID and he was covered with a RISS.
He was restarted on metoprolol and hydralazine once his hypotension resolved.
His SSRI was d/c'ed and his remeron was increased to 30 qhs.
He was given bisacodyl po and pr, senna, and colace as well as a lactulose emema with no improvement.
He was sent home with a prescription for lactulose enemas for home hospice to continue to use as needed.
