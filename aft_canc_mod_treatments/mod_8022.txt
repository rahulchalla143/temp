During his last admission he received a thoracentesis.
Upon discharge plan was for cardiac catheterization and evaluation for aortic valve replacement if his symptoms did not improve.
He was admitted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.
ROS: denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
# CHF, systolic - LVEF= 45 % # psoriasis # esophageal stricture # former smoking # cholecystectomy in the summer of [**2167**].

He required ICU-level care and pressors before he expired on [**2168-6-13**].
Pt was diuresed well on last admission along with a thoracentesis, and sCHF was not contributing.
Pt's DOE was most likely due to AS, and was evaluated for surgery as inpatient since pt was not able to tolerate outpatient appointments.
Pulmonary similarly thought the patient was high operative risk and would likely have prolonged time on ventillator, but agreeble to surgery - and would recommend bilateral thoracentesis prior to surgery or pigtail after surgery due to pt's signficant pleural efffusions.
Pt was then assessed for valvuloplasty and he underwent successful aortic baloon valvuloplasty [**2168-6-10**].
At the same time, two bare metal stents were placed in the RCA.
Patient was initially managed on vancomycin and zosyn which was narrowed to nafcillin when culture data finalized.
He did not tolerate dopamine due to tachycardia.
He remained on levophed but became progressively less responsive to pressors.
On [**2168-6-12**] a trial of dobutamine was unsuccessful and not tolerated due to worsenng hypotension.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened again to include Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Vasoprossin was added but MAPs did not improve above 50.
A family meeting was held on [**2168-6-12**] and the decision was made to not escalate care, including use of more pressors, central venous lines, arterial lines and more IVfs.
Cards proceeded with cardioversion which was successful.
Pt was kept on heparin gtt, and started on Dofetilide 250 mcg PO Q12H.
Patient was managed on a heparin gtt while in house.
He had a brief episode of Afib again after cardiac cath but this self terminated.
#  sCHF, chronic- EF 40%, goal was to maintain even I/O goals.
Pt was continued on lasix 20mg daily.
Pt was continued on Vitamin K 5mg until pt needed to be on anticoagulation for recent cardioversion.
Pt as C.diff negative x3 last admission, started on lomotil aferwards.
#  history of HTN - not on any hypertensives, low-dose ACEi and spironolactone d/c on last admission, likely due to cirhhosis.
He was started on Dobutamine drip but became tachychardic to 150's, tachypnic to 40's, and hypotensive to 60's, within one hour of administration.
# Code - DNR/DNI (briefly reversed for valvuloplasy and then re-initiated DNR/I)  Medications on Admission: - Vitamin K 5mg daily - MVI - Glipizide 5mg [**Hospital1 **] - Lasix 20mg daily - Fluticasone 50mcg [**Hospital1 **] - Lomotil 1 tab q6h prn   Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Critical aortic stenosis - Atrial fibrillation - Bacteremia  Secondary diagnosis: - cirrhosis - diabetes - systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none.
