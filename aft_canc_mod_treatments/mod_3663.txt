History of Present Illness: 59 year-old male w/hx of renal cell CA with lung mets diagnosed in [**1-7**] s/p nephrectomy and experimental chemotherapy who initialy presented to OSH with 3 episodes of hemopytsis and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma: Metastatic to lung.
S/p debulking nephrectomy at OSH on [**2184-3-1**], complicated by pulmonary embolism and near fatality.
Started on PROTOCOL:04-099 Avastin + Tarceva/placebo [**7-7**].
Hiatal Hernia repair [**2159**] 4.
Pulmonary Embolism after nephrectomy [**2-4**], treated with lovenox x 6 months, s/p IVC filter placement.
Colonscopy approx [**2179**] s/p polypectomy 7.
Oral Mucositis improved with decreased Tarceva dose and addition of prednisone and kelfex  Social History: Tobacco: quit smoking approximately 25 years ago.
The patient underwent emergent bronchoscopy and embolization of left bronchial artery on [**2185-4-30**].
Thoracic Surgery was called to evaluate the patient for pneumonectomy.
After consultation with Surgery and Interventional Pulmonology, the decision was made to proceed with a more aggressive embolization at this time.
Interventional radiology concluded that the endobronchial lesion seen on CT is unlikely the source of the bleed and therefore another rigid/flexible bronchoscopy was performed [**5-5**] for Argon coagulation of endobronchial lesion in left superior lingular segment.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and is now transferred to the medical floor on [**2185-5-5**].
The patient was started on codeine for cough suppression.
Because the patient was on codeine for cough suppression which could have masked his symptoms and because of his likely immunocompromised status due to malignancy/chemo, the decision was made to treat him empirically with a 7-day course of Levaquin.
His chemotherapy was discontinued on [**2185-5-2**] per his primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic in approximately one week at which time the need to continue chemo will be discussed.
H/o peri-operative PE s/p IVC filter placement in remote past.
Had a polypectomy in [**2179**].
However, the risks/benefits of anticoagulation will need to be reassessed if the patient remains stable from bleeding perspective as IVC filters do not offer long-term protection against PE.
