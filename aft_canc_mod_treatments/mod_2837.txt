HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the date of admission, the patient was taken to the operating room, where a subtotal pancreatectomy along with a splenectomy were performed.
The estimated blood loss for the procedure was approximately 600 cc.
Patient tolerated this procedure well, and was discharged to the Post Anesthesia Recovery Room in good condition with a nasogastric tube, [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, and a Foley catheter in place.
Given the patient's recent diagnosis of insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, the patient was placed on an insulin drip in the immediate postoperative period and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Diabetes consult was obtained.
Her epidural catheter was removed and her pain was then controlled with a PCA analgesic pump.
She also was tachycardic to the 120s and was therefore placed on a diltiazem drip.
The post intubation chest x-ray demonstrated congestive heart failure which was treated with intravenous diuretics.
On postoperative day three, the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.9%.
He was therefore started on Levaquin prophylactically.
The left upper quadrant [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed on postoperative day four.
The insulin drip was weaned off on postoperative day five, and she was subsequently started on a subcutaneous sliding scale along with long-acting glargine.
She was subsequently advanced to a clear liquid diet on postoperative day seven.
Given her splenectomy, the patient received a triple vaccine on this day as well.
She finished up a seven day course of Levaquin for her presumed pneumonia on postoperative day nine.
Her second [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed on postoperative day 10, and patient was discharged to home on postoperative day 11 in good condition.
Final pathology from her surgery was read as invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma, T3 N0 MX.
