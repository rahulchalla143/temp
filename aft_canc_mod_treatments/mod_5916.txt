He received aggressive fluid resuscitation, vitamin K SC, 5U FFP, 3U PRBC, and 1U platelets.

He was kept on Flagyl and cefepime for empiric treatment and his stool was sent for C. diff toxin.
He was started on a sodium bicarbonate drip and his minute ventilation parameters were increased in an effort to increase respiratory elimination of carbon dioxide.
