[**2157-9-9**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**9-4**], there is continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with less prominent vascular congestion that may reflect the PA rather than supine AP technique.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1005**] is a 61 yo M with refractory biphenotypic leukemia and history of disseminated fusarium [**Known lastname 2**], on Ambisome and voriconazole in the setting of prolonged neutropenia from induction chemotherapy.
He was recently transferred to the CCU for pericardio-centisis on [**2157-9-14**] and pericardial drain (pulled [**9-16**]).
# BIPHENOTYPIC LEUKEMIA: Initial therapy was included hyperCVAD.
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium [**Month/Year (2) 2**] in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.
He then received 10 days of decitabine (C1D41, [**2157-9-10**]).
Continued home neupogen to stimulate WBC in setting of fusarium [**Month/Day/Year 2**].
The patient then received MEC (C1D1 [**2157-9-24**]).
He was discharged with plan to discuss possible outpatient chemotherapy trials with primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Patient was maintained on the following ppx regimen: bactrim (switched from atovaquone [**10-17**]) and atovaquone.
Patient was started on daptomycin for VRE.
He spiked a fever in the CCU on [**9-14**] after placement of pericardial drain ([**Last Name 788**] problem #4), at which point empiric vancomycin and cefepime were started.
Per ID recs, daptomycin was discontinued.
Negative infectious workup, including UCx, BCx, pericardial fluid cx, and Quantiferon gold.
On [**10-11**], antibiotics were tapered to PO Levofloxacin.
He was discharged on Levoquin for ppx as outpatient, given his chronic neutropenia.
On [**10-19**], Ambisome discontinued with goal of pt returning home shortly not on ambisome infusions.
Patient was discharged on voriconazole.
Most recent beta glucan and galactomannan are negative.
Managed initially with diltiazem, then switched to metoprolol and diltiazem per cardiology recs, ultimately titrated up to metoprolol 37.5mg PO q6 hours and diltiazem 60mg PO q6 hours.
On [**9-14**] pt had pericardiocentesis with placement of pericardial drain, in the setting of starting anthracycline with potential for cardiotoxicity and worsening EF.
He tolerated the procedure well, with inital output around 500-700 cc and he was transferred to the CCU.
While pt had no respiratory compromise and maintained normal O2 saturations, there was concern for eventual compromise of lung expansion given severity of effusion.
BL chest tubes placed on [**9-22**], with drainage of about 2L on each side.
Pleural fluid analysis showed transudate with reactive inflammatory cells; bacterial/mycobacterial/fungal cultures and cytology negative.
Removed R chest tube [**9-22**], unclamped and removed L chest tube on [**9-23**].
He received IV lasix and PO spironolactone, transitioning to PO lasix and then ultimately discharged on only spironolactone 20mg PO daily.
# RV STRAIN ON TTE: After the pericardial drain was place and then later pulled, echocardiogram showed new significant RV strain and volume overload.
Found to be prerenal in etiology as well as from ATN, improved somewhat with IV fluids.
# ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA: [**12-22**] leukemia, as well as autoimmune destruction and splenic sequestration (pt with massive splenomegaly).
Patient requiring frequent (q1-2 days) [**Month/Day (2) **] and platelet transfusions.
Patient is maintained on Lamivudine.
Pt with mildly elevated LFTs during hospitalization, which improved after Bactrim was discontinued.
Given his thrombocytopenia, received immediate transfusion 2 units platelets.

Your treatment for the fungal [**Name5 (PTitle) 2**] was continued.
You were found to have a bacteria (called Enterococcus) growing in your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and on skin biopsy and so you were treated with an antibiotic called daptomycin.
You got several imaging studies of your heart because we were worried about the fluid around it.
You were given small doses of lasix to manage the extra fluid in your body and to help you breathe more easily.
You also had irregular and rapid heart beat (atrial fibrillation) which we treated with diltiazem and metoprolol.
STARTED metoprolol succinate 150mg by mouth once daily 3.
STARTED ipratropium nebulizer 1 treatment every 4 hours as needed for wheezing/shortness of breath 6.
INCREASED voriconazole to 300mg by mouth twice daily (from 300mg by mouth once daily)  Followup Instructions: Department: BMT CHAIRS & ROOMS When: TUESDAY [**2157-10-25**] at 12:00 PM  Department: HEMATOLOGY/BMT When: TUESDAY [**2157-10-25**] at 12:00 PM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], RN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/BMT When: TUESDAY [**2157-10-25**] at 2:30 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7779**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
