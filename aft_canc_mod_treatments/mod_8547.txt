On plavix for hx CAD, and given timing of symptoms with dialysis possible that combination of being on plavix and heparin flushes from dialysis +uremic platelets revealed a lesion in his GI tract susceptible to bleeding.
An IV PPI and desmopressin were started in the MICU.
EGD once again showed antral ulcers and duodenitis (biopsy pending at time of discharge) and Cscope showed 3 sessile polyps that were resected (biopsy pending at time of discharge).
He was also started on sucralafate QID X6weeks.
He will need [**Hospital1 **] PPI for 6weeks at least with GI follow-up for possible repeat scope to ensure resolution since he will need lifelong plavix +/-ASA.
Of note, at time of discharge, it was noted that his H.pylori serology that was previously negative had turned postiive by EIA, thus he was contact[**Name (NI) **] and Rx for clarithro and amox X2weeks was added (already on PPI [**Hospital1 **]) for triple therapy.
He was kept on optimal medical management with coreg and statin but his plavix was held.
Per cardiology and GI, we will resume plavix 10days after discharge.
H. pylori infection: The patient was found to have a positive H. pylori serology in the setting of gastric ulcers.
The patient was placed on a PPI for his GI bleed and started on two weeks of amoxicillin 1g [**Hospital1 **] and clarithromycin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Of note, his SC vein and IJ were fine and his HD catheter is functional.
He is advised to seek immediate attention if he develops worsening/severe swelling of L arm for concern for compartment syndrome, which would be an indication for catheter directed thrombolysis.
ESRD with complications of anemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism: The patient tolerated hemodialysis on Tu/Th/Sat while in house.
If the patient has not been receiving Epogen shots, one might consider starting them.
Patient should be started back on Plavix on [**7-31**].
