Further review of his history raised the possibility of an upper GI bleed, as it was determined he had been taking high doses of NSAIDs for his abdominal pain, and had unclear history of melanotic stools and/or blood-tinged emesis.
He was initially admitted to the Surgical ICU, where he was stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Extensive hepatic lesions (presumably HCC) with extensive mesenteric root, porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as mesenteric/omental implants and possible pancreatic and mesenteric vein invasion as described above.
Given the size and distribution of his hepatic lesions, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was determined to be not eligible for surgical resection.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also received an esophago-gastric endoscopy to evaluate his suspected upper GI bleed, anemia, and abdominal pain.
After hemodynamic and cardiovascular stabilization with transfusions as above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred out of the SICU to the surgical floor.
His liver lesions and clinical case was discussed during a multi-disciplinary hepatic tumor conference.
