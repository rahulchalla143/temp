HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 70-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer status post thoracentesis was admitted with increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure, was admitted for observation.
She was kept on Telemetry, her enzymes were cycled, and was given diltiazem as needed for blood pressure as well as rate control.
It was noticed on the day following admission, on examination patient had alternating loud versus soft heart sounds, bedside echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated a pericardial effusion, the patient was emergently transferred to the catheterization laboratory, where a pericardial drain was placed.
In the CCU, the patient continued to have intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation for which he was treated with diltiazem prn.
Due to her current bouts of atrial fibrillation, it was determined to start her on amiodarone in hopes of better control of her atrial fibrillation.
The patient was continued to be monitored in the CCU, the pericardial drain was removed on [**10-13**] without difficulty since the drainage was minimal.
Due to the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, with recurrent pleural effusions, as well as patient's symptomatic improvement post-thoracenteses, on [**10-16**], Interventional Pulmonology performed a left sided pleurodesis.
On the evening, the patient continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation in the 140s, even though she had been started on an amiodarone drip in the unit, and converted to an amiodarone po load followed by amiodarone 400 tid.
Thus she was given diltiazem x2 followed by a diltiazem drip which resolved in sinus rhythm, but hypotension.
The drip was discontinued, and she was given fluid boluses.
Of note, with the chest tube in place following the pleurodesis, the patient continued to have significant drainage of 350 cc per 24 hours, thus, more talc was infused via chest tube on [**10-19**].
The patient continued to remain comfortable.
In order to help control the atrial fibrillation, amiodarone was continued, and metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid was added for better control.
The patient continued to remain stable, and relatively remained in normal sinus on the amiodarone and metoprolol.
The patient was asymptomatic and feeling comfortable, but the chest tube was still in as of [**10-20**].
On the 4th, the chest tube was eventually removed without complications.
Patient did have an elevated white count, though likely due to a talc infusion, and the patient was afebrile, the patient was started on levofloxacin 500 q day as prophylaxis.
