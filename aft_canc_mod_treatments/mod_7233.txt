Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] was safely extubated following the procedure but experienced laryngospasm which required protective reintubation and admission to the ICU overnight on POD#0(reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
She required intermittent IV Dilaudid prior dressing change.
Pulmonary: The patient experienced an episode of laryngospasm following intial extubation post-operatively on [**2146-10-4**] which required immediate protective reintubation on POD#0.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
On POD#2 the patient's wound was noted to be expressing a significant amount of bloody ascites which was initially controlled with an appliance.
Given the large amount of continued treatment, the wound was re-inforced with suture and a hepatology consult was obtained to assess for liver disease.
By the time of discharge, the wound was healing well, with scant stapline line erythema but with no warmth, evidence of purulent drainage, or tenderness on palpation.
The patient was noted to have low-grade fevers on POD#5, but remained asymptomatic otherwise and, as she self-defervesced, required no further work-up at that time.
She was given several doses of Keflex immediately following.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
