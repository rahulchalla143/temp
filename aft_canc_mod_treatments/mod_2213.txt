A stent was placed and she was sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lanoxin, Norvasc, Zestril, Zocor, Allopurinol, Axid, Folic acid and multi-vitamins.
Postoperatively, she was placed on prophylactic benzodiazepine for possible delirium tremens.
She was also placed on subcutaneous heparin, Zantac, Testall and her pain was controlled with an epidural.
Initially, she was neo-synephrine dependent and she had very subtle electrocardiogram changes postoperatively.
The evening of postoperative day one, her epidural was switched to a PCA for better pain control; however, she was found to be over narcotized and required a Narcan drip to alleviate this problem.
On postoperative day four, she required some Lasix for mild pulmonary edema on clinical examination.
This resolved with upright positioning and the diuresis with the Lasix.
On postoperative day number seven, she was noted to have a large amount of wound drainage and her wound was open for copious amounts of somewhat enteric looking drainage.
All heparin was removed from her lines and subcutaneous.
We placed Venodynes on her legs for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and requested a hematology consult.
The hematology consult agreed with our management and furthermore, advised holding any anticoagulation, secondary to a risk of bleed, given that her platelet count was only nine.
Swan-Ganz was placed for fluid management.
She was actively resuscitated with blood products and fluid.
She was reclosed without any further intervention and brought back to the Intensive Care Unit.
We supported her blood pressure with pressors and fluids until her family could be fully present.
At that point, she was made comfort measures only.
