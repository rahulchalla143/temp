Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and chest wall tissue including portion of ribs, sternal tumor, resection (B-H):  Baso-squamous carcinoma, deeply invasive into chest wall, ulcerated, approximately 17 mm.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 20179**] came to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency room on [**2112-10-28**] for a large fungating, foul smelling anterior sternal basal cell carcinoma which was bleeding.
Initial bedside hemostasis was obtained with cautery, sutures and surgicell in the Emergency room.
Thoracic and Plastic surgery was consulted.
The patient was then taken to the Operating room on [**2112-10-28**] where he underwent radical sternectomy with wound vac placement.
He was transferred to the ICU intubated given the extensive change to the thoracic cavity for further management.
While in the SICU he required fluid challenges and neosynephrine for hypovolemia with good response.
He remained intubated and was taken back to the operating room on [**2112-11-2**] with Plastic and Thoracic surgery for Major reconstruction of chest wall, with right latissimus muscle flap, bilateral pectoralis muscle flap, local advancement flap 30 cm2, split-thickness skin graft to trunk 625 cm2 and placement of negative pressure wound therapy.
Drains & Chest tubes: Right and left chest tubes were removed [**2112-11-11**], with stable postpull films.
JP drains x 4 at anastomosis site remained with serousanguious drainage.
Plastic surgery will followup in a week from discharge for further management, including drains.
Nutrition: The patient was given tube feedings via dobhoff while intubated.
He was seen by Speech and Swallow on [**2112-11-11**], who cleared him for a regular diet with thin liquids which he tolerated.
Renal:  A foley catheter which was placed initially on [**2112-10-28**] and discontinued on [**2112-11-14**].
On [**2112-11-14**] the VAC dressing was removed, with instruction for further dressing changes with xeroform and light gauze fluff and ABD pads to cover, changing daily.
Initially he was started on Vancomycin and once the sternal wound cultures grew Beta-Strep A he was switched to Unasyn and Clindamycin.
Once the final Intraoperative tissue specimen consisting of sternum and tumor revealed a polymicrobial infection including MSSA, Pseudomonas, Proteus and B. fragilis on [**2112-11-3**] he was transitioned to a 6 week course of Imipenem for monotherapy of the above Polymicrobial Sternal Osteomyelitis.
PICC: placed [**2112-11-1**] 54 cm R basilic: CXR revealed the right PIC catheter ends in the SVC.
Neuro: pain control requiring ketamine drip with episodes of hullcinations and confusion.
Once the Ketamine drip was stopped his mental status improved.
His pain was well controlled oxycodone and tylenol on discharge.
His INR elevated to 3.3 on [**2112-11-8**] which he was given vitamin K for.
