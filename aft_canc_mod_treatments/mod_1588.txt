Right lesser saphenous (superficial) vein thrombosis.
The scattered small metastases which were previously seen on MRI are not visualized on CT, even after the administration of intravenous contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year-old male with stage IV lung CA with brain metastases initially admitted directly from [**Hospital **] clinic for enlarging left-sided malignant effusion and hypoxemia, admitted to the ICU for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, then transferred to the oncology service.
# Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma:  Cytology-confirmed diagnosis with widespread metastases, a tumor in the perihilar region of the left lung causing collapse and recurrent malignant effusions made his prognosis particularly poor.
In addition to management of his hypoxia and shortness of breath, the patient was initiated on chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed in an attempt to reduce his disease burden in the lung and thus reduce his symptoms.
This was treated with dexamethasone for a three day course and Zofran pre-medication prior to meals.
Placement of a Pleurex catheter was considered, however the patient preferred to wait to determine if chemotherapy could reduce his symptoms.
After weighing the risks/benefits of starting anticoagulation, it was determined that starting a heparin gtt with close monitoring was indicated at this time despite the known risk of intracranial bleeding from metastases.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was found to be elevated to 1.3, thought to be due to hypovolemia.

This was treated with heparin, an anti-coagulant.
Your shortness of breath required oxygen support.
During your admission you were started on chemotherapy.
Following chemotherapy you had problems with nausea, particularly in the mornings.
We treated this with anti-nausea medications prior to each meal and on an as-needed basis.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP Percocet - START oxycodone for pain.
- STOP hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, both blood pressure medications, as your pressures have been low.
- START miconazole powder for groin rash  Please follow-up with your physicians as listed below.
