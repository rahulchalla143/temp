Admission Date: [**2200-4-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2200-4-19**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD, ventricular tachycardia, status post implantable defibrillator with newly diagnosed right upper lobe [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for right main stem bronchus stent for recurrent ex vacuo effusion, status post thoracentesis times three.
He was then readmitted on [**2200-3-26**], for a recurrent pleural effusion, for which he received a pigtail catheter and consideration of possible pleurodesis.
Thus CT surgery placed a chest tube, which was accidentally pulled out by the patient during movement on [**2200-3-30**].
On [**2200-4-4**], the patient became acutely short of breath with drop in sense requiring non- rebreather.
Further decompensation occurred while the patient was transferred to the CCU and he ultimately required emergent intubation.
The patient's blood pressure decreased following intubation requiring IV fluids and Neo-Synephrine.
Echo in [**2198-11-18**], showed an EF of 50 percent, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; and a normal pulmonary artery pressure, history of ventricular tachycardia status post implantable defibrillator, right upper lobe mass diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, no endobronchial disease on bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital1 336**] (status post pleuracentesis, fluid was non malignant, MRI revealed mediastinal involvement, thus the patient was considered non- resectable; status post 12 radiation treatments in addition to a course of Paxil and carboplatin), hypercholesterolemia, and history of atrial fibrillation, taken off Coumadin four weeks ago.
Avandia 4 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Trazodone 50 mg p.o.
Megace 100 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
The patient presents with a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer identified as stage 3B squamous carcinoma with mediastinal involvement by MRI with a non- malignant ex vacuo pleural effusion and associated lung collapse, status post 12 radiation treatments and a course of Paxil and carboplatin.
The patient was activated with photodynamic therapy on [**2200-4-10**].
He required three subsequent bronchoscopies for removal of debridement from the right main stem bronchus.
Unfortunately, his lung did not re-expand following this intervention and the patient passed before any significant recovery could occur.
During his hospital stay, hematology- oncology was consulted to discuss further management as daughter looking to shift care to [**Hospital1 18**].
Discussion initially was made of further chemotherapy.
Radiation oncology was consulted and felt no further radiation was indicated as the patient has progressed through 12 treatments of radiation.
The patient presented with a right chest tube in place.
The chest tube remained water sealed.
Our hope was that this chest tube could be removed following the re-expansion of his lungs after intervention to open up his right main stem bronchus.
At the outside hospital, a chest tube was placed.
It was accidentally dislodged, but ultimately required replacement as the patient had respiratory decompensation.
The patient presented with blood pressure of 72/25 with a CVP of four on peripheral Neo-Synephrine.
He was maintained on Neo-Synephrine.
During this hospital stay, the patient became septic from likely pulmonary source and required increasing amounts of pressors for support.
He ceased to respond to IV fluid boluses and pressor-support was thought to be maximized.
The patient was maintained on all these medications till the time of his death.
The patient's beta-blocker was held due to his hypotension.
Thus, he was started on empiric ceftazidime.
Vancomycin was later added for persistent hypotension, but was subsequently discontinued when the patient was able to be weaned off all pressors.
The patient was administered GCSF in hopes of recovering his white blood count and this medication was discontinued when he was no longer neutropenic.
He was thus continued on his ceftazidime and vancomycin was restarted in addition to Cipro for double-pseudomonas coverage.
He was continued on Flagyl and his diarrhea subsided.
He was administered vitamin K and DIC panel was negative.
An ID consult was obtained and on [**2200-4-13**], mucolytic cultures were then growing yeast.
Ultimately, the patient's ceftazidime was discontinued secondary to drop in platelets and eminent death as this medication was thought to be doing more harm than good.
His creatinine came down with IV fluids and his urine output responded to fluid boluses.
Protein to creatinine was 1.0; FENA at that time was 0.9 percent with urine output of 423.
The patient was initially on a sliding scale insulin, however, he was quickly changed to an insulin drug for improved blood sugar control.
The patient maintained on PPI, subcutaneous Heparin, and neutropenic precautions.
The patient's nutritional status maintained with tube feeds.
As the patient rapidly declined near the end of his stay, despite attempted intervention and photodynamic therapy to improve his overall outcome, a number of family meetings were organized to discuss the patient's wishes regarding further intervention.
