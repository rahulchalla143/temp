BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1005**] is a 51-year- old gentleman with metastatic esophageal cancer with obstructive nephropathy caused by bulky lymphadenopathy with bilateral nephrostomy tubes admitted for weakness, tremor and hypocalcemia.
The patient was started on    calcium gluconate drip which was continued for 3 days.
He received Calcitrol empirically which    was stopped after 2 days upon the endocrinology team    recommendation.
Magnesium and    potassium were also repleted daily IV.
His electrolytes -    including calcium, magnesium and phosphorous - were    checked daily and repleted appropriately.
He did not receive any    chemotherapy during this hospitalization; however, upon    discharge he was planned to receive once again Taxol.
However, after    consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] it was thought that a    diagnostic thoracentesis was not necessary since the    patient did not have any symptoms of dyspnea or hypoxia,    and finding malignant cells in the pleural fluid would not    have changed his prognosis or management at this time.
PROPHYLAXIS: During his hospital stay the patient received    physical therapy to walk, PPI for gastric ulcer    prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Weakness, myoclonus, hoarse voice, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, esophageal cancer with metastasis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, bilateral nephrostomy tubes.
