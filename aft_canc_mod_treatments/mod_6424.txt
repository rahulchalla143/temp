[**2184-12-17**] MRCP: Status post right hepatectomy.
The liver demonstrates moderate dropout of signal intensity on out-of-phase imaging consistent with fatty infiltration.
Stable appearance of the resection bed hematoma (heterogeneous collection measuring 9.5 x 6.4 x 7.3 cm) as compared to the CT from [**2184-12-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2184-12-10**], she underwent  right hepatic lobectomy and cholecystectomy, with intraoperative ultrasound.
Consequently, further opiate medication was limited.
On [**12-14**] was tolerating a regular diet and started on Lasix for weight gain and edema.
She was empirically started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for the leukocytosis.
Patient received 2u pRBC on [**12-20**] after a decline in HCT to 24.4 as well as 2 u FFP for an INR of 2.7.
A Dobhoff was placed and tube feeds were started for poor oral intake.
On [**12-23**] L blood was noted from JP drain with a decline in HCT to 28.9 from prior 32.8 and was taken to OR for hematoma evacuation.
Two JP drains were placed.
Patient was kept in SICU following surgery for monitoring.
She required albumin and a fluid bolus for hypotension/low UO, pRBCs for HCT 27.5, and 1 u plts for platelets of 66.
On [**12-27**] 1 FFP, 1 plt, and vitamin K were given for an INR of 2.1, but there was no evidence of bleeding from the JP drains, which had decreased output.
That afternoon, she was noted to have worsening mental status and complaint of shortness of breath for which albuterol nebs were given.
She was maintaining her saturations at 96% on 2L NC and appeared more awake and responsive by the late afternoon.
At this time patient went into cardiac arrest and ACLS was initiated with pressor drip.
Bleeding was noted from drains accompanied by abdominal distension, with drop in HCT from 41 to 20, rise in INR from 1.6 to >3, and platelets of 33.
Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and patient underwent exploratory laparotomy at bedside by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but bleeding was unable to be controlled and patient required CPR and external pacing.
