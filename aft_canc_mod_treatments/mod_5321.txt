She also remained pancytopenic so was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, including daptomycin, ampho, azithro, atovoquone, and meropenem.
We increased her PEEP and decreased her tital volumes but were unable to provide adequate oxygenation.
She also was intermittently hypotensive and required frequent fluid boluses.
