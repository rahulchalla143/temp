Concern was for flash pulmonary edema and she was started on a nitro drip and BIPAP with improvemnet.
Following intubation, the patient's BPs fell and a CVL was placed for norepinephrine.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam: Vitals: 97 110/68 80 22 100% intubated, CVP 4 General: Intubated and sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated Lungs: Rhoncorous breath sounds throughout, breath sounds on left may be transmitted sounds.
Echocardiography should be considered as clinically indicated.
Patchy opacities in the right lung could represent aspiration or infection.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-7-4**] at 10:23:49 AM  Impression: moderate pericardial effusion; no chamber collapse but this may be absent despite the presence of high intrapericardial pressures when severe pulmonary hypertension is also present; apical hypokinesis of the left ventricle, with apical ballooning of the right ventricle (consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with right ventricular as well as left ventricular manifestation)  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2138-7-3**]  10:32:14 AM   Sinus rhythm.

Cytologic brushings returned positive for neuroendocrine tumor cells, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, though could not definitively rule out small cell, particularly based on bronchoscopy visualization.
Patient was extubated [**2138-7-11**]; decision for comfort measures only was made on [**2138-7-12**], and she passed away [**2138-7-13**].

She was made comfort measures only on [**2138-7-12**] and passed away on [**2138-7-13**].
Patient required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressures on presentation and was weaned off within two days.
She did require intermittent norepinephrine over the next several days as well, though this was temporally associated with midazolam dosing.
Patient was made DNR/DNI by family mid-way through the hospitalization and made comfort measures only on [**2138-7-12**] after extubation.
