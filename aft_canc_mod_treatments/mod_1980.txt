There was concern for a possible pneumonia based on the left lower lobe opacity, in addition to a meningitis.
She had a lumbar puncture in the unit, she was covered with Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir and Vancomycin until her CSF Gram stain results were negative.
Since her CXR was suggestive of a pneumonia, she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
However, on Zosyn she developed a right focal motor seizure in her arm, so this was discontinued, and she was started on Ceftazidine.
She was initially loaded on Dilantin and then maintained on Dilantin and Keppra.
It is however, not necessary to eliminate the focal motor seizures completely with benzodiazepines because these agents may compromise her airways.
Code Blue was called and she was not able to be resusitated despite aggressive CPR measures.
