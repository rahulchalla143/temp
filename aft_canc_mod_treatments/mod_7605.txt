For his HCV, he had been treated with ribavirin and interferon, without response.
Several additional nodules which are subcentimeter in size, are also concerning for HCC but too small for definitive imaging  diagnosis.
Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
CLINICAL INDICATION: 60-year-old man with hepatitis C status post TACE procedure, elevated and rising bilirubin of unclear etiology.
The gallbladder is nondistended and demonstrates diffuse gallbladder wall thickening measuring up to 3 mm, stable from prior CT examination.
Final Report INDICATION: Altered mental status, status post chemoembolization procedure.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis following administration of intravenous contrast with multiplanar reformations.
CT ABDOMEN: An enteric tube is in place with tip extending to the stomach.
Two subcentimeter hypodense lesions are seen within liver, segments [**Doctor First Name 690**] (2, 14) and IVb (2, 21), too small to fully characterize.

A rectal tube is in place.
Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, varices, and small ascites, consistent with portal hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSION 60 y/o M with recently diagnosed multifocal HCC, s/p selective segment VI + right lobar TACE [**2162-2-15**].
He became hypertensive at the the end of the procedure, thought to be due to pain with BP up to SBP 200, controlled with dilaudid, toradol for pain and hydralazine.
Pt with persistent nausea/vomiting/pain post procedure and marked increase in transaminases and bilirubin and developed encephalopathy and hypoxia, see below.
Pt started on vanc/ctx/flagyl initially, then broadened to vanc/zosyn.
Tube feeds were started via NG.

A 13 days course of vanc/zosyn for HAP was finished on [**3-6**].
Patient started on spironolactone and furosemide.
Pt was given IV vitamin K and this remained stable.

Pt was given slow rate D5W with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
# Hepatocellular carcinoma s/p TACE: s/p selective segment VI and right lobar TACE.
