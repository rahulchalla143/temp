During this period of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he was status post AML and ALL treatment.
He subsequently was experiencing a fever with no known source and was started on Levaquin on [**2170-2-13**].
The patient remained febrile for the next two days and was begun empirically on cefepime 2 grams IV q.d.
and vancomycin 1 gram IV b.i.d.
The patient continued to spike to approximately a temperature of 102 to 103 daily and AmBisome was added on as well at 450 mg IV q.d.
However, everything returned negative except for one positive C. difficile toxin which was positive.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
The patient was begun on high-dose Ara-C treatment as well given that his fevers may have been secondary to active leukemia.
The patient with all of these treatments began to defervesce spontaneously.
It was unclear whether the patient's resolution of fever was secondary to the cefepime, vancomycin, AmBisome, Flagyl, or his other standing medications which included acyclovir and Nystatin or whether his resolution of fever was secondary to his chemotherapeutic regimen which included high-dose Ara-C.
The patient had also complained of occasional left ear fullness which resolved after an otoscopic examination.
He had been tolerating his chemotherapeutic regimen well and his counts had decreased to expected limits.
He had required transfusions of packed red blood cells and of platelets but remained stable throughout this time.
