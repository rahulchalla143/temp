Do not suspect current ichemia given lack of ST changes during hospitalization.
Pt was continued on home regimen of Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, ASA  # PUMP: During admission pt was noted to be hypervolemic on examination with diffuse crackles on pulmonary auscultation, mixed 2+ edema in b/l lower extremities.
Pt was started on a Furosemide gtt for diuresis and then transitioned to a PO regimen of Furosemide 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
On day of transfer pt was noted to have SOB with a rate in the 140s after which she received IV Metoprolol 5mg Tartrate with response of heart rate within 100-120.
Pt was changed to Metoprolol 100mg Taretrate TID, a heart rate of 100-120 was tolerated given the presence of hypoxia, pulmonary HTN, pericardial effusion.
Pt was restarted on her Coumadin prior to discharge.
Suspect that the collection has always been present but hidden from prior Echos because of the pericardial fluid superimposed around it.
Per Psych recommendations pt was started on Seroquel at bedtime.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has a history of Pulmonary HTN per transfer summary, it appears she was started on oxygen last [**Month (only) 359**] for it but has never been worked up.
Her reason for transfer was due to her noted pulmonary pressures in the 90s-100s on Echo, right heart cath was performed to determine whether etiology is cardiac versus Pulmonary.
I clinically suspect that there are two processes going on - acute and chronic.
Pt has OSA and is intermittently non-adherent to it which is likely a component, pt also has a smoking history and may have a COPD component too (no PFTs available).
Arthritis, Lupus may also cause pulmonary HTN particularly given her pericardial effusion, pleural effusion.
Chronic PEs is another diagnosis to consider however prior to this transfer she had been on Coumadin for her A. fib.
- Recommend pt set up Pulmonary appointment for Pulmonary HTN work up - pt discharged onb home regimen of 2l NS to be worn at all times - encouraged pt to continue her CPAP at home  # Leukocytosis: Pt has history of leukocytosis from her myelodysplastic syndrome.
Likely due to her MDS as she did not show any signs of infection during admission.
# HTN: Pt was continued on Amlodipine and Metoprolol.
# GERD: Pt was continued on Omeprazole and Maalox PRN.
# Depression: Pt was conrinued on her home regimen of Fluoxetine daily.
