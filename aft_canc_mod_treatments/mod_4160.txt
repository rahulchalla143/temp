Unchanged severe systemic hemosiderosis involving the liver, spleen, pancreas, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow.
Little change to bilateral pleural effusions, moderate intra-abdominal ascites, and diffuse third spacing.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 28-year-old gentleman with AML s/p 3 allo transplants with recurrence, most recently a DLI and SCR, who presents to [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and bilateral rib pain.
Upon admission, patient was started on empiric Levaquin, continued cyclosporine, antifungal prophylaxis, and acyclovir.
Patient was put on daptomycin and meropenem in addition to Voriconazole and Flagyl.
Patient had 2 negative c.diff cultures but 3rd was positive, so patient was started on PO Vanc and IV flagyl.
Cyclosporine was started [**2136-9-27**].
Still required some IVF boluses.
Was on steroids, tapered from 30 to 15 IV bid, PO Vanc, IV Meropenem, IV Flagyl, IV Cyclosporine, IV Vori, IV Acyclovir.
WEEK2 Merrem was stopped and Cipro started.
Steroids were increased to 40 IV bid.
WEEK 3 [**Known firstname 16376**] was started on a Fentanyl PCA.
A paracentesis was performed and a significant amount of fluid was removed.
Steroids were increased to 80mg IV bid (2mg/kg).
[**Known firstname 16376**] was taken to the ICU where he was started on a Dilt drip, Cefepime, Linezolid, and restarted on PO Vanco.
WEEK 4 [**Known firstname 16376**] was still having 2-3L of copious diarrhea and LFTs continued to rise.
[**Known firstname 62550**] hematocrit remained fairly stable through these bleeding episodes, but he intermittently required transfusions of PRBCs.
[**Known firstname 16376**] was given lasix on a day-to-day basis with good results.
It would have been difficult to obtain access through the jugular veins, and a percutaneous biops was much too risky.
[**Known firstname 16376**] did however go for a therapeutic paracentesis; about 4.5 liters of ascites were removed with profound symptomatic relief.
He was started on anti-diarrheal medications with minimal relief.
Lasix was continued for volume overload.
Patient also received Rituxan for treatment of GVHD.
Rituxan and enbrel were stopped, and focus became on treatment of adenovirus.
[**Known firstname 16376**] was given cidofovir on [**11-1**]--after pre and post hydration with IVF and probenecid for nephro-protection.
Week 7: [**Known firstname 62550**] mental status started to decline this week due to profound hepatic/toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
Family meeting was held on [**11-7**], and decision was made to make [**Known firstname 16376**] DNR/DNI.
Bicarbonate down; BUN, creatinine, INR, and bilirubin all up.
Liver team suggested starting rifaxamine and increasing ursodiol (however, patient was too weak to take either).
Small dose of ativan given and symptoms eventually resolved.
Medications on Admission: Acyclovir Cyclosporine Folic Acid Ativan Morphine 15mg Ondansetron Pantoprazole Pentamidine [Nebupent] Posaconazole [Noxafil] Prochlorperazine [Compazine] Ursodiol Multivitamin  Discharge Medications: None.
