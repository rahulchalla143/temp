On the day of admission, she felt worsening dyspnea and palpitations without chest pain, fevers, syncope, chills, nausea, vomitting.
She was initially on diltiazem drip which was transitioned to oral diltiazem on the floor, during which time she was in NSR  Today patietn underwent bronchoscopy which revealed near total collapse of the left mainstem bronchus and 50% collapse of the bronchus intermedius.

Cells are negative for cytokeratin AE1/3  IMAGES/STUDIES:  ECG [**2104-5-9**]: Atrial flutter with variable ventricular response or atrial fibrillation.
No other finding to explain palpitations.
CXR [**2104-5-9**]: IMPRESSION: Nasogastric tube in satisfactory position, some upper mediastinal shift.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY 51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**], presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, weight loss found to have large mediastinal mass that completely collapsed her left main-stem bronchus.
She was admitted to the ICU after she required intubation for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.
She remained intubated for the duration of her hospitalization, save for multiple self-extubations with subsequent respiratory failure on non-invaive ventillation.
She received palliative chemotherapy and 10 doses of XRT to attempt to re-expanded her collapsed lung.
She was ultimately terminally extubated and placed on comfort measures.
BY PROBLEM # Mediastinal Mass: She was admitted to ICU following brochoscopy where she remained intubated given the findings of significant compression to the left mainstem bronchus with bleeding periprocedurally.
The hematology oncology service was consulted and brain and abdominal imaging for staging were obtained.
The interventional pulmonary service was consulted to evaluate for possible stent placemement but felt she was not a candidate.
She was admitted to the ICU after she required intubation for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.
She remained intubated for the duration of her hospitalization, except for several self-extubations with subsequent respiratory failure on non-invaive ventillation.
She received palliative chemotherapy and 10 doses of XRT to attempt to re-expanded her collapsed lung.
Ultimately, this was unsuccessful and the patient was terminally extubated and placed on comfort measures.
She was started emperically on vancomycin and zosyn, which was later changed to vancomycin and unasyn after sputum culture grew Moraxella.
Vancomycin was discontinued and she finished a 10 day course of unasyn without recurrence.
# Atrial Flutter: On the floor, She had an episode of rapid ventricular rate post-procedurally and was started on PO diltiazem.
She spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm, which she maintained during her hospitalization.
She spent most of the day in 3:1 block but occasionally required Diltiazem boluses for 2:1 block.
