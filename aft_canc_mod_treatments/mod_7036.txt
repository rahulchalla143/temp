An epiaortic scan showed and anterior rim of calcification and the canulation and cross clamp site were adjusted accordingly.
POSTBYPASS: The patient is receiving epinephrine at 0.05 ucg/kg/min.
LV systolic function appears marginally improved in the setting of inotropes (LVEF25-30%).
The is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the mitral position.
An agitated saline bubble study revealed no intraatrial shunt at rest of with Valsalva and release.

Per renal recommendations, he is to stay on Lasix 40 IV BID until edema decreases and then go to Lasix 40 IV daily with renal follow up in 6 weeks.
He was anticoagulated for post operative atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA due to LV thrombus.
His Coumadin was held POD 9, as the patient had epistaxis.
Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he recommended continuing the Coumadin once discharged with INR goal 2-2.5 (epistaxis had resolved at the time of discharge).
