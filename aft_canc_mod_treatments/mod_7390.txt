For serious infections, repeat culture and sensitivity testing may          therefore be warranted if third generation cephalosporins were          used.
Brief Hospital Course: 47F with metastatic breast cancer and herceptin-induced cardiomyopathy, now with Serratia hypotension/sepsis.
1) Sepsis: Patient had porta-cath removed by general surgery on hospital day 2, and was weaned off pressors by hospital day 3.
By hospital day 4, blood cultures speciated Serratia with a high possibility of developing resistance to third generation cephalosporins, and so antibiotics were changed to ciprofloxacin and cefepime, and vancomycin was discontinued.
Infectious disease was briefly consulted with regard to the organism and treatment course.
Consultants advised that single therapy with a third generation cephalosporin should be avoided given the theoretical possibility of inducible beta-lactamase.
Therefore, it was recommended that patient be initiated on a course of oral levofloxacin to continue treatment as outpatient.
Patient continued to be hemodynamically stable and afebrile and was discharged home with a course of oral levofloxacin and to return to clinic a week following discharge.
However, patient's coumadin was held in order to allow removal of the portacath.
Following stabilization in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on day 3, coumadin therapy was reinitiated.
Consideration was given to decreasing patient's dose of coumadin given her antibiotic therapy, however, at the time of discharge, patient's INR was 1.6, and it was felt that patient would likely reach therapeutic range during the week before returning to clinic.
Patient was to return to clinic for evaluation for chemotherapy a week following discharge.
She was instructed to continue taking levofloxacin for 10 days following discharge, to continue taking all of her outpatient medications except for antihypertensives, and to follow up with her oncologist a week following discharge.
