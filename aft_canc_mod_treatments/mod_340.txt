He had a post-op SBO and is s/p ex-lap with clot evaluation, lysis of adhesions on [**2128-9-7**].
He ultimately had a j-tube placement for nutrition; however, he did not tolerate tube feed and was placed on TPN.
He was found to have e.coli and enterococcus bacteremia and was started on vancomycin/zosyn, ultimately narrowed to zosyn only.
He was seen by cardiology and placed on metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.
The patient has been started on lovenox (given that this occured while on coumadin).
Respiratory status currently improved, weaned to nasal cannula use at night as he does not use CPAP for his OSA.
Vancomycin and meropenem were completed [**2128-10-14**] (which will complete a 2-week course for bacteremia and 10 days for presumed hospital-acquired PNA).
Likely sources for bacteremia included PICC and urine.
Other antibiotics given during hospitalization: - Cefepime ([**9-28**] - [**9-30**]) - Zosyn ([**9-30**] - [**10-4**]) - Vancomycin ([**9-28**] - [**10-1**]; [**10-4**] - 25) - Meropenem ([**10-5**] - [**10-14**])  (2) DVT: Pt with LENI showing occlusive thrombus in the left posterior tibial vein.
Heme/onc evaluated patient and recommended anticoagulation with lovenox, given that this clot occurred while on coumadin.
Discused with cardiology, given mechanical valve, and they agreed but recommended following factor Xa levels.
(4) Bladder Cancer s/p Radical Cysoprostatectomy: Ileal conduit has been funtioning well and training for routine ostomy care has been carried out by Ostomy nurse specialist.
(7) Nutrition: Tolerating tube feeds at goal.
(9) Anemia: Felt to be multifactorial, including AOCD and multiple surgeries and poor nutrition due to lack of diet/po intake.
At discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 9908**] was not taking any pain medications, he was tolerating tube feeds at goal and having bowel movements, ambulating with walker AND with assistance.
He was using nasal canula overnight in lieu of CPAP and he was making good urine.
