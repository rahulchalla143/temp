The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**2166-3-31**] following an admission to [**Hospital1 882**] for left leg hematoma with INR 19 s/p fasciotomy [**2166-2-22**] which was c/b DVT in hematoma for which she was restarted on coumadin and underwent repeat surgery [**2166-3-24**].
She specifically refuses cpr, intubation, EGD, interventional lines, embolization but does want dialysis and blood-products in the short term.
If her GIB does not resolve quickly, she wishes to have comfort the main goal of care, including discontinuation of HD and blood products.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for hematemesis/UGIB in setting of anti-coagulation for DVT as well as permanent afib with course complicated by E. Coli bacteremia, rapid afib, hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
However, upon further conversation with the patient regarding code status and goals of care, the patient reported to the treating team that she did not want invasive procedures including resuscitation, intubation or EGD.
In the setting of a supratherapeutic INR the patient did exeprience some bloody discharge from her rectal tube which was self limiting without Hct drop.
The patient required intubation on [**4-10**] because of impending respiratory failure.
During that time period, the patient had daily HD with removal of multiple liters of fluid.
S/p extubation there was some concern for ongoing respiratory insufficiency w/ hypercarbia although the patient was mentating well.
The patient was initally put on face mask for transition and eventually weaned to NC.
The patient was initially maintained on 2L NC with recent increasing O2 needs to 3L and postional desats.
Subsequent sensitivites revealed however only partial sensitivity to Zosyn for which Abx therapy was tailored to ceftriaxone, dosed with HD.
It was initially suspected in the ICU that this was a line related infection for which the patient's dialysis line was pulled on [**2166-4-11**] although tip culture never grew any bacteria.
The patient subsequently had complete ID workup including repeat blood,urine, and sputum cultures.
The patient rapidly cleared her cultures with treatment and all surveillance cultures subsequently have been negative.
The patient was treated with oral Flagyl as well as oral Vancomycin given persistently elevated white count a and is currently on both with planned treatment duration of three weeks.
The patient's white count is currently slowly trending downward, most recently 28.5 from peak of 50, likely representing response to therapy with regards to C. Diff infection.
The patient's rate control medications were up titrated and she has now been continued throughout her course on Diltiazem 60mg qid as well as metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid with imperfect rate control with heart rate ranging 100-115.
Given history of DVT as well as persistent afib the decision was made to continue anticoagulation but with goal to maintain anti-coagulation at the lower end of therapeutic.
The patient was maintained on a Heparin gtt with goal PTT of 60 throughout her hospital course.
Since placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter, the patient has begun transition back to coumadin and should continue of Heparin gtt with gaol PTT 50-70 until a therapeutic INR is achieved.
ESRD: As previous in the setting of volume overload and respiratory failure the patient was receiving qd dialysis for volume removal upon establishment of euvolemia the patient continued to recieve HD as needed.
The patient was maintained on nephrocaps.
The patient was given small boluses as needed and efforts were maintained to control heart rate as above.
The patient's temporary HD catheter was reported to be functioning imperfectly.
As surveillance cultures had remained negative > 48 hours and the patient remained afebrile, her hemodialysis catheter was replaced on [**2166-4-24**].
DM2 - The patient was maintained with Lantus 5 Units at breakfast with additional ISS with generally tight glycemic control, with most sugars < 180.
Left Leg Hematoma - The patient was admitted with known prior left thigh hematoma s/p fasciotomy and evacuation at [**Hospital1 882**].
Surgery was consulted with assessment that there was no indication for evacuation of hematoma given there were no neurologic or vascular deficits.
As above, given concern for potential infectious source repeat LLE CT was performed.
It was felt that there was no significant left shift or toxic granulations to suggest infection and that the elevated white count may be consistent with her underlying MPD, although the possibility that an uderlying infection could have caused demargination could not be ruled out.
The patient was continued on her outpatient treatmet regimen of Anagrelide for thrombocythemia with platelet counts < 400K.
The patien has received few 250cc boluses as needed but aggressive volume repletion has not been attempted given ESRD and patient's DNR/DNI status with evidence previously for pulmonary edema.
The patient's pressures have been decreased in the setting of Diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control which have been likely contributing.
The patient should continue to receive these medications although with hold parameters as prescribed, holding for SBP < 90.
The patient further stated she would not want BiPap if necessary.
