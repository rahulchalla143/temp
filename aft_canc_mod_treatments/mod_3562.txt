Past Medical History: Idiopathic peripheral neuropathy (per family), HTN, Petite mal sz 8yrs and 2.5yrs ago on phenobarb s/p hernia repair PNA at [**Hospital3 **] 2 weeks ago   Social History: nonsmoker, ex-etoh drinker (non x 2yrs).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with htn, seizure d/o, who presented with speech difficulty/new bilateral hand tremors and C. diff colitis.
It was determined that his C.diff infection was so severe he would require colectomy but his family did not want to put the patient through surgery.
After much discussion with the MICU attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the family decided to make the patient DNR/DNI and keep only minimal support with antibiotics.
Upon transfer to the floor, the family, including his son the HCP, the patient's wife and daughter in law, decided to pursue comfort measures only around 10pm.
The antibiotics and IVF were discontinued.
The patient was maintained on morphine for pain control.
# C diff: Found positive at OSH, likely secondary to recent antibiotics used for treating pneumonia.
Vancomycin PO was added to flagyl as pt was not clinically improving after couple of days on flagyl alone.
He was treated with flagyl, PO/PR vancomycin, cholestyramine and zosyn.
His studies lacked signs of ileus, though he was noted to have distention and trouble with tube feeds so he was kept NPO and followed by GI.
He had his hematocrit checked frequently, was given IVF and remained stable and never required blood products.
He remained NPO for aspiration risks.
# Aspiration pneumonia: New LL lobe infiltrate with likley aspiration noted.
Already on broad coverage with zosyn, but concern that patient may be becoming septic with hypothermia and increased wbc count, given this the patient was kept on zosyn and vancomycin was added.
He was kept NPO as well.
Extra-axial mass not in location to be contributing to speech difficulty as not in Broca's area and no evidence of mass effect on brain parenchyma region involved in facial, tongue motor function.
Not on medications that would cause tremors.
He has family hx of essential tremors and is currently on beta blocker for heart disease.
Neurosurgery eval pt on admission and no intervention was recommended, with suggested followup in 3 month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] and a repeat MRI head at that time.
Continued on phenobarb and gapabentin, without epileptic activity during hospital course.
Prior to transfer out of the ICU his gabapentin was held given his renal failure.
The family did not want dialysis, so hydration was continued and nephrotoxins were held.
