Admission Date:  [**2106-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-10-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: pelvic mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, tumor debulking, omentectomy, extended right colectomy, right pelvic peritoneal implant excision, partial wedge gastrectomy, ileal descending colostomy, and rigid proctosigmoidoscopy  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70-year-old G2, P2 sent by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for consultation regarding a possible diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
There were also nodules in the region of the fissure for the ligamentum venosum and ligamentum teres.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Rotator cuff repair and cholecystectomy.
OB HISTORY:  Vaginal delivery x2.
Family History: Significant for mother with stomach cancer, a brother with pancreatic cancer, cousin with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and aunts with stomach cancer.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2106-11-2**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, tumor debulking, omentectomy, extended right colectomy, right pelvic peritoneal implant excision, partial wedge gastrectomy, ileal descending colostomy, and rigid proctosigmoidoscopy, requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
Post-operatively, she remained intubated and was transferred to the SICU, with transfer to regular post-operative floor on POD#2.
The patient's post-operative course was complicated by low hematocrit, post-operative fever w/ Clostridium perfringens on blood culture, an intrahepatic IVC thrombus, bilateral upper lobe opacities and bibasilar effusions L>R with dyspnea/hypoxia and O2 requirement, lower extremity fungal infection, and small bowel obstruction.
On POD #6, the patient underwent a CT of the abdomen for evaluation of fever, and an intrahepatic IVC thrombus was discovered incidentally.
Per surgery recommendation the patient was started on heparin for anticoagulation, however this was discontinued when the pt had another Hct drop.
Vascular surgery recommended no further anticoagulation, and given the location of the thrombus, filter placement was also not technically feasible.
Infectious disease was consulted and she was started on vancomycin empirically, with ampicillin-sulbactam added after identification and sensitivities.
On POD#4, the pt continued to require 4 L of oxygen by NC.
She was started on levofloxacin, and repeat chest x-ray showed that her pneumonia improved after 4 days of levofloxacin, and this was discontinued.
The patient was also noted to have a bilateral lower extremity and groin rash on [**11-23**]; ID consult was obtained, and it was felt that this was the result of a fungal infection, and IV fluconazole was started.
The rash improved on fluconazole, and the patient was switched to PO fluconazole on [**12-2**], to continue for a 6 week total course.
An interventional pulm consult was obtained for possible thoracentesis, but per bedside U/S, the left effusion was found to be subpulmonic and quite small, and therefore not likely to account for pt's symptoms; given the location, thoracentesis would also be at higher risk for adverse events i.e.
She was covered for somewhat elevated FSG's with an insulin sliding scale.
5) Oncology: Per discussion with tumor board, medical oncology was consulted for administration of chemotherapy while in-house.
It was decided to administer first dose of carboplatin alone, given greater potential toxicity with Taxol.
On [**11-23**] the patient received her 1st carboplatin dose and tolerated this adequately with only some nausea.
She is to follow up with a medical oncologist at [**Hospital3 3583**] for further chemotherapy cycles.
