Coronary bypass grafting x1 with reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to distal right coronary artery.
Her bypass time was 160 minutes with a crossclamp time of 136 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred post-operatively to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
On POD2 her lactate rose from 1.2 to 2.1 and general surgery was consulted.
She extubated the day after surgery but remained in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
During this time she had several episodes of atrial fibrillation and was treated with Beta blockers, amiodarone and anticoagulation.
She was very deconditioned and her activity was minimal in this initial period, she failed a swallow evaluation and a feeding tube was placed.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and her leukocytosis gradually resolved.
She worked with physical therapy and the nursing staff to regain strength and mobility, again the progress was slow.
ON POD 18 she was transferred to rehabilitation at Life Care Center of [**Location (un) **] for continued recovery.
