Given the patient's recent chest x-ray documenting short-interval development of interstitial edema, ?volume overload, possibly vasculitis.
IMPRESSION: Prevertebral fluid accumulation as described.
She responded to IV fluids and was easily weaned off her dopamine drip with her systolic blood pressures consistently in the 130s with concomitant transfer from the ICU to the medicine floor.
Prevertebral fluid collection: The patient was evluated by neurosurgery and this fluid collection was not thought to be secondary to fracture or infection.
She was instructed to wear a neck collar and will follow up in neurosurgery clinic two weeks after discharge.
Seizures: She was continued on her neurontin as advised by her PCP.
Acute Renal Failure: Her elevated creatinine responded well to re-hydration and thus her acute renal failure was considered to be secondary to hypovolemia.

Although this was felt to be seconary to sick euthyroid syndrome her levothyroxine was emperically increased to 200 mcg per day which the patient tolerated.
