He tolerated the procedure well with no complications, but was transferred to the ICU in guarded condition still intubated.
He had a NGT, RIJ, ETT, urostomy stents x 2, and a Right A-line in place upon transfer.
He did require pressors for the first day post-op in order to maintain his arterial pressure.
From a GI standpoint he was slow to return his bowel function and therefore was kept NPO with NGT in place until he had some return of function.

Prior to discharge his PCA was d/ced and he was switched to PO pain meds.
