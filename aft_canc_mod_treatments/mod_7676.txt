At that time, lasix was stopped and atenolol was switched to metoprolol as there was concern that blunting of tachycardia could be contributing to falls.

Clonality could not be assessed in this case due to insufficient numbers of B cells.
Thyroid goiter, which if clinically indicated could be further evaluated with ultrasound if not already performed.
These lesions demonstrate bright T2 FLAIR signal as well as mild slow diffusion and are hypodense on CT.  MRI with contrast is suggested for further characterization.
Very limited MRA examination demonstrating possible severe narrowing of the distal right M1 segment  [**6-4**] MRI with add'l sequences:  Multiple enhancing lesions along the corpus callosum as described above as well as in the suprasellar region, pineal gland, and right thalamus.
Main pulmonary artery measures 3.6 cm, unchanged since [**2137-9-17**], raising the question of pulmonary artery hypertension.
Status post left occipital approach biopsy with hypoattenuation in this region, which could represent postprocedural edema versus infarct, which could be further delineated by MRI.
Furthermore, background is diffusely slow indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction on non-specific etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY:  78 year old female with PMHx HTN, dCHF, diabetes, atrial fibrillation on coumadin with past ischemic stroke, presents with altered mental status, found to have new brain lesions.
It was subsequently done under IR and was remarkable for a high protein and atypical cells.
She was given ativan 1mg x 2 after which she developed tonic gaze deviation to the left and continued to be unresponsive.
She was loaded with Keppra 1000mg IV x 1 and started on 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was given decadron 10mg IV x 1 and started on 4mg Q6hrs.
# NEURO: She remained intubated on a propofol drip overnight with resolution of clinical seizure activity.
She subsequently began to have more epileptiform activity on EEG with runs of left-sided rhythmic theta activity.
She was given an additional 1000mg Keppra IV and her maintenance dose was increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was taken off sedation and began to awake slowly.
She was loaded with Phenytoin and started on 100mg IV Q8hrs.
She continued to have some intermittent rhythmic eye blinking which was treated with ativan when persistent.
She was continued on decadron 4mg Q6hrs for her brain lesions.
This was discussed with her family, and given her poor prognosis with few viable treatment options she was made DNR/DNI.
# CV: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring throughout her admission.
She was started on an amiodarone drip upon transfer to the ICU for her a fib with RVR.
She was continued on metoprolol 5mg IV Q6hrs and losartan 100mg daily.
Her home lasix was held due to her volume depletion upon admission.
Coumadin was held for her brain biopsy on [**6-10**] and was not restarted given the change in her goals of care.
# Respiratory: She remained intubated pending pathology results and discussion regarding goals of care with her family.
She completed a course of ceftriaxone for a UTI.
# Renal/GU: Mild renal insufficiency improved with gentle IVF suggesting hypovolemia, likely from decreased PO intake in setting of mental status changes.
An OG tube was placd and she was started on tube feeds.
She was continued on her home omeprazole and sucralfate for GERD.
# Endocrine: She was maintained on fingersticks and ISS for blood glucose control.
Once the pathology results from her brain biopsy returned and her poor prognosis was recognized, a family meeting was held involving her health care proxy (son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 95250**]), daughter, and close family friend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
When it became clear that her son would not be able to obtain the necessary paperwork for several weeks the family decided to proceed with terminal extubation.
All medications were stopped except for those to provide comfort.
