Given the extent of pain that he is in, he cannot allow for a full digital exam and it is very difficult to see between his tongue and jaw, so the tumor visibly approaches the midline.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post IVC filter in [**2084**] bilateral cataract surgery.
Left leg skin graft donor site healing well with dry Xeroform in place.

He tolerated the procedure well; please see the separately dictated operative report for details of the procedure.
Given the extent of resection, he was kept intubated overnight and was successfully extubated the next morning.
He received a short course of post-operative steroids.
The drains were removed as they met criteria on POD#3 and 4.
The staples were removed from his neck incision on POD#8, and the incision was healing well without evidence of dehiscence.
###Neuro:  He initially received IV morphine for pain control and was subsequently transitioned to oxycodone liquid PT on POD#2.
By the time of discharge, he was receiving only standing acetaminophen every 6 hours for pain; this will be changed to a PRN medication at the time of discharge.
He received standing nebulizer treatments for a few days with good effect and resolution of his cough.
###GI:  Tube feeds were started on POD#1 after extubation.
After the bolster was removed on POD#5, he was evaluated by Speech and Swallow for possible initiation of an oral diet.
They recommended clear liquids given that although he showed no signs of aspiration, he had difficulty with oral manipulation of food boluses given the exten of his surgical resection.
It was decided that he would continue with tube feeds for nutrition while he continued to work on his swallow ability with the therapists.
He was discharged on tube feeds and an oral full liquid diet.
The NG tube can be removed if he can take adequate POs.
He did not receive any blood transfusions.
He had restarted his coumadin on POD#3 but after identification of the clot, he was also started on a lovenox bridge.
###ID:  He was started on Ancef post-operatively for prophylaxis while the bolster was in place.
This was changed to IV ciprofloxacin for the right lower lobe pneumonia which was then changed to Zosyn and azithromycin the next day to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia seen on PE-CT.  After 48 hours, he was changed to oral levofloxacin.
He completed a 7-day course of antibiotics with normalization of his leukocytosis.
###Endocrine: The patient's blood glucose was controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale, which he tolerated well.
He will require chemoradiation therapy, and will follow up with radiation oncology as well as hematology/oncology as an outpatient.
