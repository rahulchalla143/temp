He was given an ASA and started on a Heparin gtt.
He received Lopresser 5 mg IV x3 and lopressor 25 mg po x1 for rate control.
He also received Vanco, Levo, flagyl and 2 liters of Normal Saline.
Past Medical History: - inoperable pancreatic cancer diagnosed [**6-16**] s/p ERCP with stent placement, laporatomy with attempted Whipple, on gemcitabine (received 3 weekly treatments starting [**2139-9-22**], followed by a week off, then a fourth dose yesterday [**2143-10-20**]) - h/o SBO - h/o cholangitis ([**6-16**]) with Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Strep Viridans - h/o bacteremia with Enterococcus fecalis (Vanc sensitive) and Pseudomonas (sensitive to Zosyn) - s/p choecystectomy tube (fell out [**7-17**]) - Hypertension - ankylosing spondylitis - right kidney cystic lesion - Moderate Aortic stenosis - intermittent SVT - anemia - tinea corporis .
Home Meds: - Lopressor 25 mg tid - Colace [**Hospital1 **] - multivitamin - compazine prn .
FH:  His sister had pancreatic cancer and is status post a Whipple procedure.
Presence of intraductal air is most consistent with patient's interval stent replacement.
Large right renal cyst, with rim calcifications.
A/P: 70 yo M with inoperable pancreatic cancer s/p ERCP with stent placement, laparotomy with attempted Whipple, h/o cholangitis, on gemcitabine (received first dose of 2nd round yesterday) who presents with fever to 105 and shortness of breath.
Likely secondary to PNA seen on CXR however need to consider biliary source given pancreatic cancer with previous biliary obstruction requiring stent placement.
- s/p 3 liters NS with good BP, will hold off on additional fluid hydration given mild CHF and pleural effusions seen on CXR  - will obtain CT abd with oral contrast to evaluate for evidence of infection; may need ERCP to evaluate biliary stent placement - will start Vanco and Zosyn (previous culture data from cholangitis revealed Enterococcus and Pseudomonas sensitive to vanco and zosyn) - control fever with tylenol - monitor blood and urine culture .
- dilt gtt for rate control - wean O2 as tolerated .
- continue to cycle cardiac enzymes - monitor on tele - will d/c heparin gtt as likely demand ischemia - continue ASA .
Last dose of gemcitabine [**2143-10-20**].
- dilt gtt as above - once off dilt gtt will restart metop 25 tid .

TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest was performed before and after the administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, without meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Limited imaging of the abdomen reveals new air within the biliary ductal system, presumably related to patient's interval biliary stent exchange.
New low attenuating fluid seen surrounding the ascending aorta , of uncertain cause in the absence of evidence of aortic contour abnormality, dissection, or aneurysm.
Presence of intraductal air is most consistent with patient's interval stent replacement.
Large right renal cyst, with rim calcifications.
Non-specific repolarization changes consistent with ischemia and/or tachycardia persist.
