She got a 1 L NS bolus, levophed was started, a RIJ was placed without complications, L radial a-line was placed.
She was treated for presumed sepsis.
The next day, thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding drainage of R pleural effusion, and oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding her metastatic renal cancer.
The pt was never stable enough to be a candidate for chemo treatment since the initial diagnosis of renal cancer in [**2100-12-16**].
Pt stayed on ventilator until all family members arrived.
Ultimately the pt was weaned from the vent and passed away on a morphine gtt on hd #7. .
The pt was given IVF boluses and started on levophed gtt.
Toward the end of her stay, urine catheter was clogged causing decrease in UOP, and it was changed.
Pt was started on CTX/Vanco in the ED and was changed to Zosyn/Levo (double coverage for gram neg) and Vanc (given recent hospitalization).
Resp failure was likely secondary to large tumor burden from malingancy and superimposed infection.
Pt was put on ventilation setting A/C 500/16/5/.5 and later 500/16/8/.5.
Pt was never able to withstand weaning of ventilator to pressure support mode.
R pleural effusion: thoracic surgery was consulted.
Patient was never a candidate for chemo therapy because of her unstable condition.
Pt was eventually put on morphine drip, weaned from ventilator and passed away.
Beta blocker was held.
PPx: pt was put on prophylaxis with Lansoprazole, SQ heparin, and bowel regimen.
