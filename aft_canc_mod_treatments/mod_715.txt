Labetalol drip was started in hopes that controlling blood pressure to keep patient normotensive would allow for potential resolution of AMS if PRES was the culprit.
On [**2199-12-31**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] (patient's primary oncologist) stopped by to see patient and family and outcome of his meeting was a request to reconsult neurology for further prognostic information for PRES as well as potential benefit for repeat MRI.
MRI tech revealed on [**2199-12-31**] that repeat MRI could not be re-attempted without intubation and sedation with anesthesia present as patient?????
Patient was made comfort measures only (CMO) on morning of [**2200-1-1**] and IV fluids and anti-hypertensives were discontinued.
Morphine drip was started and was titrated to patient comfort and RR of < 15.
