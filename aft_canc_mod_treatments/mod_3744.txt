She was electively admitted for a craniotomy.
Patient is status post left occipital craniotomy with a regional osseous defect and overlying metallic mesh.
No osseous defect in addition to surgical defect as described.
Post- surgical changes as described.
MR HEAD [**2166-3-21**] FINDINGS: The patient is status post left suboccipital craniotomy for resection of left CP angle meningioma.
There is a postoperative collection in the left lateral posterior fossa extending into the CP angle cistern with mass effect on the brainstem and cerebellum as well as shift of midline to the right.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes status post resection of left CP angle mass.
Recommend dedicated cervical spine MRI for further evaluation.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**] FINDINGS: There is interval placement of an intraventricular drain with right transfrontal approach and the tip terminating near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Interval placement of the intraventricular drainage catheter via right transfrontal approach with the tip terminating near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**] As compared to most recent prior study, craniotomy and post-surgical changes in the left posterior fossa, with mildly decreased air and fluid collection with stable small amount of hemorrhage and maybe hyperdense post-surgical material.
Mildly hyperdense material in the left frontal lobe (2A:22) may represent small amount of subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
Interval decrease in the size of right lateral and the third ventricle status post right transfrontal intraventricular drain placement.
Stable appearance of right frontal approach ventriculostomy without evidence of hydrocephalus.
There are persistent blood products along the course of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter tract.
Postoperative changes are present following prior left occipital craniotomy with prominence of the extra-axial space overlying the left cerebellar hemisphere and blood products layering posteriorly within the resection cavity as well as along the surface of the brain.
The left middle cerebellar peduncular lesion could represent an area of infarction that appears to have developed following the prior MR study of [**2166-3-21**]  Labs on Discharge:  COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT   WBC   RBC    Hgb  Hct   MCV MCH  MCHC RDW    Plt Ct [**2166-4-10**] 05:35AM    15.8* 3.44*# 10.8 33.1  96  31.5 32.8 17.9*  451* [**2166-4-9**] 05:50AM    9.4   2.67*  8.4* 25.3* 95  31.6 33.3 17.8*  357 [**2166-4-8**] 05:30AM    13.2* 2.81*  9.1* 26.9* 96  32.3* 33.8 16.9* 403 [**2166-4-7**] 04:58AM    9.4   2.49*  8.0* 23.5* 94  32.2* 34.2 16.2* 412                         Glucose UreaN Creat Na  K   Cl  HCO3 AnGap [**2166-4-10**] 05:35AM    127*1   13    0.4   143 3.9 104 28   15 [**2166-4-9**] 05:50AM    120*1   13    0.3*  138 3.6 103 31   8 [**2166-4-8**] 03:35PM    141 [**2166-4-8**] 05:30AM    123*1   15    0.4   135 3.8 101   Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a left sided craniotomy without complications.
Her blood pressure was maintained less than 140, she was started on steroid [**Last Name (LF) 15123**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MRI was done on post op day 1 which showed good resection of the tumor.
She was taken back emergently for evacuation of the clot and placement of an EVD.
She was kept intubated for approximately two days post-operatively due to a poor gag reflex.
Head CT showed stable ventricular size and a stable neurologic examination and in the afternoon of [**3-27**], her EVD drain was removed.
After the drain was replaced, her examination markedly improved.
Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed on [**2166-3-30**].
The patients sputum grew out G+ rods, G- rods, G+ cocci and she was started on Zosyn in addition to the Vanco that she was already on for the EVD.
Her SQH was stopped on [**4-3**] and EVD drain was removed in the morning of [**4-4**].
Infectious disease was also consulted to guide antibiotic coverage, and identfication of febrile source was her sputum (Gram - rods).
She was place on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, and later changed to meropenum.
She also had routine LENIS done of her lower extremities.
