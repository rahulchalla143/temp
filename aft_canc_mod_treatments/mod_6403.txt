Admission Date:  [**2155-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-6-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Autologous BMT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: continuous renal replacement therapy hemodialysis intubation and mechanical ventilation tracheostomy paracentesis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male who was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma in 01/[**2154**].
Based on that, he was referred for excisional biopsy of the right inguinal adenopathy on [**2154-2-26**] which revealed follicular lymphoma with partial marginal zone differentiation, grade I-II by large cell quantitation.
There was no expression of CD-23 or cyclin D1.
He was then started on R-CVP.
He tolerated therapy fairly well, but suffered from fatigue, hyperglycemia, flushing, and hypertension.
His prednisone dose during treatment was eventually lowered from 200 mg daily to 100 mg daily.
After three cycles of R-CVP, the vincristine was discontinued due to neuropathy.
He continued on R-CVP for two additional cycles, but after the fifth cycle, he noticed the recurrence of right inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The decision was made to hold on further R-CVP as his lymphoma was no longer responding to the current therapy.
CHEMOTHERAPY HISTORY  [**Date range (1) 83066**]: He received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone plus rituximab (R-CVP) x 3 cycles; the vincristine was discontinued due to neuropathy.
[**2154-5-1**]: PET Scan showing extensive FDG avid disease  [**Date range (1) 83067**]: continued on R-CVP for two additional cycles, but after the fifth cycle, he noticed the recurrence of right inguinal lymphadenopathy.
[**2154-6-12**]: repeat PET - little interval change  [**2154-7-2**]: repeat lesion biopsy - similar findings  [**2154-8-5**]: transferred care to [**Hospital1 **], presented with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy; received 4 cyclyes R-Bendamustine by local oncologist at time of transfer; planned for two more cycles of R-bendamustine  [**2155-1-22**]: Mobilization HiDAC, final cumulative CD-34 yield of 5.19 x 10e CD-34 cells/kg over three days, discharged on Cipro, Neupogen and Compazine.
Started on Moxifloxacin and neupogen.
Denies headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, fevers, chills, recent night sweats, blurry vision, shortness of breath.
Reports only mild ongoing cough significantly improved from prior and occasional fatigue when his counts get low.
There was no expression of CD-23 or cyclin D1.

Reversal of flow within the right anterior portal vein on breath-hold imaging.
Possibility of iron deposition within the liver cannot be excluded without dual-echo gradient-echo images (omitted in this abbreviated examination due to patient intolerance of examination).
Oxygen therapy can also have this appearance.
Central line catheter is noted with its tip in the right atrium.
Nasogastric tube with its tip in the stomach.
Rectal tube is seen in the rectum.
CXR: [**2155-6-6**] FINDINGS: Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 56 year old male with PMH of follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma s/p R-CVP admitted for BEAM auto-SCT (C1D1 ([**2155-3-26**]) and as per BMT protocol, initiated carmustine day -7, followed by etoposide/cytarabine on days -6 to -3, then melphalan on day -2 ([**2155-3-31**]).
He then underwent Autologus stem cell transplant on [**2155-4-2**].
Respiratory distress - The patient was tachypneic to the 40s on admission to the ICU and had an increasing oxygen requirement, thought to represent attempted compensation for metabolic acidosis and low lung volumes with atelectasis.
The patient failed a trial of bipap and was intubated and placed on A/C mechanical ventilation.
Patient remained intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a) impaired mental status and b) restrictive physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure.
The patient remained on the ventilator for approximately three weeks; his respiratory status remained relatively stable but his mental status precluded extubation.
He did experience an episode of leukocytosis, detailed below, and was treated for a pseudomonas ventilator associated pneumonia with improvement in his leukocytosis.
The patient eventually received a tracheostomy and was subsequently weaned down to trach collar, which coincided with an improvement in his mental status.
Sepsis thought to be a contributing factor as well, but he was maintained on broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, with no infectious source identified for the majority of his hospitalization.
Although cortisol levels were normal, suggesting against adrenal insufficiency, the patient was trialed on a three day course of steroids, which temporarily improved his pressures and removed his pressor requirement.
Following the conclusion of the steroid trial, the patient again required vasopressor support to maintain his blood pressure.
Ultimately, vasopressin was started and levophed was weaned.
For the rest of his ICU course, the patient was maintained off of pressors and perfusion was monitored by assessing mental status.
He is persistently orthostatic which has somewhat improved with restarting midodrine.
Please elevate head of bed as patient tolerates and continue passive motion in bed.
Autonomics was consulted prior to discharge and feels like hypotension is not likely related to dysautonomia given his hypotension even while supine.
Autonomics recommended continuation of midodrine and a trial of florinef to be started at rehabilitation.
Florinef will be started at low dose (0.1 mg daily) and can be uptitrated based on patient response to a maximum of 0.4 mg daily.
It is felt that the hypotension is likely related to deconditioning and aggressive PT should be pursued.
He was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics with a mild improvement in his leukocytosis but with no obvious source on cultures.
Much later in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, a re-elevation in his white blood cell count corresponded with a new positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas.
A large volume paracentesis was performed with fluid sent for cytology and flow cytometry, which was not revealing.
Ultimately, only his CVVH catheter tip grew out the same strain of pseudomonas on [**6-4**] that was in his sputum on [**5-12**].
His antibiotics were ultimately all discontinued and he did well.
The patient was then started on a defibrotide treatment protocol on [**2155-4-9**] with close monitoring of coags, plts, hct, fibrinogen due to concern of bleeding (goal INR < 1.5, plts > 30, Hct > 30, Fibrinogen > 150).
After 25 days of treatment for defibrotide, a head MRI revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which necessitated discontinuation of the treatment.
Currently he is requiring paracentesis every 10-14 days and his ascites should continue to be monitored and tapped PRN.
He was started on low dose amphetamine salts at 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to increase his energy and blood pressure.
Caution should be used with blood thinners due to his low platelet level.
The patient was started on reglan and an aggressive bowel regimen.
Following withdrawal of sedation as patient's respiratory status improved, his ileus improved as well.
His stool frequency has improved after stopping lactulose but have continued to remain loose.
It is likely that the diarrhea is related to tube feeds and banana flakes have been added recently with subsequent improvement in diarrhea.
Altered mental status - Attributed to hepatic encephalopathy in addition to sedating meds for treatment of his abdominal pain.
Standing lactulose was started for therapy of hepatic encephalopathy and was also given broad spectrum antibiotics for treatment of possible infections.
His antibiotics and lactulose were ultimately discontinued.
The patient was started on CVVH on [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic acidosis.
Midodrine was started in an effort to improve the patient's blood pressures so that he could be transitioned to HD.
He was eventually transitioned to HD without ultrafiltration, and has tolerated it well.
Neutropenic fevers - On admission, patient was kept on broad spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fevers (vancomycin/cefepime/ganciclovir/micafungin).
Antibiotics were stopped [**4-12**] following recovery of his neutrophil counts.
Regular insulin was added to the TPN, and the patient was placed on a Regular Insulin SS.
Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
He was continued on atovaquone prophylaxis for PCP but there was concern that it was not being absorbed as it appeared to be present in his diarrhea.
He was given one dose of inhaled pentamidine on [**2155-6-9**] and will be continued on atovaquone.
If his diarrhea continues to improve, he can remain on atovaquone and will likely not need another dose of inhaled pentamidine one month from [**2155-6-9**].
He also remains on Acyclovir prophylaxis.
