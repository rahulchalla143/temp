The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-6-5**], at which time RV biopsy demonstrated cardiac amyloidosis, as well as a bone marrow biopsy with e/o multiple myeloma.
ECHO showed e/o new systolic heart failure on top of preexisting diastolic heart failure and is s/p cardiac catheterization with e/o 50% left main disease, 50% LAD stenosis.
Lasix was switched to torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] with continued spironolactone 50mg daily.
When he initially presented to [**Hospital1 **], the patient was noted to have change in mental status that was attributed to uremia, [**Last Name (un) **], and medication side effect from torsemide.
He also had a bandemia of 9% and was initially treated for a potential UTI.
He was treated for acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure with IV lasix but of note this was limited by his BP's.
While on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was being diuresed on Lasix drip 30 mg/hour, with diuresis limited by increasing creatinine.
After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], it was thought that the patient could benefit from milronone drip in the setting of having a Swan placed to measure his wedge and his CO.

Physician communicated to pt/family that PT will be consulted on recommendations for home vs rehab.
SW provided empathic listening, guidance on resources that are available, and encouraged Pt and family to continue to utilize clinicians to help make an informed decision on where Pt should transition to next.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 109642**] is 77M with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, systolic and diastolic heart failure, cardiac amylodosis, and multiple myeloma who initially presented from OSH with weight gain and need aggressive IV diuresis, requiring CCU admission for initiation of milrinone drip.
He was initially diuresed with lasix drip and metolazone with good effect, but was stopped after increasing creatinine.
He was then transferred to the ICU for diuresis with milrinone for inotropic effect and pulomary vasodilation allowing right sided unloading.
He diuresed well in the CCU, was transfered to the floor, but after weaning milrinone, he required reinitiation of milrinone in the CCU due to drop off in energy level, urine output an reaccumulation of fluid.
He tolerated reinstitution of milrinone infusion well and was transferred to the floor.
He was also continued spironolactone and torsemide after period of autodiuresis from [**Last Name (un) **] ended.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
After discontinuing Lasix gtt, he autodiuresed.
He was treated with Ciprofloxacin and then Levofloxacin caused him to have a supratherapeutic INR above 5.
For the remainder of 10 day abx course, his coumadin was held.
He also continued dexamentasone/velcade treatment while inpatient.
Will continue treatment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109643**].
It was decided that the patient was too high risk for CABG, as well as PCI given his amyloidosis and was discharge on medical management of his CAD.
He was continued on atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ASA 162 mg daily, metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was continued on coumadin for goal INR of 2.0-2.5 given for increased risk of bleeding with amyloid.
His coumadin was held for a few days and restarted to maintain appropriate anticoagulation.
He will continue INR checks and Coumadin management through Dr. [**Name (NI) 109644**] office.
