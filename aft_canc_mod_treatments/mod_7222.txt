He was started on cipro per GI recs after the EGD/EUS.

The patient was unable to tolerate POs likely secondary to gastric outlet obstruction so a PICC line was placed and TPN was started on [**3-7**].

He was transfered to the SICU intubated, sedated, on multiple pressors, broad spectrum antibiotics, with an open abdomen.
His pressors were weaned off over the course of 3 days.
The perforated area of the duodenum was still difficult to access and he was left with a drain in place and an open abdomen and VAC placement.
On [**2014-3-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname 100481**] was diuresed and TPN was continued in the SICU.
