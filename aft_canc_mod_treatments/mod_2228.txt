Given the worsening refractory anemia, the plan was for non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant - [**2120-2-23**] repeat bone marrow showed blasts of up to 9% in the aspirate smear - [**2120-3-27**]: underwent non-myeloablative MUD allo SCT with Campath,  fludarabine, and Cytoxan.

The patient was kept on prednisone 2.5 mg, which was his home dose.
During his admission, we were awaiting benefit from DLI which he had on [**9-3**] but it was made clear to the family that no further intervention would significantly change his hematologic malignancy.
After a long discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at that time, the patient and family agreed to continue current measures but not to escalate care greatly with a hope for the DLI to take effect.
The patient did receive hydroxyurea starting on [**9-18**] for escalating white counts with a decrease in his WBC count from 49.3 to 14.
Allopurinol given as well.
As the patient was seemingly uncomfortable for several days, he was made comfort measures only on [**9-25**] per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in lengthy discussion with family.
At that time, he was placed on a morphine drip.
