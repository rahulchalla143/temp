- pleural fluid [**2178-8-26**] DIAGNOSIS: Pleural fluid, cell block: Metastatic adenocarcinoma.
IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal left-sided pneumonia, with associated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
[**2178-8-25**] cxr: IMPRESSION: Since [**2178-8-24**], following left chest tube removal, there is a tiny residual left apical pneumothorax.
She received a pericardial window for cardiac tamponade presumably from a malignant effusion, as well as a bronchoscopy which took several transbronchial biopsies.
She was transferred to the MICU, and was eventually called out to the cardiology floor, for management of new paroxysmal afib with RVR while the etiology of her left lung mass was being worked up.
# Malignancy adenocarcinoma: CT showed that since [**2178-7-6**], her left lower lobe consolidation has significantly progressed with unchanged bulk of the bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes; interlobular interstitial septal thickening in left lower lobe persists.
She began her chemotherapy regimen which is to be continued as an outpatient.
There, 200cc of bloody fluid was taken out, and a drain was put in with another 230cc drainage over the next 12 hours.
CT surgery was consulted and agreed that patient needed urgent pericardial window operation.
After call-out to the cardiology floor, her chest tube drainage decreased and the tube was removed on [**8-25**].
The pt c/o constant dyspnea and was maintained on several L of O2 with sats in the mid-90's; she was started on low doses of morphine to treat dyspnea and air hunger on [**8-24**], which gave her significant symptomatic improvement.
Pulmonology was consulted and performed a biopsy and bronchoscopy with washings sent for cultures.
She was treated with cefepime and metronidazole for 10 days each for concern for anaerobes and resistant gram negatives.
Her cough and lung exam initially improved, but on [**8-24**] her dyspnea increased, she had persisting opacities on CXR and slowly increasing WBC, and so zosyn, and levofloxacin were started.
She tolerated this regimen and her symptoms improved.
Since undergoing surgery for placement of pericardial window, pt has been intermittently in atrial fibrillation with RVR to 130s.
Given that she currently has a pericardial drain in place and is going for transbronchial biopsy, anticoagulation was deferred.
On the cardiology floor, metoprolol was continued at 12.5mg q6hr given relatively low BPs; she self-converted into sinus with HR in the 70-80's.
Deferred starting anticoagulation with aspirin given CHADS2-vasc score of one in setting of recent procedures.
Likely anemia of chronic inflammation; retic count, ferritin, B12/folate are all WNL.
Deferred iron replacement for now given acute illness.
Nonetheless, neurology was made aware, and they recommended a carotid series and aspirin initiation.
# Limited scleroderma with CREST syndrome: Her symptoms are moderately controlled with Calcium channel blockers at home.
She was continued on nifedipine and her proton pump inhibitor for esophageal involvement.
She was continued on her calcium and vitamin D for prevention as well as ibuprofen for pain control, taken especially with meals.
Also, she was continued on her chlorhexidine mouth washes.
