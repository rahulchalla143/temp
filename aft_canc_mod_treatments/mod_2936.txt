CD10 and CD15 highlight background stromal cells and neutrophils, respectively.
Cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3/CAM5.2) does not stain the large atypical lymphoid cells.
Since the biopsy is represented by small fragments of tissue subtype classification is not advisable.
Note: Sections show squamous epithelium and fibrous tissue with an extensive subepithelial inflammatory infiltrate composed of small lymphocytes, neutrophils, plasma cells, histiocytes and scattered to focally clustered large atypical lymphoid cells, with abundant cytoplasm, irregular nuclear contours, consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells, some of the classic type.
Note: Special stains for microorganisms could not be performed due to exhaustion of the tissue block.
Part 1 is received in formalin and additionally labeled "biopsy distal trachea" and consists of four fragments of soft tan tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm in aggregate, entirely submitted in A.
Part 2 is received in formalin and additionally labeled "esophageal biopsy" and consists of a 1.6 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm aggregate of tan soft tissue fragments, entirely submitted in B.
Part 3 is received fresh additionally labeled "esophageal biopsy for lymphoma study" and consists of multiple tan tissue fragments measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate.
