The L ICA could be considered for surgery in [**3-16**] months after he has recovered from his current stroke and is more stable for surgery.
He continued to have BRBPR and after discussion anticoagulation was stopped and he was started on Aggrenox (no sxs of angina)  His blood pressure was target at SBP 120-180.
He was switched from ASA/Plavix to Aggrenox [**Hospital1 **].
His Zocor was kept at 80mg and not decreased given concern for potential increased risk of stroke after reductions in statin dose.
He was also maintained euthermic and euglycemic.
After a colonoscopy for his GI bleeding he was started on a heparin drip with a goal PTT maintained between 50 and 70.
He had an episode of BRBPR on [**2-25**] with about 50cc of stool and blood.
He was discharged on aggrenox [**Hospital1 **] given his apparent bleeding complication to full anticoagulation.
He therefore had the procedure on [**2-24**] which showed radiation proctitis, multiple AVM's, as well as a clot which was cauterized.
He was started on Mesalamine PR per GI for proctitis.
The patient was anticoagulated, but then had recurrent GI bleeding (hemodynamically stable), and heparin was stopped.
There were polyps noted on his colonoscopy, and he will require a repeat colonoscopy for purposes of polypectomy in a few months as arranged by his PCP.
Cardiovascular: The patient's metoprolol and lisinopril were held on admission.
His metoprolol was held given his recent episodes of GI bleeding.
His BP medications will require further titration as an outpatient.
Serial hematocrits following the transfusion were stable.
He was treated with SSI as needed and restarted on Glucophage on [**2-25**].
He was not started on on colchicine for this likely exacerbation of acute gouty arthritis due to his anticoagulation and GI bleeding.
He was started on a short course of prednisone for gout.
He was also provided a short course of vicodin for pain control.
