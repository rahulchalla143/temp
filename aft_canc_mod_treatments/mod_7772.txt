The patient is currently disoriented in the trauma SICU, with CAT scan that showed C5 lamina and spinous process fracture and vertebral foramen fracture around C5.
Due to concern for vertebral artery Neurosurgery requested MRI, MRA, and C-spine at this time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Of note, the patient's past medial history consist of prostate cancer, therapy with Lupron, history of lymphoma, hypertension, and history of alcohol abuse.
He was on a propofol drip at this time and a Solu-Medrol drip.
Endotracheal tube was required to proceed with his MRI with a plan to extubate when the study is completed.
The patient was placed on intravenous fluids and NPO at this time and regular insulin sliding scale.
A Foley catheter was also placed.
The patient was placed on Pepcid, subcutaneous heparin, Pneumoboots, thiamine folate and Ativan 0.5 mg intravenous, b.i.d.
2, [**2110-10-3**], the patient remained in the trauma SICU and was continued on the Solu- Medrol drip at this time.
The patient was also placed on prophylaxis for alcohol withdrawal and the patient also was extubated at this time without incident.
It was determined that the patient was currently at risk for re- intubation and would need two feeds for nutrition at this time and a OG tube was placed for this purpose.
Plastic surgery was also consulted at this time to assess for possible repair of this fracture.
2, a central venous line was placed in the left subclavian vein in a sterile fashion.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
The patient at this time was started on a Heparin drip with a goal  PTT of 40 to 60.
The patient was also on an insulin drip at this time for elevated blood glucose on finger sticks.
An AA line was placed on hospital day 3, [**2110-10-4**] and on hospital day No.
Tube feeds were started.
Haldol was given for agitation and Zyprexa and valproate were discharged at this time.
The patient was changed to Dobhoff tube on hospital day 4, [**2110-10-5**] and on hospital day 4, also of note the patient was neurologically improved according to the neurosurgical team who saw him in the afternoon.
5 the patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.3 and cultures were sent and labetalol was required to control his systolic blood pressure.
Also of note the patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia.
The patient briefly went into pulseless electrical activity at this time as the team was preparing was intubation and compressions were started.
The patient was given 0.5 mg of atropine x 1.
Epinephrine was given, etomidate and succinylcholine were administered for intubation purposes and C-spine immobilization was maintained at all times.
An endotracheal tube was placed and good coloration was noted.
The patient was given morphine and Ativan and was noted to have a blood pressure of 150 systolically in the CT scanner.
The plan was for the patient to have blood pressure greater than 150 at all times systolically and heparin was continued with a goal PTT of 40 to 60.
6, [**2110-10-7**], the patient continued to be tachycardic and hypertensive and was requiring Lopressor, hydralazine and labetalol drip now.
Levophed was stopped at this time as the patient was not requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure above 150 systolically.
Nutrition throughout this stay continued to provide the recommendations for tube feeds and these were followed accordingly.
His central line tip was cultured at this time.
They agreed with the current regimen of antibiotics of Vancomycin and Zosyn to provide broad coverage and should cover the likely pathogens.
The patient was switched to Fentanyl patch at this time.
Foley placement was performed and decongestants were added for left maxillary sinus opacity.
The patient also had a hematocrit dropped to 23.5 during this time and received two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient's morphine and Haldol were stopped at this time and antibiotics were continued for strep viridans, and bacteremia.
Heparin was stopped at this time and the patient then received 5 units of packed red blood cells overnight.
Tube feeds were on hold at this time.
The patient was also seen by Neurology on this date who recommended not using pressors to maintain a target systolic blood pressure and suggested continuing to treat sepsis and hemorrhage and to use fluid boluses if needed They also suggested to consider an MRI with diffusion to assess whether the patient has in fact sustained an acute infarct.
Infectious Disease continued to recommend the using Vancomycin and Zosyn at this time.
9, Otolaryngology was consulted to perform a tap on a left maxillary sinus that was known to be built up with fluid if the patient is now positive blood cultures with sinus, possibly suspected as a source,  At this time it was determined that this patient's bleed was likely retroperitoneal in nature in the study of recent trauma and anticoagulation and the patient continued to be hemodynamically labile suggesting a possible central nervous system process.
A right femoral ultrasound was also performed at this time to rule venous pseudoaneurysm and anticoagulation was reassessed in the background of this bleed with need for anticoagulation for left vertebral artery thrombosis.
11, [**2110-10-12**], Vancomycin was stopped and Lopressor was added for blood pressure control and urine catecholamines were also sent at this time to try to explain these possible sudden rises in blood pressure.
The patient was transfused one unit at this time of packed red blood cells.
Also on this date, the left subclavian central venous line was changed due to the likelihood of possible infection.
12, [**2110-10-13**], penicillin was started by strep viridans in his blood.
Levofloxacin was also started on enterococcus that grew back in the urine and angiography was planned for the morning.
Tube feeds were held.
Metoprolol was then given orally 2 twice day and [**2110-10-13**], the patient also received transesophageal echocardiogram that revealed no vegetations and no significant valvular abnormalities or regurgitations.
The patient was then started on aspirin after discussion with Neurosurgical and Trauma teams.
Penicillin was also stopped at this time and tube feeds were restarted since angiography did not take place.
Maxillary sinus fluid was noted to be positive for Enterococcus at this time and the antibiotics given at this time were vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
Penicillin had been stopped.
15, [**2110-10-16**],  a family meeting was arranged in order to discuss the possibility of a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy to be done.
Clonidine was also added at this time for further blood pressure control and angiography was still being planned at this time.
16, the patient was weaned off of all pressors and was having problems with agitation and accompanied hypertension and tachycardia that evening.
The patient required Haldol, morphine and Versed.
The patient also then required being placed back on Levophed for blood pressure systolic in the 60's that was not temporarily related to sedation and then Levophed was discharged again as the patient's blood pressure rebounded appropriately.
17, [**2110-10-18**], the patient required two more units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.9, with a plan to obtain abdominal CAT scan if this hematocrit continued to drop.
Lopressor and Clonidine were increased at this time and blood pressure decreased down to the 80s around 10 p.m. that evening.
Antibiotics were changed to a Linezolid from Vancomycin due to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus in sputum.
On [**2110-10-19**], the patient was given Lasix 20 mg twice a day.
The patient was still not able to be weaned off the endotracheal tube at this time and then on [**2110-10-20**], the patient was continued on diuresis as tolerated with a plan for possible tracheostomy at this time.
At this time the staff was still waiting for daughter's consent for the tracheostomy and another family meeting was brought about.
Levaquin was also stopped at this time.
The patient was also more hypertensive and the evening dose of Lasix was held and the patient received a small fluid bolus.
21, [**2110-10-22**], Levofloxacin was restarted for Pen sensitive Klebsiella grown out of sputum.
Consent was now obtained for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was noted to have a bout of hypotension at 80/50 and the patient received bolus of Neo- Synephrine to which he responded well.
23, [**2110-10-24**], physical therapy and occupational therapy continued to work with the patient.
The patient was noted to need spinal rehab placement once he was weaned to the tracheal mask and was assessed for pap smear of valve when appropriate.
The patient continued to be evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy at this time who suggested the patient would likely need a significant rehabilitation stint before being able to return to a home setting and on [**2110-10-25**], hospital day 24, the patient's central line was removed and the patient was placed on all oral medications.
Pressor support was gradually weaned and sputum gram stain at this time showed no organisms.
Arterial line was also discharged at this time.
The patient was continued on Levofloxacin and Linezolid.
On hospital day 25, [**2110-10-26**], the patient was given Lasix once and was received Impact at 75 cc which was his goal rate.
He was continued on Fentanyl patch and Haldol prn and morphine as needed.
The patient was noted to also still have large amounts of secretions at this time from his tracheostomy but they were noted to be easily expectorated.
The patient continued to receive Lasix for gentle diuresis after that was added as the patient still had mild wheezes and on Albuterol.
The patient also received a bedside swallow and pap smear of valve of valve evaluation at this time.
Detailed instructions were given to always deflate the cuff prior to placing the valve and to monitor oxygen saturations and respirations while valve was in place.
The patient had to receive fluid and Neo- Synephrine drip basically for hypotensive episode.
The patient was continued on a ventilator.
28, [**2110-10-29**], the patient was now being actually screen for rehabilitation and was started on Verapamil.
Diuresis was continued with Lasix with goal that the patient be 1 liter negative in terms of input and outputs.
The patient was continued with pressor support at this time.
There were no new cultures over the last 5 days and on [**2110-10-30**], the patient had CT angiogram that showed bilateral pulmonary emboli and the patient was then started on anticoagulation with Lovenox.
The patient received the flue vaccine at this time.
The patient was continued on Lovenox at this time for pulmonary embolus.
Coumadin was also started at this time with goal of anticoagulation.
The patient was also restarted on metoprolol at 25 mg b.i.d and blood pressure range was still noted to be 130 to 190 systolically over 50 to 90 diastolically.
The patient was on 5 mg of Coumadin at this time, taking it once a day with Lovenox to be taken until the INR was in the therapeutic range.
The patient was still being treated with Levofloxacin and Linezolid with a goal at this time still to obtain MRI/ MRA.
