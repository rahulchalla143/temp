He was therefore administered a five-day course of IVIG to neutralize the anti-platelet antibodies.
Concurrently, he received platelets transfusions to maintain a platelet count above 10.
Given his refractory thrombocytopenia, a splenectomy was performed on [**2103-9-13**].
The splenectomy was complicated post-op by a large incision hematoma and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation (see below).
For treatment of the hematoma, a large abdominal binder was place, and the patient received thrice daily transfusion of platelets for approximately 1 week, responding well to each unit, but consumed quickly.
By the time of the patient's death, he was requiring once daily units of platelet to maintain platelet count greater than 10. .
Yet, circulating atypical lymphoma cells were present on peripheral blood smears.
A splenectomy was performed on [**2103-9-13**] due to ITP and a biospy of the spleen demonstrated extensive involvement of DLBCL.
On [**2103-9-22**], he was treated with ICE and bortezomib given without complication.
Empiric antibotics were continued (vancomycin/ Ambisome / Meropenem / Acyclovir).
The patient desired to continue treatment for DLBCL (see above) .
#.Fever/Bactermia- The patient was neutropenic after receiving ICE therapy on [**9-22**].
A catheter was removed on [**10-4**] and grew VRE.
A new catheter was placed and then removed on [**10-7**], and was culture negative.
Linezolid therapy was initiated on [**10-4**].
#.Histoplasmosis- The patient was diagnosed during his previous hospitalization with cerebral histoplasmosis.
Antifungal antibotics were continued throughout the entire hospitalization until his death.
Adrenal Insufficiency- The patient received prednisone for adrenal insufficiency, and was tappered multiple times after each round of chemotherapy that contained steroids.
[**Name (NI) 14624**] Pt found to be persistently bacteremic with VRE despite linezolid therapy.
Pt wanted to keep being treated symptomatically with antibiotics and transfusion.
