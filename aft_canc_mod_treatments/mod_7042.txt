He was placed on bipap to help with his breathing which was particularly difficult given the need to balance treatment of his fracture pain with adequate mentation and respiratory effort.
Family members concluded that he would want comfort care only and did not want to continue with invasive interventions.
He received morphine boluses prior to moving him but otherwise did not require additional therapeutics.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM PRIOR TO CMO STATUS: # Respiratory Distress: likely secondary to pain with splinting from rib pain resulting in ventilation and oxygenation deficits.
- A-line for BP monitor and frequent ABG - CXR this am as above.
-DC'd lidoderm patch yesterday without change in myoclonus.
- renally dose meds - UOP improved this am.
- Limit further fluids now that uOP increasing.
# Fall: likely mechanical secondary to slipping on ice at home.
#DM: Sliding scale insulin with good coverage yesterday.
Peaked at 0.04 - repeat EKG - continue aspirin/plavix/statin .
- hold home diuretics - received gentle IVF on [**11-16**].
