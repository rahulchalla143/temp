Admitted to ICU after repeat episode of AF RVR (130-150) w/ BP 90's, 90% 2L, placed on 100% NRB w/ spo2 hi 90's; following 1L bolus--> SBP 100's.
ID:  Febrile neutropenia     A.Urosepsis with +[**Last Name (un) **] and +Blood cultures for enterobacter now negative x many days.
Abx were switched to ciprofloxacin and meripenem providing double coverage for gram (-) organisms.
Sputum and repeat chest CT's did not offer putative etiology.
Required non-rebreather for a number of days in ICU, but eventually weaned to 8 L nasal canulae and over the course of 2 weeks, to room air; his oxygen saturation at discharge was 95% on RA.
Danazol, neupogen, and vancomycin were discontinued as potential causes of medication-induced fever, considering that meropenem was providing adequate gram positive coverage.
),he was started on low dose steriods, prednisone 10 mg qd, with resolution of fevers.
The patient was therefore discharged to home in good condition on prednisone 10mg qd, tylenol 500mg qd, ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **], caspofungin 35 mg qd, meropenem 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] in addition to the other listed medications.
Caspofungin was used after ambisome resulted in a conjugated bilirubinemia and voriconazole resulted in elevation of transaminase levels.
With a lasix diuresis, his pleural effusions, 3+ pitting leg edema to the thighs, and positive fluid balance all corrected.
Received transfusions to keep HCT >25 and plts >10 (>50 if bleeding).
GI:  The initial course of ambisome resulted in an elevated direct bilirubin level.
Was then started on voriconazole until liver transaminases trended up.
Now on caspofungin with liver enzymes trending down towards normal.
A fib with RVR: likely [**1-15**] bactermia (ruled out for MI, nl TSH), resolved after dilt 20 IV x 2, then dilt po 30 qid.
HTN: on meds at home with baseline bps in 100s per patient.
In hospital, on metoprolol but transitioned back to home medications on discharge.
Renal/F/E/N:  Small renal stone in pole of R kidney Fluids were d/c on [**6-28**] as pt looks like in pulm edema (with lower extremity edema).
Given lasix 40 mg iv qd and then prn for diuresis.
Access: Surgery placed R internal jugular CVL [**6-29**].
Transfused platelets for above 50K for line to be placed.
Right midline placed [**7-10**] after right IJ d/c'd [**7-9**] secondary to ?fever source.
Double-lumen Hickman placed [**2181-7-13**] by surgery before discharge but visualized by PA/LAT to be in L brachiocephalic.
Pulled by surgery on day of d/c after platelets given pre-procedure.
Disposition: To home in stable condition on antibiotics, tylenol, and prednisone 10 mg qd.
Antibiotics will be discontinued based on radiologic resolution of the pulmonary and dermatologic conditions.
Medications on Admission: Atenolol 12.5 mg qd danazol 200 mg p.o.
Aranesp 200 mg subcu q. weekly Nexium 40 mg daily.
