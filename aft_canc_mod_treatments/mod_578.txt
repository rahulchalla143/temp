Status post right ankle fixation.
Status post left lateral segmentectomy, segment 6     resection, intraoperative ultrasound.
He was evaluated electively in the hepatobiliary surgery office for possible surgical resection of a large left lateral segment liver mass which had grown from 4 x 4 cm to 9.2 x 7.5 cm in segments 2 and 3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted elective on [**2125-1-5**], on which day he underwent a left lateral segmentectomy  and segment 6 resection with intraoperative ultrasound.
The patient remained intubated overnight and initially required vasopressors for blood pressure support and significant fluid resuscitation for a persistent metabolic acidosis.
He was started on low dose heparinization for this.
Systematically, the patient's pain was controlled with intravenous narcotics, generally phentanyl throughout the course of his hospitalization.
Propofol was used intermittently for sedation.
His mental status never really improved during the course of his hospitalization as his multisystem organ failure as described below developed.
His ventilatory requirements subsequently continued to increase secondary to the large volume of fluid required for his resuscitation and subsequently secondary to the development of bilateral Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Throughout the course of his hospitalization, his oxygenation and ventilatory support requirements continued to progressively increase despite efforts at diuresis and treatment of his pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics.
By [**1-18**], the patient was requiring between 80-100% FIO2 with maximal positive end respiratory pressure and ventilatory support and despite this, his oxygenation was marginal with PAO2 of between 50 and 65.
In terms of the patient's cardiovascular status, he required moderate doses of phenylephrine initially in the postoperative period but subsequently as the patient demonstrated evidence of septic physiology with source questionable from his pneumonia or possible urinary tract infection, he continued to require increasing amounts of vasopressor support including norepinephrine and vasopressin.
His persistent hypotension was not felt to be cardiogenic in etiology as he had two echocardiograms demonstrating no significant valvular disease and no significant wall motion abnormalities with a normal ejection fraction.
By [**1-18**], the patient was requiring increasingly large doses of norepinephrine as well as vasopressin, maintaining a blood pressure maximally at 100-105 systolic.
He did notably develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be secondary to the amount of fluid resuscitation and the physiologic stress that the patient was under.
This was managed intermittently with calcium channel blockade.
In terms of the patient's GI status, he was maintained on prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor.
He did have significant ileus which was managed with bowel rest as well as nasogastric suction.
His NG tube put out between 1-1.5 liters per day.
The patient's liver function continued to deteriorate during the postoperative period with his bilirubin rising to a maximum of 19.2 along with elevations of his transaminases between 200-300.
The hepatic venous and partial portal venous thromboses were managed with heparinization as noted previously.
The patient developed complete acute renal failure and required the initiation of continuous venovenous hemodialysis.
He was treated with the appropriate antibiotics which included vancomycin for gram positive cocci seen on gram stain of his sputum as well as ciprofloxacin and Zosyn for double coverage of pseudomonas and the ciprofloxacin covered the Klebsiella.
Given that the patient was evidencing significant progression of his multisystem organ failure as well as lack of responsiveness to maximal medical supportive therapy including full ventilatory support, full vasopressor support as well as continuous venovenous hemodialysis and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, discussion was held with the family as to the goals of care.
It was decided with the family that there really was no likelihood of recovery from his current status and the patient was made comfort measures only on [**2125-1-18**].
Vasopressor support was withdrawn and the patient expired one hour thereafter at 3:12 p.m. on [**2125-1-18**].
