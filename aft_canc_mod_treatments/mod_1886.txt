The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of throat cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2173-5-28**] for leg claudication and at that time an admission chest x-ray showed right upper lobe and left lower lobe lung masses.
At that time he had a right upper lobe wedge resection and pleural biopsy which was negative for malignancy on pathology, and he also had a negative bone scan and head MRI for metastatic disease.
In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year he was admitted again for an uncomplicated left femoral peroneal bypass surgery for his leg claudication, and further workup at that time revealed a left lower lobe 3-cm mass.
He had no immediate complications post surgery and was easily extubated.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed with initial of right atrium 4, pulmonary artery pressure of 38/14, cardiac output of 5.9, cardiac index of 3.2, and systemic vascular resistance of 1038.
A Neo-Synephrine drip was initiated.
Sputum from the bronchoscopy grew Klebsiella and Serratia which were pan sensitive, and he was started on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.
Efforts at weaning were limited by secretions, high oxygen requirement, and increased respiratory rate if pressure support was decreased, and he was requested to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Throat cancer, status post radiation therapy complicated by esophageal stricture requiring dilation.
Bilateral leg claudication, status post left femoral peroneal bypass in [**2173-7-28**].
Status post colectomy secondary to diverticulitis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ciprofloxacin 400 mg intravenous q.12h., ceftazidime 2 g intravenously q.8h., Lopressor 5 mg intravenously q.6h., nitroglycerin q.h.s., Neo-Synephrine drip, procainamide drip, Ativan drip 2 mg per hour, morphine drip 2 mg to 4 mg per hour, Haldol 1 q.2h., sliding-scale regular insulin, Synthroid 0.1 mg intravenously q.d., Reglan 10 mg intravenously q.8h., albuterol/Atrovent meter-dosed inhalers, Flovent 2 puffs b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Dulcolax 1 p.r.
q.d., and Nystatin swish-and-swallow.
In general, on ventilation at AC with a tidal volume of 550, respiratory rate of 20, FIO2 of 0.7, PEEP of 8; most recent arterial blood gas 7.28/59/78.
Neurologically, intubated and sedated.
Microbiology on [**10-18**] bronch growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Serratia.
IMPRESSION:  A 77-year-old gentleman status post left lower lobectomy on postoperative day 15 with diffuse alveolar infiltrates and consolidations suggestive of pneumonia bilaterally; now with difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.
He was followed on arterial blood gas and was on assist control ventilation while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He became progressively acidotic by his followed arterial blood gas, and his set respiratory rate was increased to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
He was continued on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime for his Serratia/Klebsiella pneumonia.
On the night of [**10-31**], he was started on a bicarbonate drip given his worsening acidosis.
It was decided to increase his sedation by increasing the amount of Ativan he was receiving and morphine he was receiving.
On [**11-1**], his morphine was changed to Fentanyl.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  RHYTHM:  His of atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular rate.
He was started on procainamide drip by the surgical team; however, since postoperative day one he had normal runs of atrial fibrillation and once he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the procainamide drip stopped.
The Neo-Synephrine drip was unable to be weaned off; and in fact, because of his progressive hypotension, vasopressin drip was added on [**10-31**].
He was also given intravenous fluids boluses which only helped temporarily to support his blood pressure.
On [**11-1**], his Neo-Synephrine drip was changed to Levophed drip for more beta agonist effects.
Cortisol was added to his laboratories to check for adrenal insufficiency as an etiology for his hypotension.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing Klebsiella and Serratia pan sensitive.
He was continued on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.
He was given one dose of vancomycin for this at 1 g.  Blood cultures did not grow anything to date.
His white blood cell count continued to rise despite his antibiotic treatment, and with his hypotension this was consistent with a septic picture.
His kidneys did not seem to respond well to intravenous fluids boluses.
Free water was restricted and all intravenous medications were placed in normal saline.
All of his medications were renally doses on [**11-1**], and his urine output progressively decreased and became darker in coloration.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was on total parenteral nutrition.
He had a Dobbhoff feeding tube in place situated correctly in post pyloric; however, because of his increasing liver function tests tube feeds were held off, and then they were never started because of his lack of bowel sounds and lack of peristalsis.
He was continued on total parenteral nutrition.
This was thought to be secondary to mixed picture of shocked liver versus obstructive due to total parenteral nutrition versus ceftazidime or other medications causing hepatic obstruction.
Because of his increasing blood glucose levels the amount of insulin in his total parenteral nutrition was increased accordingly.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, although he did require 2 units of packed red blood cells transfusion on [**10-29**] under the surgical team's care.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was on total parenteral nutrition.
Tube feeds were not initiated.
His blood glucose did increase, most likely secondary to the total parenteral nutrition and insulin was added to the total parenteral nutrition.
An insulin drip was considered but never started, although his insulin sliding-scale was adjusted accordingly.
LINES:  Right subclavian line, left arterial line placed on [**10-27**].
Peripheral access, Protonix, and subcutaneous heparin.
He was approaching intubation for 10 days, and therefore if aggressive care was continued a tracheostomy would be considered; however, in his current status he may not tolerate a tracheostomy placement especially given his underlying throat cancer.
They were also told that a bicarbonate drip was started for his acidosis.
HEMODYNAMICS:  Hemodynamic wise, he was hypotensive and dependent on two pressors; namely, Levophed and vasopressin drip to maintain his blood pressure.
His wife brought with her the patient's living will which was signed by him in [**2161**] in which he states that if he is in no position to speak for himself and in a state from which there was no hope of recovery he would desire no means of life-sustaining methods including no artifical ventilation, antibiotics or hemodialysis.
His Levophed drip and vasopressin drips were stopped at 6 p.m. on [**11-1**] in his family's presence.
