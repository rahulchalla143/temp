She was on the general medicine floor, with surgery following, and continued her antibiotics (switched to Augmentin/Flagyl), along with an aggressive bowel regimen b/c she had not had a bowel movement for a week.
CXR showed bilateral infiltrates, and she was given lasix with little response.
[**12-12**] she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy without complication, with gallbladder appearing "diseased, but not impressively so".
She was switched to Zosyn for antibiotic coverage.
Started empirically on methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q8hrs.
Given 80mg IV lasix prior to transfer with no improvement.
Briefly this is a 69 year old female with history of Non-Hodgkins's Lymphoma c/b and unclear h/o of cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia and chronic kidney disease, previous dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 40% up to 70%),who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2107-12-13**] one day post-op from lap cholecystectomy due to worsening oliguria and continued hypoxemia, patient was intubated prior to transfer.
In the MICU patient was found to be severely volume overloaded with minimal urine output, she did not have fevers or leukocytosis but had been transferred on high dose steroids (concern for vasculitides), Zosyn for antibiotics.
Throughout course patient remained afebrile, antibiotics were DC'ed.
In regards to volume status, patient was diuresed with IV lasix.
She also had a history of cutaenous vasculitis 8 months ago and found to have polyclonal croglobulinemia with evidence of small amount of lymphone in marrow, she was given chem and developed HSV and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] where she went to [**Hospital1 2025**] and was treated.
Patient reported to have baseline Cr 1.1-1.2.
MDS has been mostly in her RBC line, getting procrit as outpatient.

Infection seemed unlikely, as she had not had fevers or leukocytosis, though she had been on high-dose steroids.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix to reduce the fluid overload, estimated at over 30L.
Approximately 10L was removed during her hospital stay, and her respiratory function improved such that she was stable on 3L NC with no episodes of desaturation within 48 hours.
She should continue Lasix at 40mg IV to continue diuresis of 1-2L daily until she returns to her dry weight (estimated at 110 lbs), at which time she can revert to her prior home dose.
Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a known history of MPGN per prior renal biopsy, presumably associated with her hemstologic malignancy, however the Nephrology team did not feel that her fluid overload could be attributed to this disease, but this may have contributed to her response to the aggressive hydration in the weeks prior to her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Of note, the patient received steroids prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], which could have partially treated an non-ATN-related condition to adequately impair our ability to see a clear MPGN picture.
Given concern for h/o cryglobulinemia/vasculitis, a panel of rheumatology labs revealed high inflammatory markers and low complement levels, rhematoid factor ~120, consistent with known cryoglobulinemia, but not consistent with a pulmonary/renal syndrome, and given muddy brown casts, Nephrology felt a nephritic/vasculitic picture less likely.
Her creatinine dropped to her baseline of 1.1 at the time of discharge following auto-diuresis and recovery from ATN.
Pancytopenia: The patient is followed by Hematology at [**Hospital1 2025**] for previous pancytopenia, and is due for repeat bone marrow biopsy next month.
These were restarted, holding losartan and spironolactone given her reduced renal function.
Hydralazine and a nitrate were stared, and clonidine was increased to control her SBP < 180.
At the time of discharge, she was on her home doses of amlodipine and carvedilol, increased doses of Lasix and clonidine, and had started hydralazine and nitrate.
As her fluid overload is corrected, it is anticipated that she will return to her home regimen by restarting spironolactone and losartan, tapering off hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate, reducing clonidine to her home dose, and reducing Lasix to her home dose.
s/p cholecystectomy: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was on Zosyn for post-surgical prophylaxis.

You were given medication (Lasix) to remove this fluid throughout your stay.
The Lasix should be continued and you should track your weight daily to ensure that you continue to make progress.
We have made several adjustments to your home medications to control your blood pressure and to avoid damaging your kidneys.
The most likely order of changes: - restart spironolactone and losartan once your kidney function is normal - reduce the doses of hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate, with the goal of stopping them - reduce clonidine to your previous dose - reduce Lasix to your previous dose (once all the fluid is gone) This is a possible approach.
You also were noted to have low blood counts of your white and red cells.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - STOP spironolactone due to your reduced kidney function - STOP losartan due to your reduced kidney function - INCREASE clonidine to 0.3mg twice a day - INCREASE furosemide to 40mg IV twice a day.
- START hydralazine 50mg three times a day for high blood pressure - START isosorbide mononitrate 90mg daily for high blood pressure - START Tylenol, oxycodone, and lidocaine patch for pain.
- START Maalox, Colace, Senna, and simethicone for dyspepsia and constipation.
- START Flonase, guaifenesin, Cepacol lozenges and nasal saline spray for nasal congestion.
