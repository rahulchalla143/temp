Fracture deformities of the right posterior 7th and 8th ribs, clinical correlation is recommended to determine if there is an acute component.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were acquired with intravenous and oral contrast material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are calcified pleural plaques at the lung bases consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
An NG tube is seen with the tip in the antrum.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Normal-appearing contrast-filled appendix was visualized.
A Foley catheter was seen within the bladder.
[**2-28**] CT abd/pelvis: TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without administration of IV contrast.
NG tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with its tip in the stomach.
This study is limited by lack of IV contrast; hypodensities can be seen in the liver, which probably correspond to the innumerable low-density lesions seen on previous CT scan.
Total hip prosthesis in right hip.
Compared with [**2195-3-3**], the ET tube has been removed and a tracheostomy is now present.
A left-sided PICC line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.

The patient was was started on vanc/levo/Flagyl for aspiration/nosocomial PNA and aggressive bowel regimen for ileus secondary to narcotics.
He completed a one week course of antibiotics, successive CXRs following treatment failed to show any residual or new infiltrate to suggest persistent pneumonia.
However, he then continued to have daily fever spikes, and he was empirically treated with a one week course of Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible VAP pneumonia.
The patient's ileus improved with bowel regimen and avoiding sedatives and so did his respiratory status.
Plan is to wean off ventilator and decrease sedation by adding Haldol/prn for agitation.
He was continuously tried on C-PAP and PS with a goal to wean.
His suctioning frequency also decreased, and he was fitted for a valve by speech therapy, with intentions to undergo a swallow study.
He had one episode of melena (about 250 cc) on the morning after his trach/PEG placement, and a drop in his BP to 80's systolic.
He should continue on the PPI and follow-up with GI on an outpatient, elective basis for a repeat endoscopy/ EUS to evaluate the nodule seen in the stomach- as this may be possible GIST.
GI cleared the patient to restart his Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, but this may need to be stopped and other prophylaxis measures explored (i.e, filter placement) if he begins to rebleed.
Ileus improved with supportive care and avoiding narcotics, and patient was started on tube feeds.
Given these findings, surgery was consulted to comment on any surgical intervention that would be necessary, none was noted.
The patient was started on empiric Flagyl for C-Diff, as he had persistently large volume, greenish, guaiac positive stool output.
The patient was restarted on his tube feeds once his PEG tube was placed, which he tolerated well.
He was followed by the nutrition service for tube feed recommendations.
# Hip fracture: s/p mechanical fall and ORIF on [**2-12**].
The patient was continued on Tylenol and avoided narcotics as much as possible.
He was restarted on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
# Hyponatremia: Initially thought to be SIADH and fluid restriction was enforced.
# HTN: His Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued in the setting of hypotension.
However, he then became hypertensive on the day prior to discharge, and was started on an ACE for management, this may need to be titrated for optimal BP control.
He was maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, and provided with a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for GI protection.
