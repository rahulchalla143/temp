Post-surgical changes in the occipital region, with prior left cerebellar resection.
Prior right MCA infarction and occipital post-surgical changes as well as new right parietal hemorrhage are better evaluated on concurrent head CT.  Abd XR ([**2162-10-23**]): Contrast injected through the gastric tube opacifies the stomach without evidence of contrast extravasation.
En total, he received 3 U FFP, 2 vials of factor IX, 10 mg Vit K PO and 5 mg vit K IV (ED).
Given history of previous strokes and former recommendations not to use coumadin, the patient is being discharged on no anticoagulation, with recommendation to restart ASA on [**2162-11-3**] and to defer to PCP and neurosurgery about restarting coumadin at any point in the future.
G-Tube Placement: In the ED, a small catheter was placed for patency.
Tube feeds were started in the ICU at 15 cc with concern for abdominal pain.
consider giving bolus tube feeds and covering the PEG with a binder or ACE wrap when not in use to deecrease the risk of dislodging.
Hypertension: BP control was difficult while in the ED and the patient was briefly on labetolol gtt.
Following restarting his home hypertensive doses per G-tube, he was hypertensive to 180 requiring 20 mg labetolol IV, metoprolol 25 mg PO and 20 mg hydral IV.
He continued to have systolic blood pressure ranging 160-170s, and his dose of metoprolol was increased from 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to 50mg TID.
History of embolic stroke [**8-/2162**]: DC summary and notes from prior admission suggest patient was not to be restarted on coumadin, but rather asa and heparin gtt.
However, restarted on coumadin at rehab.
He should be restarted on ASA on [**2162-11-3**], with plan to discuss coumadin recs with PCP and neurosurgery in follow up.
