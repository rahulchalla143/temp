An arterial blood gas performed after intubation at the outside hospital revealed a severe acidosis, predominantly metabolic and less respiratory, with a serum bicarbonate of 9.
A chest x-ray done after intubation showed evolving bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with aspiration, and possibly evolving adult respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 69**] campus for further management.
Neo-Synephrine 2.
Bilateral lower extremities had two peripheral IVs with pressors being transfused and were cold to the touch.
A left femoral triple lumen catheter was placed for better access.
The patient was doing very poorly upon transfer over here, with worsening ventilation, oxygenation and persistent metabolic acidosis despite maximal ventilatory support and an attempt at correction of her metabolic acidosis.
The patient's ventilator settings were subsequently changed to FIO2 of 21% with a respiratory rate of 4.
The family agreed to starting a morphine drip if the patient started to appear uncomfortable.
