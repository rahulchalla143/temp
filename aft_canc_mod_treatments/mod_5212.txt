After his last hospitalization (d/c on [**2125-1-8**]), he was able to ambulate with a walker and had achieved modest pain control with methadone (dose was increased to 60 mg PO TID) to the point where he was not using much dilaudid for breakthrough.
However, since then, he has called the clinic multiple times for worsening pain not covered by medications at home.
He's increased the use of dilaudid to approximately 24 mg PO daily and had also started using MS Contin 30 mg PO BID.
However, treatment was deferred and the pt was admitted to 7F for better pain control and possible [**Hospital1 1501**] placement.
Discussions have been had during previous hospitalizations around hospice and what services are available at home.
Past Medical History: ROS: + "feeling warm", w/ temp of 99; however taking RTC tylenol at home + chills, but denies night sweats ~30# wt loss since [**11-27**] denies CP, palp, SOB denies URI sx other than mild ear pain denies LH, headaches, dizziness denies abd pain + mild odynophagia, but able to take PO liquids OK + n/v (none since yesterday) normal BM, nonbloody, no melena + numbness and tingling in genitals/buttocks since [**2125**] denies leg swelling + urinary retenion but no dysuria or hematuria .
From [**2124-5-29**] to [**2124-6-16**] he received palliative radiation to these areas.
Subsequently, in a staging work-up, a torso CT also indicated two lung lesions, and a lesion in his right kidney.
The patient transferred his oncological care to [**Hospital1 69**] in [**2124-8-22**] and started on Zometa and Sutent.
The lesion was treated with Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2124-9-18**] to 2,220 cGy in one fraction.
Subsequently, he had external beam radiation to these areas from [**2124-10-10**] to [**2124-10-16**].
He has been intermittently on Sutent since [**8-27**].
The Sutent was restarted on [**2124-12-18**].
Family History: M died of embolus to brain post surgery; F died of MI/CAD.
In LE, [**4-26**] plantarflexion bilaterally, dorsiflexion 4-/5 bilaterally and symmetric; knee flexion/extension [**4-26**] on R, [**3-26**] on L but limited by pain.
Numerous osseous metastases with soft tissue with bony destruction as described above, overall not significantly changed since prior study.
Increased fat stranding in bilateral lower pelvis seen in extraperitoneal area with small amount of fluid with increased anasarca.
Some engorgement of mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature may be due to supine positioning.
Right subclavian line tip projects over the SVC.
Osseous metastases with surrounding soft tissue and bone destruction, not significantly changed from [**2125-2-1**].
On the other hand, there is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and abnormality at the right lung base, suggesting this may be asymmetric edema, either cardiogenic or related to reaction to medications or drug products.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 67759**] is a 44 year old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who was admitted on [**2125-1-24**] for pain management and rehab placement.
His Sutent was initially held, pain service was consulted, and his pain management was adjusted according to his needs.
At maximum doses, he required 240 mg OxyContin TID, a Dilaudid PCA set at 1 mg basal with 4 mg q6min, Lyrica 150 mg [**Hospital1 **], three lidocaine patches, and Tylenol around the clock.
His bowel regimen was maximized with the extreme doses of narcotics.
He was given a dose of gemcitabine on [**1-31**], and his Sutent was restarted.
During the admission, he also developed urinary pain (despite the presence of a foley catheter); this has been controlled with oxybutynin and Pyridium.
A multidisciplinary meeting was held on [**2-9**] (social work, case management, medicine, anesthesia, nursing all represented) to determine the plan; the patient was approached regarding the decision to pursue an intrathecal pump, which he had previously rejected.
With IV antibiotics (levofloxacin, metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia) and decrease in pain medications, as well as the addition of high dose steroids, he improved and was transferred back to the oncology floor.
Attempts were made the week of [**2-20**] - [**2125-2-23**] for placement of an intrathecal (IT) pump.
Pt was started on vancomycin and aztreonam was later added.
Flagyl was continued and levofloxacin was D/C.
Azithromycin was then added for atypical coverage.
He will be continued on aztreonam, vancomycin, flagyl, and azithromycin upon transfer to [**Hospital1 112**].
