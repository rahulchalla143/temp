Hematology/Oncology:  Given the patient's recent intracranial bleeds due to thrombocytopenia, there was a high level of concern for doing further consolidation chemotherapy, given the risk of thrombocytopenia associated with that, leading to further bleeding in the brain.
Lumbar puncture had been considered to rule out central leukemia and, prior to doing the lumbar puncture, re-imaging of the brain was performed to look for any central lesions, any increased intracranial pressure secondary to hydrocephalus, and also to look for any structural defects which may have predisposed to the bleeding.
If, in fact, a structural lesion was present as a cause of the bleed, repair of that lesion, if possible, was felt to reduce the risk of further chemotherapy.
Therefore, Interventional Neuroradiology as well as Neurosurgery were consulted to comment on the possibility of a vascular malformation and possible treatment options.
With that information, weighing the risks and benefits of withholding treatment, it was decided that without treatment, the chance of her leukemia to relapse would be 100% and, in long discussions with the patient, whose mental status had improved greatly, and her family, it was decided that further treatment was indicated and, starting on [**2154-12-7**], she was begun on high-dose ARA-C treatment to be given twice daily on days one, three and five.
She tolerated the treatment very well.
Her counts will be followed very closely over the ensuing week, with plans to transfuse matched platelets as necessary, as well as other blood products that become necessary as her bone marrow becomes further suppressed.
With the high-dose ARA-C, she was given Anzemet for anti-emesis, in addition to Decadron, which was given at 20 mg intravenously on days one and two, and decreased to 10 mg intravenously twice a day on days three through five.
Neurology:  Her previously-described right frontal and mid-brain bleeds were unchanged as seen on the MRI performed on [**2154-12-3**].
She performed very well again on cerebellar testing with her high-dose ARA-C, including finger-to-nose testing.
Infectious Disease:  At the request of the Infectious Disease consult team, the abdomen was re-scanned with MRI and the chest was CT scanned to rule out or to look for interval change in the presumed fungal infection.
She was continued on AmBisome, which was held during the course of consolidation chemotherapy but restarted 24 hours after cytarabine was completed.
Infectious Disease ultimately recommended planning to complete a total of six weeks of AmBisome and then repeating MRI for interval change after that period of time.
If then the splenic lesions had decreased in size or number of lesions, then itraconazole could be substituted for AmBisome, with reconsideration for starting AmBisome again if further chemotherapy was administered in the future.
She tolerated an oral diet without any difficulty, and had no signs or symptoms of aspiration.
