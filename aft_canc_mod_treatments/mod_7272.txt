She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a rigid bronchoscopy with possible stent intervention by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
The patient has also been requiring narcotics for her left hip fracture since last year and had evidence of dependence.
Morphine drip.
Ventilator settings at AC 400 by 12 at a PEEP of 5 and 100% FI02.
General:  She was a well appearing intubated woman in no apparent distress.
LEFT BRONCHIAL MASS:  The patient was kept intubated for signs of hypoventilation upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] and MICU.
She continued to have agitation while on the ventilator but was easily sedated with Ativan, morphine, and propofol drips.
A metal stent was placed with no resulting inflation of the lung postprocedure.
She remained intubated showing signs of hypoventilation.
She was also treated for MSSA pneumonia with Oxacillin initially.
She also was treated with vancomycin for a temperature while on Oxacillin.
Additional Gram's stain revealed gram-negative rods and she was started on ciprofloxacin and then switched to levofloxacin for concern of gram-negative rod coverage.
The patient's family was informed of the poor prognosis regarding weaning off mechanical ventilation.
She continued to spike low-grade fevers while on the Oxacillin and Fluoroquinolone.
She was watched for one day post stent with no improvement in chest x-ray appearance of the left lung collapse.
It was determined at this time that the patient probably would not improve on the ventilator and the patient's daughter agreed to extubation and comfort measures only for the patient.
It should also be noted that a pleural effusion was noted on the left lung and 800 cc were drained in the OR during rigid bronchoscopy when a left chest tube was placed to that side.
The patient underwent extubation on [**2115-7-17**] and was administered Ativan and morphine drips, titrating up for sedation and comfort.
