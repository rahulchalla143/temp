He regained consciousness and and fingerstick were in mid 100s.
He was transferred to the ICU after a total of 3 amps D50 and 1 dose of unasyn.
While in the MICU patient required D20 gtt for 20 hours beacuse of low blood glucose that was stopped on [**5-9**].
He was kept on unasyn and cipro was added on [**5-9**] for broader coverage.
Patient started on dopamine for decreased blood pressures.
His blood pressure remained stable and dopamine was quickly turned off.
He had ERCP on [**2173-5-10**] with stent replaced with double pigtail biliary stent, dilated CBD at 15 mm, obstruction seen at L main hepatic duct, sludge and stone debris extracted.
LFTs trended down after stent change.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with possible cholangiocarcinoma, HTN, CAD, hypothyroidism, tachy/brady syndrome with recent CBD stent on [**5-1**] presenting after episode of unresponsiveness found to have a fingerstick of 6, found to have cholangitis.
A double pigtail biliary stent was placed and the patient was covered broadly with Unasyn/ciprofloxacin.
The patient was weaned of pressors and transferred to the general medical floor.
Given his poor long-term prognosis, in the setting of ongoing biliary obstruction (possibly due to cholangiocarcinoma given markedly elevated CA [**85**]-9 at 2551) and risk of recurrent cholangitis, as well as his rapid clinical decline over the course of the last several months (malnutrition, declining mental status), the patient's family decided to pursue comfort-oriented care.
A hematology consult was obtained, who felt that, while the patient's risk of thrombosis was high, (presumed cancer, possible HIT antibody), his risk of bleeding in the setting of underlying liver dysfunction and recent procedure was also high.
Given the ultimate decision to pursue comfort oriented care, anti-coagulation was not pursued.
5) Tachy/brady syndrome/atrial fibrillation: The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] rate frequently dipped to the 30s-40s, particularly while sleeping.
