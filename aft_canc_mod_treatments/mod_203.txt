Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] is a 60 yo male with history of metastatic esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy but with recurrence as well as brain metastasis, recurrent pneumonias and thromboemboli on lovenox who presented with esophageal stent migration into right lung and septic shock with afib RVR.
He was initially intubated for this and a chest tube was placed on the right side to suction.
He required vasopressors as well to maintain his [**Known lastname **] pressure and an esmolol drip for afib with RVR.
Thoracic surgery was consulted about possible operative management of his stent and hydropneumothorax on the right.
They did not feel that there would be any worthwhile outcome from surgery given the scope of the procedure it would require and the baseline metastatic cancer.
The family decided to make the patient CMO, understanding that he would pass away from hypoxia and sepsis.
His antibiotics, vasopressors, esmolol, and mechanical ventilation were discontinued.
