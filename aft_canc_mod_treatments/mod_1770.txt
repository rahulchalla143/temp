Multilevel spondylosis is seen including a disc osteophyte complex at C5/C6 and C6/C7.
Brief Hospital Course: 56M with rectal carcinoma s/p resection, chemoradiation who was referred to ED for R common iliac DVT and was found to be febrile.
He was treated with Lovenox, empiric antibiotics, however developed progressive weakness initially concerning for spinal cord compression (MRI pan spine showed no cord compression, while MRI of head showed a stable cerebellar herniation through craniotomy site without evidence of infection).
His exam progressed to bilateral leg weakness, worsened bilateral hand and lower leg numbness, tongue numbness, and dysphagia to liquids and solids and patient developed progressive loss of reflexes.
# GBS Patient with ascending weakness, loss of reflexes and CSF with albuninocytologic dissociation.
His NIF and vital capacity apparently declined while in medical ICU and he was intubated on [**2161-2-20**] based on above and in setting of tachypnea.
Neurology and neurosurgery followed the patient and he was maintained on standing dexamethasone which was subsequently discontinued given negative imaging.
He developed urinary retention (bladder scan with 500cc) though also may have been holding in his urine due to physical difficulty using urinal.
Enoxaprin was initially started and then held starting [**2-16**] for an LP.
He was switched to Heparin SC TID during that interval and changed back to Lovenox on [**2-18**].
# Fever: Given recent chemotherapy, was initially concerning for infection.
After switch to Levofloxacin he spiked and was thus changed back to Cefepime/Vanc before being changed to Levo/Flagyll as above with plan to continue for 7 days.
All of infectious evaluations proved to be unrevealing including BCx, UCx, Stool Cx, C.diff Assay, Legionella antigen, sputum and BAL washings.
Antibiotics were thus discontinued on [**2-22**].
