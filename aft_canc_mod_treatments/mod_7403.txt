She went for cystoscopy with plan to place b/l stents.
No stents could be placed due to her anatomy but a 22F three-way foley with continuous bladder irrigation which showed clearing after the procedure.
She then had b/l percutaneous nephrostomy tubes placed by IR to solve the primary cause of her ARF.
Her creatinine dramatically improved after the procedures back down to its baseline.
She remains with nephrostomy tubes.
# Respiratory failure: Patient required re-inbuation after dropping O2 sats and being unresponsive post-cystoscopy.
This reason is unclear as there was not excessive sedation during procedure per urology and extubation was uneventful post-OP.

# Hypertension: Her anti-hypertensive meds were adjusted as needed.
She will likely be discharged on metoprolol alone.
