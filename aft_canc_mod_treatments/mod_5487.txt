He was intubated for respiratory distress.

[**11-18**] CXR: No significant interval change [**11-18**] KUB: Limited study demonstrating findings consistent with ascites [**11-19**] CXR: Small stable bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectases with continued mild pulmonary edema [**11-21**] CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions, increased moderate pulmonary edema [**11-22**] CXR: maybe mild increase in extent of R pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] for management of the MI, for which he underwent a cardiac catheterization involving placement of 5 bare-metal stents by interventional cardiology on [**2181-10-24**].
The following day an abdominal CT showed a pre-sacral abscess insufficiently controlled by the operatively-placed JP drain, for which a CT-guided pigtail catheter was placed by interventional radiology on [**2181-10-26**].
Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics were continued consisting of Vancomycin and Zosyn.
The patient's mental status was slow to awaken, Head CT on [**10-29**] was negative for acute pathology, all sedation and narcotic medication was held, and eventually his mental status improved to permit extubation, and eventually transfer to the floor on [**2181-11-6**].
Aspiring and plavix were continued.
Nutrition was transitioned to tube feeds via an NGT; he failed swallow evaluations.
High ileostomy outputs revealed CDiff enteritis, for which IV Flagyl and later vancomycin via both NGT and enema (via the distal limb of the ileostomy) were instituted.
The broad-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued after a 14-day course.
A gastrograffin enema on [**2181-11-7**] revealed no anastomotic leak; the JP drain was subsequently discontinued.
ALCS was instituted and entailed 1 mg of epinephrine, 2mg of atropine, 2 amps of bicarb, and 2 min of CPR.
Pt was intubated and returned to the SICU; presumptive causes were aspiration versus persistent metabolic acidosis.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were reinstituted due to a new and persistent leukocytosis and low-level pressor requirement.
A new pigtail catheter was placed into the collection on [**2181-11-15**] by interventional radiology.
The recent CT also revealed large-volume ascites; abdominal exam revealed significant distension and the ventilator pressures were increased as well.
Accordingly, a therapeutic paracentesis was performed on [**2181-11-15**].
He was aggressively resuscitated with transfusions to correct his coagulopathy and anemia, ultimately totalling 10u of PRBC, 10u FFP, and 2u Plt (despite the recent cardiac stents due to life-threatening hemorrhage), as well as vitamin K, over the next 8 hours.
The ileostomy output ceased but he developed worsening abdominal distension, increasing peak inspiratory pressures, increasing pressor requirements, consistent with an abdominal compartment syndrome.
Correction of coagulopathy continued over the next 12 hours, the PRBC requirements slowed, and he returned to the OR for the planned second look.
Over the next 48 hours the resuscitation plateaued and transfusion requirements minimized; he returned to the OR on [**11-18**] for closure and placement of a G-tube.
In light of holding the aspirin and plavix, cardiac enzymes were cycled and noted to be rising.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of new MI and cardiology consult agreed, with recommendation to resume antiplatelet therapy once able, which was done one week later.
The patient did develop atrial fibrillation and hypotension, initially unresponsive to beta-blocker and calcium-channel-blocker but later successfully restored to sinus rhythm after amiodarone and electrical cardioversion x4.
The hepatic failure also continued to evolve, with bilirubins approaching 18.
In light of the multi-system organ failure and poor prognosis, the pt's HCP declined dialysis and later decided to make the patient CMO.
After receiving the last rites by the pastor, the patient was extubated, started on morphine gtt, and expired at 17:40 on [**2181-11-26**].
