While he denied further chest pain, the patient was continued on the Heparin drip.
On discussing with the patient's attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that given the patient's advanced metastatic disease, anticoagulation would not be started on the patient such as Coumadin.
Pulmonary:  The patient was desatting on admission and required some oxygen due to aggressive volume repletion for hypotension.

The Foley was replaced when the patient failed a voiding trial and then discontinued again and the patient had no further hematuria but this should be followed up after the patient is discharged.
