On [**2150-6-26**], a fine needle aspiration of his left cervical node revealed monoclonal infiltrate with B cells positive for CD10 antigen, consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (small, noncleaved and large cell histology).
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, where he was started on hemodialysis via a right internal jugular catheter and was intubated for airway protection.
A renal ultrasound revealed massive homogeneous enlargement of the kidneys and a bronchoscopy for his recurrent hemoptysis revealed a large clot/vascular mass in his right bronchus intermedius with spill-over blood in the left bronchus.
The patient was started on methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg q.d.
intravenously and allopurinol 150 mg q.d.
On [**2150-7-3**], he was transfused blood for a low hematocrit with the hematocrit coming up to 30.
His last day of hemodialysis was on [**2150-7-3**].
On [**2150-7-4**], the patient was still intubated and sedated on a morphine and lorazepam drip with low grade fevers and requiring high doses of PEEP.
On [**2150-7-5**], the patient was still intubated and sedated after being agitated on [**2150-7-4**].
He was also treated for presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin during his medical intensive care unit stay.
For his coagulopathy, the patient received estrogen, DDAVP and vitamin K.  Finally, he was extubated on [**2150-7-5**] and transferred to the oncology floor for planned low dose cyclophosphamide and vincristine.
The patient was on antiretroviral therapy until this admission.
NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA : This was status post fine needle aspiration of cervical lymph node on [**2150-6-26**], which revealed monoclonal B cell infiltrates and CD10 positive, consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of either small cell, noncleaved cell or large cell history.
Perianal papillomatosis:  This was status post laser surgery in [**2148-2-15**].
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Allopurinol 150 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg intravenous q.d.
Solu-Medrol 60 mg intravenous q.d.
Estrogen 35 mg intravenous q.d.
Calcium acetate two tablets p.o.
He had never used intravenous drugs.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  On [**2150-7-11**], the patient received his first dose of cyclophosphamide and vincristine as well as packed red blood cells for a hematocrit drop to 19.
He finished receiving his chemotherapy and blood at a slower rate.
The patient continued to receive methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg intravenous q.d.
prednisone and slowly tapered off.
His allopurinol was continued throughout his hospitalization and raised to a dose of 300 mg p.o.
He had a bump in his white blood cell count after his first day on the floor because he received an extra dose of methylprednisolone by mistake.
The patient received a total of four units of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit of 19.
It was unclear why his hematocrit had dropped to 19 on this day, since his hemoptysis was decreasing.
His calcium acetate was increased to three tablets t.i.d.
with meals for an increase in his phosphorus and he was given repletion for a low calcium.
His intravenous fluids on [**2150-7-8**] were increased to 150 cc/hour of D5W with bicarbonate to alkalinize his urine.
On [**2150-7-12**], he was started on Neupogen subcutaneously for a low white blood cell count status post chemotherapy.
It was decided that the patient would need six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy.
He may substitute the doxorubicin with DaunoXome because it is less cardiotoxic and the patient has already received ABVD for Hodgkin's disease in the past.
Because of bone marrow involvement, the patient will need intrathecal therapy with ara-C times four treatments.
It was decided that allopurinol should stay for ten days post chemotherapy and that G-CSF should be given for at least ten days to increase his counts.
He has an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to begin chemotherapy on [**2150-7-21**] at 3 PM.
On [**2150-7-15**], the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26 in preparation for discharge.
Aggressive intravenous fluids were continued with D5W and three ampules of bicarbonate.
The patient was continued on calcium acetate and Nephrocaps.
His Foley catheter was discontinued on [**2150-7-8**].
His Nephrocaps were discontinued and changed to a multivitamin with trace minerals because the patient was no longer on hemodialysis.
His calcium, magnesium and potassium were occasionally low and these were repeated as necessary.
Intravenous fluids were discontinued on [**2150-7-14**].
He was continued on Levaquin for a total of ten days and this was discontinued on [**2150-7-15**].
His oral thrush was treated with Nystatin swish and swallow and Peridex.
His Levaquin dose was increased to 500 mg p.o.
On [**2150-7-8**], Bactrim SS one p.o.
On [**2150-7-10**], the patient was restarted on his antiretroviral therapy.
On [**2150-7-10**], the patient spiked a fever in the evening and he was started on ceftazidime intravenously.
[**Name2 (NI) **] also had recurrence of his hemoptysis and it was decided, with the infectious disease team's input and approval, to start the patient on intravenous acyclovir.
His stools were negative for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Isospora and Microsporidium as well as being negative for Clostridium difficile twice.
Acyclovir was started at 350 mg intravenous every eight hours.
The plan is to complete a ten day course of acyclovir for herpes simplex I.
The question remains as to whether to continue him on ceftazidime, which is an intravenous medication for his neutropenia, until his absolute neutrophil count is greater than 500 and he is afebrile.
He required oxygen by nasal cannula for only a couple of days and then was on room air doing well.
Occasionally, he experienced some wheezing and he was started on albuterol metered dose inhaler and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer p.r.n.
He was continued on Levaquin for a total of ten days to treat his pneumonia.
He received two nebulizer treatments.
A chest x-ray showed increased vascularity, so intravenous fluids were decreased a little bit to 100 cc/hour instead of 150 cc/hour.
Albuterol metered dose inhaler was changed to a standing dose of q.i.d.
The patient was started on acyclovir as noted above.
His hemoptysis did continue to improve after the exacerbation.
He did have recurrent hiccups throughout his hospitalization stay with Thorazine being given every day and raised to 50 mg t.i.d.
On [**2150-7-16**], the patient was given Baclofen for his hiccups, which seemed to work more effectively than the Thorazine, so he might consider either one of these as an outpatient if his hiccups do continue.
He did have some nausea, which was treated with Compazine b.i.d., Compazine p.r.n.
DISPOSITION:  The plan is for the patient to receive his gallium scan today, [**2150-7-16**], in [**Hospital1 190**] and then to be transferred to [**Hospital6 7068**].
