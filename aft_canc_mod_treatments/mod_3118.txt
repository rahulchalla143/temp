Admission Date:  [**2123-2-10**]     Discharge Date: [**2123-3-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-4-3**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, status post chemotherapy treatment leading to myelodysplastic syndrome and subsequently to acute myelogenous leukemia, who is now at day plus 97 status post allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant, who presents with a history of fevers and a new radiologic finding of a left upper lobe nodule.
Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome leading to acute myelogenous leukemia by bone marrow biopsy in [**2122-1-28**]; now at day plus 97 status post allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant from a [**7-4**] matched sibling donor.
History of breast cancer diagnosed in [**2117**]; status post right mastectomy and right axillary lymph node dissection; status post CALGB chemotherapy regimen subsequently leading to myelodysplastic syndrome (as described above).
History of Sweet syndrome; treated with prednisone in the past.
History of suspected Aspergillus with a video-assisted thoracic surgery done in [**2122-9-28**] which showed evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.
Cyclosporine 120 mg once per day continuous intravenous.
AmBisome 180 mg intravenously every other day.
Methylprednisolone 30 mg by mouth once per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Ativan 0.5 mg by mouth q.6h.
Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once per day.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth twice per day.
Magnesium sulfate 3 grams intravenously once per day.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest computed tomography with contrast revealed (1) slightly speculated 1.4-cm left upper lobe nodule which had arisen since the prior chest computed tomography in [**2122-10-28**]; given the patient's fever this most likely represents an infectious process, consider Aspergillosis; (2) probable radiation changes at the right apex unchanged; and, (3) persistent right-sided pleural effusion which had decreased in size since previous chest computed tomography on [**2122-11-23**].
They determined that a bronchoscopy was not indicated as the lung lesion was in too peripheral a location for an adequate bronchoalveolar lavage to be accomplished.
Also on [**2-12**], the Infectious Disease team was consulted who agreed with the plan for a video-assisted thoracic surgery and had recommendations for cultures to be sent in addition to pathology.
No change in her antibiotic regimen was made prior to the video-assisted thoracic surgery.
On [**2-13**], the patient was prepared for a video-assisted thoracic surgery by Cardiothoracic Surgery; however, in the hour prior to the operation, the patient's blood cultures came back with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.
Therefore, the patient's video-assisted thoracic surgery was cancelled and a course of vancomycin was initiated in addition to levofloxacin and AmBisome.
Caspofungin was approved by the Infectious Disease team on [**2-17**] as there were ongoing concerns about the possibility of aspergillosis by the primary team.
It was decided to hold on initiating Bactrim for the possibility of tachycardia.
She was continued on vancomycin, and caspofungin, and AmBisome while her cultures were pending.
On [**2-23**], the cultures from the video-assisted thoracic surgery grew out nocardia.
At that time, intravenous Bactrim was intubated per the recommendations of the Infectious Disease team.
The patient also had her chest tube removed on this day which was postoperative day three from the video-assisted thoracic surgery.
At the time of this dictation, the patient had been afebrile on Bactrim but was having complications of nausea with this therapy.
GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was continued on cyclosporine continuous intravenous throughout her hospital stay.
At the time of this dictation, she had been receiving cyclosporine at 72 mg once per day.
Her prednisone dose was also tapered to 10 mg of prednisone once per day during her hospital stay.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient required at least 3 grams of intravenous magnesium repletion each day while on cyclosporine.
She was continued on total parenteral nutrition at the time of this dictation.
The patient was continued on intravenous Bactrim as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (per the Infectious Disease team) for treatment of this disseminated nocardia.
During her hospital stay, the patient did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2-22**] for ongoing anemia.
This worsening renal function was thought to be related to medications; in particular AmBisome and cyclosporine were suspected to be causing renal insufficiency.
The patient did initially respond to a decrease in her cyclosporine and adjustment of some of her medications; however, at the time of this dictation, her creatinine remained at 2 despite serial decreases in her cyclosporine.
The possibility that intravenous Bactrim was contributing to her renal insufficiency was being explored.
Imaging of the area was not done, and her pain was controlled with a patient-controlled analgesia.
