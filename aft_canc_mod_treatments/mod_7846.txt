Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
