HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 77 year old female with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy with 5FU and Leucovorin.
The patient treated symptoms with Imodium with some effect.
The patient was seen in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic on the day prior to admission and on the day of admission where she was rehydrated with intravenous fluids.
Abdominal pain was continuing to get worse and she is therefore being admitted for management of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Colon cancer T2 N2 M0, status post resection and adjuvant chemotherapy with 5FU and Leucovorin.
Aortic stenosis with aortic valve repair in [**2170**] with a bovine valve, not anti-coagulated, mild coronary artery disease.
Avapro 30 q. day.
Lipitor 12.5 p.o.
Nexium 40 mg p.o.
Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
Zoloft 100 mg p.o.
Diarrhea was believed to be due to chemotherapy side effects.
She was hydrated and continued on Imodium as well as Octreotide and Ativan for nausea.
At that point, she became acutely hypoxic, hypotensive and required intubation and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
In the Intensive Care Unit, x-ray reveals intubation with large amount of what appeared to be aspirated matter in the right lung.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, initially Vancomycin and Zosyn which she received for about a week, and then she was switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl which she had a ten day course of.
She was aggressively fluid resuscitated which eventually led to fluid overload.
At the same time, the patient was diagnosed with heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Her heparin flushes and subcutaneous heparin were discontinued and she was started on Argatroban for heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
The patient remained intubated for about two weeks at which point extubation was attempted.
Of note, during the sepsis exacerbations, the patient received large amounts of intravenous fluids and therefore was grossly volume overloaded.
She was continuously being diuresed with Lasix and at the time of the first extubation she was still about 15 liters positive.
For the next five days, she had a very uneventful course, was off all antibiotics with no signs of infection.
Of note, she has had prior gastrointestinal upsets and ulcers on aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, so at this point, it is most prudent to treat the pain with Tylenol and very weak opioids.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Currently the patient is extremely deconditioned and non-ambulatory, breathing comfortably on face mask and being fed per post-pyloric feeding tube, alert and oriented, very interactive and appropriate.
Zoloft 100 p.o.
Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Lasix p.r.n.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
