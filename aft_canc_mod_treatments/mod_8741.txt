He received chemotherapy and got R-ICE therapy.
His Lasix was continued but [**Month/Day (2) **] held due to concern for thrombocytopenia from chemotherapy.

In the past few months, he had recurrence of lymphoma and was admitted for R-ICE chemo in 11/[**2113**].
On [**11-21**] he began having chest pressure, acutely SOB and hypoxic, so started on NRB and CXR showed flash edema and transferred to MICU for diuresis.
There, on [**11-23**] he NSTEMI'd with positive uptrending cardiac enzymes and EKG changes, thought to be due to demand ischemia, so taken to cardiac cath which showed bad 3vd and 60-70% left main disease, but he was not felt to be an operable / intervenable candidate, so it was medically managed with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and ACS medications.
Heparin drip was stopped.
His cardiac regimen including antiHTN meds were adjusted.
He was also noted to have some purulence coming from the inferior-most part of his surgical wound -- this grew Ecoli but was not thought to be the sole reason for his fevers/leukocytosis as the supposed wound infection was quite small.
He was started on empiric broad spectrum ABx, surgery consulted, NGT placed, TPN started eventually.
Most of his oral medication regimen at that time was held.
Surgery came and saw him, and said he was not operable because extremely poor prognosis and surgery would likely kill him.
So his SBO was medically managed with broad spectrum ABx, NGT to suction, Octreotide for secretions, and family was very aware and involved in the grim prognosis.
On the night of [**12-4**] he again flashed, got more hypoxic and required NRB mask, and was diuresed.
Patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facilty with comfort measures only.
Prior to discharge his pain was well controlled with concentrated oral morphine [**9-27**] mL Q2H:PRN pain and air hunger.
additionally he recieved 8 mg Ondansetron ODT Q8H:PRN for nausea and Ativan 0.5-1 mg PO Q2H:PRN anxiety, nausea or air hunger.
-Would recomend sub cutaneous octreotide if bowel obstruction symptoms worsen -Patient stable on Oral morphine, ativan and zofran PRN for symptom management as above.
