Upon arrival on the floor, pt's BP was 79/54, and he was bolused 500 cc NS over 60 min, as well as placed on NS drip at 125 ml/hr.
's surgery to place a venous access device was postponed because of WBC = 0.8.
At that time, pt's PPx Abx was changed from acyclovir and sulfamethoxale/trimethoprim, to atovaquone.
Pt took his first two doses of atovaquone one day prior to admission.
Past Medical History: PAST ONC HX: - Multiple myeloma, Stage IIIA ([**2117-10-6**]):  Presented with hypercalcemia, hematuria, UPEP w/ monoclonal protein --- CT abd with lytic lumbar and sacral lesions --- BMbx with 30-50% plasma cells, elevate IgG Kappa = 6781 - Thalidomide and dexamethasone with response ([**2-9**]) - Stem cell mobilization with high dose cytoxan ([**2118-3-9**]) - AutoSCT with Melphalan ([**2118-5-13**]), c/b neutropenic fever, TPN [**2-4**] mucositis --- Melphalan-associated lung toxicity, treated with high-dose steroids ([**2118-6-6**]) .
PMH: - Pituitary adenoma ([**2112**]), s/p transsphenoidal resection/adrenal insufficiency - Intrasellar meningioma (resected [**2118-3-31**]) - Melanoma in situ - Hypotestosterone - Hypothyroidism [**2-4**] pituitary ablation - Type II diabetes [**2110**]-[**2111**]:  Per wife, controlled with glyburide only, then pt presented to clinic in [**2111**] with glucose = 20, resulting in d/c glyburide, and no subsequent need for glucose-controlling agents.
With onset of prednisone use, pt has been taking NPH insulin.
[**2118-7-17**] Cytogenetics BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS .
Intracranial hemorrhage:  Pt had an LP on [**7-27**] that was concerning for a SAH due to 1200 RBCs on 4th tube and yellow color.
Family discussed the issue and decided on comfort care measures only.
Pt was extubated later in that afternoon and made comfortable with morphine drip.
Mental status changes prior to [**7-29**]: This was likely multi factorial given hyponatremia, known infectious process in lung along with findings on MRI suggestive of septic emboli, and toxic-metabolic insults resulting in encephalopathy.
Meningitis, vasculitis ([**Doctor First Name **] neg), and ongoing seizure activity were also in differential.
He was on high dose steroids for desired effect of decreasing the lesions in the brain as well as broad spectrum antibiotics Meropenam and Vancomycin as well as acyclovir, voriconazole, and ambisone.
Also, pt has developed new firm, erythematous skin lesions and subcutaneous nodules on his LEs and abdomen that are concerning for septic emboli as well.
Pt was on broad coverage with Meropenam, vancomycin, acyclovir, voriconazole, and ambisone.
Neutropenia: Pt is s/p autoSCT almost 2 months ago and not on chemotherapy, so, the cause of neutropenia is unknown but suspected to be due to bactrim or infectious process.
Pt was started on filgrastim on [**7-17**].
Pantoprozale was stopped [**7-21**] due to pancytopenia.
Multiple myeloma, s/p autoSCT:  For prophylaxis pt had been on Bactrim for PCP as has been on high dose steroids for a long time.
He was on double strength Bactrim MWF, but was switched to atovaquone due to neutropenia which he took one day prior to admission.
He was started on aerosolized pentamine on [**2118-7-17**].
Pt was fluid resuscitated and placed temporarily on stress dose steroids of Hydrocort 100mg q8 hrs.
He was managed with fluid restriction starting on [**7-23**] and furosemide.
Elevated glucose in context of high dose steroids for melphalan lung toxicity: Pt was placed on long-acting insulin (NPH or glargine) with an insulin sliding scale.
Panhypopituitarism [**2-4**] transphenoid resection of pituitary adenoma:  Pt was on prednisone, which was occasionally changed to stress dose steroids for hypotension and later in effort to decrease brain lesions.
Pt was continued on home regimen of androderm patch 2.5 mg and levothyroxine 137 mcg daily.
Medications on Admission: Androderm patch 2.5 mg Levothyroxine 137 mcg daily prednisone 20 mg in a.m., 10 mg in p.m. NPH 12 units in a.m., 10 units in p.m. Fluconazole 200 mg [**Hospital1 **]: Pt.
