Newly apparent nodular focus projecting along the right lower lung, probably a nipple shadow, although a pulmonary nodule should be considered.
Right femoral stent is noted, patency cannot be assessed.
Given overall well appearance of the patient, would seem in favor of continuing if stent high risk for occlusion.
[**2121-3-29**] CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to [**2121-3-27**].
The patient received a bolus of normal saline and two units of packed red blood cells.
Because he had recently undergone stenting of peripheral artery, a retroperitoneal bleed remained on the differential.
His urinalysis in the ICU was suggestive of infection so he was started on ceftriaxone therapy.
Ceftriaxone was stopped and a repeat Ucx was unremarkable.
He was provided thiamine and folate.
The patient was discharged on thiamine and folate.
# Diabetes: Provided insulin sliding scale while in hospital.
