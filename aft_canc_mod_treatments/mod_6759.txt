Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had lengthy discussion w/ family and a plan for aggressive non-operative  management was made based on pt's age DNR/DNI status pre- hospitalization and co-morbidities.
She was started on Vanco/Zosyn, fluconazole.
on HD #1 and a covered esophageal stent was placed.
She was weaned and extubated on HD#2 without difficulty.
Pt was transferred from the ICU and TPN was started on HD#3.
On HD#6 she was taken to the OR for Exploratory laparotomy; placement of open tube gastrostomy (22 Malecot); placement of open tube jejunostomy (14-French whistle-tip); gastric biopsy.
Pt tolerated procedure well but was found to have what appeared to be Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary confirmed by by pathology.
Oncology was consulted and their recommendation was that aggressive measures including chemo or further surgery would not be beneficial.
An esophageal stent was placed over the area of perforation.
Initially pt's right chest tubes were draining serosanguinous drainage in small/mod amounts but on approx HD # 9 the drainage increased and became bilious.
It was thought that her esophageal stent had migrated.
She was sent for a EGD and the stent was repositioned.
Subsequently the drainage decreased and over the next few days became very pale green, thick and cloudy.
A left sided pleural effusion was seen on CXR and a left chest tube was placed and subsequently d/c'd when the effusion resolved.
Left PICC line placed [**12-30**].
She was maintained on broad spectrum IVAB Vanco, Zosyn, Caspo which she will need to complete a 6 week course.
TPN was d/c'd and tube feeds were started and increased to goal.
A decision was made to continue treatment so long as she continued to respond.
Hospice was also consulted but her, niece who is her proxy, [**Name (NI) 52213**] wanted to continue current CT and IVAB management.
