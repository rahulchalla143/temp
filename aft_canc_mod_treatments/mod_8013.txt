The patient was diuresed and transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He was given Levofloxacin for cellulitis.
The patient had a central line placed in the subclavian position on the day of transfer.
CLL with massive splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and anemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with baseline 2 liter O2 requirement and PCO2s running in the 50s chronically.
Fistulizing Crohn's disease status post colectomy and ileectomy with ileostomy.
Pneumococcal pneumonia with sepsis resistant to Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone treated with Azithromycin status post intubation in [**2105-3-17**].
Bilateral pleural effusion status post right thoracentesis.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.
Protonix 40 mg po q day.
Prednisone 40 mg po q day.
Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day.
Oxycontin 10 mg po b.i.d.
Ileostomy looked pink and healthy with guaiac negative output.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 56 year-old male with a history of CLL, massive splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with restriction, cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary hypertension, fistulizing Crohn's who presents with dyspnea.
After this finding he was started on Azithromycin as he had a Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin resistant Pneumococcal pneumonia in the same distribution as the last admission.
The patient's chronic steroids were attempted to be tapered.
He was treated with Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers along with Serevent and his diuretic was held as he appeared to be well diuresed after a day or two of oral diuretic.
Multiple family meetings were held to discuss the likelihood of not having much further therapeutic intervention for the patient's severe dyspnea.
He was tried on BiPAP with no improvement.
Family meeting was held and although the patient's daughter requested ongoing full aggressive care, the health care proxy who was the patient's wife requested that no intubation be pursued and that the patient be made comfortable.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, although the possibility of diastolic dysfunction was entertained.
He was somewhat hypotensive on the last day of admission responsive to volume resuscitation and his diuretics had been held for several days prior to this.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a right lower extremity cellulitis, which was treated with Clindamycin with good response.
C-diff toxin was negative.
When he became hypotensive he was switched to Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.
He also had evidence of ongoing hemolysis probably from destruction of white blood cells in the setting of steroids as well as some autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
On the final day of the patient's admission hematology oncology felt that the patient's CLL was progressing at a rapid rate and that he was unlikely to be treated given his other comorbidity conditions.
The patient with a history of fistulizing Crohn's disease status post ileostomy complicated by recent gastrointestinal bleed.
He did develop some postprandial discomfort likely secondary to splenomegaly, which improved with simethicone and Maalox.
The patient requested time to consider his options for end of life care as well as resuscitative measures.
The wife was the health care proxy and the patient did not receive any aggressive measures when he expired on his last day of admission.
