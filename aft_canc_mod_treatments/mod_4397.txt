Antibiotics were discontinued and she remained afebrle x 4 days at the time of discharge.
She remained with a dry, non-productive cough at the time of discharge however this was not thought to be related to an infectious process.

Steroids were tapered off and she was treated with Ativan.
After discussion with Hepatology it was decided to continue lamviudine while patient is receiving chemotherapy.
