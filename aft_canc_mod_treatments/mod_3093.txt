Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo M with metastatic esophageal CA on chemo s/p multiple dilatations who presented with weakness/fatigue/decreased po's.
# Respiratory distress: He was noted to have increasing respiratory distress and stridor on the floor and was transferred on [**3-13**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for elective intubation.
The initial plan was for him to have a tracheal stent placed by IP to relieve his tracheal stenosis as well as a J tube placement by thoracics surgery to provide him with nutrition.
Multiple attempts were made to transfer him to the operating suite to have this procedure performed but with only minimal movement his O2 saturation fell precipitously and he was not felt stable enough to move to the operating room.
At best, a tracheal stent would have provided a temporizing solution to his tracheal stenosis and after multiple discusssions with his family and his oncology team, the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.
