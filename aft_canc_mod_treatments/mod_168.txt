Cycle #1 decitabine chemotherapy.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for cycle #1 decitabine chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
You were given IV antibiotics and IV fluids and recovered quickly.
Chemotherapy was restarted and finished [**2171-2-4**].
Concern was raised about recurrent aspiration as the cause of your recent pneumonias.
Also during your stay, your heart rate became very fast, so you were evaluated by Cardiology and restarted on metoprolol, a blood pressure medication that also controls heart rate.
After starting this, your blood pressure became very low for a short while and improved with IV fluids.
You should have your blood counts checked at least every other day until they stabilize because you will continue to need frequent transfusions.
Metoprolol 25mg 2x a day.
You completed a course of antibiotics while in the hospital.
