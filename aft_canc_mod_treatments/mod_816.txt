2) Systolic congestive heart failure: The patient was volume overloaded on exam (elevated JVP and LE edema, and effusion on CXR) and was therefore diuresed with IV lasix.
was felt to be euvolemic, diuresis was stopped.
Unfortunately, the Pt's recuperation seemed to be limited by a combination of poor PO intake and inability to tolerate cardiac meds (both afterload reducers for CHF, and rate and rhythm controllers for PAF), due to low bp (baseline 90s/50s).
was evaluated by both cardiology and renal, and his poor cardiac function was felt to be due to multi-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy due to iron overload (from multiple transfusions for MDS).
The Pt's digoxin was held at admission, and the Pt.
In order to maintain a high enough blood pressure to receive CHF/AFib meds and diuretics, plan was made for the Pt.
