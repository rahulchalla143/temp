Perhaps these fractures relate to osteoporosis secondary to steroid administration, if this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was administered on a chronic basis .
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 40 yo F with AML s/p related allogenic bone marrow transplant in [**10-14**] with GVHD who presented for acute back pain and was found to have T11 compression fracture on MRI.
Back pain: MRI showed compression fracture of the T11 vertebral body and possibly also a minimal fracture of the L4 vertebral body, likely due to osteoporosis from chronic steroids use.
Pt was discharged on adequate pain regimen with narcotics.
Home antihypertensive medications were held because of low BP readings.
Although the patient remained on a low-dose of prednisone 10mg daily, a cortisol stimulation test was performed, which showed a strong rise from the suppressed endogenous cortisol level of 0.6 to 19 one half hour after the test, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
Later, BP readings were found not to correlate between left arm (PICC line inserted in right arm) and the thighs, likely because of severe vascular disease.
BP readings were subsequently taken from the thigh, and Metoprolol and Imdur were restarted as tolerated.
She was managed conservatively with SL NTG, Lopressor, which was titrated up as BP tolerated, [**Date Range **] 325 mg, [**Date Range **] 75 mg [**Hospital1 **], and Lovenox 60mg SC BID.
Pt continued to have episodes of chest pain, and troponin peaked to 0.27.
Medical management was maximized under the guidance of Cardiology.
Pt was titrated back up to Metoprolol 200 mg po BID, and pt was started on Ranolazone and her EKGs were monitored daily for QT prolongation.
UTI:  Pt had a U/A suspicious for UTI and because of her hypotension and concern for sepsis was initially started on Ceftriaxone.
This was changed to Cipro based on sensitivities from prior urine culture.
AML s/p related allogenic bone marrow transplant in [**10-14**] with chronic GVHD:  Cytoxan was initially held on admission but restarted after transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt was continued on her outpatient prednisone dose of 10 mg po daily, budesonide 3 mg po TID, and Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg po QID.
