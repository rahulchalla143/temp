In the field, EMS found him in respiratory distress and attempted nasal intubation which was partially successful.
Patient orally intubated by anaesthesia.
SBP elevated post Aspirin 300 PR, Plavix 600 given along with [**First Name3 (LF) **] gtt 8000 units Extensive nasal bleeding seen and this was ballooned by ER physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] gtt stopped although integrilin continued.
Pt also given 20 IV lasix.
During procedure pt given 40 IV lasix for elevated LVEDP.
He became hypotensive and was started on neosynphrine drip subsequently transitioned to levophed.
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: T 97.9, BP 96/53 on 5 dopamine and .0175 of levophed, P 90-100 O2 sat 94-93 on AC TV 500 RR 26 FiO2 100 PEEP 14 .
The endotracheal tube tip remains 2-3 cm above the level of the carina.
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Aortic balloon pump marker seen approximately 5.4 cm from the top of the aortic arch.
Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.
Swan-Ganz catheter again seen with tip at the main pulmonary artery.
Nasogastric tube seen coursing over the stomach, tip incompletely imaged.
Aortic balloon pump marker tip approximately 5 cm from the top of the aortic arch.
Increase in retrocardiac opacity likely representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
#) Cardiogenic shock/CAD: Patient presented from OSH in cardiogenic shock, intubated, on balloon pump and on neosinephrine.
His neosinephrine was switched to dopamine and norepinephrine.
His CXR showed complete white-out of both lung fields, thought secondary to pulmonary edema from cardiogenic shock, and aspiration pneumonitis.
His vent settings were therefore switched to allow minor hypercapnia to allow increased PEEP and improved oxygenation, similar to ARDS net protocol.
He was started on a lasix drip.
He was therefore taken for cardiac catheterization and received BMS X4 to his RCA.
Over the next several days, his hemodynamics improved and his pressors were weaned off.
His aortic balloon pump was discontinued after being in place for three days.
He was continued on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, captopril, and atorvastatin and will continue with these medications at home.
He was followed by CT surgery throughout his hospital stay and he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for likely CABG in the near future.
Did well for most of the day, initially refused to take medications because he insisted he would have a bad reaction to them, later on in the day he agreed to take his meds.
Patient was given lasix 20IV.
Hyperventilation was initially thought secondary to anxiety, he was given haldol .25mg IV and ativan 1mg IV X1.
He was started on zosyn and continued on vancomycin (started previously for fevers).
Ciprofloxacin was added a few days later for continued fevers.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were then discontinued and he is to complete a 7day course of Ciprofloxacin  #) Thrombocytosis:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4698**] developed thrombocytosis during this hospital stay.
Plavix was increased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for prevention of thrombosis of his BMS x 4.
Thought secondary to IV dye load, in addition to possible intraaortic balloon pump placement which was shown to be placed too low on CXR.
#) Oropharyngeal bleeding: He was seen by ENT, who performed nasal packing.
Patient was maintained on mupirocin while the pack was in place.
Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Disp:*90 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute STEMI- inferior MI s/p stent to RCA Ventilator associated pneumonia Systolic CHF with EF 40%   Discharge Condition: Stable, planning for CABG in next few weeks.
You had a cardiac catheterization to have a stent placed in the arteries of your heart to open them up.
You were also intubated for several days and required another intubation for a multi-focal pneumonia leading to respiratory distress.
Because of the new stent in your heart artery, you must take aspirin 325mg daily and plavix 75mg twice daily every day without stopping.
Please DO NOT stop these medications without talking to your cardiologist first.
Please continue to take your other medications as prescribed.
