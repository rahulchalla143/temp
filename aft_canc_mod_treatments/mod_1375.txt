She was started on a slow prednisone taper, as the reason for steroids is unclear.
In the ICU, she was started on heparin and transitioned to low dose lovenox.
Due to risk of bleeding, with recent GI bleed and severe thrombocytopenia, Lovenox was discontinued except for prophylaxis dose subcutaneous heparin.
Further treatment was deferred given her overall clinical situation.
She continued XRT while here in the hospital for palliation of her bladder tumor, and will continue this as long as she is able to tolerate it.
She was followed by palliative care, and was started on standing oxycodone for pain control, with good effect.
Will continue outpatient meds with albuterol prn  7.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin for 5 days, although the culture was never speciated due to technical reasons.
