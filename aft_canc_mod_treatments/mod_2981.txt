Over the next several days the patient continued to be short of breath while requiring non-rebreather face mask to maintain her oxygen saturation.
On [**2182-3-25**] the patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy with the goal being tumor destruction and dilation.
She also underwent therapeutic aspiration of retained secretions in the left upper lobe.
The procedure was complicated by tooth obstruction of the upper incisor.
During the procedure it was noted that the left main stem tumor was very vascular and bled easily.
However, due to bleeding the procedure was cut somewhat early.
In addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] was consulted during the procedure about the feasibility of placing a left main stem stent, but given that he planned for a possible lobectomy or pneumonectomy, he felt that a stent in the airway would not be appropriate.
Therefore, a stent was not placed at that time by Interventional Pulmonary.
Therefore, she was intubated at the termination of her procedure and brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
At this point the Radiation Oncology resident was called for evaluation of the role of radiation therapy for Mrs.[**Known lastname 52537**] left main stem bronchus tumor.
Decision was made by Radiation Oncology in conjunction with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] for five radiation treatments while Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was in hospital.
The oncologist felt that there was little role for chemotherapy given her low performance score.
On [**2182-3-28**] Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Known lastname 52538**] Intensive Care Unit to the Medical service from the Thoracic service so that she would be able to go for her daily radiation therapy treatments, which would begin on [**2182-3-28**].
Post procedure Mrs.[**Known lastname 52537**] aeration of the left upper lobe did improve significantly.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was diuresed very gingerly secondary to episodes of hypotension and episodes of requiring pressors while in the Intensive Care Unit.
With the difficulty weaning Mrs. [**Known lastname **] from the ventilator, she was again reevaluated by Dr. [**Name (NI) **] of Interventional Pulmonary for stent placement.
He felt that there was little role for a stent as the stent could not open up the obstruction in the left lower lobe and was only useful if there was persistent left upper lobe clots.
After significant progress was made in diuresing Mrs. [**Known lastname **], and she was noted to be stable and comfortable and had tolerated pressure-support ventilation trial for several hours in the morning of [**2182-4-9**], an attempt was made to wean her PEEP again to 0.5.
She had significant blood secretions and adherent mucus secretions in her airway.
Given the difficulty weaning Mrs. [**Known lastname **] from the ventilator, conversations were renewed in terms of what could be done to stent open her left upper lobe airway in order to wean her from the ventilator.
The team felt that if the nodules had increased in size, that would be more suggestive that they were metastases and people would be less likely to continue forward in her treatment.
The stent was placed successfully on [**2182-4-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back from the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to the [**Hospital Ward Name 52538**] Intensive Care Unit for further observation and with hopeful weaning from the ventilator with the stent in place.
Her other chief medical problems during her stay in the [**Name (NI) 52538**] Intensive Care Unit from the date [**2182-3-28**] to [**2182-4-10**] included episodes of hypotension requiring intermittent pressure support with Neo-Synephrine as well as congestive heart failure complicated by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy requiring careful diuresis.
Nevertheless, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did wish to continue with aggressive therapy in the hopes of potential cure.
At the time of this dictation ends on [**2182-4-12**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had undergone the stent successfully and the plan was still in place for possible salvage/curative pneumonectomy of the left lung in the event that we were unable to wean Mrs. [**Known lastname **] over the next few days from the ventilator.
Please see remainder of hospital course for further events and discharge status.
