[**6-30**] R therapeutic thoracentesis by Interventional Pulmonology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3072**]) 4.
[**7-2**] new Option IVC filter plaved via R internal jugular vein, inferior to the pre-existing Optease filter by Interventional Radiology  History of Present Illness: 50-year-old male with a past medical history of extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p 9 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin (last [**2183-6-20**]), hepatitis C, multiple pulmonary embolisms with the last while on lovenox, endocarditis who presents with right thoracic pain and productive cough x several days.
This AM he awoke with sharp right sided pleuritic chest pain.
He went to [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] for scheduled chemotherapy and was found to have 02 saturation 87-88% on room air with recovery with 2L NC.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] began systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin on [**2182-12-11**].
Initially treated outpt with PO abx but then hospitalized for IV antibiotics.
Cycle 2 was given [**Date range (1) 80631**].
On [**2182-1-3**], he was started on combination therapy of pegasys 180 mcg/mL SQ weekly and ribavirin 1200 mg PO daily.
Initially, he was tolerating therapy relatively well except for mood swings, irritability and insomnia and he was closely monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1681**] in Psychiatry.
Apparently, he was taking twice the prescribed dose of citalopram 20 mg a day; and he had also relapsed into drinking alcohol; about [**9-17**] drinks per day for a few days.
Given these significant side effects, pegasys and ribavirin were eventually discontinued.
History of polysubstance abuse including heroin but is currently clean.

Dense consolidation and air bronchograms are seen in the left lower lobe (3:89), right lower lobe and right middle lobe (3:81).
Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
The previously described right subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position terminating in low SVC.
Newly placed right chest tube with introduction of air into the loculated fluid.
No evidence of right heart strain, but given the examination protocol, embolic load after PE cannot be determined.
A right chest tube and SVC line terminating in the mid SVC are appropriate.
Tip of the chest tube does project over the right mid and lower lung peripheral opacity although satisfactory positioning should be based on the clinical assessment as the tube appears to have a central lucency suggestive of air rather than fluid.Pleural-based opacity at the right mid to lower lung remains overall unchanged.
The parenchymal opacities surrounding the right chest tubes are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: ==================================================== BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY ==================================================== 50-year-old male with history of cholangiocarcinoma on chemotherapy who present pneumonia and pulmonary embolus.
==================================================== ACTIVE ISSUES ==================================================== # Pulmonary embolus: Pt found to have a large R-sided pulmonary embolus while on lovenox for home anticoagulation, suggesting failure of the Lovenox therapy.
However, further history reveals pt was taking lovenox qWeek rather than QD, no he was not truly anticoagulated.
Given his underlying cholangiocarcinoma and history of DVT/PEs he remains is chronically hypercoagulable and in need of anticoagulant therapy.
In the ICU he was on a heparin drip.
He was also found to have significant R leg DVTs and an IVC filter was placed by radiology.
Subsequently on imaging, it was discovered that his IVC filter was inverted, so he had an additional IVC filter placed on [**7-2**].
He had been transferred to the floor, but due to worsening hypoxia was sent back to the ICU, where interventional pulmonology changed his chest tube.
Since his effusion had significant loculations, he was given doses of tPA via chest tube to break up the loculations and thereby allow more drainage.
While on the floor, it is likely that the pt had a second PE on Lovenox in the second week of [**Month (only) 216**] (RH strain, hypoxemic event).
Transitioned pt from lovenox to heparin drip.
Pulmonary infarct and/or pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to his large R PE was considered as a possibility, so a diagnostic thoracentesis was performed.
He was treat with broad coverage antibiotics vs HCAP including vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl.
Interventional pulmonology placed a pigtail catheter, connected to suction, on [**6-30**] to drain his loculated R effusions, and this was replaced on [**7-5**].
He was given tPA with hopes of lysing some clots He maintained O2 saturation >90% on 2L NC at time of ICU discharge.
Pt completed course of antibiotics for HAP.
In the third week of [**Name (NI) 216**], pt became more hypoxemic with a rising white count and patient was reinitiated on broad spectrum antibiotics for a second HAP.
Pt's Cr drifted upward to 2.1 throughout hospitalization, although laboratory results pointed toward a pre-renal cuase, IVF did not improve his Cr.
#Pain:  Difficult to manage requiring multiple modifications of pain regimen including methadone titration, Dilaudid titriation, and use of PCA.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient recently received chemotherapy.
He was followed in the ICU by the oncology team who felt that treatment was contraindicated at this time.
