History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 40230**] is a 39-year-old woman with history of diabetes, IVDU (ongoing), recently discharged ([**2138-7-10**]) from [**Hospital1 18**] for MRSA aortic valve endocarditis complicated with endopthalmitis, septic emboli, and SAH.
She is being transferred from OSH for management of brain abscess.
Found to have aortic valve vegetation on TEE and MRSA bacteremia.
This was managed conservatively with pain control (Tylenol, oxycodone SR, Dilaudid for breakthrough, and verapramil for prophylaxis) and seizure prophylaxis (Phenytoin 250 [**Hospital1 **] started for total 4-week course).
Had evidence of septic cerebral emboli on brain MRI imaging, and she was started on vancomycin with course to end in the second week of [**Month (only) **].
The infection was further complicated by endophalmitis for which she underwent vitrectomy and intravitreous vancomycin injection.
A PICC was placed on [**7-8**].
From [**Hospital1 18**] she went to [**Hospital **] hospital for antibiotic administration, then to [**Hospital 46555**] rehab.
