Pt has had ~100cc per day, light bilious drainage from his sub-hepatic JP drain for the past several months.
Drainage was complicated by perforation of the diaphragm and subsequent bilio-pleural fistula.
He has a pleural drain attached to a heimlich valve.
Today, Pt underwent placement of a percutaneous trans-hepatic catheter into the left biliary tree in hopes to decompress the system and have the leak spontaneously close.
He also developed an obstructed foley which resolved with manipulation and flushes.

Drain has been replaced a few times over the past months.
He underwent cholangiogram on day of admission which demonstrated leakage from the left hepatic duct into the perihepatic collection.
He then underwent successful placement of an 8 French transhepatic internal-external biliary drain placed with the tip in the perihepatic collection and the side holes withing the left hepatic duct.
he immediately received Vanco and Zosyn and fluid resuscitation.
In addition he required adjustemnt to the Foley catheter in response to concern for low urine outputs, which were deemed to be from Foley malfunction.
