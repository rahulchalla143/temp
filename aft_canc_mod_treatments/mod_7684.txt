PATHOLOGY: [**2179-2-8**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation.
Maturing erythroid and myeloid precursors are rare.
Maturing erythroid and myeloid precursors are markedly decreased.
Cytogenetics: No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
Note: FISH was performed on a concurrent sample of neoplastic blood assessing for rearrangements of 15;17, 8;21, and 16q22.
B cells comprise approximately 27% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express aberrant antigens.
[**2179-2-15**] Right Thigh Skin Biopsy: Sparse perivascular inflammation and edema involving dermis and subcutis.
[**2179-2-17**] Right Leg Skin Biopsy: Mild perivascular inflammation and edema involving dermis and subcutis.
CD20 reactive B-cells are rare.
It consists of scant hypocellular spicules composed of stromal cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and clusters of plasma cells.
Based on a limited 100 cell differential shows: 0% Blasts, 1% Promyelocytes, 2% Myelocytes, 2% Metamyelocytes, 0% Bands/Neutrophils, 17% Plasma cells, 59% Lymphocytes, 19% Erythroid.
IMAGING: [**2179-2-8**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
[**2179-2-9**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new right-sided double-lumen dialysis catheter and a new left internal jugular vein catheter.
The tip of the first catheter projects over the right atrium, the tip of the left catheter projects over the mid SVC.
[**2179-2-24**] TRANSVAGINAL U/S: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old woman with a history of HTN and borderline DM who initially presented to an OSH with fevers, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
A pheresis catheter was placed and she underwent leukopheresis.
She was started on allopurinol and hydroxyurea.
She started 7+3 chemotherapy (daunorubicin + cytarabine) on [**2-9**].
Repeat bone marrow biopsy at day 14 ([**2179-2-23**]) demonstrated an empty bone marrow, consistent with myeloablative therapy, and her ANCs rebounded nicely thereafter.
She developed severe oral mucositis, requiring TPN for a short period of time, but this resolved with routine oral care and she is now able to tolerate POs, though her appetite is still depressed.
She will continue her oncology care with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7422**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with whom she has an appointment on [**2179-3-22**].
Fungal markers (galactomannan and B-glucan) were ultimately negative and she was switched from amphotericin to voriconazole.
She developed rigors and a non-painful and non-pruritic diffuse body rash and antibiotics were switched to vanco/meropenem.
Oral lesions were consistent with mucositis but suspicious for viral infection (HSV) and she was started on IV acyclovir.
# Hypoxia/PE: She was initially diuresed with gentle IV furosemide boluses as her high respiratory rate and CXR findings were felt secondary to fluid overload given aggressive hydration as part of chemo.
Due to concern for PE, CTA was performed and demonstrated bilateral PEs and pulmonary infarction in addition to considerable lymphadenopathy.
An IVC filter was placed on [**2179-2-13**] given the inability to start anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia.
In the ICU she required several platelet infusions though she did not appear to be bumping appropriately.
Blood bank was consulted who recommended infusion of only O+ platelets.
They deferred endometrial biopsy due to her neutropenia, and deferred hormonal therapies given the prothrombotic risks in someone with a PE.
She was treated conservatively with continued transfusions and [**Hospital1 **] hematocrit/plt checks.
Her bleeding slowed markedly and her bone marrow began to recover with decreased need for transfusions.
# Rash: Patient developed several quarter sized areas of hyperpigmented, raised lesions on her legs shortly after chemotherapy was completed.
Numerous nephrotoxic medications including amphotericin-B, acyclovir, and voriconazole were also implicated.
She intermittently required an insulin gtt while in the ICU.
She was transitioned to NPH [**Hospital1 **] and ISS prior to transfer to the floor, which was transitioned to Lantus QHS once D5W was discontinued for treatment of hypernatremia.
She was briefly started on glyburide [**Hospital1 **], but due to poor appetite and PO intake, her blood sugars were low and the glyburide and insulin was stopped.
She may require oral DM meds in the future.
# HTN: The patient was not on any anti-hypertensive medications upon admission but did require treatment during this hospitalization.
She was discharged on metoprolol tartrate 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
**A copy of this summary was faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]**  Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: 1. acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours).

Lab testing and a bone marrow biopsy showed that you have leukemia which was treated with chemotherapy.
After your chemotherapy your white blood cells are trending upward toward normal levels.
You will be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management of your leukemia and for further chemotherapy.
We started the following medications: - Acyclovir for your leukemia - Fluconazole for your leukemia - Metoprolol for your blood pressure - Prochlorperazine for your nausea  Followup Instructions: Department: BMT/ONCOLOGY UNIT When: SATURDAY [**2179-3-20**] at 8:30 AM [**Telephone/Fax (1) 447**] Building: Fd [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Building ([**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] Complex) [**Location (un) 3971**] Campus: EAST Best Parking: Main Garage .
