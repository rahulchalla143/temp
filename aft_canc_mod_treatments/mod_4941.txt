Right nephrosotomy and ureteral stent are also new.
In [**2167-3-15**], mets were found in his left humerous and left pelvis; patient then underwent chemotherapy through [**2167-6-12**] and also had radiation therapy.
He also recommended that the patient undergo percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement to relieve the ureteral obstruction.
The patient was set to undergo percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement on [**2167-12-15**]; however, patient was noted to be anemic at 24.7.
He underwent a PRBC tranfusion and then developed chest pain.
He was ruled out for MI (CE negative X 3, normal EKG); however, he was noted to have creatinine of 5.2 during this event and consequently extended his stay in the ICU for management of ARF.
A CT without contrast of abdomen suggested that his ileal conduit was dilated and also contributing to a peristomal hernia (thought to be contributing to the cause of the ARF); hydronephrosis of right kidney was also noted.
On [**12-16**], patient had placement by IR of percutaneous nephrostomy tube, along with placement of stent in right ureter to dilate a 2 cm proximal ureteral stricture.
The patient passed urine through his nephrostomy tube with consequent downtrending of creatinine.
The same day of his nephrostomy tube placement ([**2167-12-16**]), the patient noted some vague periumbilical abdominal pain.
Furthermore, he noted that his ileal conduit ostomy (NOT his percutaneous nephrostomy) was not putting out any urine, even through the proximal ureteral stent had been placed.
Surgery also placed an NG tube which put out 800 cc of bilious fluid.
A foley was placed through the ileal conduit ostomy with subsequent drainage of urine.
After these maneuvers, the patient's creatinine paradoxically bumped to 4.9 from 4.2 on [**12-18**]; this was subsequently found to be secondary to obstruction of percutaneous nephrostomy.
The tube was cleared and the patient started passing urine through the percutaneous nephrostomy tube.
For his SBO, the patient was placed NPO with agressive IVF (200 cc NS/hr -> 200 cc D5 1/2NS -> 200 cc D5 water) for adequate bowel rest X 4 days.
On the day of discharge, the patient's exam had markedly improved, he was tolerating a regular diet, and the patient was passing stool and without abdominal pain.
Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Coumadin (d/c'ed) calcium Iron.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: Seventy Five (75) mg PO twice a day.
Calcium  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Community health and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Small Bowel Obstruction Secondary: 1) Acute Renal Failure 2) Atypical Chest Pain 3) Prior PE s/p IVF placement, on anticoagulation 4) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good.
However, we also discovered that you had kidney failure due to a blockage between your kidney and new bladder.
This was dilated and a tube was placed from your kidney to the skin; your renal function subsequently improved.
It was determined that your small intestine had bulged into your ostomy and formed a hernia; this caused a small-bowel obstruction which blocked your ostomy output.
We then treated you for small-bowel obstruction with decompression of your GI system through a tube in your nose.
Please continue to take your home medications, with the following changes: 1) Do not take Coumadin until instructed by your doctor.
You should have an INR checked on Friday ([**12-25**]) and should talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 84403**] about your Coumadin dose then.
2) Your metoprolol dose was increased to 50mg three times daily, you may take 75mg twice daily.
Followup Instructions: Be sure to talk to Dr.[**Name (NI) 84404**] office on Friday [**12-25**] regarding your Coumadin dosing  Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 84403**] or your new primary care doctor in the next 1-2 weeks  Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] in 2 weeks or per his recommendations  You will also need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after your repeat bone scan.
