Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o M with history of pancreatic cancer s/p whipple currently on chemotherapy with gemcitabine with port in place, presenting with fevers and hypotension.
Central line placed in [**Hospital1 18**] ED with further fluid boluses delivered.
He briefly needed pressor support with levofloxacin, which was discontinued shortly after arrival to the ICU as he was maintaining MAPs above 65 and mentating well.
He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, with the port removed by surgery and port culture growing MRSA.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] and [**Hospital1 18**] were positive for MRSA, so he was continued on vancomycin alone.
He will complete 3 week course of vancomycin dated from first negative blood culture.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr elevated to 1.9 on admission from baseline of 1.0, improved somewhat with hydration but did not return to baseline (1.4-1.5 range).

# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: poorly differentiated T3N1MX pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple resection [**2113-8-21**], recently treated with gemcitabine.
# Hypertension: home lisinopril held on admission due to hypotension, acute kidney injury.
Will have weekly labs drawn (CBC, Chem 10, vancomycin levels) - Follow up with the PEVA service 2 weeks after discharge for serial blood culture monitoring and evaluation for possible port replacement given his continued need for chemotherapy.
Thrombocytopenia noted is suspected to be a side effect of gemcitabine and should continue to be trended.
