He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED in the midst of a RBC transfusion when he developed sudden shortness of breath that was interpreted as a possible transfusion reaction.
Albuterol can help stop these episodes.
He recently underwent TTE evaluation of his exercise intolerance, at which point a relatively large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology was seen.
He recently underwent his first chemo session with taxol for NSCLC.
Received 20mg IV lasix and underwent BiPAP trial, which was poorly tolerated.
In the midst of our interview, he had the urge to urinate and abruptly stood to use his urinal- he developed respiratory distress with saturations dipping to the 80s and tachypnea to 50.
This episode resolved with supplemental 02.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

He was admitted to the MICU due to apparent increased WOB, and was briefly tried on BiPAP in the ED despite normal saturations.
Tamponade was ruled out with US in ED.
He initially was stable on room air with saturations in the 90s upon admission to the ICU.
Widespread wheezing prompted treatment for COPD exacerbation.
He decompensated quickly in the unit after getting agitated during a foley adjustment.
A cardiac event could have potentially caused his deterioration and CHF exacerbation.
Pneumonia was possible based on his RLL infiltrate, and he was treated for HCAP with vanco/cefepime/levaquin.
He was started on nebs and steroids for possible COPD exacerbation as well,though these were quickly tapered due to suspicion for more of a CHF etiology.
He continued to be diuresed gently with PO and occasional IV lasix.
His oxygen was weaned as tolerated with a goal of 02 sat of 92%.
His steroids were discontinued on [**2132-10-13**] as the etiology of his SOB was thought to be related to pulmonary edema and a possible pneumonia rather than a COPD exacerbation.
His vancomycin was discontinued based on sputum data and cefepime and levaquin were continued until further speciation was available.
His nebulizers were continued throughout his hospital stay.
On the day prior to discharge, cefipime was discontinued as the patient had remained afebrile and without leukocytosis; prednisone was also discontinued since COPD flare appears to not have been the primary etiology of SOB and his symptoms were resolving.
However, based on the absence of symptoms and the comorbidities in the patient, oncology, medicine and the patient's family were in agreement with medical management.
Based on his new diagnosis of CHF, lisinopril was restarted at a dose of 10 mg QAM; his blood pressures remained stable with systolics greater than 110 while in house.
GOUT: Allopurinol and colchicine were continued, this was not an active issue on this admission.

A chest xray showed possible signs of a pneumomia and you were started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
It is possible that yoru COPD was contributing to your shortness of breath and you were also given a steroid as well as your usual inhalers.
You were given lasix to help reduce the volume in your lungs and your respiratory status improved to the point that you were extubated (breathing tube was removed) two days after you were intubated.
Cardiology was consulted to help with your care and suggested the possibility of a cardiac cathetrization to look at the vessels of your heart.
Due to your continued improvement you were transferred to the general medical floor where we continued to monitor your respiratory status and give you lasix to manage your fluid balance.
Your steroids were stopped on the medical floor and the medicines for your pneumonia were narrowed to treat the most likely organism.
You should keep your oxygen saturation bewteen 88-92% and should use 3L of oxygen when active.
You should resume the medicines you were previously taking at home with the following changes:  START: lisinopril 10 mg QD (daily)  START: lasix 20 mg PO (by mouth) QD  START: atorvastatin 80 PO QD  START: Spiriva 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] (twice daily)  CONTINUE: Levofloxacin 750 mg x1 dose ([**10-16**])  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with the appointments below after your discharge from the hospital:  Name: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP Specialty: Internal Medicine When: Tuesday [**10-21**] at 9:30am Location: [**Location (un) 2274**]-[**University/College **] Address: [**Hospital1 3470**], [**University/College **],[**Numeric Identifier 23943**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 17530**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is out of the office next week so you will see his nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3639**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at this visit.
