Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hickman Line Placement and Removal.
Past Medical History: DJD S/P Discectomy ([**2174**]).
RVG ([**2198-10-8**]): Following the intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with  Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, first pass and equilibrium images were obtained.
CXR ([**2198-10-8**]): FINDINGS: There is a left subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in satisfactory location in the distal SVC.
4.The AV leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
Since the prior study, the left subclavian line has been removed.
He subsequently developed severe congestive heart failure after anthracycline chemotherapy.
He was started on hydroxyurea for temporary stabilizing measures.
The patient was started on [7+3] chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubacin.
Re-induction chemotherapy was planned, but the patient developed an acute decline in his repiratory status: pulmonary nodules and then congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation were noted.
Upon recovery from acute congestive heart failure, the patient returned to the BMT service for re-induction chemotherapy with HIDAC (high-dose cytarabine).
The patient was started on G-CSF and his neutrophils and other cell lines (to a lesser degree) promptly recovered and his fevers abatted.
He required several platelet and packed red blood cell transufusions over his course, but did not require tranfusions over the last several days prior to discharge.
2) Neutropenic Fevers: As mentioned, the patient developed febrile neutropenia after his initial induction chemotherapy.
He was continued on anti-fungals.
Late in his course, he grew staph epidermidis from four of four blood culture bottles (anaerobic and aerobic) and his Hickman line was removed.
Concominantly with Vancomycin therapy and a rising neutrophil count, his fevers abatted and all follow-up blood cultures were negative.
The patient was discharged on two additional weeks of Voriconazole to complete and empiric course of antifungal therapy for his presumptive recovering lung infection.
Of note, Caspofungin was changed to Voriconazole because of rising alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin and a concern for causation; these values decreased after the change was made.
3) CHF: As mentioned the patient had a declining respiratory status two weeks after anthracycline therapy.
He was initially maintained on daily IV Lasix, Beta-Blocker and Digoxin.
On account of teniously low blood pressures (systolic blood pressures to the 70s) with Lasix boluses, he was changed to a Lasix drip ([**2-16**] mg/hr).
Thereafter, he made great progress with diuresis and held his systolic blood pressures at a level greater than 90.
He was discharged on Lasix 30 mg PO BID along with follow-up with the CHF service.
He was mainted on beta-blocker and Digoxin as above and his heart rates ranged from the 60's to the 100's late in his course, when his CHF was better controlled.
Anticoagulation was not initiated because of thrombocytopenia, associated with his chemotherapy and AML.
5) NSVT: The patient had several episodes of asymptomatic NSVT over his course.
He was continued on beta-blockade.
Despite his severe heart failure, he was not deemed a candidate for a BiV/ICD given his low platlets.
He was changed from Caspofungin to Voriconazole and these values trended downwards.
Furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Carvedilol 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Digoxin 250 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Voriconazole 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day for 2 weeks.
Potassium Chloride 20 mEq Packet Sig: Two (2) packets PO once a day.
Magnesium Oxide 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
2) Please take your medications as instructed.
3) If you have any dizziness, or light-headedness while standing, please do not take your Lasix, Carvedilol (Coreg), or Digoxin and call your doctor immediately.
4) Please follow the dietary instructions of the nutrionist in regards to your heart failure: some of these recommendations include limiting your fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day and limiting your salt intake to 2 grams per day.
A CBC, SMA10, and digoxin level should be checked to evaluate your blood count, electrolytes, and digoxin level.
