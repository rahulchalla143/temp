Admission Date:  [**2133-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-2-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4611**] Chief Complaint: Right Parietal Occipital Brain Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Craniotomy with resection of supratentorial metastases Rhinoscopy   History of Present Illness: 62M w/ hx of ETOH abuse, A-fib, cardiomyopathy who was found to be confused and shaking on [**12-9**].
Heterogeneous bulky appearance to the right side of the glottis and supraglottic region which needs evaluation with direct exmaination and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31186**] [**Last Name (un) 78953**] without and with contrast for better assessment of extension and exclude neoplasm in this location.
Status post craniotomy and resection of the previously seen tumor centered in the calvarium, with supratentorial and infratentorial extension.
Expected postoperative change at the site of right parietal craniectomy for tumor resection.
Differential considerations include metastatic disease as well as a plasmacytoma.
Bilateral supraclavicular, right paratracheal, retrocrural, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Immunophenotyping: A limited panel was attempted to exclude a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, however was non-diagnostic due to insufficient numbers of B cells for analysis.
-[**12-17**] Surgical Pathology: 1.
"Temporal tumor" right (H-O): Metastatic carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] dept of neurosurgery after having an episode of confusion and shaking.
He was admitted to the intensive care unit for frequent neurlogical monitoring and managment.
In this setting, Craniotomy for resection was deferred pending further work up.
The patient underwent a craniectomy/craniotomy for resection of the skull mass and supratentorial lesion on [**2133-12-17**].
The patient the went to the ICU and remained intubated overnight.
The patient's steroids were weaned to 2 mg [**Hospital1 **].
*****************  The patient started chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil on [**12-25**].
CT scans and rhinoscopic visualization performed by ENT suggested that a soft [**Date Range 31186**] mass in the right neck was the primary cancer.
Vascular surgery was consulted, given the proximity of the mass to the patients carotid artery, and they said they would be available for assistance, in the event that the neck mass would be resected.
His chemotherapy was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and neutropenia (pleae see below).
# Tumor lysis syndrome/[**Last Name (un) **]: Following his first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed signs of tumor lysis, including acute kidney injury, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia (in the setting of a high baseline uric acid level), and an LDH level that rose into the 5000s.
He was treated with aggressive IV hydration, at 200 cc/hour continuously, for several straight days.
Both normal saline and D5W with NaHCO3 were used, aiming to keep the patient from becoming acidotic, but also to avoid over-alkalinization and subsequent exacerbation of calcium phosphate precipitation in the renal tubules.
Renal was consulted, and attributed the [**Last Name (un) **] to cisplatin nephrotoxicity.
IV fluid rates were subsequently decreased.
He was maintained on his home lasix 40 mg PO and his IVF were stopped.
The patient was switched to Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] which is less toxic to the bone marrow.
This medication was to be weaned slowly over time and eventually discontinued.
The patient remained afebrile and was treated with supportive care.
However, he stopped making urine and appeared by labs to have ATN.
Lasix was given to help with his breathing, but had no effect despite large doses.
That afternoon he was placed on a morphine gtt, about 1 hour later he passed.
Renal was consulted and felt that the [**Last Name (un) **] was from cisplatin toxicity.
As the patient was thrombocytopenic to 60K that morning, he was transfused platelets, with a post-transfusion plt level of 89K.
# Atrial fibrillation w/RVR: The patient was generally well rate controlled with dilitazem 30 QID and lopressor 50 TID.
These medications were frequently held, because of hypotension.
Digoxin was also continued and levels were generally found to be therapeutic.
Anticoagulation was held, given chemo and expected drop in cell counts, BRBPR (see above), and recent neurosurgery.
In spite of aggressive IV fluid hydration for tumor lysis (see above), the patient did not experience any dyspnea or hypoxemia suggestive of pleural effusions.
His beta blocker, CCB, digoxin and lasix were all continued as above.
He was kept on a low sodium diet.
The patient had significant ecchymoses at sites of subcutaneous injections.
His subcutaneous heparin was discontinued and he was placed on pneumoboots and ambulation for DVT prophylaxis.
# Code: The patient was confirmed DNR/DNI on [**12-17**]  Medications on Admission: Ranitidine 150', Klor-Con 10mEq, Metoprolol 25', Lasix 40mg', Diltiazem 60mg", Digoxin 125mcg'  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: expired  Discharge Condition: expired
