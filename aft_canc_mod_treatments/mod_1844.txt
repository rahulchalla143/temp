HEART:  Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with a mechanical S1 and S2.
The EKG was notable for prolonged PR interval and peaked T waves.
He was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells, given vitamin K, and transfused with fresh frozen plasma to correct his coagulopathy.
He was started on Ceftriaxone for presumed urinary tract infection.
He was placed on an insulin drip and he was aggressively hydrated for the metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure.
Foley was changed out to a three-way catheter and constant bladder irrigation was initiated.
He continued to improve on all indices.
His white count had dropped from 28,000 to 14,000 and his antibiotics were switched to Levaquin.
The patient was taken off his insulin drip and transferred to the floor in stable condition.
The oncology service was consulted and among their recommendations was a request for plain films of the hip to rule out impending fracture.
On [**12-27**], the patient underwent an uncomplicated transurethral resection of bladder tumor.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
He was placed on oral pain medication.
He was restarted on his Coumadin at a dose of 10 q.h.s.
He was begun on a Heparin drip for the purposes of anticoagulation for his St. [**Last Name (un) 923**] valve.
The patient was screened for rehabilitation and offered at bed at [**Location (un) 1036**].
By postoperative day #5, the patient had continued his perioperative Ciprofloxacin antibiotic coverage and he was afebrile.
After ensuring that there were no clots, and that the patient was not in retention, the heparin was continued.
After three days of anticoagulation with 10 mg of Coumadin, the patient's INR still remained subtherapeutic at around 1.8.
He was subsequently started on low-molecular weight heparin after consultation with his cardiologist, Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the heparin was discontinued.
He was then transferred to [**Location (un) 1036**] on Lovenox and Coumadin with plans to have them manage his anticoagulation.
