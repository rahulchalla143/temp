Per report, patient has had a clinical decline over the last 5months with massive anasarca, ascites, weakness, and shortness of breath.
His PET scan from yesterday revealed ascites, pleural effusions, but showed that his esophageal CA treatment with cisplatin and 5FU was definitive.
His oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt his symptoms must be due to a decline in his liver function in the setting of known Hepatitis C from IV drug use.
Awaiting a note for further comment and recommendations.
Past Medical History: -Esophageal CA thought to be definitively treated with cisplastin and 5-FU -Hepatitis C diagnosed at age 17 for which he has never been treated or followed -Ascites and 2 paracenteses   Social History: Patient states he quit smoking 1 week ago, although he smells of cigarettes.
