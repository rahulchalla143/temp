States that his dyspnea usually improves following a blood transfusion, however, last transfusion was Wednesday without significant improvement.
Has not been treated with any antibiotics other than his Bactrim prophylaxis.
pt also states that he may have had afib in [**2180**] that was treated with medicine and it resolved.
In the ED the patient was given 20 mg IV diltiazem x 2 with temporary effect and was then started on a dilt drip.
In the [**Name (NI) 153**] pt was switched from dilt drip to po dilt.
He was started on a diltiazem drip which was effective in reducing his rate somewhat.
Given that he seemed to have a CHF component he had been started on captopril 6.25 mg.
He was also given lasix as aggressively as his often-low blood pressures would tolerate.
He was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID.
On [**2187-7-1**] after some success in diuresis, he was started on lasix 60 mg PO BID, but this was not uncommonly held for low blood pressures over the next few days.
Their overall recommendation was to attempt to increase metoprolol and continue diuresis while titrating down diltiazem dose, as diltiazem was less likely to have a direct benefit for the heart failure element of his cardiac picture.
The team worked on this plan, titrating metoprolol up to 12.5 TID and then to 25 [**Hospital1 **], while holding off on rhythm control because of potential dual benefit of beta-blocker for rate control and heart failure.
He was loaded with two doses of 0.25 mg and rate improved; he was put on a standing dose of 0.125 mg with levels checked.
Because his pressures were often low we began holding diuresis during this same period, d/c'ing the standing furosemide and following ins and outs and daily weights with a goal of running approximately even.
He did take aspirin during much of the admission.
Cardiology suggested the possibility of TEE and cardioversion as a later consideration; this was deferred during this admission, again because of concerns about anticoagulation.
For a conclusive diagnosis of his cardiomyopathy, a biopsy of cardiac muscle would be required; we judged this to be too invasive and risky a procedure for its potential benefits at this point in his course, and treated his symptoms.
Finally, the possibility exists that he has iron deposits in his cardiac muscle as a result of ongoing transfusions; this can be followed and considered as an outpatient.
He was discharged on digoxin and Toprol XL dose corresponding to his hospital metoprolol dosing, as well as captopril, with instructions to follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**] of cardiology.
