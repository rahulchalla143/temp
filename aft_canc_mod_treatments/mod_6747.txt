The surgery was very complicated.
Due to the patient's body habitus and extent of disease with considerable tumor adherent to the dura, two dural tears with spinal fluid leaks were encountered.
The procedure duration was approximately 10.5 hours with EBL 2500cc.
The patient was gradually transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet.
Oxycontin and Oxycodone were used for oral pain control.
A wound care consult was obtained for assistance in managing a chin abrasion sustained that developed postoperatively as well as several chronic pannus ulcers.
Intravenous Ancef was continued for infection prophylaxis while the lumbar drain was in place.
On POD#6 the lumbar drain was removed and a purse-string suture was used to close the drain hole to prevent fistula formation.
Foley was removed on POD#7.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
