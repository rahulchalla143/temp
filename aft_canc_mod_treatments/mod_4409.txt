Final Report AP CHEST, 8:38 A.M., [**7-16**]  HISTORY: Pacer pocket infection following explant with wire removal and now temporary pacemaker.
Shunt catheter traverses the right neck, chest, and upper abdomen.
wire placement    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    87 year old woman with pacer eroding through her chest wall REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    ?
FINDINGS: Pacer box is seen in the left anterior chest wall which is tilted, is compatible with clinical exam, findings which demonstrate the lateral portion of the box is eroding through the skin.
IMPRESSION: Slightly aberrant positioning of the right atrial lead could relate to retraction secondary to pacer box eroding through skin.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left chest wound status post device explantation.
Surgical preparation of left upper chest 5 x 3 cm wound.
Irrigation and debridement of wound.
She presents for debridement as well as closure of wound.
Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.
They included risks of bleeding, infection, need for additional surgery, flap loss, graft loss, asymmetry, delayed healing, poor scar formation, hypertrophic scar, keloid scar, delayed healing and need for additional procedures.
After Venodyne boots were placed as well as intravenous antibiotics were given, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for truncal surgery.
Following irrigation and debridement of the area, skin flaps were elevated using [**Last Name (un) 4161**] electrocautery over this area of 20 cm2 and Penrose drain was also placed.
The skin and subcutaneous areas medially was advanced to close the wound and this was closed with several 3-0 Monocryl sutures in interrupted fashion as well as several 2-0 nylon sutures in interrupted fashion.
Penrose drain was also secured.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**MD Number(2) 89147**]   Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old woman with atrial fibrillation s/p PPM ([**2116**]), s/p generator replacement [**2134-5-26**] who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pocket infection at pacer site wound growing pan sensitive acinetobacter.
Now s/p explantation with reimplantation on right side with left chest wound revision.
Pacemaker pocket infection: Patient presented with several weeks of progressive skin erosion over pacer site with increasing pain, erythema and drainage.
Empiric antiobiotic therapy with vancomycin was started, but when wound cultures grew pansensitive acinetobacter patient was switched Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid per ID.
Patient underwent pacer explantation with temporary pacer placement on [**7-15**].
Reimplantation of PPM was performed on [**7-20**] and wound revision and drainage of former pacer pocket was performed [**7-22**].
Patient is to continue Cipro through [**2134-8-12**] for four weeks total treatment from pacer explantation.
Patient will follow up with ID, cardiology, and plastic surgery as outpatient.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with history of longstanding chronic slow atrial fibrillation on coumadin therapy.
We started her on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] during her stay which she tolerated well.
Coumadin was held for most of her stay considering her frequent procedures.
Coumadin was restarted on [**7-22**] following revision and drainage of wound.
Of note, due to interaction with Cipro, dose of coumadin was decreased to 3mg from home dose of 6mg.
Upon discharge her INR remained at 1.3 and decision was made to increase coumadin to 5 mg.
After discussion with ID and EP it was decided it was torn fibrinous material from pacer explantation.
Patient recieves rituximab therapy every three months.
She did not receive rituximab while at [**Hospital1 18**].
Continued on home detrol without much relief.
Additionally, patient had increasing difficulty with ambulation during her stay after several procedures.
Worked with PT during stay and recommended inpatient rehabilitation to aid in ambulation.
VPS noted on imaging and appeared stable.
Continued on alendronate 35 qweek.
Note cipro and coumadin interation.
-Will need continued wound care and removal of stitches.
