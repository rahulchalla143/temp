[**2176-2-20**]: Open splenectomy, exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions [**2176-3-13**]: Drainage of splenectomy bed   History of Present Illness: This is a 59 yom with hx of DM2, High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, Renal cell carcinoma, s/p L nephrectomy ([**1-/2175**]), Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ([**1-/2175**]), s/p CHOP x 8 cycles and R-ICE two cycles now s/p ASCT day 41 post transplant who presents from home with fevers.
Patient states he felt febrile this afteroon so he took his temperature and noted it to be elevated to 100.6.
Patient received Cefepime 2gm IV x 1, Flu swab sent.
Diabetes mellitus, type II (diagnosed 10-11 years ago), treated with oral meds until chemotherapy, now on ISS.
High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (prostate biopsy [**2175-8-26**], no treatment [**2-6**] "no cancer") 3.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ([**1-/2175**]), s/p CHOP x 8 cycles and R-ICE two cycles 4.
Renal cell carcinoma, s/p L nephrectomy ([**1-/2175**]) 5.
Pneumonia, ~[**2172**] - did not require hospitalization; treated with Z-pack x 2 .
Vasectomy - complicated by infection, treated with antibiotics [**2148**] 3.
At the time of this diagnosis, he was also diagnosed with a renal cell carcinoma for which he underwent unilateral left complete nephrectomy and this was thought to be curative therapy.
CD20 was not immunoreactive and this was thought to be due to previous therapy with rituximab and therefore he was started on ICE without Rituxan due to the lack of CD20 positivity in the cells.
His therapy was complicated by encephalopathy.
He developed asterixis, negative myoclonus, inattentiveness and somnolence after the second dose of ifosfamide and third dose was delayed by one day.
He was readmitted with febrile neutropenia secondary  to C. difficile colitis on [**2175-9-4**], treated with oral vancomycin  and flagyl, and discharged on [**2175-9-11**].
Prostate cancer - biopsy on [**2174-8-26**] revealed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia - Renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed [**1-/2175**] after routine work-up  including CT scan; s/p nephrectomy (considered curative) .
OSH documents describe his mother's "myelodysplastic syndrome, 5q minus syndrome and low-grade lymphoma involving bone marrow as well as monoclonal gammopathy consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35852**]".

Diffuse low signal intensity within the liver and spleen is consistent with iron deposition secondary to hemosiderosis.
Abnormal marrow signal, possibly related to iron deposition but marrow infiltration by lymphoma, post-treatment changes, or marrow reconversion are not excluded.
Status post splenectomy with a small amount of fluid within the posterior splenectomy bed and mesenteric stranding.
[**2176-3-5**]: Bone Marrow Biopsy: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY PATIENT'S KNOWN DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.
Interval organization of fluid within the splenectomy bed, now with enhancing rim.
Status post left nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.
Drain projects in the left upper quadrant.
Interval decrease in fluid collection within the left upper quadrant with drain in appropriate position.
Dedicated visualization with colonoscopy is recommended given history of lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old male with a history of Type II DM, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, renal cell carcinoma s/p L nephrectomy ([**1-/2175**]), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ([**1-/2175**]) s/p autologous SCT admitted for febrile neutropenia.
He continued to have fevers to 103 so micafungin was added for fungal coverage while invasive marker of fungal infection were sent.
He required daily platelet and blood tranfusions, thought to be [**2-6**] to splenic consumption.
General surgery was consulted, and the patient underwent splenectomy on [**2176-2-20**] (see below for course with general surgery).
He received pentamidine on [**3-2**] for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Antibiotic coverage was broadened to include daptomycin, zosyn, voriconazole, levaquin, and bactrim.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage on [**3-21**] and repeat on [**2176-3-24**], both negative for organisms or PCP; bactrim was then discontinued on [**3-24**].
The only culture positive data was from his JP drain fluid, which grew enteroccoccus; ID felt this was more consistent with colonization than infection, but the patient was nonetheless continued on Daptomycin.
He was tranfused PRBCs and platelets to keep his HCt above 25 and his platelets above 10.
Sputum culture on [**3-25**] grew GNRs, likely respiratory flora, but given persistent fevers, ID recommended changing levofloxacin to gentamicin, and zosyn to meropenem.
CXR and CT chest were consistent with progression of the patient's underlying lymphoma, and although he continued to be treated for infectious source, B lymphoma symptoms were also considered as contributing to his fevers.
Antibiotics were being changed to meet this fever curve, with the last major addition being daptomycin on [**4-3**].
Respiratory distress: As above, the patient had worsening opacities on chest films and CT scans, concerning for infection.
He was placed on a non-rebreather mask.
On arrival patient was tachypneic and tachycardic, and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
Bactrim was stopped, but he was otherwise continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Thoracic surgery declined to perform a VATS biopsy given patients comorbidities.
He was given IVF in the emergency department and on the floor and his creatinine returned to baseline.
Cholestasis Transaminitis: Patient developed an elevated alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and GGT following initiation of antibiotic therapy.
Azithromycin was stopped and the LFTs improved.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: He is s/p autologous SCT.
He was started on antibiotics on admission but after his infectious work-up was negative they were discontinued given concern for drug fever.
After splenectomy on [**2-20**], splenic tissue showed involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
He was restarted on rituxan and steroids on [**2-29**].
He underwent treated with nitrogen mustard on [**2176-3-7**].
Post-operative Splenectomy Course: On [**2176-2-20**], the patient underwent open splenectomy, exploratory laparotomy, and lysis of adhesions.
CT abdomen/pelvis was done which showed an fluid collection at the splenectomy site with an enhancing rim and there was concern for infection given his recent fevers.
This collection was drained by interventional radiology and gram stain and culture were negative to date.
A drain was left in place, and it continued to collect about 20-80 cc of fluid/day, one month later.
Medications on Admission: ACYCLOVIR - 400 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 12 hrs Levamir 24u SQ qPM Novolog Sliding Scale  Discharge Medications: deceased  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1.
