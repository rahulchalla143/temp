The next day, she complained of a headache.
She received 2 units of FFP, 5mg of sc vitamin K, and was loaded with 1g of phenytoin.
She was treated with warfarin at that time, then restarted on the coumadin for unknown reasons several years ago.
s/p pacemaker placement hypertension gout  Social History: She lives at home with one of her daughters.

There is an NG tube seen, with the tip in the stomach.
IMPRESSION: ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position.
[**11-12**] Upper Extremity US: PICC line in the left basilic vein with no flow seen in the basilic, but good flow in the brachial, axillary and subclavian veins on the left, and normal flow in the deep veins of the right upper extremity.
Marked cardiomegaly with biatrial enlargement, extensive atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications, and pacemaker seen.
Tortuous abdominal aorta with extensive atherosclerotic calcification, no evidence of aortic aneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: 82yo woman with a history of stroke and dementia who presented with alteration in consciousness, exam notable for severe encephalopathy, intact brainstem reflexes, and bilateral lower extremity hyperreflexia with clonus.
Her history is very convincing for a fall with a seizure and resulting subdural hematoma.
Her fever likely due to an underlying infection which may have precipitated the seizure, but she does have a source for a seizure given her prior stroke, and she has evidence for bilateral epileptiform discharges on her EEG.
While the fever is unlikely secondary to a meningitis, lumbar puncture was unsuccessful and so she was treated empirically with ampicillin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone for a fourteen day course.
She was treated with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Coumadin was held given the hemorrhage, and SBP maintained below 150.
Because there were some concerns that the fevers may be secondary to the Dilantin, it was discontinued and she was started on Keppra.
A repeat EEG was  2)  CV:  Her blood pressure medications were titrated to maintain normal BPs.
She was started on Vancomycin, Ampicillin, and Ceftriaxone for infectious coverage.
Patient had low grade temperatures and CXR was hazy; therefore, Flagyl was started for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Infectious disease was consulted and recommended slowing discontinuing the antibiotics.
Her Ampicillin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone were dicontinued on [**11-16**].
They were corrected based on her daily blood chemistries.
She remained on nasal cannula.
