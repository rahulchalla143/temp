Both chest tubes were left to suction and no air leak was noted.
She remained NPO overnight.
On POD1 her diet was advanced and her pain was controlled with a dilaudid PCA now controlled with percocet.
Both chest tubes were removed on POD2, however the JP drain was left in place until she was taking a significant amount of oral intake.
