He has been treated with intravesical BCG as well as BCG and Interferon and his most recent bladder biopsy demonstrates persistent multifocal CIS.
Options were discussed and he decided to proceed with cystoprostatectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**] to be followed by ileal loop urinary diversion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**].
On examination, his abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and obese.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Preoperative laboratories showed a BUN and creatinine of 40/1.6, hematocrit of 35, and a urinalysis with 135 red blood cells per high-powered field.
He received 9.5 liters of crystalloid and 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He underwent a radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop urinary diversion as well as bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.
A Foley catheter was placed in the ostomy to use as a stent.
The Foley catheter was thus removed; however, it was again noted that the ostomy output was decreasing so this was replaced again.
The suction drainage was then switched over to a gravity drainage.
Creatinine of both drains in the ostomy showed the creatinine of the ostomy to be 70, the creatinine of the right drain 39 and the creatinine of the left JP to be 1.1.
The left JP was subsequently removed on postoperative day number nine and the patient will be discharged to rehabilitation with the Foley catheter in the stent opening the ostomy as well as the right drain to gravity drainage.
Lopressor and Hydralazine were used to control his blood pressure.
He was initially monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter which was eventually switched to a CVL on postoperative day number two.
He was kept on telemetry for monitoring.
He was eventually switched over to his home regimen which controlled his hypertension.
He was weaned from his oxygen without issues.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Postoperatively, the patient was maintained with a NG tube and IV Pepcid.
The NG tube was self-discontinued on postoperative day number four.
GENITOURINARY:  Please see the main hospital course for details on his ostomy and drain functions.
HEME:  The patient was maintained on Lovenox 40 mg b.i.d.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was given perioperative Ancef                               [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
