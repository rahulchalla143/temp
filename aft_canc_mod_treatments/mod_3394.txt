<br> <b>Studies:</b> CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2167-10-26**] 3:28 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Lung bases demonstrate mild atelectasis.
The previously identified plastic biliary stent has been replaced with a metallic Wallstent with distal tip located within the duodenum.
Subcentimeter hypodensities are seen within bilateral kidneys, too small to characterize.
Status post replacement of previously noted plastic biliary stent with a metallic Wallstent.
Metal biliary stent was placed across the lower CBD stricture.
IMPRESSION: Successful ERCP with extraction of CBD stones and metal stent placement across the lower CBD stricture.
CBD measures 2 mm.
Pneumobilia is noted from prior stent placement.
A borderline peripancreatic node is seen measuring 1.0 cm in short axis.
A short interval followup CT possibly after stent removal is recommended to exclude a pancreatic mass.
Extensive ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis and small bilateral pleural effusions as well as anasarca could be related to CHF.
<br> ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT  [**2167-10-11**] 3:14 PM FINDINGS: Six fluoroscopic images obtained during the ERCP procedure were submitted to be evaluated by radiology.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 80 year old woman with likely biliary cancer, biliary obstruction s/p stenting presenting with cholangitis.
Per the biliary team, patient required a repeat ERCP with placement of a metal stent.
A metal stent was placed across the stricture.
# Hypotension: Resolved with 2 L fluids over the initial 24-48 hrs.
SBPs ranged from mid-90s to 100s (also influenced by being on Lasix and aldactone).
Initial CT scan raised the suspicion of a pancreatic mass, however this was not seen in repeat CT scan after metal stent was placed.
Viral hepatitis serologies were sent, and were positive for HAV antibody, prior HBV exposure, and HCV indeterminate (per RIBA as above).
She was given Albumin 25g during the last two paracenteses.
She was started on Lactulose with improvement in her symptoms.
She was started on Lasix and Aldactone, with the doses titrated up as her blood pressure would allow.
Was given acyclovir for 7 day course.
She was not maintained on a beta blocker due to her low blood pressure.
# Anxiety/Trigeminal Neuralgia: Continue on home carbamazepine.
