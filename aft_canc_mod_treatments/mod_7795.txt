In summary he had a small left anterior chest incision with pericardial window created and drainage tube placed.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the CVICU in stable condition.
He was extubated on the day of surgery and remained hemodynamically stable throughout his stay in the CVICU.
He was slated to be transferred to the cardiac surgery floor after his pericardial drain was removed however these tubes continued to drain significant amounts of serosanguinous fluid and on POD3 he was transferred to the cardiology ICU instead of remaining in the CVICU.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible placement of a pleurex catheter.
However they recommended removing the drain because the output was low and not placing another drain.
The chest tube was removed and per the patients request he was discharged with hospice.
Prior to admission he underwent on cycle of cisplatin and taxol.
After his drains were removed he was discharged with hospice.

An echocardiogram showed that you had fluid surrounding your heart and a drain was placed by the cardiologists to drain the extra fluid.
We think that your lung cancer is the reason the fluid accumulated around your heart and because we thought that it would likely recur, the heart surgeons did a procedure called a pericardial window to stop fluid from accumulating.
During that procudure they also placed a tube in your chest.
