Then, on [**1-29**], the patient presented to [**Hospital6 14430**] complaining of a persistent productive cough times three months with greenish white/yellow sputum with occasional scant blood mixed in, increased shortness of breath, and increased dyspnea for two weeks, dysphagia times three months, and bilateral neck swelling times a few weeks.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial cardiac enzymes and was started on levofloxacin for "bronchitis."
Intubation was very difficult.
Of note, with labile blood pressures with a systolic blood pressure of 200/110 and was started on a Nipride drip.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for a rigid bronchoscopy and stents.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Home medications included albuterol, Advair diskus, rifampin, INH, Combivent, and levofloxacin.
INH 300 mg intravenously q.d.
Rifampin 600 mg intravenously q.d.
Ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously q.8h.
Flagyl 500 mg intravenously q.8h.
Decadron 10 mg intravenously q.8h.
Atrovent 10 puffs q.i.d.
Ranitidine 50 mg intravenously q.8h.
Vecuronium 4 mg to 8 mg per hour drip.
Amphotericin 400 mg intravenously q.d.
Benadryl 500 mg intravenously q.d.
Lasix 20 mg intravenously q.d.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for a rigid bronchoscopy and stents.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was initially kept on assist-control; however, on the morning of [**2127-2-4**], he self-extubated, and intubation with prolonged arterial blood gas empty time was 2.23, PCO2 was 54, PO2 was 127.
A computed tomography tracheostomy was performed for planning of rigid bronchoscopy with stents; which revealed a large speculated mass in the right upper lobe with cavitations and extensions to pleural surface, hilar lymphadenopathy.
The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with stents on [**2127-2-6**] which revealed large amounts of paratracheal edema.
Stents were placed times two in the trachea and right main stem bronchus.
Ultimately, a tracheostomy was placed on [**2127-2-14**], and the patient remained ventilated.
Tuberculosis was unlikely given the negative acid-fast bacillus smears and negative cultures; however, that he was always on anti-tuberculosis medications during this time complicated matters as well as recent travel to [**Country 3587**].
He was initially continued on INH and rifampin therapy per outpatient medications (he had already received quadruple therapy times 10 weeks and was to continue double therapy with INH and rifampin to complete a 6-month course).
Due to the rising AST and ALT and low likelihood for tuberculosis given negative acid-fast bacillus smears, his INH and rifampin were discontinued.
The patient was initially placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl for postobstructive pneumonia; however, he continued to spike fevers and was changed to AmBisome on [**2127-2-6**] due to aspergillus growing out of bronchial washings from sample taken here at [**Hospital1 69**] as well as a computed tomography cavitary lesion highly suspicious for aspergilloma.
He was continued on AmBisome per Infectious Disease recommendations and continued to spike temperatures to 103.8.
He was started on vancomycin and Zosyn.
The patient likely with stage III-B large-cell carcinoma of the lung given bilateral subcarinal lymph node involvement.
Therefore, the patient had to be transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Intensive Care Unit for daily radiation therapy.
