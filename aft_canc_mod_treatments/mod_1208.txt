Admission Date:  [**2106-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-3-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Resection of C5-C6 intradural mass along with laminectomy   History of Present Illness: 71M with a history of melanoma, s/p wide local excision and sentinel LN Bx in [**2100**] for 0.8 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV melanoma located in the R-posterior auricular area admitted with new metastitic melanoma.
In [**2100**], sentinel LN Bx showed melanoma so pt underwent a complete node dissection with no residual melanoma documented in the remaining nodes.
Pt underwent a wide local excision and sentinel LN Bx with the sentinel LN w/o evidence of melanoma.
The pt saw his PCP at that time who treated him with NSAIDs and muscle relaxants.
At the OSH, the pt was placed on emperic Decadron 10 mg IV loading dose followed by 4 mg IV Q6H.
Pt was also given morphine for pain.
HTN treated with Norvasc and Hytrin 4.
Osteoporosis Tx w/Fosamax 5.
HEENT: NC AT.
Scar on right from previous melenoma and lymph node disection.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
Small inguinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
Small inguinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
There is evidence of blood products in the posterior portion of both lateral ventricles with fluid-fluid levels.
IMPRESSION: Blood products are seen within the ventricles and subarachnoid space, which could be postoperative in nature.
Visualized osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
An endotracheal tube is seen, with tip in appropriate location in the trachea.
3) Interval increase in size and number of mesenteric lymph nodes.
On the current study, central increased signal intensity is identified within the spinal cord at the site of prior resection at the C5-C6 level.
This was appreciated on the prior exam, but due to severe compression on that examination, it is difficult to appreciate whether this amount of edema has increased.
Vertebral body alignment and signal intensity is normal.
Status post excision of intradural, extramedullary mass at the C5-C6 level with decompression of the spinal canal.
Opacification in the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses is essentially unchanged.
[**3-17**] head CT: INDICATION: 71-year-old man with known metastatic melanoma status post spinal surgery, now with acute mental status changes, nonverbal.
[**3-25**] MRI T and L spine: INDICATION: A 71-year-old man with metastatic melanoma, recent resection of cervical spine intradural mass, now with possible incontinence.
The distal spinal cord, and conus medullaris also have normal signal characteristics.
Lumbar spine MRI: Abnormal signal within the most distal portion of the spinal canal, with aggregation and displacement of the cauda equina roots.
[**3-17**]: LP positive for malignant cells-melanoma   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26122**] is a 71 year-old man with past medical history significant for melanoma (3 separate lesions) s/p wide local excision who presented on this admission with recurrent melanoma and a probable met from mid C5 to C6 displacing sac and cord posteriorly.
The patient was initially admitted to the OMED service and then transferred to the neurosurgical service for resection of intradural C5-C6 mass.
After resection, patient developed respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia requiring intubation and was transferred to the MICU.
Radiation onocology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to evaluate if radiation therapy would be appropriate but felt that their role was limited and that neurosurgical option was preferrable.
Patient was started on decadron on admission and it was continued throughout hospital course.
Patient noted on subsequent head CT's to have blood in ventricles which as per neurosurgical service was to be expected post-operatively.
Patient was closely monitored for neuro changes and evidence of hydrocephalus.
Resection of intradural extramedullary met as above.
Patient maintained on decadron throughout hospital course.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncologist, covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**], was made aware of new CNS findings and treatment options were re-considered.
At that time, if patient regains sufficient strength, radiation and potential chemotherapy will be considered.
Thus will need to routinely  assess patient's progress at rehab and re-address treatment options as well as possible Hospice if patient not improving at rehab/re-gaining strength.
It is very unlikely that there are treatment options from here, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] should be contact[**Name (NI) **] to update progress.
As noted above, patient followed with daily neuro exams which did not significantly change while the patient was on the medical service.
Steroids should be tapered by 1 gram per dose per week.
Respiratory Failure: After resection of intradural mass, patient developed respiratory distress on [**3-8**] requiring intubation and transfer to Medical ICU.
He was treated with 14 day course of vancomycin and Zosyn.
Patient was gradually weaned from supplemental oxygen and by [**3-20**] was satting well on room air.
Post operatively while on neurosurgical and MICU services, patient's blood pressure became difficult to control.
Incrementally, medications were added.
Ultimately, the patient required norvasc, metoprolol, captopril and hydralazine to effectively control pressures.
Captopril switched to lisinopril on [**3-24**].
Some blood pressure meds have been held by parameters but continuing on current regimen.
Narcotics and sedating meds were limited, hyponatremia, pneumonia were treated.
Patien already on vanc/zosyn at that time, but ceftaz started given good BBB penetration.
Large number of red cells also consistent with prior surgery and blood in ventricles from surgery.
Narcotics continue to be limited, patient requires occasional re-orientation.
Resolved with fluid restriction by [**3-16**].
BPH: Hytrin was continued in-house.
Had been on heparin flushes.
All heparin products were stopped.
No heparin products.
Patient has expressed desires to minimize treatments and maximize palliative efforts.
Given his continued delirious state, however, wife's input as spouse and health care proxy is also determinant of future care.
At this point, mutual agreement has been made to pursue rehabilitation and then re-assess goals of care and treatment option at that point.
We have explained very grim prognosis, especially after CNS findings/leptomeningeal involvement.
