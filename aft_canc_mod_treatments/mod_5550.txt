The patient elected for the definitive procedure to be performed on [**5-15**], with the intent of an open exploration and biopsy of this duodenal mass.
Duodenal mass, suspicious for carcinoma of pancreatic head 2. s/p pancreaticoduodenectomy w/open cholecystectomy 3.
CAD s/p stent 4.
He has an ostomy bag collecting the drainage from the left side of the wound, while wet to dry dressings cover the non draining, right side of the wound.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A):         Gallbladder with no significant pathologic change.
Pancreas and duodenum, Whipple resection (F, H-MA):           A.
Stomach, antrectomy (NA-XA):           A.     Stomach with chronic inactive gastritis.
[**2142-6-19**]: CT scan abdomen IMPRESSION: 1) Post operative fluid and air in the resection bed as well as mesenteric and omental fat stranding are consistent with recent surgery.
Drainage catheter runs through this fluid collection.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, but was admittted to the intensive care unit for continued mechanical ventilation over night.
The patient had persistent low blood pressures and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.
He was maintained on a insulin drip for glucose control, and continued to have fluid resucitation.
The patient pulled out his NG tube on Post operative day 2.
His incision was noted to be erythematous, and cultures were sent, and he was started on antibiotics for a suspected wound infection.
A NG tube was also replaced.
His wound ws reopented on post operative day 6 and the patient was started on unasyn for his wound infection.
His NG tube was removed and he was started on sips on post operative day 7, and clears on post operative day 8.
Several CT scans were obtained to evaluate placement of a drain, however the radiologists did not feel that a drain placement would be possible, and that the fluid collection actually decreased in size on the repeat scan.
The ostomy team was consulted for wound management, and decided to use an ostomy bag to control the drainage.
On post operative day 14, the decision was made to srate the patient on TPN and make him NPO, since the drain output was nearly 700cc/day on a regular diet and taking ocretotide.
A PICC line was placed and nutrition services was consulted to assist in his TPN management.
His fluid was positive on enterobacter, so the patient was placed back onto unasyn, and later transitioned to PO augmentin.
He required dressing changes up to 5-6 times a day, due to the high output.
His TPN was optimized, however his blood glucose levels at times were consistently over 200 despite an escalating sliding scale.
Increased levels of insulin were added to his TPN regimen to gain better control.
His drain output decreased to a manageable level for a rehab facility.
He will be treated with a total of 2 weeks of antibiotics from the last positive culture.
