PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION [**3-4**]:  Placement of CVL (left SCL), placement of A-line (R forearm) [**3-11**]:  rewiring of CVL  CONSULTATIONS DURING [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit Surgical Intensive Care Unit Infectious Disease Oral Maxillo-Facial Surgery Plastic Surgery Opthalmology General Surgery Medicine  BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted to the MICU on [**3-3**] given the rapid progression of his facial swelling and periorbital edema.
He was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl and admitted to the MICU.
On [**3-4**] the patient became progressively hemodynamically unstable and was started on levophed for pressure support.
His erythema and edema were thought initially to be improving on antibiotics, but given his hemodynamic instability and concern for necrotizing fasciitis the patient was taken to the operating room by otolaryngology on [**3-5**] for neck exploration, irrigation and debridement of necrotizing fasciitis of right face and neck and left neck.
Pathology results showed necrosis of fibroadipose and muscle, no fascia seen, abscess, and GPCs in pairs/clusters/chains.
Postoperatively the patient entered florid sepsis; he became more hemodynamically unstable and acidemic to 7.2, his WBC rose to a high of 41, and he was placed on three pressors, (levophed, neo, and vasopressin), though he continued to have urine output.
On [**3-7**] he was weaned off pressors, and his white count decreased, but he developed atrial fibrillation with a regular ventricular rate but with resulting hypotension, and so was started on amiodarone.
Given these results on [**3-7**] his antibiotics were changed to clindamycin and penicillin G per ID recommendations.
The erythema on his chest continued to spread, however, and so he was given one dose of vancomycin and then placed on linezolid for its toxin-fighting effects, with discontinuation of clindamycin, per ID.
He was also taken back to the operating room on [**3-8**] for concern with worsening necrotizing fasciiting; he underwent neck exploration, wash out and debridement of neck.
On [**3-9**] he was placed on PO amiodarone but then put back on IV on [**3-10**] as he converted back to AF, and he was started on a heparin drip.
He remained with a persistent leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, so on [**3-14**] OMFS was consulted given concern for odotogenic source of infection.
On [**3-12**] - [**3-14**] the wound, initially oozing while he was on heparin, stopped with surgicel and the cessation of heparin gtt as the patient converted back into sinus rhythm.
His IV amio was converted to PO amio on [**3-15**].
The patient was also started back on his home antihypertensive agents, his lasix drip discontinued, and he was started on [**Hospital1 **] lasix.
A speech and swallow consulted recommended nectar thick liquids and pureed softs foods for a pleasure diet, with primary feeds through the NGT, an advancement from his prior failed study.
On [**3-16**] he underwent a medicine consult for control of his blood pressure, hx CVA and diuresis mangement as he was initially 21, now 10 liters positive from admission.
On [**3-17**] he underwent partial surgical closure by plastic and reconstructive surgery of his neck wound.
He tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the floor after a short stay in the PACU.
On [**3-18**] repeat speech and swallow recommended thin liquids, pureed foods, and pills with pureed foods and supervision.
His tube feeds were discontinued and the dophoff removed.
His aspirin was continued throughout his stay.
His Foley catheter was removed.
He was also seen by physical therapy again, who, though noted improvement, recommended short term rehab given his recent infection.
The WBC normalized following wound closure on [**3-17**].
The patient also underwent a wound care consult for skin breakdown secondary to loose stool from the tube feedings in spite of regular turning.
He was started on antifungal cream and placed on an air mattress.
His Foley catheter was removed on [**3-18**].
Throughout his stay he was maintained on GI and DVT prophylaxsis.
The wound remains partially open at the sternal notch and needs to be dressed with wet to dry sterile gauze [**Hospital1 **] with xeroform QD on the incisions all covered with kerlex until deemed necessary at the patient's follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23606**].
Atrial Fibrillation:  AF with regular VR occurred in the context of his infection and was well controlled with IV then PO amiodarone.
The patient's primary care physician shall have to decide whether to continue the patient on long-term amiodarone as well as on anticoagulation ([**Country **] 4 per medicine consult).
Anticoagulation was held as per medicine consult given the patient had an open wound with recent surgery during his hospitalization.
Given that his AF occurred during sepsis it may be that he does not require anticoagulation or antiarrythmics at all.
Type II Diabetes Mellitus:  The patient was not taking any meds for DM prior to admission; here has required high doses of insulin while on tube feeds.
His NPH was decreased to 15 [**Hospital1 **] from 30 [**Hospital1 **] when his diet was changed from tube feeds to PO intake.
The patient may also be changed to oral medications as seen fit by his primary care doctor.
Fluid overload:  the patient was aggressively given IVF while septic and then diuresed, though still clinically not back to his baseline weight.
He has no diagnosis of congestive heart failure and no clinical evidence, and so diuresis was discontinued on [**3-19**] per medicine recommendations.
Incontinence:  the patient has been incontinent of stool and urine.
