Admission Date:  [**2104-2-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-3-13**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old gentleman with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2101**], hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, history of congestive heart failure, hypercholesterolemia, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] for respiratory distress, status post intubation.
He was given 100 mg intravenous Lasix, Aspirin, Heparin intravenous, Nitroglycerin, Morphine and Versed.
His blood pressure decreased to 80 to 90 systolic and the Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off.
The patient put out approximately 700 ccs of urine and reportedly felt much better.
Hematuria was noted at that time and Heparin drip was discontinued.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2101**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Chest x-ray - congestive heart failure, nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube in place, left costophrenic angle with blunting.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 78 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, mesenteric ischemia, diabetes mellitus who presented with acute respiratory distress.
Cardiovascular -  The patient was known to have a history of coronary artery disease and was continued on Aspirin and Coreg.
His cardiac enzymes remained flat and electrocardiogram without changes, and therefore it was felt that the patient did not experience an acute ischemic event that triggered his congestive heart failure and therefore his Heparin drip was discontinued.
A cholesterol panel was checked and the patient was started on Lipitor.
Over the next few hospital days, the patient underwent continuous diuresis with intravenous Lasix with significant improvement in his subjective feelings of shortness of breath.
In addition, he was started on Captopril at 25 mg t.i.d.
The patient's Demadex dose was held while undergoing diuresis and his Captopril was titrated up as tolerated to a maximum of 100 mg t.i.d.
Pulmonary - The patient was intubated at the time of arrival and his ventilator settings included SIMV, pressure support 10, PEEP 7.5, FIO2 30%, tidal volume 700 with a respiratory rate of 13.
The patient's hypoxia was thought most likely secondary to his florid congestive heart failure and therefore he underwent aggressive diuresis.
As the patient diuresed, his pressure support was decreased to as low as 5 and 5.
Therefore, the patient was placed back on pressure support of 15 and 5 and then rested on SIMV overnight.
Therefore, given the combination of the patient's failure to wean off the ventilator, as well as the left upper lobe lung mass, a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed partial bronchial stenosis distally without intervention required as well as a left middle lobe and left lower lobe mass of which brushings and endobronchial biopsy were taken.
In addition, a thoracentesis was offered to the patient given the pleural effusion seen on CT scan, however, this was refused by the patient until he could discuss it further with his wife.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2104-3-2**], which demonstrated a white blood cell count of 75, red blood cells 1,980, 27 polys, 33 monocytes, glucose 232, LDH 86.
However, the patient did not tolerate this weaning process, demonstrating increasing acidosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia with each attempt.
Given the patient's failure to wean after nearly a week of intubation, a tracheostomy was placed on [**2104-3-11**].
By this time, the patient had also completed a fourteen day course of Levaquin for a postobstructive pneumonia.
The patient is to be continued on Flovent and Serevent as needed and can be more slowly weaned and also ventilator rehabilitation.
The patient's creatinine remained stable despite diuresis and despite initiation of an ace inhibitor and was maintained at approximately 1.0 to 1.2 over the remainder of his hospital stay.
The patient was noted to have a persistent metabolic alkalosis which did not seem to vary with his hydration status and did not respond to Acetazolamide treatment.
Infectious disease - The patient was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count as well as persistent secretions at the time of admission and therefore was started on Levofloxacin for a community acquired pneumonia.
The patient completed his fourteen day course of Levaquin while in the hospital and his secretions slowly decreased in amount and color.
He was kept on Prevacid via his gastrostomy tube for gastrointestinal prophylaxis and had no further complaints.
The patient's hematocrit did drop very slowly at one point, approximately one point per day, and he was transfused a unit of blood cells with an appropriate bump in his hematocrit which remained stable at approximately 31 to 32 over the remainder of the hospital stay.
The biopsy results were discussed with the patient's wife given that the patient was sedated and intubated at this time.
A hematology/oncology consultation was obtained who suggested that given the patient's underlying poor function, he was not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy and given that the patient's family did not want to investigate the extent of the metastasis, there was no further metastatic workup performed.
However, the oncology consultation did suggest that the patient might benefit from palliative x-ray therapy especially if the lesion into the segmental collapse behind it could be contributing to the patient's failure to wean.
Therefore, x-ray therapy was consulted who suggested that the patient's lesion was not likely significant enough to be contributing to his failure to wean and also suggested that given the duration of knowledge of the mass as well as slow growth, it was not likely to respond to palliative treatment.
However, they did feel it was worthwhile to undergo a mapping session and a trial of palliative x-ray therapy to see if the patient would respond with improvement in his pulmonary function and symptoms.
At the time of this discharge summary dictation, a planning session for palliative x-ray therapy was planned for the day of discharge, Thursday, [**2104-3-13**].
He was noted to have an elevated TSH and therefore his Synthroid dose was increased to 150 p.o.
In addition, the patient's diabetes mellitus was controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale as well as NPH with sugar ranging between 120 and 200.
An nasogastric tube was placed in order to initiate tube feeds given that the patient was intubated for such a prolonged period of time.
Once it was determined that the patient would require tracheostomy placement, gastroenterology was consulted and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed without complications on [**2104-3-11**].
Prophylaxis - The patient was maintained on Heparin subcutaneous as well as Prevacid per his gastrostomy tube for prophylaxis during the hospital stay.
