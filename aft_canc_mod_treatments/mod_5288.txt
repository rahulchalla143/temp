Upon his arrival he was found to have cardiogenic shock and was intubated and taken urgently for cardiac catheterization.
PERTINENT LABORATORY/RADIOLOGY/OTHER FINDINGS:  His initial ECG on [**2179-7-15**], showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110, there was a late transition consistent with possible prior anterior infarction, there was left axis deviation, nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
He was intubated and taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
Cardiac surgery consultation was obtained, but it was determined that he was not a good candidate for surgical revascularization.
He, therefore, went back to the cardiac catheterization lab the next day for high-risk intervention with placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Over the next several days his cardiogenic shock improved and he was weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and pressors, however, he remained intubated due to hypoxia and congestive heart failure.
On [**2184-7-26**] there was a meeting with the family, the healthcare proxy and the clinical team, and the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.
