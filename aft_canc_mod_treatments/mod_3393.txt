He originally presented with back pain and in the process of workup for this got an MRI which incidentally showed a 2 cm left renal mass.
He came to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for urological follow-up, who scheduled and, on [**4-22**], performed an open partial nephrectomy to resect the mass.
This included chest tube placement in the left; the chest tube was pulled [**4-23**].
At midnight [**Date range (1) 62333**], he had a trigger on the floor for hypoxia and fever, with temp 102.2 and O2 saturation of 87% on 3.5L NC.
This increased to 92% with 5L NC and use of an incentive spirometer.
On the floor today, he continued to be febrile for much of the day, with Tmax of 102.8 at 1415; he continued to require oxygen support of 5L NC with 40% facemask for much of the day, with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s to this.
