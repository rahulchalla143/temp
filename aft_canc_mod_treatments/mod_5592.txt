She was diuresed with lasix prn.
She also had her pain medications uptitrated and in the setting of her new pain regimen, she developed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory distress on [**2177-4-14**], necessitating transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and NIPPV.
Patient improved significantly after receiving BiPap and was called out to the floor.
She received NIPPV overnight and improved and was called out to floor.
On the floor she received BIPAP at night.
She received 20 IV lasix on [**4-23**].
She was given 40 IV lasix and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for noninvasive ventilation.
Respiratory therapy was consulted and she transitioned to bipap at night only.
Her mental status and O2 sats improved and she remained on 3L nasal canula during the daytime.
During her hospital course patient had numerous transfers to the ICU for mental status changes and respiratory failure, which became increasingly difficult to control, she was DNR/DNI and remained BiPAP dependant.
Etiology of patient's propensity towards hypercarbic distress was likely her multiple primary pulmonary pathologies, including pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, diastolic dysfunction, and presumed obstructive sleep apnea.
These, coupled with narcotic use for pain related to malignancy require careful management to prevent inappropriately high bicarbonate levels.
