She was finally taken to the operating room for a left sided VATS, chest tube placement, and tac pleurodesis on [**2169-5-25**].
She tolerated the actual procedure well but there was difficulty in extubating her.
The patient remained in the post anesthesia care unit overnight with a prolonged intubated course complicated by bouts of hypotension and low urine output for which she received multiple intravenous fluid boluses.
She was placed on a nonrebreather and her O2 saturations responded to 95 percent.
The patient was given Lasix, Lopressor and Hydralazine all intravenous as well as Nitropaste and a central line was placed.
She then became hypotensive likely in response to the aggressive blood pressure management, although her EKG changes did resolve with decreased blood pressure and was transferred to the [**Last Name (un) 100649**] Intensive Care Unit on a dopamine drip.
She spent several days in the unit, was rapidly weaned off pressor support and weaned off O2 by face mask to nasal cannula.
Chest x-ray and examination were consistent with some amount of pulmonary edema likely from the intravenous fluids she had received in the post anesthesia care unit for her hypotension.
Chest tube was discontinued on the 27th and the patient has continued to do well and her O2 requirement has decreased although her chest x-ray remains with bilateral infiltrates and pleural reaction to the talc pleurodesis.
Final stains of the cytology cell blocks from patient's malignant pleural effusion were positive for cytokeratin 7, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTS-1) and focally for cytokeratin 20.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction and EKG changes resolved with control of her blood pressure and heart rate.
She is continued on her aspirin and beta blocker for her known coronary artery disease.
However, she had several episodes of hypotension during her stay in the post anesthesia care unit as well as briefly on the night of [**5-26**].
Therefore all of her hypertensive medicines were initially held while she was in the Intensive Care Unit on pressor support.
Her Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide and Clonidine patch are still being held.
