# TAGGED RED BLOOD CELL: GI Bleeding Study [**2172-11-24**] Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen were obtained for 2 hours.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old woman with history of [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for evaluation for IR procedure for LGIB of unclear exact source.
Colonoscopy and imaging there had suggested colonic origin.
She required 4 additional units of PRBCs during ICU course for Hct below 25.
After all these procedures and her last unit of transfused PRBCs, Hct remained stable at 27-29 and she was transferred to the floor at that point.
Surgery consult team was made aware of the patient how given inability to localize bleeding no surgical intervention was recommended.
Pt continued to ooze initially while on the floor and require additional unit of blood for a total of 11units during her stay.
Because of continued bleed, the pt could not receive anticoagulation so a IVC filter was placed w/out complications.
Metoprolol and aspirin were initially held in setting of GIB.
Metoprolol was eventually restarted along with diltazem (see below) given afib.
Isosorbide mononitrate continued to be held given concern over bleeding and risk of hypotension.
Home triamterene and HCTZ were held during ICU stay due to LGIB.
Currently blood pressure is stable on metoprolol 25mg TID and diltizem 30mg QID.
# Rapid afib: In the ICU, HR increased to 120s on HD2; she was given one time dose of diltiazem 5mg which decreased HR to 60s but pt remained in afib.
She was given low dose beta blocker and converted back to sinus rhythm.
On the floor, pt had 2 episodes of afib w/RVR which required pushing of IV diltiazem and support with IV fluids given low blood pressure.
Pt broke and returned to sinus with IV diltazem.
Pt was eventually placed on a regimen of 25mg metoprolol TID and 30mg Diltiazem QID; this may need to be adjusted and she recovers.
# Interstitial lung disease: Pt had unclear history of interstitial lung disease and had been on low dose prednisone at home.
Howver, albuteol could not be used b/c of afib so ipratropium was used.
She had an episode of urinary retention for ~8hrs in which she was found to have 750 mL of urine in her bladder.
This resolved without intervention with a post-void  volume of ~300 mL.
Pt is going to rehab facility to complete recovery and then will return to her [**Hospital3 **] facility.

You needed to be admitted to the ICU because of the extent of your bleeding and the need for significant blood transfusions and blood pressure support.
Multiple attempts were made to determine the source of the bleeding including a colonoscopy and a special imaging scan.
However, you were given multiple units of blood and were stablized in the ICU.
Medications were given to control your heart rate so that it would go at normal rate and your blood pressure improved.
Ususually this would be treated with anticoagulation [**Location (un) 4085**]; however, you could not receive these medications while you were in the hospital because of your bleeding.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Please START taking metoprolol succinate 75mg daily.
- Please START taking pantoprazole 40mg daily instead of omeprazole - Please complete a 6 day course of Ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily to be finished on [**2172-11-28**].
- Please continue using Ipratropium nebulizers to help with your wheezing every 6hrs.
- Please STOP taking isosorbide mononitrate.
- Please STOP taking naproxen, aspirin, ibuprofen or any other NSAIDS you may take over the counter (you can take tylenol for pain).
- Please continue to take all of your other home medications as prescribed.
