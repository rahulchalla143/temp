Based off of the pt's history, clinical exam, BNP > 50,000, and admission CXR suggestive of fluid overload, it was thought that the etiology of the pt's SOB was secondary to a diastolic CHF exacerbation.
He had been previously admitted to the hospital just 4 days PTA with similar complaints of SOB that was also associated with a cough, and was diuresed and treated with antibiotics for a community acquired pneumonia.
He was started on IV lasix for diuresis and standing po lasix.
His blood pressure medication regimen was further titrated up with good effect and he was started on norvasc on top of an ACE-I and b-blocker.
The pt had just completed a 7 day course of abx for treatment of CAP prior to admission and given his lack of clinical symptoms suggestive of PNA, including fever and cough, he was not continued to antibiotics.
An attempt was made to contact his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], during his hospitalization however Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was on vacation.
