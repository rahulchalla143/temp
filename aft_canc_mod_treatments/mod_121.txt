Unchanged status post CABG with stable size of the cardiac silhouette and stable sternal wires.
Brief Hospital Course: 78M with hx of CAD s/p CABG, L THA with Left hip dislocation s/p reduction, here with hypoxia in setting of likely pneumonia/aspiration.
Patient initially received vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone for likely community-acquired v aspiration PNA.
He was initially admitted to the MICU as he required a non-rebreather but he was quickly transitioned to nasal cannula and sent to the floor.
One of 4 blood cultures was postive for gram positive cocci, so vancomycin was also started.
When the blood culture speciated to Streptococcus viridans, vancomycin was discontinued and he was kept on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
TEE could not be performed to rule out endocarditis due to his tenuous aortic valve but as patient appeared clinically well and had a very low-grade bacteremia (only one positive culture out of many bottles), CRP/ESR were low and TTE was negative for vegetations, there was a low suspicion for endocarditis so ID recommended he be treated for two weeks of IV antibiotics for his bacteremia until [**4-28**].
Patient was discharged on oral levofloxacin as well to cover for atypical organisms.
Presented with troponin of 0.05 that peaked at 0.37.
He was placed on ASA, metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], and continued on his statin.
Patient with total hip arthroplasty of left hip many years ago and has had multiple dislocations in past, this presentation is similar to his previous.
At the time of discharge they recommended keeping him in the brace when out of bed only and with a maximum of 70 degrees hip flexion.
They recommended he continue in these braces until his hip can be evaluated for surgical repair.
Maintained on insulin sliding scale in house.
Continued lasix 20mg daily, switched atenolol 12.5mg daily to metop 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].
Continued rosuvastatin 5mg daily .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Given his severe aortic stenosis, patient will likely require cardiac evaluation to determine whether he is a candidate for hip surgery - Patient will need follow-up for his melanoma.
- Patient will require repeat blood cultures two weeks after he has completed his antibiotic course to make sure his infection has cleared  Medications on Admission: Lasix 20mg qday multivitamin qday omeprazole 20mg qday atenolol 12.5mg qday Calcarb 600 With Vitamin D 1tab qday lactulose 10g/15mL 1tblespoon as needed for constipation Ecotrin 81mg qday tylenol 650 qday rosuvastatin 5mg qday   Discharge Medications: 1. furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Your hip was put back into place by our orthopedic surgeons who felt you should wear a brace to help keep your joint in place.
You will likely require surgery to repair this hip.
You will need to talk to your cardiologist to determine whether you are a good candidate for surgery given your narrow aortic valve.
We treated you with antibiotics and your breathing improved quickly.
As a result you will need to be on intravenous antibiotics to make sure that all the bacteria in your blood is gone.
The following medications were changed during this hospitalization: START ceftriaxone intravenously for a total of two weeks to end on [**4-28**] START levofloxacin until [**4-20**] STOP atenolol and START metoprolol 12.5mg twice a day .
Please continue your other medications as previously prescribed  Followup Instructions: The doctor at rehab will follow-up this hospitalization.
