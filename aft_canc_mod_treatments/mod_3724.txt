Brief Hospital Course: 53 year-old woman with history of metastatic breast cancer to liver and brain, transferred from neurosurgical service status post [**Last Name (un) **] catheter (ventriculostomy tube) placement for XRT to C7-T3 and T8-L2.
METASTATIC BREAST CANCER She was transferred to the oncologic medicine service from neurosurgery after venticulostomy tube had been placed.
The treatment was without complications.
She will receive a total of 10 radiation treatments to her spinal cord after which she will receive intrathecal chemotherapy.
The symptoms transiently resolved after steroids were increased during her previous hospitalization.
However, she has required foley cath placement intermittently during this admission, and her post-void residuals have been as high as 450 cc.
We also added nifedipine and uptitrated the dose to 60 mg once daily to achieve BP goal of <130/80.
The consensus is that she will need home services, including VNA and potentially meals-on-wheels and homemaker services.
Due to her metastatic intracranial disease, pneumoboots rather than subcutaneous heparin were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
