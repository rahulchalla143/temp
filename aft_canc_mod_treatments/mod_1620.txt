He was admitted to the ICU following TPA for close monitoring; blood pressure autoregulated and after 24 hours, aspirin was recommended, which he refused given his GI bleed history (including a large GI bleed following aspirin use).
As coumadin had also caused GI bleeding in the past, GI was consulted for further management considering this history of bleeding, and with the question of whether aspirin would be better or worse than coumadin with regards to GI bleed risk.
[**Hospital1 **] PPI and QID carafate were recommended, and GI felt that part of his history of GI bleeds related to medication noncompliance with protective and acid-reducing medications.
They also felt that coumadin and aspirin had approximately equivalent risks of GI bleed.
The risks and benefits of the medications were explained to the patient, an in the end, with equivalent risk profiles and coumadin providing better protection from another cardioembolic event considering his embolic infarct and atrial fibrillation, coumadin was started after protein C and S panels were sent (results of which were pending at discharge, but appear to be normal).
