A PEG was placed and he was being treated for aspiration/nosocomial PNA with vanc and zosyn.
He continued to require pRBCs and platelet transfusions on a daily basis for his MDS.
He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure felt to be due to increased secretions in the setting of persistent MRSA pneumonia.
Neurosurgery did not feel that the patient was a surgical candidate, and the team pursued medical management with mannitol, dilantin, and platelet transfusions.
Because of concern for possible C diff as well as persistently positive sputum cultures, the patient was continued on vanc PO, vanc IV, and zosyn.
Zosyn was changed to cefepime because of concern that zosyn may be contributing to thrombocytopenia.
Past Medical History: Brain tumor: MR c/w low grade glioma; has been followed since [**8-/2169**] without biopsy Hemorrhagic stroke [**8-/2171**] at site of biopsy CAD s/p CABG x 4 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM1, OM2, PDA) [**2168**].
HTN AFib no longer on coumadin (has been on amiodarone) Dyslipidemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome: BM Bx [**8-1**] MDS vs CML, followed by [**Month/Year (2) 2539**] Prostate Cancer s/p radictal prostatectomy and simultaneous penile implant [**2155**] Hyperparathyroidism h/o DVT, no CTA done b/c of CKD--treated w/ IVC filter and lovenox, filter has since been removed.
Was on warfarin until hemorrhagic stroke.
Right arms and leg have intact strength but left arm and leg are 0/5.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA [**10-8**] sputum cx: MRSA Blood cx [**10-7**], [**10-8**] No growth Urine cx [**10-8**] no growth C diff negative x 3   Brief Hospital Course: 80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and brain tumor (most likely low grade glioma) transferred intubated to [**Hospital1 18**] in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
Patient originally intubated [**9-25**] at OSH.
He was initially treated here with Vanco/Zosyn for infiltrate on CXR and fever with hypoxia which was narrowed to Vancomycin when sputum cultures were positive for MRSA [**10-8**].
he completed antibiotic course for MRSA PNA/VAP.
Respiratory status improved and he had trachesotomy placed [**2171-10-17**].
At time of discharge, he was tolerating trach collar with occasional CPAP with PSV overnight for tachypnea.
Trach sutures should be D/C'd [**10-27**].
He was loaded with Dilantin then bridged to Keppra which was titrated up to 100mg PO BID.
He was continued on PO Vanco through [**10-20**], 5 days after he had completed antibiotics for PNA.
Rectal tube in place.
Further diuresis deferred given patient now clinically hypovolemic with likely contraction alkalosis.
He was transfused total of 3 units PRBC and 17 bags platelets.
He was found to be HIT positive with positive antibodies and serotonin release assay so all heparin products were avoided.
Notably, he was epoetin prior to admission but this was not continued during admission; he will likely need to be restarted on this medication in the near future in consultation with his hematologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2539**].
ASA was held [**1-26**] head bleed.
He was continued on statin and beta blocker.
# AFib: - Rate controled with beta blocker.
No ASA or Coumadin given brain mass and h/o bleed.
Wound care was consulted and patient had frequent position changes with Allevyn foam dressing over open tissues.
Also treated with Nystatin for possible fungal component and Zinc x 10 days starting [**10-20**] to promote wound healing.
Continued Allopurinol .
# GERD:  Was on PPI at home, continued.
Continued on tube feeds via PEG.
