Admission Date: [**2124-3-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2124-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-1-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old female, recently diagnosed with a right femur osteosarcoma, status post 1 cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin and cisplatinum on [**2-28**], and a history of ulcerative colitis, status post total colectomy and ileostomy in the past, who presented to the Emergency Room with acute sharp abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
MEDS AT HOME: 1.
Aspirin 81.
The distal small bowel was resected, and a new ileostomy was constructed.
This was later weaned and    changed to prn morphine as needed, and prior to discharge    her pain was well-controlled on Roxicet prn, and very    small amounts of Ativan prn.
She was    seen by the neurology team and was started on aspirin.
She    developed atrial fibrillation which was converted back to    sinus on an amiodarone drip.
Prior to discharge, she was    on amiodarone through her G-tube.
This required a tracheostomy which was    done on [**2124-3-30**].
She has    been tolerating tube feeds at goal with 1 episode of    vomiting 2 days prior to discharge.
After starting her on    Reglan, tube feeds were restarted, and she seemed to be    tolerating it well.
She was receiving Prevacid for    prophylaxis.
GU:  After her initial resuscitation around surgery, the    patient significantly volume overloaded.
Once stabilized    hemodynamically, this required gentle diuresis.
It was recommended still to continue gentle    diuresis as we had been doing, and she seemed to be    tolerating it well.
She was broadly covered with    antibiotics, including vancomycin, Levaquin, Flagyl, and    fluconazole.
She was,    therefore, treated with Zosyn and vancomycin.
Continue meds as listed in .
Exploratory laparotomy, status post small bowel resection    and ileostomy.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
