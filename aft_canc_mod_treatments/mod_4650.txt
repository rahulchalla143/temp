Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
You have been prescribed an anti-seizure medicine, Keppra, take it as prescribed.
Because this is a steroid, we recommend that you take Omeprazole while on Dexamethasone to protect your stomach.
