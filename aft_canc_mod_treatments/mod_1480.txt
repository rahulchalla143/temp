She was subsequently transferred to the CCU for Swan-Ganz monitoring, diuresis to decrease PA pressures prior to MVR surgery.
The patient was started on medical therapy and referred to [**Hospital1 346**] for catheterization.
The patient had been managed on medical therapy over the past year and noticed worsening dyspnea on exertion (from house to her car) and occasional two pillow orthopnea.
The patient received 40 of intravenous Lasix in the catheterization laboratory.
She was transferred to the CCU for Swan-Ganz placement and diuresis management to decrease PA pressures.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was started on Nitroprusside and Lasix intravenous 40 times one.
[**2192-9-12**] echo shows 3+ mitral regurgitation; severe pulmonary hypertension; mean gradient of 22, peak 38; MV area of 1.1 cm squared; ejection fraction of 60% with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg prn.
Lasix 40 mg twice a day.
Potassium chloride equivalent of supplements 10 meq p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Heart rate of 73; blood pressure of 119/56; 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Sodium of 145; potassium of 3.2; chloride 109; bicarbonate 23; BUN 17; creatinine 0.7; glucose 99; ALT 16; AST 19; alkaline phosphatase 107.
Admitted to the CCU for medical therapy and diuresis, to decrease her filling pressures prior to MVR.
She was also started on a statin.
The patient was admitted for diuresis and medical management to decrease filling pressures, due to possible mitral valve replacement.
She was started on a trial of Lasix and Nipride with a goal PA systolic of 60 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure goal of 15.
The patient diuresed well with Nipride and Lasix drip.
Natrecor was considered but was found to be unnecessary since the patient was diuresing well with her Nipride an Lasix drip.
The patient was started on Lasix p.o.
three times a day on [**2-12**] and diuresed quite significantly with diuresis of negative 1.8 liters on that day.
Considering this bump in creatinine and very negative fluid balance, the patient's Lasix regimen was decreased to 40 mg p.o.
It was decided that the patient should continue on this regimen as an outpatient, as well as on Norvasc at 5 mg p.o.
Further discussion of a mitral valve replacement could be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] in the future.
On transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] for out of the unit, the patient remained having high oxygen saturations of 98 to 99% on six liters nasal cannula and her oxygen can continue to be weaned down as an outpatient.
She has maintained good oxygen saturations and her arterial blood gases were improved prior to transfer from the floor.
She should continue on her Combivent inhaler as an outpatient.
She has maintained good oxygen saturations and her arterial blood gases were improved prior to transfer from the floor.
She should continue on her Combivent inhaler as an outpatient.
Of note, given her pulmonary hypertension, the team did discuss with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of pulmonary whether he would like to try other agents such as Spironolan or Nitrous oxide to further reduce her pulmonary artery pressure but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] suggested that these agents would only further increase pulmonary artery flow and preload and thus increase the patient's wedge pressure.
The patient will be discharged with home oxygen, as she has now had a new oxygen requirement and will need pulmonary rehabilitation as an outpatient.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient should continue with a bowel regimen as an outpatient.
Other gastrointestinal issues included a routine abdominal ultrasound that was performed for preoperative evaluation prior to her mitral valve replacement to rule out liver disease.
Renal:  On abdominal ultrasound, as mentioned above, there was a further magnetic resonance scan of the abdomen to further work-up questionable liver mass found on abdominal ultrasound.
Urology team was consulted who felt that the mass was concerning for a malignancy, about 70 to 80% chance; however, the urology team felt that her cardiac issues took obvious precedence above this renal mass and the renal mass could be addressed as an outpatient, once the patient decided about her mitral valve replacement and recovered from surgery.
The patient was started on a heparin drip related to these clots.
The patient was initially started on a heparin drip on [**2-13**], after her Swan was discontinued but then she was transitioned to Lovenox as a bridge to Coumadin therapy.
The patient will be discharged on Lovenox therapy with Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
and should be monitored with Coumadin levels and INR checks as an outpatient.
The patient initially had a urinalysis that was positive for infection and was put on Levofloxacin for this reason.
The patient was thus continued on Levofloxacin therapy and will likely finish this within one day as an outpatient, to complete a ten day course for presumed pneumonia.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was maintained on a low sodium diet and was continued to monitor daily weights and input and output.
She chronically had low potassium throughout her hospital course and required as much as 40 to 80 meq of potassium a day.
The patient was discharged on standing potassium supplements and will need to continue to need these as an outpatient.
The patient will also need frequent monitoring of her potassium as well as her INR as mentioned above since she tends to become very hypokalemic and will be in a high dose of Lasix as an outpatient.
Prophylaxis:  The patient will be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin for her upper extremity deep vein thrombosis as well as a Proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal stress prophylaxis and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
DISPOSITION:  The patient will likely go to rehabilitation when she is adequately diuresed and has an appropriate regimen for her clot.
Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous twice a day.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Albuterol nebs q. four hours.
Potassium chloride 40 meq p.o.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Ativan 1 mg p.o.

Phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 277**] of urology within one month of discharge to further evaluate the left kidney mass and decide on further treatment options.
