Increased size of right frontal, right temporal, and interhemispheric subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Had complicated course of AMPL treatment  # Leukemia: Patient found to have AMPL via bone marrow biopsy the day of admission to the MICU.
He was started on ATRA and monitored closely for symptoms of DIC, TLS and ATRA syndrome.
He was transfused as needed with PRBC, platlets and FFP.
He was induced with Ara-c and daunurubicin.
A repeat BM biopsy showed remission and he will continue the ATRA for now and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for plans of stage two of his treatment.
# Fevers: He initially was on Vancomycin and cefepime when first starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home, but as his culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his antibiotics were discontinued.
He was started on vanco/cefepime at that time.
His antibiotics were eventually broadened to vanco, meropenem, fluconzaole and flagyl for the brain abscesses.
He complained of some thigh pain and we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections.
His vanco was discontinued and his counts began to recover.
Eventually he was on meropenem, voriconazole and acyclovir and stopped having fevers.
The plan is to complete 6 week course of the above antibiotics for his brain abscesses.
We will reimage his thighs with an MRI as an outpatient and depending on those results, he will either need surgical drainage or still prolonged course of abx.
# ICH: Pt with multiple small ICH sustained from fall with acute left sided head injury in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia.
He also required heparin and then lovenox for DVTs, and repeat head CTs while on these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds.
He was not kept on decadron because chemotherapy was initiated.
His blood pressures remained stable and he was started on metoprolol.
# [**Name (NI) 6059**] - pt had one episode of 16 b [**Name (NI) 6059**] v. afib with aberrancy.
# Vasovagal bradycardia - the day prior to admission, while the patient was having a bowel movement, he was noted on telemetry to brady to the 30s, he felt light headed and it resolved in 5 minutes.
Heparin was started overnight, but because of his hx of ICHs, it was decided to stop the heparin and place an IVC filter.
Heparin was initially.
And then he was converted to lovenox for outpatient treatment of the DVTs.
He had PIVs until transfer to the ICU when a PICC line was placed.
The PICC line was removed after a DVT was found in the arm.
He again had PIVs for a while until a IR guided subclavian line was placed.
For outpatient continuation of his 6 week course of antibiotics, a hickman was placed as PICCs could not be placed due to bilateraly UE DVTs.
