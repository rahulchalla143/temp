HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including recurrent arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30% who was referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for APF/LV mapping/biventricular ICD.
He was scheduled for the pacemaker ICD placement in effort to enhance synchrony of his cardiac function and to capture an element of atrial kick, as well.
He had the procedure done on [**2123-3-23**] which was complicated by approximately 400 cc blood loss and hypotension which ultimately responded to fluid boluses and Dopamine drip.
His hematocrit trended from mid 30s to 27.4, and he was started on one unit packed red cells and admitted to the CCU.
He denied back pain, groin pain, chest pain, shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of retroperitoneal space status post chemo complicated by cardiotoxicity.
Antithrombin 3 deficiency complicated by deep venous thrombosis.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 10/[**2119**].
Alternating right bundle branch block/left anterior fascicular block with left bundle branch block and long PR.
Cellulitis complicated by group A Streptococcal bacteremia [**11/2122**] status post Vancomycin times one month.
Clostridium difficile complicated by toxic megacolon status post hemicolectomy.
Lipitor 10 mg a day.
Lasix 80 mg a day.
Plavix 75 mg a day.
Synthroid 25 mcg a day.
Diovan 40 mg a day.
Aldactone 25 mg a day.
Digoxin 0.125 mg a day.
Cardiovascular rhythm:  Patient was ventricular paced with ICD which was interrogated the day after placement and working well.
He completed a five-dose course of Vancomycin as well as a day of Levofloxacin per Electrophysiology given the extent of the procedure for prophylaxis.
He was continued on his home regimen of statin, Plavix, and Valsartan.
Blood pressure:  Patient had hypovolemia likely secondary to blood/volume loss and was transfused two units packed red cells initially.
He was gradually weaned off Dopamine after a day and his blood pressure stabilized.
He had the rest of his home cardiac meds added, including Lasix for diuresis.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix after his blood pressure normalized given his chest x-ray is concerning for congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray repeated after diuresis showed improvement with decrease in infiltrates bilaterally.
Patient will continue on Digoxin, Lasix, and Spironolactone per home meds.
Left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis/hypercoagulability:  He will be started on Lovenox and Coumadin to be followed by primary care physician.
Nurse noticed raised area of erythema diffusely across back which decreased with hydrocortisone cream.
A Dermatology consult was called which recommended topical treatments including Sarna lotion and Lac-Hydrin.
He should also use Spectazole to feet twice daily for tinea pedis.
At home he will continue on Atarax p.r.n.
Arrhythmias status post pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy with CHOP.
History of hemicolectomy after Clostridium difficile-induced toxic megacolon.
History of atrial flutter status post cardioversion [**2119**].
