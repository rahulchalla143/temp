Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness, in brief: 41-year-old male with past medical history of patent foramen ovale s/p closure, PE on lovenox, diastolic CHF, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, on home O2 at 4L NC (although patient states he was on room air prior to admission) initially presented to [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital with 10/10 periumbilical pain associated with nausea, vomiting, worse in the right lower quadrant.
At that time he was found to have an incarcerated hernia on imaging and admitted for open repair of strangulated incisional hernia with mesh placement, with some strangulated bowel requiring resection (end to end connection).
After the procedure he was transfered to the ICU, where he was not able to be extubated for 2 days and apparently developed aspiration pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole).
He developed atrial flutter after which he required both face mask and nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations above 90% and required cardioversion.
Patient had difficulty being weaned of venti-face mask with FiO2 of 50% with 5L NC.
He was given IV lasix 80mg, nebs, heparin drip continued, vancomycin and zosyn for HAP/VAP/aspiration PNA, blood and urine cultures obtained and MICU consulted and subsequent transfer initiated.
In the MICU the patient was maintained on a face mask.
He had an A-line placed and a TTE with bubble study, which showed a septal occluder device in place without evidence of atrial septal defect of patent foramen ovale.
The patient was started on a lasix drip and acetazolamide.
A PICC line was placed and a CTA was performed which showed possible chronic pulmonary emboli and patchy ground glass opacities and enlarged lymph nodes.
The lasix drip was stopped with continued diuresis by the patient.
The patient was deemed to be stable for general medical floor treatment and was transferred.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

The pneumonia was treated with an 8 day course of vancomycin and zosyn.
The patient was placed on a lasix drip with aggressive diuresis.
The patient improved with diuresis and was transferred to the floor on 3L NC and 35% FM.
There he was given another 8 day course of vancomycin and zosyn and was aggressivly diuresed.
The patient returned to the floor on 3L NC during the day and 40% FM overnight.
He was continued on coumadin and aspirin with an INR goal of [**2-5**].
He may also warrant evaluation for lung transplantation in the future.
