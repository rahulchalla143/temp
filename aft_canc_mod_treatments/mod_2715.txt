Application of local autograft for fusion augmentation.
Application of allograft for fusion augmentation   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 61229**] is a 49-year-old male who was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in [**2104**].
Since that time, he has been diagnosed with multiple metastases including skeletal metastases.
He underwent an MRI as recommended by his medical oncologist, which demonstrated an infiltrative lesion within C4, causing spinal cord compression as well as severe nerve root compression.
Due to the nature of this disease, in concert with the severity of symptoms, pending spinal instability and spinal cord compression, he elected to undergo surgical treatment to help accomplish the goals of anterior cervical spinal cord decompression with interbody reconstruction and fusion.
He underwent wide local excision and bilateral inguinal negative sentinel lymph node biopsies.
He developed left inguinal recurrence in [**12/2111**], undergoing completion left inguinal lymph node dissection on [**2112-2-8**] with pathology revealing melanoma in four of nine nodes with extracapsular extension.
He received radiation therapy to the left inguinal region completing in 05/[**2111**].
He began interferon off protocol in [**5-/2112**] with therapy discontinued on [**2112-10-19**] due to radiation colitis.
He underwent wide local excision in 04/[**2112**].
In [**6-/2114**], he had biopsy of a left mandible skin lesion revealing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10834**] level III, 0.51 mm thick melanoma with three mitoses per mm2.
On [**2114-7-23**], he underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] with no residual melanoma at the primary site, but one of three lymph nodes showed a microscopic deposit of melanoma.
He underwent modified left neck dissection on [**2114-7-30**] with no melanoma noted in seven additional nodes.
In [**2115-6-4**], he underwent biopsy of a new right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing metastatic melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component and two mitoses per mm2.
He underwent right chest wide local excision and right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1924**] on [**2115-7-18**].
Staging scans were negative and he began GM-CSF off protocol on [**2115-9-4**], completing 13 cycles in [**2116-8-4**].
Therapy was held on C1W4, [**1-12**], due to visual problems, fatigue and anorexia.
His pain score was about [**2-4**] and he is on analgesic medications for this.
