HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2132-10-22**] for his right-sided empyema and hydropneumothorax and patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, right-sided video assisted thoracoscopy, and partial decortication and evacuation of the empyema.
Patient also underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with near total removal of endobronchial tumor obstructing the right lower lobe.
Patient still had portions of the endobronchial tumor of the right lower lobe and a bronchopulmonary fistula was also noted.
Patient was noted to have air leak in the right-sided chest tube and given the findings in the bronchoscopy done on [**2132-10-23**] the air leak was expected.
Patient continued to do well on the floor.
Patient was noted to have positive I's and O's since his transfer out of the CSRU and given the interventions that he had gone through patient was further diuresed with IV Lasix.
By postoperative day seven patient's air leak has decreased and patient was given a trial of Water-seal with a follow-up chest x-ray, PA and lateral.
Despite the persistent air leak patient's right lung stayed relatively inflated and one chest tube out of a total of three was carefully taken out on postoperative day nine.
Again, a repeat chest x-ray done showed no change in the expansion of the right lung and patient underwent removal of a second chest tube without any difficulty.
By postoperative day ten patient remained with one chest tube, in the right thorax, and plans were made to convert the chest tube and empyema tube with a Heimlich valve.
However, in the overnight period between postoperative day nine and ten, patient accidentally removed the third and the final chest tube for the right thorax, however, a new chest tube could be placed into the same insertion site without any difficulty.
The new chest tube was converted to a empyema tube by attachment of a Heimlich valve and a leg drainage bag.
Patient again underwent a chest x-ray to verify that his lungs were remaining expanded and after a satisfactory finding on the chest x-ray patient was discharged on postoperative day ten.
