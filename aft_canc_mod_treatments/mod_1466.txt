The patient denied fevers, headache, and chest pain.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the neck with lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, and was supple.
Alpha-fetoprotein was within normal limits.
ASCITES ISSUES:  In the Emergency Department, at the time of presentation on [**2100-7-14**], a paracentesis of one liter was done with Gram stain and culture negative for organisms, white blood cell count was 210 (with 7 polys) and consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
[**Last Name (un) 26460**] discriminant factor was less than 32; so treatment was not started for possible alcoholic hepatitis given AST of 159 and ALT of 19; which is greater than a 2:1 ratio.
Stenosis was also noted in the inferior vena cava close to this junction with the hepatic vein.
Therefore, a stent procedure was considered but ultimately deferred at this time.
Upon discussion with Hepatology consultation, medical management through aggressive diuresis was constituted.
A regimen of Lasix 80 mg, spironolactone 200 mg by mouth once per day, and pentoxifylline 400 mg three times per day resulted in fluid loss and decreased body weight.
Prophylaxis was started with metronidazole, levofloxacin, and ampicillin.
However, concern over a possible gastrointestinal bleed made prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with levofloxacin 500 mg a necessity.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy performed in the Intensive Care Unit were negative for gastrointestinal bleed, and no source of bleeding was identified.
4500 cc of clear straw-colored fluid was removed by paracentesis.
The patient received a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells, one unit of fresh frozen plasma, and 10 mg of vitamin K.  The patient returned to the floor on [**2100-7-18**].
Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once per day.
Thiamine 100 mg by mouth once per day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth q.12h.
Pentoxifylline 400 mg by mouth three times per day.
Furosemide 80 mg by mouth once per day.
Spironolactone 200 mg by mouth once per day.
