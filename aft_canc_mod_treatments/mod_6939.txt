Per report, was subsequently running errands when had a mechanical slip and fell.
He received bacitracin, lidocaine, tetanus, calcium gluconate 1 g, dextrose, insulin 10 units, 1 L NS, 50 mEq NaHCO3.
His forehead laceration was cleaned and repaired w/ sutures and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Son was notified and reported pt is full code so was intubated w/ 7.5 endotracheal tube w/ 20 mg etomidate, 60 mg rocuronium, lidocaine 100 mg, and was started on a propofol gtt running at 10.
He was able to be weaned off this within one hour.
He received an additional liter of NS, vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage.
A triple lumen femoral line was placed under sterile conditions.
Surgery was consulted who remarked that CT abd findings were unlikely to be related to trauma,  and that the pt may have some pancreatitis- they recommended repeat CT Abd w/ PO contrast.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated and unresponsive to verbal stimuli.

Small amount of fluid superior to the endotracheal tube balloon.
Mild volume overload with pleural/pericardial effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
[**3-3**] CXR: Tip of the endotracheal tube has been partially withdrawn, now no less than 3 cm from the carina.
Nasogastric tube loops in the stomach ending in the fundus.
Brief Hospital Course: 78M with past medical history notable for prostate adenocarcinoma on XRT, CKD stage III, MDS, G6PD deficiency, hypothyroidism and recent UTI on treatment transferred from OSH after a mechanical fall with concern for T1 fracture, with course c/b hypotension and hypothermia presumably secondary to septic shock, initially requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, aggressive IVF, pressors, and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Patient will need suture removal [**2119-3-9**] if scalp laceration appears healed.
He was intubated and sedated given altered mental status (as below).
Received 2L NS with BP response and was put on levophed.
BP improved quickly and he came off pressors within hours.
He received broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, cefepime, levofloxacin, azithro, flagyl.
Antibiotics eventually narrowed to levofloxacin for presumed UTI,  given known history of urinary retention, prostate cancer currently on radiation treatment, prior UTIs, and dirty UA on presentation.
He remained hemodynamically off pressors and continued to do well on throughout the remaining hospital course.
He was discharged with plan to complete 10d course of levofloxacin (last day [**2119-3-11**]) which will cover both UTI and otitis media.
TSH slightly elevated but free T4 normal, and cortisol WNL.
Temperature improved quickly with antibiotic therapy and Bair hugger.
ABGs while on mechanical ventilation suggested that he was oxygenating relatively well.
He was diuresed with lasix 10mg IV prior to transfer.
Did not require supplemental O2 on the floor.
Mental status improved after abx and IVF resuscitation.
He was discharged with the plan to complete total 10d course of levofloxacin as above (last day [**3-11**]).
He briefly required lasix in the MICU.
Cr continued to improve (2.6 on the day of discharge) with improved hemodynamic state and aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Patient received continued fluids.
Rash improved after most of the antibiotics were discontinued (including vancomycin; as above) to near resolution prior to discharge.
# NON-OCCLUSIVE CHRONIC DVT He was started on a heparin drip after he was noted to have R DVT on lower extremity ultrasound.
However, final report of ultrasound suggested a non-occlusive peripheral deep vein thrombosis of the proximal femoral vein with central flow within it, consistent with an old re-canalized deep vein thrombosis.
As DVT not felt to be acute, heparin gtt d/c'd.
HTN: His home atenolol and enalapril were initially held in setting of hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **].
Enalapril was held given [**Last Name (un) **], but can likely be restarted in outpatient setting once renal function improves.
He is having difficulty with excessive urination at home and per report has not been drinking as much as a result.
He would likely benefit from re-initiation of Flomax if BP remains stable at rehab.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Needs removal of sutures from the scalp laceration repair on [**2119-3-9**] -Should continue levofloxacin for 5 additional days (last day [**2119-3-11**]) to treat UTI, otitis media -PICC line should be removed prior to discharge home from rehab -Please monitor renal function (check chem7 on [**2119-3-8**] and at least 3 times per week at rehab) to ensure renal function trending back to baseline (Cr 1.3-1.5) -Please re-dose meds for renal function (including levofloxacin, allopurinol, gabapentin) -Restart home enalapril once kidney function back at baseline.
-Repeat thyroid function tests once acute illness resolved -Home safety evaluation for elderly fall risk -Patient's code status was confirmed as full code this admission -Contact is patient's son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 109554**]  Medications on Admission: Enalapril Maleate 10 mg Oral Tablet 1 po bid Gabapentin 300 mg TID Allopurinol 200 mg daily Tamsulosin 0.4 mg ER PO daily Finasteride 5 mg PO daily Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily Docusate Sodium 100 mg PRN Levothyroxine 100 mcg Oral (TAKE 1 TABLET four times per week and [**1-2**] of a tablet three times per week.)

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after falling and hitting your head on [**2119-3-2**].
You needed a breathing tube to help protect your airway, and fluids and medications to help raise your blood pressure.
You were treated with various antibiotics for your ongoing urinary tract infection and ear infection.
You should finish your prescribed antibiotics course (last dose [**2119-3-11**]) for your urinary tract infection and ear infection.
You developed rash on your legs which may have been caused by one of the antibiotics you received (vancomycin).
We have made the following changes to your medications: - STOPPED enalapril (you can restart this when your kidney function returns to normal, please discuss with your doctors) - STOPPED docusate sodium (Colace) while you are having diarrhea - DECREASED gabapentin to 300 mg daily - DECREASED allopurinol to 100 mg every other day - ADDED levofloxacin 250 mg daily (for urinary tract and ear infections), last day will be [**2119-3-11**] - ADDED sarna cream as needed for itching  We have continued all your other medications and adjusted some of their doses for your decreased kidney function.
