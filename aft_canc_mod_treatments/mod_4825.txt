Pt was initially started on zosyn, cipro and vancomycin for broad coverage in this frequently hospitalized pt in addition to pressors and xygris given pt's high apache score.
Stress dose steroids were also started as pt was on dexamethasone as outpt per his med list.
Influenza antigen and legionella antigen were sent and were negative.
Pressors able to be weaned and antibiotics switched to linezolid for VRE in urine and meropenem for acinetobacter in sputum.
Respiratory Failure: Pt arrived intubated in ventilatory failure believed to be [**1-20**] pna versus ards from urosepsis.
Tracheostomy tube placed on [**9-26**].
Renal functions improved with creatinines trending towards baseline (baseline is 1.8-2.0, at time of discharge was 2.3).
Aspirin was initially held as pt had been started on xygris, but asa was restarted once xygris course completed.
In future could consider adding ace inhibitor as renal function resolves.
Did not start beta blocker given episodes of bradycardia.
Bradycardia: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring atropine in the field for HR in the 40s.
Pt was maintained on PPI and active type and screen maintained.
Hypothyroidism: continued on home levothyroxine .
#Schizophrenia: Intially held clozaril and perphenazine while intubated and sedated.
Pt was then started on linezolid so clozaril and perphenazine were held for concern for seratonin syndrome.
Clozaril should be held another 2 weeks, at least, and could be restarted on [**10-10**] as long as patient is not sedated.
Can be continued on perphenazine per home dose.
#COPD: continue atrovent and albuterol prn, usually on nebs but switched to inh while intubated.
adrenal insufficiency: on dexamethasone 2mg at home, hydrocortisone was initially started at stress doses and then weaned down and eventually transitioned back to dexamethasone.
# DM: Pt with known DM type 2.
Initially placed on insulin drip as it was felt that his skin was likely too edematous to get good absorption of sc insulin (target range for gtt was 150-200).
After diuresis pt was placed on sc insulin.
They felt that placement at home would not be a good idea and should go to rehab and be further evaluated for placement at time of discharge from rehab.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1)  Uro/pneumo sepsis 2) Ventilator acquired pneumonia 3) S/p tracheostomy and PEG tube placement   Discharge Condition: Stable for discharge to rehab.
You were also getting better at breathing so we took you off the ventilator and put in a tracheostomy, which allows us to give you oxygen safely.
When you go to rehab, they will assess you daily to see when your tracheostomy can be safely removed or whether your PEG tube can come out once you can safely take food by mouth.
The following medication changes were made: (1)  Because of renal failure, we stopped your lasix.
(2) We stopped your glyburide because of your renal failure.
(3) We stopped your home dose of flomax because of your renal failure.
You can restart clozaril on [**10-10**].
(6) You should continue to take perphenazine 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] as at home; this can also be given PRN for agitation.
