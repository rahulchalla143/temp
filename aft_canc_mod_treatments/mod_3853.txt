Admission Date: [**2186-2-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2186-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-4-19**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2186-4-1**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post 4-vessel CABG in [**5-4**], status post pacemaker placement who was admitted for evaluation of elevated white blood cell count.
He went to the outpatient primary care physician on the day prior to admission for routine blood work.
Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times 4 vessels in [**5-4**].
Nephrolithiasis, status post surgical removal.
Status post pacemaker placement in [**5-4**], recently interrogated.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father was deceased from [**Name (NI) 4278**] lymphoma and diabetes mellitus 2, mother deceased from a colon cancer, and sister with cervical cancer.
Strength 5/5 throughout and sensation grossly intact to light touch.
He started induction chemotherapy with 7 plus 3.
His post chemotherapy course was complicated by multiple events.
For this, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Status post subclavian line placement for chemotherapy, he had increased bleeding and oozing from line site on [**2186-2-27**] and was found on laboratories to be in acute DIC.
He was supported with blood products including platelets and serial blood transfusions to keep platelet count greater than 10 and hematocrit greater than 25.
For this, he was treated with 1 g of IV Solu-Medrol times 3 days.
He had already been on prophylactic doses of ampicillin at that time, but ampicillin was increased to treatment dose of 5 mg/kg.
Therefore, he was treated with Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV times 2 on [**2186-3-25**] and [**2186-3-26**] for engraftment.
He continued to be treated on cefepime, ampicillin, and Flagyl.
The patient continued to be in profound respiratory distress and was managed in the Intensive Care Unit with noninvasive ventilation mode.
There was some concern that perhaps some of his respiratory compensation was due to amiodarone toxicity, as he had been on amiodarone in the past.
At this time, it was felt that the patient's prognosis was very poor given his increased need for hemodynamic support via pressors in his prolonged persistent hypoxia unresponsive to ventilation techniques, and broad spectrum antibiotics for possible pulmonary process.
At that time, additionally, the family decided to withdraw aggressive care and focus instead on comfort measures only.
He had a cardiac history consisting of status post coronary artery bypass grafting times 4 grafts in [**5-4**].
Therefore, the patient was started on management for congestive heart failure.
Review of his weight and volume status during this admission noted that he had gained over 20 pounds status post initiation of the chemotherapy from early [**Month (only) 547**] to mid [**Month (only) 547**].
He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
However, diuresis was complicated by development of a drug reaction, which was felt to be due to Lasix.
Therefore, Lasix was discontinued.
During the diuresis period, the patient's dyspnea was much improved.
He was on prophylactic doses of AmBisome at that time and had AmBisome increased to 5 mg/kg for treatment doses.
Throughout his hospital course, he was continued on antifungal therapy.
Status post treatment with Lasix, the patient developed a diffuse maculopapular rash.
He was seen by Dermatology, who felt that several of his medications could be the culprit.
He was continued on his antibiotics due to his profound neutropenia and immunocompromised state.
Lasix was held, however; and with discontinuation of Lasix, his rash improved.
At no time was there any mucosal involvement, blistering, or bullae formation.
He was followed by Endocrine Service, who recommended checking vitamin D.  His vitamin D was low.
He was started on calcitriol.
However, due to multiple complicating events status post initiation of chemotherapy for his AML, including worsening cardiopulmonary status and need for higher level of care in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, code status was re-addressed to his family on [**2186-3-31**].
At that time, it was felt that his prognosis was poor and family wished to focus on comfort measures only.
Intravenous pressors, which were being used for hemodynamic support were slowly weaned.
He remained intubated, but had morphine added to his medication regimen for respiratory distress.
