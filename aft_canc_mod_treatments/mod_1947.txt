Admission Date:  [**2199-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-6-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial window  History of Present Illness: 67 yF with h/o metastatic cervical cancer c/b bulky LAD w/R hydronephrosis necessitating nephrostomy tube placement, hypercoagulability resulting in mult CVAs and more recently, PE/[**Hospital 19601**] transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for management of pericardial effusion and UGIB.
1 week prior to this admission, she was treated for PE/DVT and CAP at [**Hospital3 7569**], d/c'ed on lovenox / coumadin; she was treated with levaquin in-house, which was not continued on an out-patient basis.
She underwent pericardial window for drainage of effusion.
Finally, she underwent R ureteral stent and IVC filter placment by IR.
On the day of transfer to medicine, pt's creat (b/l 1.1) had risen to 2.0, despite stent placement, prompting a Renal consult.
In addition, her coags were elevated and trending up with an INR of 3.6 (DIC labs neg; LFTs WNL), despite being off coumadin since admission.

Pericardial effusion: Pt was found to have a new pericardial effusion on Echo, was seen by thoracic surgery, and underwent thorascopic pericardial window with chest tube insertion.
Oncology noted that the patient could be followed as an outpatient for further management of the pleural malignancy.
The chest tube was pulled without complications.
GI Bleed: The patient was initially started on heparin drip due to concerns about the presence of PE; however, this medication was discontinued as her hematocrit decreased while on the drip.
Chronic PE: As above, the patient was placed on the heparin drip for 1 day for concern of PE/DVT, but as she had an IVC filter placed this drip was discontinued.
Given her hypercoagulability, she will likely need long-term AC, which may be re-initiated on an outpatient basis after the IVC filter has been removed.
She had had a nephrostomy tube placed in [**3-6**] obstruction of her R kidney and resultant ARF at that time.
She was taken to IR on [**5-13**], where the R ureter was stented with good flow into the bladder, and the nephrostomy tube was kept in place with plans for capping.
Despite this, levofloxicin was changed to azithro/CTX due to concerns for AIN.
Abdominal u/s showed resolution of prior R hydronephrosis, but was unable to visualize the renal arteries.
As she was never HD unstable to suggest possible renal ischemia, and there were no muddy brown casts on urine sedment exam, ATN was unlikely.
Given the clinical concerns, she was started on levo for community-acquired PNA on [**5-9**], which was changed to azithro/CTX on [**5-13**] (see above).
Likely [**2-6**] nutritional deficiency as pt w/low albumin and poor PO intake.
Also with possible contribution of ABX displacement of coumadin, although she is 7 days s/p stopping coumadin and INR is still rising, making this unlikely.
Vitamin K was held, given no evidence of bleeding; however, she receievd FFP prior to stent placement.
The persistently elevated INR despite being off coumadin for days raised the concern for malnutrition (protein deficiency).
Nutrition was consulted, and transferritin/prealbumin were also sent.
9) Dispo: Pt was discharged home with services once her creatinine was decreasing and she was afebrile and HD stable.
