However the family was not interested in further interventions given their monther's ESLD.
In addition, it is unlikely that these interventions would have altered management.
On the floor the patient's HCT slowly decreased secondary to slow gastric bleeding from GAVE syndrome and on HD #6 it had drifted down to 28.
ESLD - The patient appeared encephalopathic on admission and she was continued on her home regimen of lactulose w/ slight improvement in her mental status upon discharge.
Her metronidazole was discontinued in light of several case reports which suggested a possible relation between this drug and neurological findings.
Dispo - The patient was discharged home with [**Hospital 24262**] home health aide, occupational therapy and physical therapy.
