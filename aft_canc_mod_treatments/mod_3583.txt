Cholangiocarcinoma status post cholecystectomy with common duct excision with left hepatic lobectomy and pylorus sparing Whipple, status post reexploration for bleeding.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 53382**] is a 73 year-old male who initially presented to an outside hospital with a painless jaundice and a CA199 of 665 at which time he underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which was thought to be consistent with a ________ tumor and had a sphincterotomy and plastic stent placed with brushings at the time, which demonstrated atypical cells consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
He underwent CT scan, which did not show visible lesions and subsequently underwent removal of the plastic stent and the PTC.
Given his diagnosis he was referred for surgical management to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Hepatobiliary Service.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2109-1-10**] and on that same day underwent cholecystectomy with a common duct excision and a left hepatic lobectomy and a pylorus sparing Whipple.
There was no note of excessive intraoperative blood loss and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition postoperatively from which he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
This was weaned secondary to episodes of hypotension after which time narcotics such as morphine were used prn for sedation and pain control.
From a respiratory standpoint the patient remained intubated postoperatively for respiratory support, but the patient was planned to wean from to extubation on postoperative day five, but remained extubated secondary to complication of bleeding for which he was taken back to the Operating Room.
The final pathology from the surgery did reveal that he did have metastatic adenocarcinoma involving the lymph nodes and biliary ducts as noted.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay was notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix secondary to large amounts of fluid he received in the immediate perioperative period.
From a nutrition standpoint the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition in the immediate postoperative period.
By the time of discharge his total parenteral nutrition was discontinued two days prior to discharge as he had adequate po intake and regular diet and Boost supplement shakes.
Notably the patient did have a G tube cholangiogram to evaluate for a leak via the T tube.
Hematologically as noted above the patient did have an episode of hypotension postoperatively along with a significant amount of a sanguinous output from his JP drain at which time he was taken back to the Operating Room and reexplored and found to have a bleeding vessel, which was then suture ligated.
From an infectious disease standpoint the patient was given broad spectrum antibiotic coverage postoperatively with Unasyn.
Given these culture findings he was treated with Vanco, Zosyn and Ambazone starting on postoperative days six and two.
After a two week course of the previously mentioned broad spectrum antibiotics he was switched over to Ciprofloxacin on postoperative days 21 and 17 for cholangitis prophylaxis.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po q.d.
Reglan 10 mg po q.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
