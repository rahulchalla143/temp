You were intubated for this procedure for your safety, because of your history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
While you were here, you also received multiple blood transfusions.
You were then started on both a heparin drip as well as warfarin therapy to keep your blood from clotting, since you have a history of blood clots.
You were discharged on lovenox and warfarin and should stop the lovenox once your warfarin (also called Coumadin) is at a safe level to prevent blood clots.
Please INCREASE your dose of lisinopril to 20 mg every day.
