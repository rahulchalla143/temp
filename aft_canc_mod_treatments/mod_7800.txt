The pt was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital from [**Date range (1) 94558**] w/ refractory peripheral edema [**2-13**] chronic right sided heart failure and was diuresed; he was also developed pneumococcal pneumonia/bacteremia so was treated with two weeks of CTX which he completed in rehab.
While at rehab, warfarin was restarted for Afib (this had been discontinued in [**5-/2171**] [**2-13**] a large diverticular bleed) and 3 days later he had dark/tarry stools in the setting of INR of 3.4 and hct of 27.5 (from 30 on [**2172-3-26**]).
He was given at least 2 units of FFP and 10 mg vitamin K which brought his INR down to 1.9.

On the cardiac surgery service, GI was consulted given his recent GI bleed and plan were made for colonscopy on [**4-15**].
Per Cardiac Surgery, he is not a candidate for surgery at this time due to GI bleed and various other issues (see below) so a transfer to Medicine was requested.

Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M w/ h/o CHF (EF 45%), porcine AV replacement, severe MR/TR, AFib, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacemaker, diverticulosis s/p bleed in [**2171**], transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-13**] for evaluation of melena.
Although an unsuccessful attempt was made to stop the bleed via interventional radiology, the patient did not want to undergo a repeat colonoscopy and it was felt that the risks of this procedure in light of his comorbid conditions outweighed the benefits.
He will be continued on diuretic therapy for comfort and is to be discharged to a hospice facility.
#) GIB: Pt had hx of melena with hct drop to 25 in setting of anticoagulation with coumadin at rehab.
He was given multiple transfusions and his hematocrit gradually stabilized.
He was aggressively diuresed with a lasix drip, and transitioned to oral torsemide.
The patient is to continues on his diuretic regimen to comfort.
He was evaluated by nutrition and began taking supplements with his meals.
He is to continue with these supplements, but should be mindful of his total fluid intake given his sCHF.
#) Coagulopathy: Initialy was secondary to warfarin and was reversed at OSH with FFP and vitamin K 10 mg from 3.4 to 1.9.
During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], platelets remained stable around 60.
On admission patient was at his baseline but creatinine bumped to 2.2 on [**4-17**] after several days of NPO status in setting continued diuresis.
He was given fluids and creatinine trend back to his baseline.
He was recently treated with CTX and azithro for strep pneumo pna/bacteremia in [**Month (only) 958**] so this was felt to be residual infiltrate vs. new aspiration pneumonitis.
Patient had no active cough, fever or leukocytosis and antibiotics were not started.
Vascular was not concerned about mild arterial disease and patient was managed with leg elevation, ABM foam dressings, and ACE wrap bandaging.
