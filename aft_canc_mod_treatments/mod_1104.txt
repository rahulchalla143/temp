Admission Date:  [**2160-5-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-5-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-6-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of carcinoid tumor of bronchial origin that was resected in [**2146**] from the left upper lobe of his lung.
He received nasogastric lavage and was found to have blood in his emesis and due to the briskness of the blood loss, he was brought to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Carcinoid cancer, metastatic, status post chemotherapy and chemoembolization in [**2152**] and [**2153**], no coronary artery disease, no hypertension, no diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission he received Protonics, Octreotide, Thiamine and Multivitamins as well as fluids.
As a result of the esophagitis, he was placed on Diflucan and Nystatin swish and swallow.
His blood sugar was increased presumably as a result of the Octreotide treatment so he receives insulin on a sliding scale.
He also received Ativan as needed per Ciwa scale.
On the final day of his admission he developed a low grade fever to 100.4 which then went down to 99.0 but to rule out infection we checked the urinalysis which was normal and chest x-ray which showed an infiltrate in the left posterior lobe of the lung which may have represented pneumonia so we treated with Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d for a 7 day course.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Sandostatin every 28 days as administered at the oncology clinic.
