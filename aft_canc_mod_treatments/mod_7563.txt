A left-sided central catheter terminates in low SVC.
A right-sided central catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with history of myelodysplasia with refractory anemia and excess blasts admitted for allogeneic stem cell transplant.
He had previously received no chemotherapy but required red cell and platelet support.
As this was thought to be some progression towards leukemia in the interim before transplant it was decided to give him a cycle of Dacogen which was started on [**2191-5-2**].
Patient underwent ablative Flu/Bu/ATG, followed by allogenic MUD SCT, with CMV negative recipient, CMV positive donor.
Overnight following transfusion of graft, patient became febrile and developed atrial fibrillation with RVR as discussed below, as well as on a second occasion (D+12) just prior to engraftment.
Tacrolimus levels were monitored closely, patient received prophylaxis with acyclovir and micafungin, and neupogen was stopped upon engraftment.
Antibiotics for neutropenic fever were stopped following engraftment as discussed below.
- Continue Acyclovir and antifungal prophylaxis - Continue 2mg [**Hospital1 **] Tacrolimus, goal level [**4-7**] - Follow up in hematology/oncology clinic  # Neutropenic fever: No source identified on CT of chest ([**2191-7-10**]) or CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2191-7-9**]).
Antibiotics were stopped following engraftment and patient was stable and afebrile thereafter.
Patient was noted to have nicotine patch was was noted to be in place on arm, with likely increased absorption during fevers, which would predispose to this rhythm.
Rate control was not achieved following IV metoprolol and IV diltiazem.
He was transferred to the ICU for further management, including pressors briefly and diltiazem drip.
At time of discharge patient was in normal sinus rhythm, stable on PO metoprolol.

Biopsy showed early changes with keratinocyte apoptosis (possible result of recent chemotherapy), possible evolving drug eruption, viral exanthem, and graft versus host disease.
- Erythromycin ointment, fluorometholone drops for one week following discharge - Artificial tears for symptom relief has changes in vision  Chronic Issues: # Skin graft right shin: Concern for infection on admission.
Patient has remote history of full course of antibiotics for this stye.
Ophthalmology was consulted when patient complained of increased tenderness around the area during neutropenic nadir, and had five day course of erythromycin ointment.
Transitional issues: - Will need suture removal on [**2191-7-28**] from left chest skin biopsy - Tacrolimus dose 2mg PO Q12H - Target Tacrolimus dose 5-10 - Patient will be followed closely by outpatient hematology/oncology - Continuation of metoprolol to be determined by outpatient cardiologist - Will need to start bactrim for PCP prophylaxis on [**Name9 (PRE) **] +30 - Positive EBV titer from [**2191-7-18**]  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
