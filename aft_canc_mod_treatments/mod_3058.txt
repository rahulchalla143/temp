Your blood sugar was significantly elevated and you were treated with intravenous fluids and insulin.
You were given two blood transfusions.

We also started you on blood "thinner" medications (heparin and coumadin) and monitored your blood levels until the activity of coumadin was therapeutic for two days (goal INR = 2.0 - 3.0).
Medication Changes: - Lantus (glargine) increased to 20 Units before bed - Use sliding scale for dosing of humalog insulin prior to meals and bedtime rather than only dosing before dinner - Prednisone now 10mg tablet daily.
Stopped medications: -glyburide -metformin -pioglitazone -iron -hydroxyurea -losartan (speak with your primary care physician about restarting this medication, your blood pressure did not require this medication while you were in the hospital)   Followup Instructions: You will need to have your blood drawn tomorrow [**2157-5-6**] when you come for appointment w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and on [**2157-5-9**] at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Location (un) 1439**].
