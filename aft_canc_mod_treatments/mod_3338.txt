Patient underwent induction 7+3; 5+2 in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2166**], followed by three cycles of consolidation after which she had a bone marrow biopsy with remission in early [**2166**].
Patient remained in remission until [**3-31**] at which time she was found to have relapsed by bone marrow biopsy and underwent reinduction 7+3/5+2(idarubicin and cytarabine).
She was admitted for a week in [**Month (only) 205**] for neutropenic fevers, hickman was pulled, and patient was treated with Daptomycin.
Although her English is limited, patient states that she has been feeling relatively well since her discharge.
Uses ativan to help control her nausea, has had occasional diarrhea with the most recent episode this am, denies any blood in stool.
(e)  she is status post HIDAC consolidation in [**2166-12-28**], complicated by fever and neutropenia with no clear source with an admission in [**2167-1-26**].
(g) She received her third and last cycle of HiDAC consolidation in [**2167-2-26**].

Imaging: [**11-18**] PCXR: An endotracheal tube ends in satisfactory position 4 cm above the carina.
An NG tube curls in the stomach.
A Swan-Ganz catheter from the inferior approach ends in the proximal left pulmonary artery.
IMPRESSION: Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
Patient had been on BMT service for >2 months and was then transferred to the MICU for CHF, including diuresis and afterload reduction therapy initially with hydralazine changed to ACE I (captopril).
With these interventions, patient's weight decreased from 130 -> 114 lbs.
Patient underwent a trial of nesiritide for diuresis while off captopril and then lasix was added the regimen.
On [**11-7**], patient diuresed well on lasix with a slight elevation in creatinine to 1.6, but a new anion gap was noted with a lactate of 7.
Also, with tricuspid vegetation and known endocarditis, it was thought placing a swan would be high risk.
Diagnosed in [**10-1**] treated with 10 days gentamicin and 4 weeks ceftriaxone, generalized anasarca, persistent sinus tachycardia with occasional [**Month/Day (1) 6059**], bilateral pleural effusions, acalculous cholecystitis, portal vein thrombosis, DIC and hemorrhoids.
* AML  - pt was started on syngeneic transplant protocol upon admission on [**2168-8-8**].
Hickman was placed on [**8-10**].
She had positive PPD 12 years ago and was treated for six months - pt can't remember which drug.
On [**8-24**] pt was started on Allo Bisulfan/Cytoxan protocol.
She was continued on Levofloxacin/Flagyl coverage.
Pt also received a PICC line in addition to her R double lumen Hickman.
Pt tolerated transplant well and her ANC gradually increased with resolution of neutropenia.
Pt was initially started on Acyclovir.
She was also treated with empiric Flucanazole.
Acyclovir and fluconazole were to be continued for 6 months after trasplant.
Pt was believed to be in complete remission from the AML, and did not required chronic blood product transfusion.
No further chemotherapy was planned in the near future.
Per ID, she was continued on her metronidazole for a 10 day course.
Cardiac enzymes were significant for troponin of 0.05 x 3, which was stable and not trending up, ck-MB was negative.
Her chest pain was thought to be secondary to anxiety, often resolving with ativan, and sinus tachycardia, and was treated with morphine and attempts at better rate control.
* CHF - her cardiomyopathy was new since her transplant as a echo prior to transplant revealed normal systolic function.
The worsened heart function was believed to be secondary to cytoxan as well as prior anthracycline.
She was managed with lasix, metoprolol 12.5 PO TID, spironolactone 25mg PO TID, and digoxin 0.125 mg PO every other day.
Patient's blood pressure with diuresis was marginal and cardiology consult initially did not believe there was room to add ACE-inhibitor, neither did they believe that she would benefit from afterload reduction.
Patient's maximum weight was 130 lbs and she was diuresed to 123 lbs with lasix 20mg PO TID and more recently a lasix drip at 2mg/hr in the MICU.
In addition, she had a thoracentesis of her right sided pleural effusion with removal of 1L, and some improvement of her dyspnea.
Of note, she has not required supplemental oxygen.
She was overall fluid overloaded and responded somewhat to diuresis in the MICU.
She was actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg PO QD to 114 lbs, with a consequent increase in her serum Cr from 0.8 to 1.4.
Cardiology then recommended acebutalol for greater Beta 1 selectivity, but she also did not tolerate this with a drop in SBP to 69, which returned to 85 after 150 cc IV bolus of NS.
Her digoxin was titrated to try to improve her rate control and was set at alternating doses of 0.1875 and 0.25 with a resting HR in the 120-130s.
She was also started on captopril 6.25 mg PO TID for afterload reduction and for her EF<20%.
On cardiology service diuresis was attempted by placing patient on nesiritide drip and supplementing with lasix.
Patient initially tolerated this well, was able to lose approximately 5 pounds of water weight.
However, lasix was discontinued after 2 days due to elevated creatinine.
After 1 week on nesiritide, this also had to be discontinued due to hypotension and development of other medical issues including elevated lactate.
Due to severe hypotension which was thought to be secondary to cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and milronone drip was initiated.
Patient also required vasopressin and levophed to maintain her blood pressure.
Attempts at weaning either the balloon pump and vasopressin were unsuccessful.
Patient expired shortly after balloon pump removal.
*Sinus Tachycardia - Patient was also noted following her chemotherapy to have sinus tachycardia, onset at same time as her above CHF.
A trial of carvedilol and acebutelol was attempted prior to transfer to cardiology, but was not tolerated due to hypotension.
On cardiology service a trial of 1mg IV lopressor was attempted with the thought that if her blood pressure tolerated this and her heart rate decreased an oral trial of lopressor could be attempted.
Therefore no nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was started for her tachycardia.
She has been continued on metoprolol 12.5 mg PO TID.
Digoxin was discontinued secondary to toxicity.
In addition patient completed an empiric 2 week course of daptomycin (given hx of allergy to vancomycin), meropenem, and ambisome.
If patient develops a fever, infectious endocarditis once again has to be considered and she needs to be broadly cultured including fungal cultures.
The patient was tx'd w/ ceftriaxone 2g daily, beginning on [**10-16**] and will need 4 weeks of treatment to be completed on [**2168-11-13**].
Follow up blood cultures and ECHO should be done at that time to ensure bacteremia and tricuspid vegetations have resolved.

Repeat lactates continued to rise, and on [**11-10**], patient was noted to have a lactate of 13.9 and an anion gap of 25.
Patient was transferred to ICU for further managment.
Her transaminases were elevated to the 200s, but the bilirubin was normal.
She was admitted to the MICU after a cholecystostomy tube was placed by IR.
* Portal vein thrombosis - patient was started on a heparin drip and continued with a goal PTT 60-80.
Her liver abdnormalities resolved on the heparin drip.
The patient accidentally partially removed the cholecystostomy drain, her labs remained stable as did the abdominal pain for the next few days and the drain tube was discontinued.
The patient was continued on heparin drip with plans to switch to lovenow injections for continued anticoagulation.
The heparin drip was d/c at the recommendation of the heme/onc service for concern of HIT.
She received 6 units of FFP and 1 bag of cryo and serial DIC labs were followed, with improvement over the time she was in the MICU.
The pt was maintained on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals with input from ID.
Pt was intially put on stool softeners and eventually made NPO with TPN in order to minimized potential infectious exposure in the rectal area.
She was empirically covered for colon flora with Levoquin and Flagyl.
Morphine was used for pain control.
Pt then transferred to the unit due to persistent hypotension, elevated anion gap, elevated lactate for further management.
Due to persistent hypotension refractory to fluid boluses and pressors, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the setting of cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **] +/- septic [**Month/Year (2) **].
- attempted to wean IABP however CI 1.7 on 1:2 - cont max doses of vasopressin, milronine and levophed - keep at goal CVP 16-18 - need to consider insensible losses - total body anasarca, likely related to her low EF.
