He was started on vancomycin and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for question of hypovolemia vs septic shock.
In the MICU, he was treated with IV fluids.
A subclavian line was placed initailly due to concern for contaminated port.
At this time, the patient was already on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for his neutropenic fever (see below).
He was treated conservatively with IV fluids and bowel rest, and his symptoms improved.
Eventually, his rate was controlled with a regimen of PO metoprolol.
He was placed on a heparin drip.
At the time of discharge, he remains on lovenox for anticoagulation.
His antibiotics were broadened to vanc and cefepime.
When he became more neutropenic and still continued to spike fevers, micafungin was also added to the patient?????
?s antibiotics were scaled back.
He is being discharged on cipro/flagyl for 9 more days (to complete a course of 14 days of antibiotics since his last fever).

The patient was admitted after a witnessed seizure at home.
He was continued on his home phenobarbitol regimen as well as seizure precautions.

His radiation treatments were continued in-house.
His most recent radiation treatment was [**2144-2-4**].
