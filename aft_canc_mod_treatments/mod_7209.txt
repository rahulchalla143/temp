Briefly, 47 y/o man with long standing history of epilepsy s/p right temporal lobectomy (at age 19) and VNS placement (7 years ago), h/o EtOH and cocaine abuse who was having increased seizure frequency in the setting of VNS malfunction.
He was admitted on [**1-28**] for elective replacement of the vagus nerve stimulator generator.
He received 2mg IV ativan with somnolence and apenea afterwards.
He was seen by the cardiology fellow and subsequently underwent pericardial window.
Past Medical History: - epilepsy and nonelectrographic seizures (petite mal with rare secondary generalization) - s/p right temporal lobectomy - s/p VNS placement - Mood disorder and likely borderline personality organization - Multiple suicide attempts in past (largely overdose) - DM due to medication, now apparently resolved - cervical strain - Rosacea - [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus - Polysubstance abuse: EtOH, MJ, cocaine/crack binges with resultant unsafe sexual practices - h/o atrial fibrillation (not on medication)  Social History: Unemployed, lives alone.
Left neck dressing with dried blood.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with 35-50% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-15mmHg).
Poor image quality.The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg with IVC dilation (2.5 cm).
Intrapericardial origin of fluid was confirmed with contrast injection and intrapericardial pressure measurement.
Pericaridal drain was sutured in place for 24 hours.
Successful urgent pericardiocentesis through subxiphoid approach for impending pericardial temponade .
Compared with the prior studies (images reviewed) of [**2196-1-29**] and [**2194-7-23**], the appearance of the pericardium is similar to that of the post-tap echo yesterday.
Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Evidence of right heart strain, manifest as reflux of IV contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with history of epilepsy admitted for elective vagal nerve stimulator replacement, transferred to MICU for management of tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia, found to have pericardial effusion, now s/p pericardiocentiesis with drain in place, transferred to CCU for post-operative monitoring, with frequent agitation, now found to have bilateral PEs .
He underwent pericardiocentesis with drain placement with drainage of bloody fluid.
Drain was eventually pulled without complication and without any further hemodynamic instability.
Pulsus checked for several days after drain pulled and resolved effusion on Echo, was ~8 mmHg on discharge.
He was started on heparin ggt in house and transitioned to an anticoagulation regimen of coumadin, with a lovenox bridge.
He was maintained on a valium CIWA and klonipin 1mg TID.
Of note, pt would be lucid and engaging often during the day with decompensation at night.
They recommended haldol for his agitation which was continued 5mg PRN along with 10mg QHS standing, these were discontinued on discharge, takes no psych meds at home and delirium apparently cleared.
Based on old records, has a history of Afib with RVR, a flutter, was treated with diltiazem and flecainide, and was supposed to be on Metoprolol.
Increased metoprolol to 75 mg po qid standing which has controlled rate well, though still with frequent episodes of rapid ventricular response that respond to IV lopressor 5 mg x 1.
Because of continued episodes of RVR (likely in the setting of pericardial effusion and multiple PEs) pt started on diltiazem drip, weaned off and started on diltiazem ER 120 mg daily, and metoprolol changed to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate on discharge.
h/o epilepsy and seizure activity: VNS placed and was re-activated about 1 week after placement.
Depakote ER 1250/1500/1500 and Oxcarbazepine 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was often given IV due to inability to take POs from agitation.
Was discharged on home meds and advised to f/u with his outpatient neurologist for management of his depakote.
# Foley self-d/c:  Pt pulled own foley overnight [**1-30**].
Urine output was monitored and foley ended up being replaced on [**2-2**] given that he was put back into 4pt restraints.

You will be taking a blood thinner called Coumadin to prevent more clots from forming and to treat the ones you already have, and you should take this medication every day.
You will be taking Lovenox, another blood thinner which works immediately, temporarily until your blood level of Coumadin reaches the therapeutic range.
Changes to your medications: START diltiazem 120 mg every day START taking metoprolol 200 mg daily START taking warfarin 5 mg daily START taking lovenox shots twice a day until you are told to stop by your doctor  Followup Instructions: In addition to the appointments below, the oncologists are trying to schedule you an appointment in clinic.
