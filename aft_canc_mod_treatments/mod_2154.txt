Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**10-3**]: Emergent perioperative EVD placement [**10-3**]: Emergent Angiogram [**10-16**]: VP shunt placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 19419**] is a 71 y/o male with previously observed right frontal meningioma who was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2192-8-27**].
The patient is following commands with all extremities.
The incision is clean, dry, intact and there are sutures in place.
Unchanged appearance of intraventricular hemorrhage with mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus.
Head CT([**10-3**]): Status post left-sided central ventricular drain placement with slight interval improvement in dilatation involving the frontal horns bilaterally, otherwise unchanged examination.
Stable large right frontal extra-axial mass, with calcifications and associated vasogenic edema.
Due to a rather expeditious neurological decline, he was taken for an emergent placement of an intraventricular drainage catheter, followed by a emergent angiogram to further identify the lesion.
Unfortunatley there was an aneurysm identified, however within the AVM itself, and thereby ineligible for coil embolization.
Unfortunately due to persistantly elevated ICPs with clamping of the EVD, he was determined to be an appropriate candidate for VP shunt placement.
On [**10-16**] he underwent an uneventful shunt placement.
Post-operatively he was transferred to the neuro step-down unit where his treatment continued.
