Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 year old man with a past medical history of severe CHF, CAD, and s/p MVR presenting after recent hospitalization for GI bleed and endovascular infection with hypotension.
His blood pressures have remained mostly stable with systolic blood pressures ranging between 90s-110s following the 1L NS given at [**Hospital3 **] and another 3L NS given in ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
On the hospital floor we have slowly started him back on his home cardiac meds: metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] instead of 25mg [**Hospital1 **] which is his home regimin and lisinopril 2.5mg QHS and his blood pressures have remained stable.
He might need to have his cardiac medication doses adjusted to this lower level of fluid intake.
We the pulled the PICC line and started him on a Heparin Drip.
We then transfused two units of red blood cells and discontinued his heparin and aspririn.
His Hct has been stable since this episode and with ID approval we switched him over to oral antibiotics for his endocarditis.
He currently does not have a PICC line in place and was placed on Heparin 5000U SQ for prophylaxis.
His Cr has been trending down since admission after institution of fluid boluses.
