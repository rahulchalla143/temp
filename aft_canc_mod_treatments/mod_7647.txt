CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2115-1-3**] Interstitial abnormality, chronicity indeterminate .
Diffuse bone marrow infiltration with malignancy.
Viable tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail, cytokeratin 7, synaptophysin, chromogranin, TTF-1, and calcitonin.
Negative stains include cytokeratin 20, LCA, C-kit, S-100, PSA, PSAP, HepPar1, CDX2, and thyroglobulin.
In the context of a prior bone metastasis (S12-857P; [**2115-1-4**])   in wich tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, the   morphology is consistent with medullary thyroid carcinoma.
Patient was initially started on acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin for meningitis, though suspicion for bacterial meningitis was low.
Once LP done on [**1-4**] ruled out bacterial and HSV infection, antibiotics were discontinued.
Patient then had a bone marrow biopsy, which preliminarily showed a "packed" marrow with carcinoma of unclear origin and was later confirmed to be medullary thyroid cancer.
Neuro surgery was consulted for biopsy.
However, biopsy was deferred given risk of the procedure and XRT was deferred as well.
Patient was intermittently agitated during the admission, but was stabilized on haldol 2 mg tid (psychiatry team was involved).
# Medullary Thyroid Cancer: Bone marrow biopsy initially with carcinoma, further tests confirmed medullary thyroid cancer.
Spine surgery evalauted the patient given pathologic fracture.
Felt that no intervention was needed at this time.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from spine surgery as an outpatient.
In regards to tumor markers, PSA/AFP/Hcg not elevated, CEA 3000, Ca [**21**]-9 547, calcitonin [**Numeric Identifier 63238**], consistent with medullary thyroid cancer.
On discharge, patient with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for treatment of cancer with chemotherapy, likely Vandetanib.
He will also follow up in brain tumor with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] to further assess for possible whole brain xrt as above.
Was transfused 6 units of pRBCs throughout admission, last unit on [**1-16**] and 2 units of platelets, last unit on [**1-4**].
# CAD: Had multiple stents placed in the past,unclear which type, though patient apparently only on aspirin, not [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] probably bare metal stent.
Continued metoprol, lisinopril, but held aspirin.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: -full code -will need frequent CBC, Chem 7 checks to assess for anemia/thrombocytopenia and Na -will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in brain tumor clinic and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for thyroid cancer treatement.
-will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from spine surgery -weekly ECGs to assess QTc given patient is on standing haldol -Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 91771**]).
