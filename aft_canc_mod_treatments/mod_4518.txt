Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 185**] is a 67 M with a medical history notable for stage IV squamous cell lung carcinoma and previous atrial fibrillation requiring an ablation procedure.
He briefly required admission to the MICU for a diltiazem drip to control his rates.
Ultimately, a repeat CT scan of the chest revealed that he was not responding to his chemotherapy and he decided to be discharged home to hospice.
Non-small cell lung cancer  - he did not have adequate pain control on his admission Fentanyl patches due to a small amount of body fat; he was discharged on long and short-acting morphine.
- he was also discharged on home oxygen  2.
His rates were ultimately controlled with long-acting diltiazem and atenolol.
Aspiration pneumonia  - failed speech and swallow and placed on 7 days of levofloxacin and Flagyl along with aspiration precautions  4.
Concern for adrenal insufficiency  - while in the ICU he was hypotensive and was started on empiric steroids for adrenal insufficiency as he has an adrenal metastasis.
Further testing for his adrenal glands can be arranged given his goals of care.
Factor V Leiden deficiency  - the patient decided to continue on warfarin anticoagulation for his hypercoagulable state.
His last dose of warfarin was on [**12-20**] (0.5mg).
Given his goals of care, other non-essential medications were discontinued including folic acid, daily multivitamin, and Zometa.

We think this was from atrial fibrillation resulting in a fast heart rate and dehydration after your chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, it appears your cancer has not responded to your chemotherapy and we have arranged for you to have hospice services at home to treat your cancer-related pain and shortness of breath.
You also developed a pneumonia while in the hospital and we are recommending 5 more days of antibiotics and a thickened diet to prevent aspiration.
We made the following changes to your medications:  - change Fentanyl and oxycodone to Morphine long-acting and short-acting for pain control  - stop folic acid and multivitamin  - decrease atenolol to 12.5mg twice daily  - discuss if you want to continue your warfarin with your hospice service; your INR is still high and you do not need any warfarin until at least Friday, [**12-24**]  - stop Zometa  - start Flagyl and levofloxacin to treat your pneumonia for 5 more days  - start diltiazem to help control your heart rate  - continue prednisone for 3 more days and then stop  Followup Instructions: Your hospice team will meet you at home today at 2pm.
