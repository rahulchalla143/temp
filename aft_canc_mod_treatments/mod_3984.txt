Admission Date:  [**2149-5-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Lovenox / Zyprexa  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: hypotension and gait disturbance  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: fluoroscopically guided lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: History per chart and patient.
Pt is a 75 yo male with history of recent left temporal lobe CVA, CAD, recent cardiac cath at [**Hospital1 2025**] recently diagnosed hydrocephalus with a 3rd ventricle lipoma who presented to [**Hospital6 4620**] for hypotension and gait disturbances on [**4-30**].
There he was found to have bladder cancer and an appointment was arranged for him to have a definitive resection under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**] at [**Hospital3 **].
After doing with lisinopril and lopressor, both of which were apparently new medications prescribed during the hospital course at [**Hospital1 2025**].
The patient was treated with dopamine at NWH and then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] because no beds were available in the ICU.
Neurology saw the patient and thought that hemodynamic issues were causing the mental status changes and the frontal dementia was secondary to the front infarct and hydrocephalus as demonstrated on another CT. Neurosurgery was consult and they felt a shunt to be unnecessary.
Past Medical History: 1) colelithiasis 2) bladder ca soon to be resected [**5-1**] 3) old left frontal stroke 4) corpus callosum lipoma with hydrocephalus 5) hospital HIT 6) ARF thought to be due to acyclovir 7) DJD of spine 8) osteoarthritis of knee 9) history of PUD status post GI bleed   Social History: 1) cigars 2) [**2-25**] shots of brandy per day 3) 11 children  4) wife alive and speaks for him  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission, the vitals: GEN: lying in bed, no acute distress, appears stated age.
Due to the mild hydrocephalus, neurosurgery remained uncertain about the utility of shunt placement and recommended a large volume lumbar puncture.
Fluoro-guided LP was performed on [**5-23**] at the Pain Clinic without complication and CSF was sent for further study.
Although the patient was sitting and opening pressures are not necessarily accurate unless lying down, neurology felt the possibility of NPH was not to be excluded.
The issue of a shunt placement was discussed with the patient's wife as well as his other family members and it was agreed that they would like to pursue more conservative management of the patient's mental status changes and gait disturbance.
This had not been documented previously and an xray of his left hip was order to r/o fracture.
ESR, CRP, and SPEP were ordered with the thought that the patient could have a vasculitis.
Unfortunately, the results that returned are difficult to interpret given the patient's bladder cancer and vasculitis has not been ruled out.
IV fluids were made ready in case he had a hypotensive episode.
Metoprolol was started at 25 mg but an ACE inhibitor was not.
Please consider restarting the patient's ACE inhibiter at rehab or afterward should blood pressures and renal function remain stable as this would likely improve long term cardiac function.
5) CAD: The patient was kept on aspirin, lipitor, aspirin, and beta blocker.
7) DVT prophylaxis: The patient was given sc heparin for DVT prophylaxis and assisted out of bed as often as possible by nursing and PT.
Heparin was discontinued and the patient's Hct remained stable around 31-33.
