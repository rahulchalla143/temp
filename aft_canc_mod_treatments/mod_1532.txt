Admission Date:  [**2173-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-10-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Oxycodone / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, tachycardia, mouth sores  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 31205**] is an 89 year old male with history of COPD and tracheo-bronchial malacia (recently stented) who is presenting from rehab with tachycardia, worsening oral ulcers and difficulty breathing.
He finished his prednisone taper about 1 week ago from a prior COPD exacerbation.
He was placed on CPAP in the ED and his VS were 120 102/57 22 100.
Upon arrival to the ICU team, respiratory therapy was at the bedside and recommended that non-rebreather may be a more comfortable option for him given his extensive oral ulcers which were bleeding.
Of note he was recently admitted for T-tube/Y stent placement which was done [**2172-10-19**] (failure to decannulate at rehab).
On [**2172-10-20**], he had more hoarsness and went for a revision of the T tube with IP.
Additionally, sputum grew out GPC and GNR and he was placed empirically on vanc and levo (history of Stenotrophomonas, E. coli, and MRSA in bronchial washings from [**2172-10-7**]).
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old male with PMH of severe COPD and tracheobronchomalacia s/p stenting, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, HTN/HL, and current C. difficile infection who initially presented with tachycardia, mouth sores, and shortness of breath consistent with recurrent COPD exacerbation.
ACTIVE issues:  # Dyspnea/COPD excacerbation: He presented with significant shortness of breath and tachycardia that improved with CPAP, nebulizers, routine airway care, and re-initiation of steroids.
We were able to wean his oxygen off, only requiring a humidified face mask without any extra O2 to help break up secretions.
We initially prescribed Azithromycin for COPD exacerbation, but then switched him over to levofloxacin to cover a suspected lower lobe pneumonia.
Albuterol/ipratroprium nebs and prednisone were continued until discharge and the levofloxacin should be continued for another 4 days (5 day course) for a suspected right lower lobe pneumonia.
For his persistent recurrence of COPD exacerbations, he should be continued on chronic prednisone at 10mg for now.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: We controlled his atrial fibrillation with rate control (uptitration of beta-blocker to metoprolol 25mg TID), rhythm control (amiodarone at prior dosing), and anticoagulation with warfarin as prior.
Please continue to uptitrate beta-blockade for rate control and follow INR for goal [**12-31**].
Continue coumadin every other day for now while on antibiotics.
# Hypotension:  Intermittent drops in his systolic blood pressure responded to fluids.
We continued Flagyl 500mg TID and he should continue this for 14 days after his levofloxacin course.
# Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG [**2156**]( LIMA->LAD, SVG-diagonal,  SVG-OM, SVG-LPL): Continued on statin and BB, ASA, as above.
# GERD: Continued on home PPI .
Medications as above.
# Vit B12 deficiency: Monthly injections as outpatient .

You were treated with steroids and breathing treatments.
The nurses frequently suctioned your mouth and we gave you medications to make your breathing better and make your mouth less painful.
We also started an antibiotic out of concern for a pneumonia.
We have made the following changes in your medications: START levofloxacin 750mg daily for 4 more days START prednisone taper, but will continue chronic prednisone at 10mg daily.
CHANGE metoprolol 25mg to three times daily, from 2 times daily CONTINUE Flagyl 500mg three times daily, for 14 days after the levofloxacin is stopped.
CHANGE warfarin to 0.5mg daily every OTHER day for now, with routine INR monitoring  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
