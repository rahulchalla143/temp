Plavix and coumadin held.
Found to have supratherapeutic INR to 9 on admission which has been reversed to 2-2.7 with PO vitamin K and FFP.
Started on heparin drip when INR <2.
However after TTE was negative for right atrial thrombus the heparin drip was turned off and coumadin was d/cd as the patient no longer had a reason to be anticoagulated and was at high risk of further bleeding from the GI tract.

HD catheter replaced over wire on [**2104-10-10**] and subsequently found to be leaking a few days later so was changed over a wire.
The catheter tip subsequently grew staph on culture.
He was treated with IV vanco per HD protocol.
Bacteremia: Patient had fever and blood cultures showed coag negative staph sensitive to Vancomycin in [**5-2**] bottles.
The PICC line was pulled and cultured with no growth.
The HD line was changed over a wire and culture results showed staph on the tip.
He may need a replacement HD catheter placed eventually if he has persistent bacteremia although subsequent blood cultures taken here since the catheter was changed show no growth to date.
He was restarted on his plavix as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] felt it was necessary to keep his stents patent.
Per patient, currently on Flagyl for C. diff.
Flagyl was d/cd.
