Progressively weakness got worse, and patient started slurring his words but was still coherent and mental status in tact.
He was started on hydroxyurea on [**6-5**] after he and his wife were made aware of his poor prognosis with leukemic transformation.
He was found down by EMS and was incontinent of stool and urine.
He was noted to be agitated and received zyprexa 5 mg x 2.
He was also noted to be in afib with RVR to 140s, for which he recieved diltiazem 10 mg IV x 1, metoprolol 5 mg IV x1, also received metoprolol 75 mg PO x1.
UA also positive for UTI, so ceftriaxone at 2 mg IV x 1 was given, given concern for meningitis with WBC in CSF as well.
Appeared agitated and yelling at staff to get away from him.

SUMMARY OF ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: - progressed while on pralatrexate and pentostatin - currently on gemcitabine, C5D1 on [**2109-1-16**] (1) He has been a patient of dermatologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81680**] for 30 years, with prior basal cell cancers on the head treated by excision.
A "small area of patchy uptake in the anterior aspect of the right liver lobe" was of "uncertain significance."
There was no evidence of invasive aspergillosis, and expectant observation was recommended by an infectious disease specialist.
(4) Subsequently, he noticed a new erythematous scalp lesion, located at the right lateral hairline of his balding scalp, in association with a pigmented lesion representing seborrheic keratosis and basal cell cancer, subsequently excised.
(5) In [**2107-2-15**], he noticed progression of skin lesions.
He saw us in follow-up on [**2107-4-5**] and began weekly oral methotrexate 2.5 mg at 8 a.m. + 2.5 mg at 8 p.m. + 2.5 mg at 8 a.m. on [**2107-4-7**].
(6) On [**2107-11-16**], Mr. [**Known lastname 81681**] reduced his weekly oral methotrexate (MTX) as follows: On Tuesdays, methotrexate 7.5 mg at 8 a.m. + 7.5 mg at 8 p.m. On Wednesdays, methotrexate 5 mg at 8 a.m. His last dose was on [**2107-12-13**], when MTX was subsequently stopped to allow healing of a right palate ulcer, arising with a neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter and brought on by burning his palate with hot coffee.
MTX was resumed on [**2108-1-28**] with stabilization or regression of lesion on the following dosing schedule, which was less than his prior dosing schedule of 3 + 3 + 2: On Sundays, 5 mg at 8 a.m. + 5 mg at 8 p.m. + 5 mg at 8 a.m. the following day.Skin lesions improved markedly.
Due to leukocytopenia and neutropenia, MTX was held and subsequently lowered to a daily dose of 2 + 2 + 1 and 2 + 1 + 1.
On lower-doses of MTX, skin lesions recrudesced.
(9) On [**2108-4-25**], began pralatrexate 30 mg/m2 with vitamin B12 1,000 micrograms IM every 7 weeks and folate 1 mg daily.
Due to mucositis and neutropenia after a single dose, second dose reduced by 50%.
(10) On [**2108-6-13**], began cycle 1 pentostatin with doses administered on day 1, 8 and 15.
(11) On [**2108-7-11**], resumed pralatrexate at a reduced dose of 15 mg/m2 weekly.
On the reduced dose of pralatrexate, skin lesions on torso and head became worse.
(12) On [**2108-9-11**], began gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 weekly days 1,8,15 of a 28 day cycle with response.
He remained on gemcitibine with improvement in  his skin till he departed for [**State 108**] in late [**2109-1-12**].
Last  dose of gemcitabine administered on [**2109-2-6**].
No chemotherapy was administered during his [**State 108**] stay.
