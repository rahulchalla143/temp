The patient  was treated with two cycles of DVD (Doxil, vincristine, Decadron) in 2/[**2164**].
Status post 2 cycles of Velcade and Decadron in [**6-/2164**], status post one month of thalidomide, status post 3 cycles of Cytoxan and status post 3 cycles of D-Pace (Decadron, Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Cytoxan, and Etoposide).
Status post another cycle of high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization in [**1-/2165**], status post high-dose melphalan with stem cell rescue in [**2-/2165**], status post 3 vaccinations with the dendritic cell vaccine study on protocol 04-098 in 5/[**2165**].
The patient is status post 3 cycles Revlimid and Decadron alone (Took 25mg po daily x 21 days of Revlimid with these cycles).
Pt is s/p 8 cycles of Velcade, Decadron, and Revlimid (Velcade was held for part of cycle 7 and cycle 8).
S/P 2 more cycles of Revlimid at 25mg po daily and Decadron alone [**11-10**].
He has been admitted to have a cord blood transplant with 2-/46 cord matches.
He does note some diarrhea the day before yesterday which he attributes to eating some pork, but this responded to Immodium and has since resolved over the past day or so.

Marked iron deposition in Kupffer cells and mild to moderate iron within hepatocytes on special stain; focal associated hepatocyte necrosis seen.
Clinical: "55 year old male, day 97 status post cord transplant for multiple myeloma with recurrent diarrhea and now rapidly rising LFTs.
[**2167-4-21**] MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: Please evaluate for evidence of infection vs GVHD Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with MM day +96 s/p cord transplant now with rising LFTs, bilirubin 3.7.
INDICATION: Multiple myeloma, status post transplant with rising LFTs and bilirubin.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the abdomen were obtained on a 1.5 Tesla magnet utilizing a breath-hold independent technique including dynamic sequential images obtained prior to, during, and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA (17 cc).
MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Study is limited due to the patient's inability to hold his breath.
Erythrocytes show anisopoikilocytosis with occasional burr cells, dacrocytes, microcytes, rare target cells, and scattered schistocytes (2/HPF).
Erythroid precursors appear relatively increased (although.
Numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages, including few with ingested cellular debris are noted.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is suboptimal for evaluation and consists of a fragmented core measuring up to 0.7 cm in length and is comprised of periosteum, hypocellular subcortical bone, and a small amount of detached marrow.
CD42 stain for megakaryocytes shows no staining.
Repeat EGD or enteroscopy   Brief Hospital Course: HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Pt was transferred to the ICU in the setting of hypoxia s/p cord blood transplant.
Sputum cultures grew group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus and pt was started on cefepime, which was later broadened to include ciprofloxacin and vancomycin given pt's persistent fevers.
For pt's likely DAH, platelets and PRBC were transfused to goals.
# Thrombocytopenia: Pt's persistent thrombocytopenia was considered likely [**3-7**] to DIC v anti-platelet Ab v HLA-antibody v cyclosporine-induced TTP.
Cyclosporine was discontinued and plasmapheresis was held given ineffectiveness in setting of cyclosporine-related TTP.
Blood bank was consulted and anti-platelet Ab as well as HLA-Ab workup was submitted.
# PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Pt was initially started on dapsone but given his relatively low G6PD levels, was switched to atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
MULTIPLE MYELOMA: The patient received Cytoxan and total body irradiation prior to his cord transplant per protocol.
He suffered a prolonged course awaiting engraftment.
Delays possibly caused by acute illness post transplant given his multifocal pneumonia and his renal failure requiring hemodialysis for a period of time as well as his CMV viremia up to 1100 copies which became undetectable after initiation of treatment with ganciclovir.
ID was consulted, and he was switched to acyclovir for CMV ppx, and his counts continued to slowly decline.
The patient underwent BM biospy on [**3-/2088**] with results demonstrating a markedly hypocellular bone marrow (~10% cellular) with marked megakaryocytic hypoplasia.
The patient continued to require frequent transfusions of PRBC and platelets.
He was started on steroids while the tacrolimus was held.
Eventually when renal function improved, he was restarted on tacrolimus for a goal level of [**6-10**].
Given concern for its contribution to diarrhea and possible microangiopathic angiopathy his tacrolimus was changed to cyclosporin and his dose adjusted for a goal trough of 200.
He was also started on cellcept and dose titrated to 750mg [**Hospital1 **] and was continued on predisone at 30mg daily.
His steroid dose was then uptitrated due to his persistent diarrhea and elevated LFTs related to GVHD.
He was started on etancept on [**4-25**] for steroid refractory GVHD.
During his ICU stay, pt's MM was considered stable and in remission, and pt was continued on mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone.
GVHD: Throughout his hospitalization the patient had recurrent episodes of diarrhea and intermittednt BRBPR.
The patient's diarrhea did not improve with anti-CMV treatment.
His diarrhea initially improved with steroids, but then worsened while on high dose steroids, so it was felt that the diarrhea was not associated with GVHD.
Diarrhea may be exacerbated by his essential medications including CellCept.
He was started on rifaximin per GI for possible bacterial overgrowth however this was discontinued out of concern for its contribution to marrow suppression.
Conservative management with maintaining adequate platelet levels was recommended.
As the patient was being transitioned from tacrolimus to cyclosporin and his steroids were tapered to prednisone from solu-medrol, he developed a bump in his LFTs and recurrent diarrhea with approx.
His cellcept and cyclosporin were increased and he was started on Entocort with subsequent improvement in diarrhea and liver function.
The patient was made NPO except medications and had improvement of his diarrhea with bowel rest and was continued on TPN.
Following the procedure the patient dropped his HCT and was found to have a intraperitoneal hemorrhage related to his liver biopsy site.
He was started on entarcept on [**4-25**] for steroid refractory GVH and in the setting of needing to lower cyclosporin dose with concurrent ganciclovir to avoid further renal toxicity.
Cyclosporine as well as ganciclovir was later discontinued given the development of significant persistent thrombocytopenia.
(Of note, he is H. pylori positive and should pursue treatment as an outpatient.)
The patient was started on ganciclovir, and this was switched to foscarnet with hopes of improving cell counts.
While on this medication, his counts slowly trended down; thus, ID recommended that he switch to acyclovir for CMV prophylaxis.
He continued on acyclovir prophylaxsis with multiple negative viral loads.
He then was found to have a VL on [**4-25**] of 862 and was restarted on ganciclovir.
Ganciclovir was later discontinued given concern for toxicity to platelets.
He was placed on cefepime, vancomycin, and caspofungin for empiric coverage while neutropenic.
The patient was continued on cefepime for this for 7 days after ANC > 500.
His vancomycin was stopped after engraftment.
The patient was continued on caspofungin prophylaxsis.
He was started on empiric levaquin after CXR on [**4-23**] demonstrated question of RLL infiltrate.
His tacrolimus was held until he reached the goal level of between [**6-13**] and stopped altogether when steroid therapy was initiated.
He was initially started on CVVH for volume overload, pulmonary edema and deterioration of respiratory status.
He was transitioned to hemodialysis and began making some urine output.
Renal was consulted again, who felt that etiology of the ARF was due to medications, including tacrolimus and foscarnet.
His Cr improved and remained stable at 1.6-1.8 after discontinuation of tacrolimus and foscarnet.
His medications were reviewed for possible oxidative stressors.
Concern was raised for TTP and cyclosporine was discontinued.
DIABETES: He received HISS and insulin in his TPN.
HYPERTENSION: Pt was started on labetalol and nifedipine while in the hospital, and these medications were titrated to control his blood pressure.
After pt was started on HD, BP was controlled with PRN hydralazine.
