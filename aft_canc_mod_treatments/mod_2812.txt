Admission Date:  [**2140-2-17**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2095-7-18**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Bone marrow transplant  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44 year old male with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive acute lymphocytic leukemia, presents for allo bone marrow transplant protocol.
At that time he also noted decreased vision in his left eye and was diagnosed with possible central vein occlusion.
He was treated with AP0 induction chemotherapy and received 2400 rads of spinal irradiation.
His hospital course following diagnosis was prolonged and he developed adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring two week intubation in the Intensive Care Unit.
He then received a cycle of hyper Cytoxan, Vincristine, Adriamycin and Dexamethasone followed by Gleevec at 400 mg p.o.
He received Vincristine [**2-6**], Cytoxan [**2-7**], and Prednisone for seven days and was continued on Gleevec.
An lumbar puncture on [**2140-2-9**] showed recurrence of leukemia in his cerebrospinal fluid and he has received three doses of Methotrexate, Solu-Medrol, Ara-C intrathecal chemotherapy ([**2-10**], [**2-12**], and [**2-15**]).
He returns for intrathecal chemotherapy and a planned allo bone marrow transplant.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Nexium, Ativan, Gleevec (which has been discontinued), Hydromorphone prn and potassium.
Total protein 5.4, albumin 2.6, calcium 9.1, phosphorus 3.8, magnesium 1.6, uric acid 5.3.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive - The patient received intrathecal Hydrocortisone, Vincristine, and Ara-C, given history of positive cytology from cerebrospinal fluid on [**2140-2-17**] and [**2140-2-23**].
Although the patient has evidence of persistent leukemia in his central nervous system, it is hoped that the allo bone marrow transplant will induce a graft for his leukemia response that will eliminate residual disease.
Initiation of bone marrow transplant protocol was initially held due to elevated liver enzymes.
At the time of dictation the patient is currently on day +3 of Cytoxan, Busulfan, Etoposide transplant protocol.
The patient's bone marrow infusion was delayed from the planned day of [**2140-3-1**] to allow time for clearance of cyclophosphamide.
The patient received his infusion on [**2140-3-2**] which he tolerated without complications.
The patient received his first dose of Methotrexate on [**2140-3-3**].
The patient was started on Cyclosporin drip per protocol and levels monitored and adjusted to goal Cyclosporin level of 500.
Febrile neutropenia - The patient had fever to 101 on [**2140-2-27**] at which time he was started on Cefepime and Vancomycin for febrile neutropenia.
The patient responded well to normal saline boluses, and since that time the patient's heart rate and blood pressure have remained stable.
Given that the patient remained afebrile with a stable blood pressure his antibiotics were discontinued on [**2140-2-29**].
At that time he was started on Cefepime.
Vancomycin was added on [**3-3**] for persistent fever and Ambazone was added on [**2140-3-4**] for a persistent fever in the setting of Grade 4 mucositis.
In order to allow improved control of anaerobe the patient was started on Flagyl on [**2140-3-5**].
He was started on Acyclovir orally initially which was changed to topical Acyclovir while he was receiving his chemotherapy.
The patient has required a Dilaudid PCA for pain controls.
Hydrocortisone was added given concern that a history of head radiation in [**2139-10-7**] may be contributing to mouth inflammation.
Possible causes include medication-related (although the patient was on new medication), leukemia, viral hepatitis, liver or gallbladder pathology.
The patient received three days of Leucovorin given the concern for intrathecal Methotrexate toxicity.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition on [**2140-3-3**] given poor p.o.
Access - Surgery placed a right triple lumen catheter on [**2140-2-17**].
On [**2140-2-18**], Surgery repositioned the catheter as it was curled as a chest x-ray had shown that it was improperly positioned.
The patient had a left Hickman catheter at the time of admission.
