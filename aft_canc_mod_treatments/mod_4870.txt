He was continued on ambisome w plans to continue w monitoring MRIs to document resolution.
He will continue ambisome at home w infusion services.
Was found to have cord match after siblings refused to be biopsied because of religous reasons, underwent cord BMT on [**2137-6-24**].
He was started on tacrolimus and MMF.
Prophylaxis was acyclovir, atovaquone and he was continued on ambisome for mucor infection.
He was advised to continue eating soft foods and chewing carefully.
After transplant posaconazole was restarted and his LFTs slowly uptrended as well.
These downtrended with discontinuation of meropenem, vancomycin and posaconazole.
# Respiratory status: Pt arrived to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] intubated with [**Last Name (un) **]-tracheal tube from the OR on propofol sedation.
He was started on methylprednisolone in anticipation of trial extubation pending hemostasis of ENT surgical site.
Pt was extubated sucessfully on [**2137-5-15**] and steroids were tapered off on [**2137-5-16**].
He was transfused 3 units of platelets in OR and post-operative platlets >100.
# H/o Peri-rectal Abscess: Drainage in 01/[**2137**].
He was also started on Levophed for pressure support.
MICU [**Location (un) **] [**5-24**]- [**6-3**]: Pt had lingual artery embolized and maintained on intubation with oropharynx packed.
He required intermittent PRBC and platlet transfusion throughout course.
He was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics acyclovir, ambisome, meropenem and vancomycin.
Zosyn was discontinued early in MICU course for a question of allergic reaction of erythematous [**Doctor Last Name **], blanching skin rash.
He is on ambisome 10mg/kg maximal dose since [**5-22**].
# NEUTROPENIC FEVER:  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever, though temps continue to run in 99s.
We started broad spectrum antibiotics with meropenem/vanc/ambisone, acyclovir.
Cord blood is available for transplant, though patient needs further stabilization and control of mucor/neutropenic fever first.
