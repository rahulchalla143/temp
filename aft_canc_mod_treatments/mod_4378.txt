NG tube ending at the GE junction with the side port in the mid-to-distal esophagus.
EGD [**2199-3-19**]: Impression: Esophagitis at the GE junction Gastritis with edema and thickened gastric folds suggesting extrinsic compression but cannot exclude tumor infiltration (biopsy) Duodenitis of the bulb and 2nd part of the duodenum Deformity due to extrinsic compression of the duodenal bulb and second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms Await pathology results Extrinsic compression at the duodenum is not amenable to duodenal stenting Further management per inpatient team   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo M with Stage IV Gallbladder CA diagnosed in [**1-10**] most recently treated with FOLFIRI (cycle 4 on [**2199-2-13**]) who presented to ED with fever to 103, weakness, and hypotension .
He was treated with IV fluid boluses and pressors were not requried.
Patient was treated empirically with meropenem and vancomycin for presumed intrabdominal source of infection related to bacterial translocation from small bowel obsruction.
Patient started on cipro for a 14 day total course.
A nasogastric tube was placed with large volume of bileous fluid returned and improvement in symptoms.
General surgery was consulted to place a venting gastric tube.
He was identified as high risk for surgical intervention given comorbid metastatic gall bladder cancer and the location of the transition point close to the stomach limiting surgical approach.
Gastroenterology was consulted to place a duodenal stent however SMA syndrome is an absolute contrindication to duodenal stent placement.
He was seen by GI after he was transferred to the oncology medicine floor, and an EGD was done on [**3-19**] which showed he was not a duodenal stent candidate.
He was sent home on hospice with an NGT, with a suction device and VNA bridge to hospice for management.
Because of NGT, patient is unable to take pills, so his medications were transitioned to liquid or dissolving at dispo.
Elevated LFTs are attributed to impaired drainage from biliary stent and progression of gall bladder cancer.
