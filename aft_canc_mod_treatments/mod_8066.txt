A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A WallFlex TM biliary RX uncovered 8 mm x 80 mm stent (REF: 7062, LOT: [**Numeric Identifier 93920**]) was placed successfully.
The pancratic stent was removed after placement of the metal stent.
The patient was treated with bowel rest and IV fluids, and his diet was advanced prior to discharge on [**2167-1-22**].
Hospital course was also notable for new diagnosis of bilateral DVTs for which patient was started on lovenox treatment.
Patient was started on vanco/cefepime for presumed HCAP.
LIJ was placed for fluid resuscitation.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient complained of heartburn and abdominal bloating.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY - [**2158**] - cystoprostatectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7391**] revealed bladder TCC invading the lamina propria involving intravesicular portion of the left ureter - [**2165**] - resection for local recurrence.
- [**2166-12-30**] - CT-guided liver biopsy carcinoma with clear cell features diffusely positive for cytokeratin cocktail and cytokeratin 7 and negative for Hep Par 1 packs 2 TTF-1, cytokeratin 20 and P63 most compatible with a tumor of biliary pancreatic or upper gastrointestinal origin - [**2167-1-5**] - KUB partial small-bowel obstruction - [**2167-1-9**] - Gemzar/cisplatin started - [**2167-1-20**] - Presentation w abd pain and elevated bilirubin, ERCP w 12mm long segment of severe narrowing, sphincterotomy and placement of WallFlex TM biliary RX uncovered stent .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY - Metastatic gallbladder cancer - Recurrent bladder CA s/p primary resection ([**2159**]), penile/urethral metastatsis resection ([**2165**]) - HTN - HLD - LVH w mild LVOT obstruction and mildly dilated thoracic aorta - h/o cystectomy - h/o resection penile recurrence  Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 86**].
Lack of air within the biliary stent and left lobe of liver suggests stent occlusion.
Interval improvement in the previously noted left hydroureteronephrosis in this patient status post urinary diversion and ileal conduit.
[**2167-1-24**] DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL POR AND LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US - Please note, patient had difficulty remaining in left lateral decubitus after obtaining only sagittal images, at which point the decision was made to transfer to the right lateral decubitus position.
The left kidney measures 10 cm.
Patient is status post urinary diversion and ileal conduit.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 75M with PMH significant for metastatic gallbladder carcinoma, bladder carcinoma (s/p primary resection with ileal conduit formation), hypertension and hyperlipidemia with recent hospitalization for ERCP in the setting of biliary stricture with metal stent deployment complicated by post-procedural pancreatitis and evidence of DVTs who now presents with nausea, emesis and hypotension concerning for septic shock requiring pressor support with evolving pneumonia, acute renal insufficiency and hyperbilirubinemia.
Given worsening clinical status despite aggressive resuscitation and pressors, patient was transitioned to comfort measures only and expired on [**2167-1-27**].
# ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Following volume resuscitation needs given his septic shock, the patient developed worsening respiratory concerns and hypoxia with an increased oxygen requirement.
Patient was empirically antibiosed with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Zosyn.
Lactate 5.1 on admission, trending downward with IV fluid resuscitation.
Following aggressive volume resuscitation, his hypotension and tachycardia improved and his pressor support was weaned.
His serial lactate and central venous oxygen saturations improved with broad spectrum antibiotics - Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Zosyn (started [**2167-1-24**]).
ACS surgery had been consulted given his evidence of delayed emptying and possible gastric obstruction with known biliary obstruction and felt no surgical intervention was feasible.
They recommended palliation with possible duodental stent placement in discussion with the gastroenterology team based on his imaging findings.
Given his overall poor prognosis, the family opted to enagage comfort measures only and a Dilaudid infusion was started.
Evidence of tumor causing obstruction without definable surgical options - would likely require palliative stenting.
ACS surgery had been consulted given his evidence of delayed emptying and possible gastric obstruction with known biliary obstruction and felt no surgical intervention was feasible.
Given his overall poor prognosis, the family opted to enagage comfort measures only and a Dilaudid infusion was started.
This likely represents poor forward flow and hypoperfusion with pre-renal azotemia in the setting of vasodilation and sepsis physiology generating hypotension.
Following fluid resuscitation, his creatinine continued to worsen.
Bladder carcinoma treated with primary resection and cystectomy with ileal conduit.
Heparin gtt started this admission (switched from Lovenox given renal dysfunction).
He was maintained on a heparin gtt until comfort measures were established.
