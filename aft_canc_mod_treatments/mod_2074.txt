He ruled out for a myocardial infarction at the outside hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for elective cardiac catheterization which showed a left main stenosis of 70 percent, a left circumflex stenosis of 90 to 99 percent, and a RCA stenosis of 90 percent at that time and was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Norvasc 5 mg once daily, atenolol 25 mg once daily, Imdur 30 mg once daily, Neurontin 900 mg once daily, allopurinol 300 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, doxazosin 4 mg once daily, Alphagan eye drops 0.15 percent 1 drop right eye twice daily, Timolol 0.5 percent 1 drop right eye in the morning, and aspirin 81 mg once daily.
He was worked up for coronary artery bypass grafting.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with a LIMA to the LAD, a saphenous vein graft to the ramus, a saphenous vein graft to the PL, and a saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
He also received multiple blood products in the Operating Room.
He was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Room on the evening of [**2-12**], A-paced at a rate of 70 on a Neo-Synephrine drip.
Therefore, a left posterior chest tube was placed with a fair amount of sanguineous drainage removed.
On postoperative day two, his respiratory status improved but he still required ventilatory support and was not extubated.
On postoperative day three, Mr. [**Known lastname 41554**] respiratory status improved; however, thick green sputum was suctioned from his endotracheal tube and sent for cultures.
His chest tube drainage significantly decreased, and all of his chest tubes were also removed.
On the evening between postoperative days three and four, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] had some atrial fibrillation for which he was started on amiodarone and beta blockade; which he subsequently converted to a normal sinus rhythm.
Also on postoperative day four, he was found to be recovering well and safe for transfer to the inpatient floor for further recovery and rehabilitation.
On postoperative day five, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] had additional bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation; treated with intravenous Lopressor as well as his oral amiodarone and Lopressor doses.
It was decided that he should be anticoagulated and was started on a heparin drip and oral Coumadin.
His cardiac pacing wires were also removed on postoperative day five.
On postoperative day six, he was noted to have some serous sternal drainage treated with Betadine swabs and dry sterile dressing.
On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] was noted to have a continued scant amount of serous drainage from his sternal incision.
He had an elevated white count up to 33, and he was therefore started on vancomycin intravenously, and a PICC line was placed for potential long-term antibiotic administration.
On postoperative day nine, Mr. [**Known lastname 41554**] INR was elevated to 1.9; at which time his heparin drip was discontinued and he continued on his oral Coumadin.
His sternal drainage on postoperative days nine and ten was also noted to be significantly decreased.
It was decided that he would continue on the vancomycin.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] was followed by Physical Therapy throughout his hospital course, and it was decided that he was not safe for home and should continue with physical therapy and rehabilitation at a rehabilitation facility.
He will be discharged to rehabilitation on [**2176-2-23**].
