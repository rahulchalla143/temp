Background interstitial lung disease compatible with NSIP and emphysema, with continued increase in areas of ground-glass attenuation and  peribronchovascular airspace opacification and consolidation, which is most notable in the left upper lobe as well as the lower lobes.
Note is made of a right PICC with tip terminating at the junction of the right axillary and subclavian veins.
Aspergillus galactomannan and B-glucan tests were negative.
He was started on steroids and antibiotics (vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime).
On [**10-15**], a meeting was held during which the patient became DNR/DNI and focus was shifted to the patient's comfort, with IV morphine and pleasure feeds.
The dyspnea was ultimately felt to be multi-factorial, including worsening nonspecific interstial pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, progression of lung cancer, or infection.
He was continued on high flow oxygen with face tent and nasal cannula with goals of O2Sat 89-92%.
On the floor his respiratory status was stable, alternating between an open face mask and non-rebreather mask.
He received good relief of his dyspnea with regular doses of IV morphine.
He lost his last remaining peripheral IV on [**10-18**], and was subsequently written for sublingual morphine concentrate.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was tolerating 5 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula at the time of discharge.

# COPD: Was recently on 2 L NC at home due to increased dyspnea, received albuterol and ipratropium nebs and IV steroids during course, as described above.
# Neuropathy/Back pain/tooth pain: The patient received morphine, acetaminophen, fentanyl and viscous lidocaine.
# FEN: no IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO except meds # PPX: home PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen # ACCESS: PIV # CODE: FULL (confirmed with pt) # CONTACT: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15014**] # DISPO: ICU  Medications on Admission: Gabapentin 300 mg three times a day.
