Admission Date:  [**2108-7-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2108-8-5**]   Service:  This is an 80 year-old female with multiple complex medical problems who presented with metastatic gastric cancer, status post Ziloda and Aronest due the Friday following admission on [**2108-7-17**].
Also planned for the Thursday following admission is a ureteral right stent for hydronephrosis.
She had a left stent placed one months prior to this admission due to external compression for lymphadenopathy and radiation in the past.
In preparation for this procedure she was off her normal 81 mg of aspirin per day.
She got 10 mg of diltiazem and she got fluids in the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Metastatic cancer from gastroesophageal junction diagnosed [**7-/2107**], locally advanced, status post three months of Ziloda, biweekly Aronest injections, weekly Taxol cycle 3.
2) External compression of ureters bilaterally, status post lateral stent with right hydronephrosis awaiting stent.
Has been on phenobarb for atrial fibrillation times one year refractory to cardioversion and cannot anticoagulate.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital 30 mg q.h.s., Fentanyl 25 mcg q 72 hours, aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor 40 mg q.d., metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d., multivitamin, Milontin 50 mcg q.d., Prozac.
Patient was then initiated on diltiazem for rate control.
During this time patient went for her right ureteral stent placement by interventional radiology, at which point the first two attempts failed.
Patient remained stable both hemodynamically and hematocrit-wise, and then was transferred to the oncology service for further management.
While on the floor patient was again in atrial fibrillation, though she was continued on her diltiazem, and then Digoxin was added at the request of her primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Once transferred to the Oncology Service, patient went for a third attempt at a right percutaneous nephrostomy placement.
This was done successfully, but the day following the procedure the patient was noted to be hypotensive in the 70s though mentating.
While in the Intensive Care Unit,, patient was transferred two units of blood and 10 liters of colloid.
Interventional Radiology and urology determined that it would not be wise to go in for another procedure but to just monitor the patient.
Patient  continued to have occasional hematocrit drops though nothing acute.
There was no evidence of active bleeding, but a thin walled arteriovenous malformation was noted, though to prevent further rupture, it was determined that Interventional radiology would embolize it.
Of note, while the patient was here, initial urinalysis was positive for E. Coli which she was treated for a full course of ciprofloxacin for ten days.
Follow up urinalysis showed no bacteria but did have 10,000 to 100,000 yeast, though she was treated with Diflucan.
From her oncology standpoint chemotherapy was not initiated during this stay while acute issues were flaring.
Her hypothyroidism was not an active issue and she was maintained on her Synthroid.
Coronary artery disease:  She was continued on her Lipitor, but her aspirin was held due to the bleeding and the multiple interventions.
We will continue to hold the aspirin at her discharge due to the planned nephrogram and potential internalization of the nephrostomy.
Hydronephrosis of right, status post multiple percutaneous nephrostomy attempts.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
