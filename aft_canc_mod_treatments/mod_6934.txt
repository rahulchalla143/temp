Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer, hypothyroidism, and diastolic CHF, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2168**] s/p fall and with concern for C1 and C7 fractures, who now presents from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypoxia and evidence of R-sided pleural effusion on CXR now s/p thoracentisis with possible HCAP.
Thoracentesis was performed at bedside with drainage of 1.5L of fluid with negative gram stain, exudative chemistry, and lymphocyte predominance with cytology pending at the time of discharge though overall felt to be c/w prior malignant pleural effusion.
After discussion with [**Female First Name (un) **], his daughter/HCP, the decision was made not to escalate care and to avoid invasive procedures such as PICC placement for IV antibiotics or initiation of pressors.
As his blood, urine, and sputum studies were negative, and pulmonary was the only organ system that could possibly be involved, he was discharged with four more days of PO levaquin to finish an 8 day course.
The plan was to forego further thoracentesis in the future if and when these effusions recur and to instead treat them symptomatically with diuretics and opiates.
He was administered albumin following his thoracentesis with improvement in his pressures.
As the patient is a chronic prednisone patient an AM cortisol was checked and 15 and he was continued on his 5mg prednisone daily.
# Goals of Care: The patient and his HCP/daughter expressed their desire not to escalate care with invasive procedures such as central lines, picc lines, or pressors as patient is in the process of transitioning to hospice.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: ================== #) DIASTOLIC CHF:  The patient was diagnosed from an ECHO in [**2163**], but also had an ECHO at DCFI for concern that his chemotherapy regimen was causing cardiomyopathy, however there was no evidence of cardiomyopathy and his EF was > 50%.
Furosemide was held for hypotension while in the MICU, and restarted at discharge when his pressures could tolerate it for symptomatic management of his effusions.
He has been off chemotherapy since [**3-28**] with no plans to resume.
He is on prednisone as per his oncologist's recommendations for appetite and bony pain.
Trazodone was added to his current regimen of oxycodone and mirtazapine.
#) HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued home Levoxyl 100mg PO daily.
