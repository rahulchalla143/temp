Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) s/p sternotomy, exploration, biopsy, 2) s/p drainage of L pleural/pericardial effusion, 3) s/p bx mediastinal nodes, 4) s/p partial pericardectomy 5) s/p tube thoracostomy (removed [**6-3**])   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an unfortunate 56-year-old woman with a prior 40 pack-year smoking history who quit several years ago and earlier this year was found to have a squamous carcinoma arising from the left lower lobe of the lung invading the left main bronchus and resulting in left main bronchial occlusion.
There was no evidence for remote metastatic disease and she underwent mediastinoscopy at an outside institution that showed no metastatic mediastinal nodes.
We reevaluated her with cardiac MR imaging and felt that if the tumor was confined to the atrium and did not involve the ventricle or the mitral annulus that we could consider a high- risk resection with left atrial reconstruction.
Past Medical History: HTN, ^chol, SCC lung carcinoma, s/p mediastinoscopy ([**Hospital1 112**])  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2174-6-3**] IMPRESSION: Large extracardiac mass invading through the left atrial wall with possible involvement of the basal inferolateral left ventricle.
A right IJ venous catheter has been removed.
The following surgical procedure was performed: Bronchoscopy, Exploratory sternotomy with biopsy of anterior  mediastinal lymph node, drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions and subtotal pericardiectomy.
She was tacycardiac and remained hemodynamically stable-betablockers were initiated and was transffered from the ICU.
She progressed well post operatively except for elevation of her BUN/Creat which responded well to hydration.
Her pain was controlled intially on PCA which was weaned to po pain med w/ good effect.
Her oxygen requirement decreased but ambukatory saturations were 87% and therefore she was maintained on 2 liters nasal prongs at time of discharge.
She did rec IV lasix for generalized lower extremity edema with good effect and miantained a stable BUN/Creat.
She was d/c'd on one week of po lasix w/ potassium supplementation.
