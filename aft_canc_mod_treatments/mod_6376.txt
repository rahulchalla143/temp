Transferred from CT surgery to OMED for XRT with goal for possible stenting of RML, RLL bronchus.

This effusion was originally drained at her OSH prior to transfer, once tranferred she underwent left and sub-xiphoid pericardial windows placed with cardiac surgery.
Transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and management on [**4-12**].
She was evaluated by cardiac and thoracic surgery as well as interventional cardiology.
