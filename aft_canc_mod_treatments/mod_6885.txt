This was debrided using both cryotherapy as well as mechanical debridement.
She had been hemoptysis free for 2 months at most after this procedure but reported hemoptysis restarting with her chemotherapy regimen.
She had been receiving chemotherapy q 3 weeks with Flourouricil through mid-[**Month (only) 958**].
In the IR suite, initial access through right groin was difficult due to bad atherosclerotic disease, so access was re-tried through left groin.
This was also difficult but catheter was able to be passed with successful embolization.
She did have a L groin hematoma extending over abdomen as access was slightly higher than ideal but pt remained HD stable.
She was transferred to the floor with plan for OR on [**4-23**] for rigid bronchoscopy and electric cautery by IP.
In the OR today, patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement after embolization yesterday.
She received argon thereapy for several seconds, but this was discontinued when bubbles were seen on TEE in the left atrium with positive pressure ventilation.
After this ST depressions over 2 mm were noticed on telemetry for approximately 20 minutes, so she was started on a Nitro drip for presumed NSTEMI, running at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
She was received one dose of Epinephrine 150 mcg x1, and was started on Phenylephrine drip at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.
She also received 2 30 mg IV boluses of esmolol and 2 2mg IV boluses of Metoprolol.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung could be edema, since the pulmonary vasculature in the right lung is congested, but I am concerned about disseminated tumor with lymphangitic extension.
Infusion port ends in the upper SVC.
Wall motion improved with resuscitation using epinephrine and phenylephrine.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old female with metastatic colon cancer with ongoing hemoptysis, evidence of left mainstem bronchus necrotic lesion on bronch, now s/p IR embolization and rigid bronch with Argon therapy leading to left-sided bubbles on TEE, now transferred to MICU for concern of NSTEMI and CVA.
# ST depressions: STDs noted on tele peri-bronchoscopy, but 12 lead EKG reassuring.
Continued on beta blocker.
# Hypoxia: Downtitrated oxygen as tolerated.
Likely due to recent procedure and poor ventilation.
# Hemoptysis: Left mainstem bronchus necrotic lesion likely representating metastatic disease, s/p IR embolization and rigid bronch with argon therapy.
Continued on advair and nebulizers as needed.
# DM: Blood sugars controlled with a humalog sliding scale.
