Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 78M with stage IV NSLC who presents with fevers from his rehab facility.
He was briefly on levophed and was taken off of pressors when SBP 100s-110s.
His hypotension was probably due to hypovolemia from diuresis but severe hypotension in setting of developing sepsis was also considered.
On the floors, his SBP's ranged in the 130's to 140's and he was restarted on his home doses of LASIX WAS HELD FOR THE SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE BECAUSE HE WAS AUTODIURESING.
HE WILL LIKELY NEED HIS LASIX RESTARTED AT SOME POINT AT REHAB.
* Fever: Patient's fever likely caused by C diff as patient is toxin positive, although aspiration pneumonia was also considered a possibility given evidence of dysphagia on prior video swallow.
His C difficile colitis was originally treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
Prior to discharge, as diarrhea began to resolve, he was switched to PO flagyl alone, to be continued for a two week course (until [**2118-8-12**]).
* L leg swelling and pain: Patient had lower extremity pain edema greater on left than right after receiving fluid resuscitation in the ICU.
He was diuresed with lasix until his fluid output was negative.
He was autodiuresing on discharge so his lasix was held.
* Hyponatremia: Patient's hyponatremia resolved after intravenous fluids, which supports hypovolemia as cause on admission.
* NSCLC: Advanced disease, on palliative chemotherapy.
Erlotinib will be restarted on [**2118-8-19**] and should be taked every other day.
He also had an elevated INR despite not being on anticoagulation which possibly could be due to malnutrition.
INR improved after administration of one dose of vitamin K.  # Oral thrush: Patient failed nystatin swish and swallow.
#Pain control: Patient was maintained on methadone and diluadid PRN during hospitalization.
His methadone should be tapered and pain reassessed daily while in rehab.
