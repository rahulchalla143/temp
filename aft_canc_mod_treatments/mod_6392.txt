He was also hypotensive, requiring a central venous line, levophed, and 6L of IV fluids.
After his admission to the MICU, he was ultimately placed on vancomycin, clindamycin, and azithromycin.
His medication choices were limited secondary to his reported allergies.
Also, the patient's antibiotic regimen was narrowed down to just clindamycin.
He was called out of the MICU to the medicine service, where treatment of his RLL aspiration and adrenal insufficiency continued.
He was weaned off oxygen and his ambulatory sats on discharge were normal.
He was treated with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers as well.
He was started on Augmentin 875mg PO BID.

# Adrenal Insufficiency - Both the patient and his family stated that he regularly takes 7mg prednisone daily for both his polymyalgia rheumatica and for primary adrenal insufficiency.
The MICU decided to treat him with stress dose steroids with the plan to taper him quickly back to his home dose.
Following transfer to the floor, pulse steroids were discontinued, and the patient was transitioned to oral prednisone 20 mg daily.
He was then placed on a prednisone taper per endocrine reccs: 20mg x 7 days ( on day [**4-24**]), then 15mg x7 days -> 10mg x 7 days -> back to baseline at 7mg.
Patient doing well, BP WNL, asymptomatic.

Because he had had some chest pain, it was decided to increase his aspirin dose while he was ruling out.
However, it was not felt necessary to treat him with heparin for ACS.
The patient's antihypertensive and afterload-reducing medications were held while he was pressor-dependent.
It was determined that he did not need any cardiac intervention at this point.
Nitro SL x3 with good result.
EKG done x 2 showed patient on A-flutter conduction rate 3:1, HR remained in 70s.
