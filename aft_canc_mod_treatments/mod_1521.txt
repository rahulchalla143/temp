Visiting nurse came to see him for transitional issues, and patient found he needed help just to get up out of bed.
Patient also with urinary retention on admission (no recent problems, per patient) and foley was placed, relieving patient of blood-tinged urine x600cc.
Labs were notable for anemia (explained as chronic) with crit in the low 20s and leukocytosis of 17,000, but without any evidence of ongoing blood loss.
For likely UTI, levofloxacin 250 mg daily was started.
Patient also had RIJ placed and received total of 5L NS.
Neosynephrine was started as well by a house officer on the night before transfer, and BPs were stable at > 100 (baseline in 90s).
Repeat CXR after fluids did not show any volume overload.
Creatinine improved with aggressive hydration.

# Septic shock/Urosepsis: The patient presented from [**Hospital1 **] with evidence of sepsis from a urinary source requiring phenylephrine support.
Weaning the patient from phenylephrine was initially difficult.
Due to his persistent pressor requriement and persistent leukocytosis, his antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and cefepime.
He was given numerous IVF boluses for blood pressure support to baseline sbps in 90s, and his phenylephrine dose was eventually weaned.
In the ICU, patient received additional fluid resuscitation.
Given thrombocytemia, patient's vancomycin was discontinued.
*Urine cultures originally grew Corynebacteria for which pt took Cefepime for 10 days, completing a full course.
There was concern for recurrent UTI as pt started have symptoms of dilirium and pt was restarted on antibiotics, Ceftriaxone.
ID followed pt and after two days of Ceftriaxone, antibiotic was discontinued given pt's rise in creatinine to 2.0 and conern for AIN.
Renal was consulted and recommended a renal ultrasound, Urine eos, and urine electrolytes.
Pt's Urine eos were positive therefore Ceftriaxone for recurrent UTIs was discontinued.
Patient and his daughter understand his poor prognosis from his malignancy and would like to avoid aggressive treatment and focus on pain control and symptom management.
The differential for his dilirium includes infection (ie possible given pt's refractory fevers, leukocytosis, and recurrent UTIs) or overmedication with narcotics (very possible as well given pt's pain regimen in hospital was increased).
Heparin dependent antibodies were sent, which returned strongly positive.
When patient returned to ICU, patient's digoxin dose was increased to 0.25 and he remained hemodynamically stable.
Metoprolol was restarted at low dose on [**9-29**].
# CHF: Because of history of CHF, fluid resuscitation was performed judiciously.
Patient received 5 mg vitamin K PO and coagulopathy resolved.
Patient and his daughter elected not to have further aggressive treatment or work-up.
