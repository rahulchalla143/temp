An x-ray of her back was taken and she was told she had a "pinched nerve" for which she was treated with one week of a prednisone taper and vicodin with good improvement.
Heme/onc was consulted who felt that initiating treatment for myelodysplasia was not warranted.
She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension with intermittent fluid boluses to maintain BPs.
ID was concerned for strep pharyngitis and recommended ceftriaxone (discouraged vanc/cefepime as these could worsen pancytopenia).
She was given a dose of amphotericin that caused rigors and tachycardia.
She was then placed on trial of IV solumedrol 80mg TID and fevers defervesced.
ID had recommended that steroids be discontinued on transfer and amphotericin resumed (150mg daily).
She was also given a dose of lasix for volume overload prior to transfer.
Denies visual changes, headache, dizziness, sinus tenderness, neck stiffness, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat or dysphagia.

INPATIENT   Brief Hospital Course: 82-year-old Spanish-speaking female with hx of ulcerative colitis in remission s/p colectomy being transferred from OSH for hypoxemic respiratory failure in setting of new diagnosis of myelodysplasia and pancytopenia.
She was treated empirically for HCAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
Also continued on ambisome per ID recs due to reports of positive histoplasmosis antigen from OSH.
She was diuresed with IV lasix approximately 4L prior to transfer to the floor.
She was electively intubated for bronchoscopy on [**9-13**], and was successfull extubated the following day.
On [**9-18**], the again began to experience respiratory distress associated with borderline BP and a 10 point decrease in her hematocrit.
She was again transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.
On day of discharge, the patient's respiratory status was stable, requiring supplemental oxygen after exertion.
# Fever: She had persistent fevers at OSH despite being on ceftriaxone and then amphotericin/itraconazole.
Urine was weakly positive for histoplasma antigen at OSH, and she was started on amphotericin.
Otherwise blood, urine, and BAL cultures were unremarkable, including repeat urine culture.
Histoplasma and autoimmune serologies are negative.
Spiked spontaneously on one evening, and initially the chest x-ray was concerning for LUL pneumonia, and the patient was started on vancomycin/zosyn for treatment of ventilator acquired PNA.
The patient was discharged on the remainder of a 3 day course of levaquin and voriconazole which she was to continue until final results of the histo PCR were complete.
Heme/onc was consulted who reviewed outside smear, and recommended repeating smear with cultures performed.
Patient also received a unit of RBCs while on the floor and also while in the unit (2 units total).
The patient will need follow-up on an outpatient basis for monitoring, transufions of blood products as well as for treatment of underlying MDS.
Continue home loperamide as needed for diarrhea upon discharge from the hospital.
The patient was not started on anticoagulation given her thrombocytopenia.
Continue on Voriconazole as ordered until we receive final results of the histoplasmosis PCR, which we expect will be by Wednesday, [**9-27**].
Continue the levofloxacin for one more day, to end on Wednesday, [**9-27**].

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 56872**],  It was a pleasure taking care of your during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
We also determined that you likely have myelodysplastic syndrome, which will require further workup and treatment as an outpatient.
The following changes were made to your medication: ADDED: - Combivent inhaler 1-2 puffs as needed for shortness of breath/wheezing every 4 to 6 hours - Levaquin which you should take for 3 days - Voriconazole, which you should continue until we have final results of your test for histoplasmosis.
You need to have your sutures removed two weeks after the biopsy which was [**9-18**], so the sutures should be removed on or around [**10-1**].
One of your physicians at the facility you are going to can remove them.
