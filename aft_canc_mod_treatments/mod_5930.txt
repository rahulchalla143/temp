Of note, knowing that her abdomen was getting distended and a paracentesis might be needed, patient had stopped her daily warfarin 4 mg 2 days prior to admission.
Her most recent chemotherapy was 6 days PTA with oxaplatin and bevacizumab.
She has also been taking capecitabine for months.
She received a total of 16 mg of IV morphine, also ondansetron, and 5 mg of oral vitamin K. .

Similar to prior episode that required therapeutic paracentesis.
Pt received paracentesos on [**12-17**] with improvment in pain (2L off), and fluid culture was negative to date so no concern for SBP.
Her pain was controlled with ocycontin and PRN oxycodone.
NG tube was placed with improvement of symptoms with decompression.
She was started on vanco and Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage.
Her pain control regimen was escalated to IV morphine.
# Anticoaguluation INR: INR 6.7 on admission, likely from interaction between capecitabine and warfarin (on warfarin for H/O of UE DVT).
The next day, pt was started on lovenox for her DVT history.
Lovenox was d/c in the ICU given elevated INR and concern for bleeding.
NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic medications were avoided.
The decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only and she was placed on a morphine drip.
