On the day prior to admission, he did have abdominal pain on context of too much G tube feeding, but has since resolved.
Of note, for hypotension at home, patient received a 2600 cc bolus by the husband, and pressures did not respond.
(Patient regularly receives fluid boluses at home via port -- further history below).
2L NS were run and patient remained hypotensive although AOx3 and mentating well.
A 4th liter of NS was given.
This current presentation is within a broader history notable for: - Hypotension responsive to fluids for last 3 months ever since completing chemotherapy.
Currently receiving nearly qdaily 1L fluid boluses at home for known hypotension.
Also has come for outpatient visits with oncology for fluid infusion - PEG tube has been troublesome since replacement ~30 days ago.
Husband feels general malaise started ~30 days ago and has worsened since, and that hypotension has become harder to manage in teh last 30 days - Of note, patient recently admitted for opioid withdrawal and detox, and discharged on fentanyl taper with standing clonidine and prn clonazepam.
On transfer from ED, VS were: 99.9 80 102/56 18 98%  Prior to transfer, patient was noted to be resting without complaints, and on levophed at 0.6.
-He was being evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who follows him for his Hodgkin's disease and he [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a PET scan on [**2103-4-16**], on which was seen a marked FDG avidity at the base of the tongue consistent with a primary malignancy and a single right level IIB lymph node with FDG uptake.
Port and PEG placed in [**5-10**] in anticipation of surgical resection and/or chemoradiation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 93766**] [**Last Name (Titles) 93769**] combination chemotherapy with cetuximab and radiation therapy on [**2103-6-4**].

PEG tube without evidence of leakage.

[**2103-9-18**] CXR: FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is obtained.
The tip of a left-sided PICC line is now positioned in the superior SVC after withdrawal from the azygos vein ostium.
IMPRESSION:  Left-sided PICC line in the upper SVC after repositioning.
This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin based on          the detection of inducible resistance .
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

Patient was continued on levophed started in ED and received fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12.
Chemotherapy port was de-accessed because of concern as source of infection.
Patient was continued on linezolid and zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage.
General surgery was consulted for PEG tube issues, and they felt that the PEG tube was intact and unlikely to be a source of infection.
Infectious disease recommended transition to daptomycin for coverage of MRSA, which was started on [**2103-9-10**], particularly given likely prolonged course of antibiotics.
*TTE was performed, and showed no vegetations *TEE was not performed due to recent chemotherapy and radiation for head and neck cancer.
ID recommended 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment with daptomycin due to inability to definitively rule out endocarditis.
*Surveillance blood cultures were sent, with negative cultures x 2 on [**2103-9-12**] *Patient remained hemodynamically stable, and the central line was discontinued on [**2103-9-18**] *PICC line was placed on [**2103-9-18**]  # DECREASED EF: On TTE, patient found to have new wall motion abnormalities suggestive of multivessel CAD.
ECHO revealed LVEF 25-30% with anteroseptal, apical, and inferiolateral hypokinesis.
This is most likely to due to a silent MI at least 1 week prior to admission given half-life of Troponin-T. Cardiology was consulted and recommended coronary catheterization once patient has completed treatment for MRSA bacteremia.
Patient resumed tube feeds and tolerated them well.
Patient's Klonipin was discontinued in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in light of AMS, so tachycardia may represent benzo withdrawal.
Klonipin was restarted with some improvement in tachycardia.
# ANEMIA & THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Thrombocytopenia likely [**3-1**] HIV/immune-mediated picture vs. simply hemodilution (received aggressive fluid bolus at home as well as in hospital).
Came in on fentanyl taper in context of opioid dependency for HNSCC mucositis/pain.
Fentanyl held in context of hypotension.
Continued nystatin but held fluconazole as patient was asymptomatic.
Continued HIV meds ([**Year (4 digits) 93770**], etravirine, raltegravir, ritonavir).
# Hyperlipidemia: Statin at home.
Held clonidine in context of hypotension.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient will need weekly CKs while on daptomycin - Patient will need to follow up with cardiology to schedule cath after finishing antibiotics  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Your port was removed, and you were treated with IV antibiotics, which you will need to continue for another 5 weeks.
You are currently on an antibiotic called daptomycin.
Resume your tube feeds as you were doing at home; please call the Oncology nutrition department to set up a follow-up appointment in 1 month.
Continue your Fentanyl patch taper as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had started in clinic.
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization and we wish you all the best going forward.
