He initially had frequent electrographic seizures without any clinical manifestation.
These were thought to be rigors in the setting of a urinary tract infection, for which he received adequate treatment with IV antibiotics.
Note that he was briefly started on valproic acid, which led to a transaminitis without obvious lesions on RUQ ultrasound.
Aside from the initial hypoglycemia episode, his blood sugars remained on the higher side throughout his hospitalization and finally attained control after initiating scheduled mixed dose insulin on top of the insulin sliding scale.
His metformin can be restarted on discharge at 500mg [**Hospital1 **].

He continues to be on aspirin and plavix for his history of CVA and current cerebrovascular disease (refer to MRA head/neck, carotid U/S).
He needs to return for a polypectomy in the future while off of plavix x 5 days.
