The patient was noted to be on Propofol at the start of the recording which is a likely culprit and, after discontinuation, there was improvement in the degree of slowing; however, the slowing did persist.
She was empirically covered for meningitis with ceftaz, vanc, flagyl(?
recent abd abscesses), and ampicillin for listeria.
She was continued on acyclovir for a question of HSV until her HSV PCR results returned and showed no evidence of HSV.
The patient was initially on IV dilantin and then transitioned to oral.
She had a cardiac cath and with bare-metal stent placed in the  RCA.
An echo down after the procedure showed EF 20% and diffuse severe akinesis with preservation of 2 cm of basal wall motion.
After the RCA stent her enzymes were trended.
Aspirin and plavix were continued and the patient was started on coumadin at discharge for her LV akinesis.
She was started empirically on antibiotics as above.
Her fentanyl patch and percocet were restarted.
The patient's left hand swelled after infiltration of dilantin to the dorsum of hand.
She was evaluated by plastics who recommended elevation and did not feel this represented compartment syndrome.
Even so, she was initially on wide spectrum antibiotics.
Her sugars were managed initially with Q 2 H fingersticks and Insulin sliding scale.
