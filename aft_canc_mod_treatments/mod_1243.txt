Admission Date: [**2189-9-4**]        Discharge Date: [**2189-9-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-4-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:  GYN   This 48 year old nulligravida Cambodian female with menarche age 14 and menses every 25 days lasting 4-5 days, LMP the end of [**2189-5-20**], was admitted on [**2189-9-4**], for a right salpingo-oophorectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.
This had been treated with radiation therapy.
As an adolescent, she underwent an emergency appendectomy in [**Location (un) 6847**].
The surgery was complicated by a probable postoperative abscess which required a second surgery and drainage a short time after the 1st one.
Her menses had been regular up until the time of radiation therapy for her breast cancer this spring.
Because of the DCIS, it was deemed advisable per her breast surgeon and oncologist that she undergo a right oophorectomy and, in addition, because tamoxifen was to be included in her regimen of therapy, a removal of the uterus if possible.
Exploratory surgery was suggested.
She preferred not to have surgery at that time.
Meanwhile, follow-up ultrasound and MRI exams suggested that the earlier exams had been over-read and that what she had was an ovary with a dilated right tube surrounding it, creating the impression of a mass with multiple septa and a solid component to it.
The right tube was dilated and was wrapped around an ostensibly normal ovary.
Cardiovascular surgery was then called to the operating room and this injury was repaired.
The surgery was completed by the GYN/oncology team.
Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy was begun almost immediately after surgery was completed.
She had been placed on anticoagulation prophylactically after surgery.
The dose of anticoagulation was increased.
The patient had been on antibiotics because of the extent of her surgery and the bowel and bladder repairs.
These were discontinued part way through the hospitalization, but once the hematoma was noticed, she was placed on Keflex and ultimately on Levaquin.
