[**6-20**]: Bone marrow pathology: not finalized [**6-21**]: Bone marrow cytogenetics: pending  Microbiology: [**6-20**]: Blood culture pending [**6-20**]: Urine culture negative [**6-21**]: Blood culture pending [**6-22**]: Blood culture pending [**6-23**]: MRSA screen pending  Imaging: TTE [**6-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
CXR [**6-21**] s/p port placement: Interval placement of a right PICC line with the tip in the distal superior vena cava.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal, anterior and apical akinesis.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that 2-4% of cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigen, CD34, and myeloid associated antigens CD33 and CD117.
Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2165-7-18**] SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:      Hypercellular marrow for age bone marrow with megakaryocytosis, myeloid predominance and left shift in myeloid lineage  Note:  The findings are consistent with recovering marrow post chemotherapy.
CD33 staining abundant immature and mature myeloid elements (20%).
Glycophorin A stain highlights abundant collections of erythroid precursors  MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Peripheral Blood Smear:  The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Numerous dysplastic (monolobulated) neutrophils with toxic granulations are present.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a core biopsy specimen that measures 1.5 cm and length and contains periosteum trabecular bone and bone marrow elements.
Bone marrow cellularity is approximately 70%.
Myeloid elements are increased in number and exhibit left-shifted maturation.
Marrow clot section is not submitted.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS------------------- nuc ish(D5S23,D5S721,EGR1)x2,(D7Z1,D7S522)x2, (D20S108x2)[100]  FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal EGR1 FISH finding can result from absence of a 5q deletion, from a 5q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal D7S522 FISH finding can result from the absence of a 7q deletion, from a 7q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Two hybridization signals were observed in 95/100 nuclei examined, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

Admission c/b ICU transfer for afib with RVR in setting of idarubicin treatment and hypotension s/p beta blocker.
He was started on 7+3 induction therapy (cytarabine/idarubicin) on [**6-22**].
Repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2165-7-15**] (report attached).
No source of infection was identified, but because of persistent febrile neutropenia, he was started on cefepime, vancomycin, and micafungin.
As the patient was already broadly covered, his antibiotics were not changed.
His fevers resolved and he remained covered with broad spectrum antibiotics until the end of his hospitalization.
#Atrial Fibrillation:  On [**6-23**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for afib with RVR, possibly secondary to volume overload vs. anthracycline toxicity vs. electrolyte abnormalities, as well as hypotension, which resulted from attempted rate control with beta blocker.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient spontaneously converted back into NSR and was started on oral metoprolol tartrate 25mg PO bid.
He was closely monitored for hemodyamic stability through 4 days of idarubicin administration without cardiac events.
Given risk of anthracyclin cardiac toxicity, cardiology was consulted and felt that chemo was still necessary at this time, although with increased heart risk.
Pt developed chest pain on [**6-21**], with unchanged EKG and troponin that stayed flat at 0.05.
He was fairly aggressively given bicarb [**Doctor First Name **] IVF in preparation for chemo, and did 3rd space some fluid into his lungs but as of [**6-22**] was saturating in high 90's on room air.
He was frequently diuresed throughout the day with IV Lasix 20mg and kept at a fluid balance of -500cc.
During the [**6-25**] transfusion, patient complained of dyspnea after the first unit of pRBCs and was found to have congestion CXR, consistent with either pulmonary edema or TRALI.
He received further transfusions of blood and platelets as required without further event.
[**Last Name (un) **] Endocrine was consulted, and started on RISS and standing lantus, with improvement in blood sugars.
His lantus was downtitrated throughout admission and his ISS was changed to humalog.
Medications on Admission: - lisinopril 20mg PO daily - pravastatin 20mg PO daily (pt does not take this) - erythromycin eye ointment since [**6-18**] for conjunctivitis  Discharge Medications: 1. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

You were started on chemotherapy to treat this leukemia.
When chemotherapy was started, you developed an abnormal heart rhythm.
We started you on treatment for this, but your blood pressure dropped and you were transferred to the ICU.
You completed your chemotherapy without any additional problems.
We treated you with antibiotics and your fevers resolved.
Please take the following medications following discharge: -METOPROLOL.
Please followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further treatment for your leukemia, see below.
