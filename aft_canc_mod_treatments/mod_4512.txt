He tried to turn up his oxygen but to apply the oxygen mask at home he had to go up to 8L or so, and he only had the ability with his compressor to go up to 5L and he wasn't able to get enough oxygen, and so his wife called EMS and went to OSH, was given 1.5L NS and nebulizers.
He completed palliative radiation to L3-L4 vertebral metastasis on [**2130-6-27**].
A discussion was also held about his overall prognosis given ongoing disease progression in his lungs, despite palliative irinotecan and cetuximab.

There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC.
There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC, stable.
There is a left sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC.
Small right pleural effusion persists following insertion of a pleural drainage catheter.
He was diuresed initially with some improvement in respiratory status and also had his R-sided pleural effusion drained for 1L w/ pigtail placement also with very mild improvement.
He was treated for HCAP with vancomycin/cefepime for an 8 day course.
He was started on a trial of steroids however this resulted in little improvement in his respiratory status and delerium.
Therefore steroids were discontinued after two doses of methylprednisolone.
He was transitioned to a morphine drip to help with dyspnea.
# Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma - Diagnosed [**5-/2128**] and is s/p proctosigmoidectomy with end colostomy with known metastases to the lung and spine.
He has completed 6 cycles of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, as well as 2 cycles of Ironotecan and Cetuximab and recently finished 5 sessions of palliative radiation to L3-L4 metastases.
He was continued on his outpatient pain regimen with OxyContin 30 mg q12h and prn Dilaudid.
Palliative care was consulted for symptom management who recommended morpine PCA which was then transtioned to a morphine drip with bolus prn.
As above when the patient's respiratory status failed to improve despite diuresis and antibiotics he was transitioned to comfort measure.
He required Haldol for agitation.
AMS was attributed to medication effect.
Ativan and steroids were discontinued and the patient's mental status improved to baseline.
