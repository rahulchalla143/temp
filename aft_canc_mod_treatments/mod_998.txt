In ED, the pt got Vanco, Cefepime, and metronidazole, 10 liter IVF, 2 U PRBC, 4 units of FFP, and was intubated after both family and patient decided to pursue aggressive care (initially did not want).
Past Oncology History: He was found to have an elevated AFP on routine screening in [**2196-4-20**] (normal in [**2193**]).
Prior to starting chemotherapy, he became short of breath and was found to have a pulmonary embolism as well as portal, hepatic, and IVC thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the lung, complicated by PE, IVC, portal, and hepatic vein thrombosis on lovenox, who presented to the ED with tachypnea and hypotension.
He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for broad empiric coverage and his blood pressure was supported with IV fluids and levophed.
His elevated LFTs and renal function were thought to be due to poor end-organ perfusion due to his hypotension and improved somewhat with IV fluid resuscitation.
# Anemia: He was noted to have coffee ground emesis in his NG tube and required support with multiple transfusions of red blood cells and FFP in an attempt to reverse his INR in the setting of active bleeding.
# Dispo: Due to his history of end-stage metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and his presentation to the ED with likely sepsis, there was discussion in the ED about the appropriateness of intubation and aggressive measures.
After a day of aggressive treatment in the ICU his labs showed minimal improvement and he was requiring increasing amounts of IV fluid and red blood cells to support his blood pressure and hematocrit.
A family meeting was again held with his primary oncology team present and the decision to stop aggressive treatment and pursue comfort measures was made.
He was given Morphine gtt and Ativan PRN anxiety, as well as Scopolamine and IV Benadryl to decrease secretions.
[**Name2 (NI) **] spoke to the family and explained that pt was at the end of his treatment options.
# H/o PE, portal, hepatic, and IVC thrombosis: -Continued lovenox until [**2-8**], when it was d'ced, as care was transitioned to comfort measures only per family wishes .
