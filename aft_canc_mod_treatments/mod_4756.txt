You were started on blood thinners (initially a heparin drip and then a daily shot of fondaparinux), and you will be discharged on a medication called warfarin.
Your diarrhea was likely due to the chemotherapy irinotecan, and this issue resolved.
You will have follow up with your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] soon after your discharge and determine the next steps of cancer management.
