These are too small to characterize and attention to these areas is recommended at further followup.
Intravenous steroids were continued and Therefore, a CT torso was performed to investigate a primary source, and revealed diffuse metastatic bony disease, left axillary lymphadenopathy, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, multiple small liver lesions, and a small chronic pulmonary embolism.
Lower extremity dopplers to investiagte the pulmonary embolism were negative, and options regarding possible treatment were considered.
The decision was made to take the patient for a craniotomy on [**2109-3-14**] for diagnosis of the mass and relief of symptomatic mass effect.
On evening of POD#1 she had decline in mental status, was transferred to ICU.
