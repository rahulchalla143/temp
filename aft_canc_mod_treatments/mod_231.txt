Interval decrease in size of right upper quadrant fluid collection, with pigtail catheter in appropriate positioning.
Left-sided chest tube appears appropriately positioned in the left pleural space.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo male status post CCY/ileostomy takedown, MRSA/Klebsiella PNA status post completed treatment with vancomycin/meropenem returns with development of large left pleural effusion.
* PLEURAL EFFUSIONs:  Patient had on previous admission had known bilateral pleural effusions, R>L, and had undergone thoracentesis with removal of 2L of fluid from the right pleural space consistent with an exudate which was thought at the time to be secondary to parapneumonic effusion as the patient was still being treated for MRSA/Klebsiella pneumonia.
During this admission, patient underwent multiple procedures for removal of pleural effusions, however was immediately restarted on vancomycin/meropenem for empiric treatment of the previous klebsiella/MRSA pneumonia.
A second attempt made under ultrasound guidance was only able to obtain 250cc of fluid, and radiologists commented upon loculations noted in the effusion, and repeat CT chest revealed continued massive pleural effusion despite initial thoracentesis.
Thoracic surgery consultants then placed a chest tube, which drained an additional 1.2 liters, yielding an additional ~2L after two administrations of intrathoracic tissue plasminogen activator.
Following placement of the chest tube, patient's blood pressure, creatinine, and lactic acid improved dramatically.
* LACTIC ACIDOSIS/HYPOTENSION:  At the time of admission, patient's systolic blood pressure was approximately 100, which was significantly lower than his baseline, which normally required anti-hypertensives for control.
While patient was initially given fluids for and blood to improve perfusion, patient became acutely hypoxic and short of breath overnight, concerning for congestive heart failure.
Therefore, patient was then treated with diuresis and fluid restriction, which in turn induced hypotension and a rise in lactate, which peaked at 3.0.
Consistent with this, following placement of chest tube and blood transfusion, patient's blood pressures improved dramatically (to SBP 130's), lactate dropped below 1, and creatinine improved, suggesting that pleural effusion was impairing appropriate cardiac output.
However, following administration of second dose of intrathoracic tPA and drainage of right upper quadrant abdominal abscess, patient became acutely hypotensive, concerning for sepsis.
Patient was started on dopamine infusion and transferred to the MICU for further management.
There, patient was found to have an extremely low central venous pressure, and patient was repleted with blood and fluids and responded appropriately.
* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Serum creatinine at the time of admission was 2.2, which rose to a peak of 2.5 within the same day.
Of note, patient's FeNa at different times during initial admission suggested both pre- and intra- renal failure.
Given the fact that patient's lactate began to rise, it was felt that increased perfusion of tissues with fluid and blood support was necessary.
Indeed, patient's creatinine improved dramatically (1.9->1.6) following placement of chest tube and administration of blood.
However, patient became hypotensive secondary to blood loss following chest tube placement, and patient's creatinine was elevated and became oliguric.
This responded well to fluid boluses and blood transfusion as expected.
Ultimately, however, cultures grew out Klebsiella and vancomycin resistant Enterococci, and patient was treated with meropenem and linezolid with good effect.
On hospital day 24, following extensive invasive procedures, patient requested comfort measures only and transfer to home with hospice.
Chest tubes were placed to water seal and removed without complications.
All medications except those required for comfort were discontinued.
Patient was discharged home with hospice care including morphine and lorazepam for comfort.
