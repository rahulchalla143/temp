HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with a long tobacco history, history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who is admitted on [**10-14**] with chest pain.
It did not improve with Bacitracin and bandages with an unknown antibiotic which he used for 10 days twice a day.
He was started on Dicloxacillin 500 mg q.i.d.
He was started on Levaquin 500 q.d.
and Clindamycin 900 t.i.d.
His wound continued to worsen, however despite antibiotics and in fact acutely worsened in size and color over one to two days prior to [**Hospital 228**] transfer to Medicine.
Foot swab revealed Staphylococcus aureus with sensitivities to Clindamycin, Levaquin and Gentamycin along with coag negative staph.
It was on his medial malleolus.
The rash and pruritus began to improve over the day prior to transfer of course finally to cessation of Captopril and Dicloxacillin.
Clindamycin and Levaquin were also discontinued on transfer, however they were not discontinued as possible culprit to his drug rash.
IV Vancomycin was started for broader coverage infection.
Over the several days subsequent to [**Hospital 228**] transfer to Medicine, Infectious Disease, Vascular, Plastic Surgery and Dermatology consults became increasing involved.
The patient's ulcer did not improve in the first couple of days despite treatment with Vancomycin 1 gram q.
Plastic Surgery and Vascular Teams recommended we treat the ulcer like a burn.
We did so and he was treated with Xeroform dressings changed q.d.
and Kerlix wrapped around the Xeroform.
IV Vancomycin was continued.
The purpuric rash present in his left lower extremity was felt to be cellulitic as it was responding to IV Vancomycin.
As the patient's left lower extremity continued to improve, he is felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation program or skilled nursing facility with plans to continue IV Vancomycin for a total of two weeks which will be approximately one more week after discharge.
However since both medications were stopped at the same time and corresponded with resolving eosinophilia and rash, it was not possible which drug was the culprit and patient should likely be considered allergic to both medications.
In terms of patient's cardiac status, he remained hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his admission on the Medication Team.
He was maintained on Lopressor 50 b.i.d.
He said this had happened a couple of years ago during his treatment for lymphoma.
Vancomycin 1 gram q.
IV Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Plavix 25 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
