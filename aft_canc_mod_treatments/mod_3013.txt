HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old female with a pre-B cell ALL diagnosed in [**June 2125**] following a workup of diffuse myalgias and low-grade fevers.
She was induced with APO per ECOG protocol and consolidated with hyper-CVAD for three cycles.
Her course has been complicated by a perirectal abscess, multiple line infections, a deep venous thrombosis in her right upper extremity and internal jugular vein as well as an episode of cholestasis and hepatitis secondary to the use of Augmentin.
ALL diagnosed in [**2125-6-3**] of the pre-B cell type with the translocation of 4:11 status post hyper-CVAD x3, status post APO induction.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin induces a rash.
Augmentin leads to cholestasis.
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION: 1.
Diflucan 200 mg p.o.
Celexa 20 mg p.o.
Acyclovir 400 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Ativan 1 mg q.h.s.
Bupropion 100 mg p.o.
Prednisone 20 mg p.o.
Zyrtec 10 mg q.h.s.
She worked as the owner of a commercial laundry company.
Differential:  34% neutrophils, 18% bands, 10% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 4% metas, 1% myelos, 32% atypicals.
She underwent cytoxan as well as total body irradiation with a conventional allogenic bone marrow transplant.
She was found to have peripheral blasts and an 11q23 cytogenic abnormality.
She was re-induced with cytoxan, vincristine, and prednisone and obtained partial response.
The bone marrow transplant that she received was a single antigen mismatched unrelated donor transplant.
The date of the stem cell transplant was [**2126-2-21**].
total body irradiation for four-day period.
Patient was continued on cyclosporin at a dose of 3 mg/kg IV continuous infusion.
She received multiple units of packed red cells approximately one per day.
Throughout her hospital course, she received multiple bags of platelets approximately 1-2 per day.
On two occasions, she did develop rigors and a rash with infusion of platelets.
The most marked at these reactions was on [**2126-2-21**] upon receiving her stem cells when she developed significant rigors that were responsive to 25 mg of Demerol as well as 25 mg of Benadryl.
This was changed to continuous infusion on day minus one.
Infectious disease:  She did develop febrile neutropenia, and was started on Vancomycin as well as cefepime.
Given the fact that she had been persistently febrile, however, despite initially being on Vancomycin and cefepime, AmBisome was added on [**2126-2-28**].
Blood cultures from [**2126-2-21**] did grow out coag-negative Staph pansensitive to Vancomycin in [**4-7**] bottles.
She was maintained on acyclovir 400 mg IV t.i.d.
as well as fluconazole 200 mg IV.
Pain control:  Given the patient's diffuse bone and muscle pain as well as her later development of mucositis pain, she was started on a PCA on [**2126-2-25**] with good effect.
Depression:  The patient was started on Celexa 20 mg p.o.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  TPN was begun on [**2126-2-28**] given the patient's decreased p.o.
Gastric reflux:  Patient was started on Protonix p.o./IV.
Glucose control:  She was maintained euglycemic on an insulin-sliding scale and fingerstick glucose checks b.i.d.
