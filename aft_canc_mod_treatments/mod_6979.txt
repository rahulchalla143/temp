Her antibiotics were initially vancomycin and zosyn which were changed to penicillin after [**3-24**] blood cultures were returned pneumococcu pansensitive from [**3-6**] for OSH.
She did not require pressures during her hospital course but progressively had shortness of breath, requiring ultimately bipap.
After extensive discussion with the family in regards to her goals of care, as she had metastatic lung cancer, and was becoming progressively short of breath secondary to the postobstructive pneumonia, she was changed to comfort measures only and was started on a morphine drip and ativan prn for comfort and ultimately died.
She was initially maintained on vancomycin and zosyn for three days until the outside hospital cultures showed pansensitive pneumococcus and she was changed to penicillin which was discontinued after two days, when she became comfort measures only.
# NSCLC: She has had 3 different histologic variants in past, widely metastatic to bone, felt to be too widely mx for radiation therapy in the past, recently started on palliative chemotx with carboplatin/taxol, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**].
