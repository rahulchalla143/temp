The patient requested decompression and resection of the tumor burden.
She was pre-op'd and taken to the OR on [**2142-4-14**] for an exploratory laparotomy and loop ileostomy (please refer to operative note for details).
The patient tolerated the procedure and was extubated post-operatively.
Given the acute nature of her hypoxemia, PE was considered a possible etiology and a heparin drip was started.
An esophageal balloon was placed to monitor transthoracic pressures.
She required multiple vasopressors, initially levophed and neosynephrine, which were transitioned to vasopressin and levophed given she was febrile and exhibiting signs of sepsis/ARDS.
Her antibiotic regimen included vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl.
She was fluid resuscitated and this culminated in approximately 5 liters of crystalloid and 3 doses of colloid given in the SICU and over 3 liters of cystalloid in the PACU.
