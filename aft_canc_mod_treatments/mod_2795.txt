Has been taking oxycodone as needed, which was controlling headache pain up until a few days ago.
Lovenox was held because of risk of bleeding.
Protamine was considered but ultimately not administered.
Neurosurgery, neuro oncology, and ophthalmology involved.
Plan was for lovenox to continueu to be held until a determination woudl be made.
--Received a total of six cycles of chemotherapy with [**Hospital1 **] (3 cycles) and CHOP (3 cycles), completed in 9/[**2126**].
Course complicated by admissions for fevers due to bacteremia, line associated DVT, and bilateral pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation with Lovenox.
--High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant was recommended to induce a durable remission given the aggressive nature of her disease, but deferred by [**Known firstname **].
--In [**11/2127**], re-staging PET-CT done without evidence of lymphoma but noted pregnancy; referred to the high-risk obstetrics group and followed regularly throughout her pregnancy.
--Due to the aggressive nature of her disease, labor induced at 32 weeks in order to initiate chemotherapy.
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.
Discharged on [**2128-7-19**] on Lovenox 60 mg twice per day.
Agreed to proceed with an autologous transplant.
--Admitted on [**2128-9-9**] for mobilization with Cytoxan followed by daily Neupogen injections.
Pheresis catheter placed on [**2128-9-21**] for stem cell collection.

--With now minimal disease and multiple recurrences, next treatment would be consideration of allogeneic transplant.
--[**2129-7-6**], evidence of persistent disease on CSF; LP showed 30-40 WBCs per hpf, suggestive of lymphoma involvment, confirmed with immunophenotyping --[**2129-7-7**], 4th cycle of high dose MTX @ 8000 mg/m2, complicated by increased transaminases, improved over time.
HTLV-1 associated peripheral T-cell lymphoma, with now CNS involvement s/p [**Hospital1 **]/CHOP x 6, ESHAP x 3, ICE x 2, 6 doses of Pralatrexate (Last given on [**2129-5-2**]), MTX x4 (last dose [**2129-7-7**]) 3.
G6PD deficiency 4.
Hypothyroidism during pregnancy, not currently on thyroid replacement 5.
She lives with her husband, 3 children, cousin and mother.
She moved here from [**Country 2045**] 13 years ago and was working as a nurses aid at a nursing home prior to her diagosis and chemotherapy.
Bifrontal hypodensities and ventricular dilation have increased from [**2129-5-12**].
She was started on dilantin 1g loading dose followed by 100 mg IV TID.
At that point she was started on keppra 1g loading dose followed by 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurology recommendations, in addition to Dilantin.
She was maintained on dexamethasone 4mg IV q6h for treatment of edema associated with the mass.
She did receive whole brain irradiation on [**8-1**], she was restarted on her enoxaparin [**8-1**], but her CT head did not show any acute process including bleeds or edema.
For now, suspect that her acute mental status changes are due to continued seizures, which are likely directly related to her brain mass and subtherapeutic dosing of her anti-epileptic medications.
Because the patient seized while on phenytoin, neurology recommended starting topiramate 25mg [**Hospital1 **], may possibly increase to 50 [**Hospital1 **] after 1 week, while keeping phenytoin on for 1st 2 doses of topiramate before discontinuing.
Topirimate was titrated to 50 [**Hospital1 **], and patient was maintained on Keppra until discharge.
Patient was started on Zyprexa with good results.
She was started on cyberknife radiation for her new suprasellar mass on [**2129-8-1**] for a planned 10 day course.
Well controlled with IV pain regimen including Dilaudid.
Patient was transitioned to an oral pain regimen with oxycontin and PO dilaudid prior to discharge.
Endocrinology recommended against stress dose steroids as long as she was on the dexamethasone as mentioned above (given to reduce edema surrounding suprasellar mass).
They recommended starting levothyroxine 50mcg daily and then titrating to 75 mcg daily.
Remains on Lovenox 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] as outpatient (therapeutic dosing).
She was started on a heparin drip on the floor, which was discontinued when there was concern for possible bleeding from her suprasellar mass.
