Per the patient's lifetime partner, the patient self increased his dose of opiate using approximately four patches of Fentanyl and increasing his Seroquel dose from 150 to 300 mg.
He was treated with Ativan 7 mg for what they thought was alcohol withdrawal, which increased the patient's sedation and subsequently his systolic blood pressure decreased to 88-97.

He was continued on ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for possible meningitis.
He was also started on a bicarb drip for metabolic acidosis.
