She has required 1 therapeutic paracentesis in the past, with cytology positive for malignancy.
She underwent a therapeutic paracentesis during this admission, with ~3 liters of fluid removed.
Hopefully her current chemotherapy regimen will decrease her need for paracenteses, however she may be a candidate for a pleurex if she requires recurrent drainage.
She will discuss port placement with her outpatient oncologist.
She will also discuss possible pleurex catheter if her ascites/pleural effusions continue to re accumulate despite chemotherapy treatment.
She was started on low dose gabapentin, and has room for titration of this as an outpatient.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt had thoracentesis with pleural cultures and cytology pending at time of discharge.
Pt will need to arrange port placement with her outpatient oncologist.
