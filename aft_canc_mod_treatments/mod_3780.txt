G-J tube placement (MIC tube).
[**2194-5-7**]: CVL placement [**2194-5-20**]: G-J tube replacement   History of Present Illness: This very nice 49-year-old gentleman was referred for a duodenal carcinoid that was recently picked up on an upper endoscopy.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] has been working up his liver function which showed mild fibrosis on a percutaneous biopsy.
Therefore, he was sent to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical consideration.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was unconvinced given the placement of this lesion that he could perform this endoscopically and therefore surgical approach was required.
They understood entirely that he had early Trials-8 cirrhosis and that he was at heightened risk for any operative intervention given this.
An endoscopic ultrasound was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1 week prior to this operation and did not reveal any diagnostic information.
Therefore a lymph node biopsy as well as a liver biopsy would be required for this operation.
On [**2194-5-1**] he elective presented for a transduodenal resection of a carcinoid tumor, an open cholecystectomy, a liver biopsy as well as a lymph node biopsy.
Past Medical History: 1. renal failure and has been on dialysis three times a week.
5. s/p back fixation 6. s/p left forearm AV graft for dialysis 7. s/p ERCP [**2194-3-13**]   Social History: Social history shows that he does not smoke tobacco nor does he imbibe alcohol, and he has had no known major environmental exposures.
A central venous catheter is present with its tip terminating in the distal SVC.
Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a percutaneous gastrostomy tube with its tip in a post-pyloric location.
The kidneys are atrophic and contain numerous cysts consistent with polycystic disease, also stable in appearance.
Please  repair/replace his PEG / J tube and continue NPO w/tube feedings.
There were no complications, and he tolerated the procedure well.
He was monitored in the PACU overnight for pain control and observation of his blood pressure.
His home blood pressure medications were selectively restarted with holding parameters which meant he frequently did not receive the doses.
He was treated with nebulizers and chest PT.
Tube feeds were started via the J tube on POD 3.
On POD 4, [**2194-5-5**] the patient returned from dialysis and was found to have peripheral cyanosis.
An O2 sat could not be obtained using a finger, toe, or forehead probe.
That evening he became febrile, pan cultures were sent, and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for presumptive pneumonia.
Sputum culture eventually grew Moraxella Catarrhalis and Haemophilus Influenzae.
On [**2194-5-6**] his J tube feeds were restarted and he tolerated a goal rate.
He was kept intubated but his sedation was lightened significantly.
He was monitored closely and continued dialysis treatments on his regular schedule.
He received PRBC transfusion on [**2194-5-7**] to help with a low blood pressure.
He continued with hemodialysis per Renal recommendation and continued to treat his hypercalcemia.
On [**2194-5-20**] his G/J tube was replaced in IR for a cracked tube.
