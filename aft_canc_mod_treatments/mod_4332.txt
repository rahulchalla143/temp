He also endorses a dry cough X 3-4 days and feels as though he now has something in his chest but has been unable to bring anything up.
He also felt he gained 10 pounds (normal weight 178 pounds), which he attrbiutes to prednisone usage.
He was also started on a Z-Pak and saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Pulmonary office on [**12-14**].
His INR was noted that visit to be elevated to 5.3, possibly due to the Z-Pak and thus, his Coumadin 8mg daily was held for two days.
Because the patient's urinalysis from [**12-14**] was also infected, he was switched off Z-Pak to Ciprofloxacin.

# Shortness of breath: Most likely an exacerbation of patient's known severe COPD (on home O2 3.5-4L NC).
He has been partially treated with a levofloxacin, and oral prednisone of 20mg daily but continues to feel SOB.
Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60mg, tapering down to 20 per Pulmonology recs and azithromycin 500mg initially and then 250mg for a total of 5 days.
Albuterol and ipratropium nebs given PRN for symptoms.
After spending the night in the ICU, patient was weaned down off ventimask and satting 93% on 4L NC.
On the floor the patient was doing well from a pulmonary perspective.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was established and we decided that sending the patient out on no prednisone was appropriate given that he is at his baseline oxygen requirement and has no symptoms.
His warfarin was held for 2 days and patient presented with an INR of 1.5.
Warfarin 8mg (home dose) was restarted and INR was monitored with a goal of [**1-12**].
His CHADS-2 score is at least 4, so when it was determined that he would have an EGD/colonoscopy in house he was started on a heparin gtt.
He will be bridged with lovenox on discharge.
He was also re-started on 8 mg of Coumadin and given a prescription for a INR which will be followed by his PCP.
Held home metformin and glipizide in house, and managed on glargine and HISS.
Patient now on prednisone, so insulin regimen was titrated as needed.
He was restarted his home DM regimen on discharge.
# Hypertension: Patient is [**Age over 90 **]-140/60-80 as an outpatient on home regimen of verapamil SR 180mg [**Hospital1 **].
Verapamil was continued in house, but captopril was added for improved SBP control.
Patient is chronically anemic, on iron supplementation.
Ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **] and folate supplementation were continued.
He was started on vitamin D supplements, 400mg daily.
# Mild depression: Denied symptoms of depression currently, has been maintained on venlafaxine chronically.
Continued home venlafaxine 75mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Glaucoma: Continued home Dorzolamide 2%/Timolol 0.5%.
Patient will have remaining home medications brought in tomorrow as they are not on formulary.
