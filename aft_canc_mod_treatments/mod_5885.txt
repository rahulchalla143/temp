IABP still in good position, aorta is intact post decannulation 3.
Other findings are unchanged  [**2188-5-20**] CXR Compared with [**2188-5-18**], the left pleural effusion may be smaller in size, although some of the clearing at the left lung base can be attributed to reexpansion of retrocardiac atelectasis.
