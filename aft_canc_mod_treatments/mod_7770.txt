Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-3-16**], the regurgitant native mitral valve has been treated with an annuloplasty.
Pt was initially given 80iv of Lasix and 3 SLN en route to the [**Hospital1 18**].
She was then started on a Lasix gtt and also on a Nitro gtt for persistent hypertension with pressures in the 200 which subsequent pressures in the 120 range.
ASA 325mg was given.
Levofloxacin and Azithromycin were given for possible CAP but d/c'd in MICU.
She was started on CPAP at 12/8 initially and then titrated to [**4-13**], then in rapid sequence to NC and came off supplemental oxygen this pm with diuresis of about 2L on a lasix gtt.
She has remained afebrile and without focal signs of infection although yesterday pm had a rise in WBC to 16  Labs on presentation also notable for an INR of 4 on presentation, coumadin was held.
Pt was kept there for 2 days while waiting for INR to drift down and giving vit K for this so she could proceed to cardiac catheterization (She has history of Afib on coumadin) She was found to have 3VD on cath on [**2133-3-19**] (70% LAD, 90% LCx, 60% RCA) --> therefore the plan was for CABG the following monday with possble mitral valve replacement given significant MR.
She was diuresed in the cath lab with IV lasix 40mg + 60mg and she put out 2L of urine.
She was continued on ASA, no beta blocker since borderline bradycardic, no statin since LDL 76 in [**10/2132**] off statins and no acute MI.
On [**3-22**] pt went to OR and underwent CABG x3/Mitral Valve repair/MAZE.
Vancomycin was administered 48 hours perioperatively for her preoperative admission.
Electrophysiology was consulted and on [**2133-3-27**] a PPM was placed.She was anticoagulated with Coumadin and Heparin for underlying AFib.
[**2133-3-31**] Ciprofloxacin x 5 days was started for an asymptomatic UTI.
