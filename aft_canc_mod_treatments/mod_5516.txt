He is currently ungergoing chemotherapy with Temazolamide (yesterday he went for his 21 day lab check, following up his most recent 5 day course).
He has not been taking steroids as far as she knows and there have been no recent changes to his medications.
He was intubated for airway protection, for which he received etomidate, succinycholine, ativan, and versed.
He was given Decadron 10 mg IV, and started on a Mannitol infusion per Neurosurgery recommendations.
Moved in with girlfriend of 14 years during past month, mainly because he could no longer keep track of his own medications and his functional status was declining.
Does not follow midline commands.
