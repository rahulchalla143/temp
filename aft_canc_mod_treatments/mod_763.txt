On POD8, APS was consulted after pain control could not be achieved using a fentanyl gtt at 300mcg/hour, dilaudid PCA@0.75mg/q6mins, clonidine patch in the ICU.
APS transitioned the pt to a ketamine infusion at 10-15mg/h, with dilaudid PCA and clonidine patch.
Before discharge the patient was transitioned to a PO regimen that included methadone 20mg tid, dilaudid 8-10mg q3h prn, and clonidine and fentanyl patches.
PE: On POD3, the pt developed acute dyspnea with tachypnea, requiring non-rebreather and CPAP to maintain adequate oxygenation.
The pt was started on a sub-therapeutic heparin drip (goal PTT 50-60) and vascular surgery was consulted to put in a supra-renal IVC filter, which they did on POD4.
On POD5, PPD1, a flex bronch with therapeutic aspiration was done with much improvement in the pt's respiratory status.
Supplemental oxygen was weaned, and on discharge the pt did not require any supplemental oxygen.
The heparin drip was discontinued on POD15, and he was discharged without any anticoagulation due to the risk of bleeding from the pancreatic tumor.
ID: Intraoperatively, there was some stool spillage into the abdomen so the pt was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
After spiking a fever on POD___, antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and zosyn.
Throughout the remainder of the hospitalization, the pt remained afebrile on vanc/zosyn and this regimen was continued for the duration.
On discharge, the pt were transitioned to augmentin for a 2 week course.
His abdominal exam continued to improve with diminishing distention.
He was transitioned to full liquids on POD14 after having a successful bowel movement, and on POD15 he did well with a regular diet and his TPn was weaned off.
