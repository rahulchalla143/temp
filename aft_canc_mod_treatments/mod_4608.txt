The patient reports "a couple" of days of feeling generally unwell with malaise and a fever.
He is not able to endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain, dysuria/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P 120 BP 132/80 R 26 O2 sat 99% on NRB but temperature then spiked to 104.2 rectally.
The patient was given levofloxacin, acetaminophen, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.
He became hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS without much effect before before being started on norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.
He received one unit Plt and one unit pRBC's as was worse than baseline.

Right great toe swollen with darker color and open wound at over the first MTP joint.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of multiple bacteremias due to gangrene of the right great toe (initially precipitated by anatomical abnormality), myelodysplastic syndrome, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease presenting from rehab with fever and hypotension and found to be bacteremic again.
1) Bacteremia/Sepsis: Patient was clearly septic at presentation with hypotension requiring norepinehprine on the night of admission and positive blood cultures for MRSA.
On presentation to the ICU the patient received his daptomycin as well as a dose of pipercillin-tazobactam for broad coverage.
Outside hospital blood cultures revealed MRSA, pan-sensitive klebsiella, and two kinds of streptococcus.
The most likely etiology of his recurrent bacteremia was considered to be his right great toe, which was status post multiple debridements, so this was amputated on [**2146-4-12**].
Given bacteremia with a PICC line in place the patient's PICC was discontinued on the recommendation of the ID consult service.
Given the patient has a pacemaker in place and had MRSA bacteremia there was concern for seeding, therefore TEE was considered necessary.
Despite being on Daptomycin for MRSA and Ceftriaxone for Klebsiella, the pt continued to have positive blood cultures following amputation of the toe and TEE.
The infectious disease service recommended removal of the pacemaker, but after discussion with Mr [**Known lastname 3012**] and his health care proxies (daughter [**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and her husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]), it was clear that the pt did not desire this aggressive approach to the treatment of his bacteremia.
Mr [**Known lastname 3012**] accepted the fact that without pacemaker extraction his life expectancy would likely be limited to weeks (according to the ID service) and the decision was made for the pt to go home with hospice, on antibiotics for comfort.
The pt was discharged on vancomycin 1g daily and rifampin on the recommendation of the ID service.
This improved with transfer to floor and resolution of hypotension as well as treatment of infection.
# Depression: The patient's mirtazapine was initially held given hypotension but then was restarted with good effect.
# BPH: The patient initially had a foley catheter in place and tamsulosin was held given his hypotension.
He was restarted on tamsulosin after 24 hours of normal blood pressures and his foley was discontinued without incident.
The pt was discharged with a condom catheter for urinary incontinence.
# Polymyalgia rheumatica: The patient has chronically (>1yr) been on prednisone for PMR.
He received stress dose IV hydrocortisone on presentation but was transitioned back to his baseline prednisone dose on the day after his surgery.

We treated you with antibiotics and you had an amputation to remove the source of the infection.
You opted to not have aggressive treatment and leave your pacemaker in place.
You decided to continue to take antibiotics, knowing that your life expectancy on an antibiotic regimen may be short.
During this admission your home medications were continued.
You were started on two IV antibiotics that you will continue to take at home.
The medications that were STARTED are: Vancomycin and Rifampin.
