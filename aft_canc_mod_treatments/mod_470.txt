Unchanged course of the left PICC catheter with tip projecting over distal SVC.
Thought most likely [**1-31**] dehydration, although given her positive PICC line culture, there may have been a component of sepsis.
IVF resuscitation was continued overnight with an additional 2L overnight in addition to the 3L the patient received in the ED, with improvement in her blood pressures to 100's to 110's systolic, which remained stable during her hospitalization.
Given these two factors, her PICC line was pulled and was given a 48 hour line holiday.
Once sensitivities returned, she was transitioned to ampicillin and cefepime.
While Enterobacteria was sensitive to Cipro, Cefepime will be continued since it is cheaper, is once a day, and patient is paying out of pocket for IV antibiotics.
She was given 50mEq KCL to take daily, and Lasix moved to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (8am & 1pm).
It was thought that admission hypokalemia was due to non-compliance with potassium supplements.
* Hypomagnesemia- Received 2g Magnesium repletion in the ED with resolution.
* Chronic renal insuffiency (stage 3) - Lasix was initially held, but restarted on [**2113-4-28**], and adjusted to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge.
She will go home with potassium supplements.
Wound care was consulted and they had made recommendations to obtaining a surgical consultation.
