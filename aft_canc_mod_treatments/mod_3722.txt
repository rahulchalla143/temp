PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses - peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2129-7-6**] with thrombectomy, history of stroke x2 - ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke with residual dysphagia and aspiration; asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm 4.3 cm in size; type 2 diabetes, controlled; history of hypertension;  ALLERGIES:  Haldol allergy new.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Nexium 40 mg daily; Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
; Arimidex 1 mg daily; nitro patch 0.4 mg daily; Remeron 15 mg at bedtime; ferrous sulfate 300 mg twice a day; Tylenol 650 mg q.4h.
; aspirin 325 mg daily; bacitracin ointment to left breast b.i.d.
Abdominal exam is benign except for PEG tube placement site clean without erythema.
IV heparinization was continued to maintain a PTT between 60 and 80.
The patient underwent on [**2129-9-12**], a diagnostic angio of the abdominopelvic vessels with left leg runoff via the right femoral artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Nutrition was consulted on admission for recommendations for tube feeds.
The patient is dependent at baseline on her tube feeds.
and held for residual greater than 150 cc and the tube is flushed every 4 hours with 50 cc of fluid.
In summary, the patient does not appear to aspirate nectar-thick liquid and ground p.o.
Recommendations were the patient could have thickened liquids only for comfort.
Recommendations were there were no signs of aspiration but the patient's oropharyngeal phase was discoordinated and PEG feedings were to be continued and thickened liquids for pleasure only.
The patient had an episode of agitation and confusion which resolved with Haldol IV.
They felt the delirium was secondary to multifactorial reasons and would recommend that we take her off narcotic and give her Tylenol 1 gm t.i.d.
standing and to simply her opiate treatment to oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h.
The Haldol was discontinued and Zyprexa 2.5 mg nightly was instituted and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa for agitation as required.
On [**2129-9-15**], the patient's Zyprexa was converted to Seroquel 50 mg at bedtime which could be repeated x1.
Heparin was continued.
The patient underwent on [**2129-9-18**], a left axillofemoral bypass and a left femoral-to- distal bypass.
She required 2 units of packed cells intraoperatively.
Postoperative day one the patient was continued on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
She did require a total of four 250-fluid boluses for mild postoperative hypotension which was resolved with fluid resuscitation.
Her heparin was continued and coumadinization was begun on [**2129-9-20**].
The patient did require several units of packed red blood cells postoperatively for hematocrit that drifted from 30.2 to 24.
GI was consulted for the patient's persistent anemia postoperatively and dark stool.
GI felt that the source was either upper or lower GI; this could not be fully evaluated given the patient's need for continuous anticoagulation but this should be evaluated on an outpatient basis when the patient has recovered from current surgery, but the patient would be monitored on a clinical basis, and if required at some point prior to discharge, would consider endoscopies to evaluate for active bleeding.
On [**2129-9-22**], the patient's Swan was converted to a central line and her IV fluids were Hep-Locked.
The patient's heparin was discontinued on [**2129-9-23**], and her INR was 4.1 and anticoagulation was held and the INR was serially monitored.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime; nitroglycerin 0.4 mg per hour patch q.24h., on 12, off 12; bacitracin ointment to the left breast area b.i.d.

for pain, warfarin 5 mg daily, goal INR 2.0 to 3.0; heparin flush to PICC line (of importance - the PICC has had to have irrigation with alteplase 1 mg on 3 separate occasions; the most recently was [**2129-9-23**]); regular insulin q.4h., see sliding scale.
10.PICC line thrombus x3, treated.
Left axillary-femoral bypass with a left femoral to distal bypass on [**2129-9-18**].
