Two days prior to admission, pt began experiencing sharp RUQ pain, nausea, nonbloody, nonbilious vomitus and diarrhea.
She was given metronidazole and levofloxacin and admitted to the general medical floor where she was kept NPO and given IVF.
CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis was performed and was concerning for necrosis, therefore were was transferred to the ICU where aggressive fluid repletion was initiated (at the time of transfer she has recieved 7 L. HCT demonstrated hemoconcentration (54) which remained stable despite fluids.
The patient does not drink alcohol, has no new medication but does have HL for which she has been on pravastatin.
The patient was intubated and sedated due to ARDS.
LIJ central venous catheter was placed given access issues.
She was extubated on [**2141-6-20**] and was transfered to the medicine floor and was treated for VAP from [**Date range (3) 112125**] with zosyn and vancomycin (cipro was started initially, but subsequently discontinued).
Several potential offending agents were discontinued.

Gallbladder filled with sludge and gallstones.
More advanced liver disease such as fibrosis or cirrhosis can not be excluded on this study.
Interval increase in peripancreatic fluid around on the tail of the pancreas and gastric greater curvature, but fluid collections do not appear organized.
She was initially treated with meropenem  which was discontinued after several days.
After acute disease state resolves, she will require lap cholecystectomy or ERCP with sphincterotomy (in 2-3months).
After pt's pancreatitis started to improve, she was aggressively diuresed and weaned off of sedation and the ventilator.
She did not have a cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given steroids for 24hrs and was ultimately extubated.
Despite aggressive diuresis and a trial of bipap, pt's CO2 did not improve, so she was re-intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was treated with steroids, racemic epinephrine and heliox for presumed laryngeal edema.
After several hours her respiratory status improved and within 24 hrs she was weaned to nasal cannula.
Chest X-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion despite persistent ataelectasis.
Other sources of infection were investigated (normal U/A, abdomen imaging unchanged, no diarrhea), so she was empirically treated for VAP with vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxicin.
Tachycardia: Improved with treatment of acute disease and with restarting her home verapamil and metoprolol (PCP confirmed that both are for hypertension).
Insomnia/delerium: Was previously on olanzapine for steroid vs. ICU induced delerium.
Olanzapine was discontinued and Trazodone was ordered.
Initial hyperglycemia treated with SSI and lantus resulted in next day hypoglycemia.
She was continued on gentle HISS while NPO.
The diabetes service saw the patient and also adjusted her insulin dosing.
Hypertension, benign: Held home amlodpine, lisinopril and verapamil initially on admission.
She was restarted on verapamil and metoprolol.
Peripheral Vascular Disease: - Continue home dose of ASA  # Anemia: Hct on admission in the 40's, now 23.

Suspect that this may have been related to aspiration as her WBC and platelets are now improving.
Prophylaxis: Heparin sub-Q 5000 Units TID for VTE prophylaxis.
