The patient refused subcutaneous heparin prior to discharge.
Given that he was having significant coffee ground emesis earlier during this admission most likely secondary to his known metastatic gastric carcinoma, he was not deemed to be a candidate for anticoagulation with Warfarin at this time.
He was therefore continued on sequential compression devices to his bilateral lower extremities for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
The instructions were given to continue these devices at the rehabilitation facility.
Given that the patient cannot receive intravenous medications at the rehabilitation facility, he was transitioned to Oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o.
