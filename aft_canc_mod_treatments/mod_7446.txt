Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 52-year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, s/p lt. mastectomy now enrolled in clinical trial "05-395" (lapatinib monotherapy 1500 mg), who noted lt. arm swelling [**2-28**].
A pericardial drain was placed with return of approximately 250 cc of serosanginous fluid and normalization of right heart pressures.
She is status post left mastectomy with reconstruction, CAF followed by tamoxifen.
She was treated with Arimidex for six months, which was followed by Taxol and Herceptin.
She was then treated with high-dose chemo and Herceptin followed by transplant as part of the clinical trial.
In [**9-/2173**], she was treated with letrozole and Herceptin and was then switched to Aromasin and Herceptin in 11/[**2174**].
Upon progression [**Male First Name (un) **] was switched to the lapatinib phase II trial in [**7-28**], and herceptin was discontinued.
Autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2169**].
Drainage bag connected, contains approx 10 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
Pericardiocentesis: was performed via the subxyphoid approach, using an 18 gauge thin-wall needle, a guide wire, and a drainage catheter.
HEMODYNAMICS RESULTS BODY SURFACE AREA:  m2   HEMOGLOBIN: gms %   FICK **PRESSURES RIGHT ATRIUM {a/v/m} 14/12/10 RIGHT VENTRICLE {s/ed} 35/12 PULMONARY ARTERY {s/d/m} 35/15/21 PULMONARY WEDGE {a/v/m} 16/16/12 AORTA {s/d/m} 140/65/95 PERICARDIUM {m} 12 **CARDIAC OUTPUT HEART RATE {beats/min} 70 RHYTHM SINUS  OTHER HEMODYNAMIC DATA:      The oxygen consumption was assumed.
Contrast injected:           Non-ionic low osmolar (isovue, optiray...), vol 20 ml, Indications - Renal Anesthesia:           1% Lidocaine subq.
There was significant respiratory variation of systemic arterial pressure up to 20mmHg.
Pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopy guidance.
Pericardial drain was subsequently placed with 240cc serosanguinous fluid removed.
Elevated right sided filling pressures with equlization of RA/LA/pericardial pressures.
Successful placement of pericardial drain.
Consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and a right apical paramediastinal mass are unchanged.
Several loops of pericardiocentesis catheter projecting over the subxiphoid midline, the base of the heart and superiorly to the level of the pulmonary outflow tract, are acutely coiled and should be evaluated clinically to see if they are draining properly.
A pericardial drain was placed with 320 cc of serosanguinous fluid output the first 12 hours, then 75 cc over 6 hours, then no output.
The pericardial drain was removed.
The patient may need a pericardial window or balloon pericardiotomy procedure if the effusion increases in size.
Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 20 mg QD  Discharge Medications: 1.
Simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement/removal .
Autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2169**] 3.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized after a procedure to remove fluid from your pericardial sac.

Followup Instructions: The office of your oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] contact you regarding scheduling of your repeat echocardiogram and follow-up with oncology on Monday, [**3-17**].
