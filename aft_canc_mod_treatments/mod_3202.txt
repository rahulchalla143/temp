[**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] MRI was performed showing a 2-4 cm ring enhancing mass in the right posterior frontal lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital and an MRI of his head was performed showing further detail of the lesion in his head.
The patient tolerated the procedure quite well and spent the night in the postanesthesia care unit for observation.
He was continued on dexamethasone although progressively tapered.
After the surgery the thoracic surgical team was consulted due to a lesion found in the left lung during preoperative work-up.
He will need to have his staples taken out in approximately one week which can be done at rehabilitation or in house, or he may return to [**Hospital1 69**] or his own physician to have them removed.
