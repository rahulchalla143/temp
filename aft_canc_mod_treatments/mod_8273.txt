On 4th unit of PRBC she bumped appropriately to HgB 9.6 and then stabilized at HgB 8.5 for discharge.
With no guaic available, she was transfused 1 unit apheresis platelets ([**10-6**]) as a cautionary measure prior to discharge.
Anti-GBM was still pending on discharge.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  -PNA/HYPOXEMIA: Transferred from OSH [**9-29**] with respiratory distress after 3 days of ceftriaxone, azithromycin and lasix for treatment of PNA vs CHF in the context of hypoxemia (79% RA-->90% 3L NC), bilateral infiltrates on CXR, lower extremity edema and BNP 1780 .
There was also concern for leukostasis given her h/o MDS and WBC elevation (51.4k from baseline 20-30k).
Antibiotic coverage broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin to cover HCAP due to recent PNA hospitalization [**6-11**] and completion of antibiotic course for course 2 wks PTA.
