[**2122-4-10**] PARACENTESIS DIAG/THERA - Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis, with removal of 4.0 liters of serosanguinous ascites.
Right central line with tip projecting over the mid-superior vena cava.
Findings again consistent with known widely metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin, with probable interval progression of liver masses, and redemonstration of adnexal mass, multiple omental masses, and peritoneal implants consistent with metastatic disease.
Delineation is limited on this non-contrast examination, but the fibroid uterus and pelvic metastatic deposits may be contributing to progressive ureteral dilation.
Gas-distended but not dilated transverse colon noted.
Vancomycin was discontinued once counts recovered and patient was discharged to rehab with plan to continue IV ceftriaxone for total of 14 days antibiotic therapy (ending [**2122-5-5**]).

She underwent therapeutic ultrasound guided paracentesis on [**4-23**] and [**4-29**] with improvement in shortness of breath and abdominal distension.
Following volume resuscitation, patient's creatinine returned to baseline (0.8-1.1) and remained there for the rest of hospitalization.
