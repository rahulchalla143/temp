HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 50-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer status post autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2181**], who was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] for an allo MUD BMT on [**8-4**].
Subsequent to her MUD BMT, she developed subsequent febrile neutropenia, tachypnea with respiratory distress, acute renal failure, requiring intubation and admission to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2188-8-11**].
Patient was admitted for allo-MUD BMT and subsequently developed congestive heart failure with an EF of 20% per echocardiogram on [**8-7**].
Patient also experienced acute episodes of shortness of breath, which were treated with Lasix, nitrates, and hydralazine, however, patient became persistently tachypneic, and hypoxic, and was subsequently intubated on [**8-11**].
She had been experiencing increasing renal insufficiency since her date of transplant with a rise in creatinine from 0.5 to 3.9 on day of admission to ICU.
Breast cancer diagnosed in [**2181**] as inflammatory Stage III treated with mastectomy, XRT, and bone marrow transplant #1 which was autologous.
Also treated with Adriamycin at that time.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
History of ulcerative proctitis with perirectal abscess in [**Month (only) **] of '[**87**] treated with Flagyl and Cipro.
General appearance:  Pursed-lipped female in moderate respiratory distress using all accessory muscles including abdominal muscles.
Intubation was uneventful without complications.
Patient also had febrile neutropenia and was covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics at this time including acyclovir, caspofungin, meropenem, Vancomycin, Cipro to cover patient broadly given neutropenic status, volume overload with questioned pneumonia and respiratory failure.
Of note, the patient had anasarca after weeks in the ICU with volume repletion and was placed on Natrecor for a short while to assist with diuresis (There is a question of a sulfa allergy, thus Lasix was not given).
Natrecor was discontinued on [**9-2**], and the patient subsequently autodiuresed very well with excellent urine output and currently has no renal issues except for elevated BUN, which is improving daily.
Anemia:  Patient is status post matched-unrelated donor allogenic bone marrow transplant on [**8-4**].
The patient had numerous schistocytes on peripheral blood smear as well as thrombocytopenia and delta MS.
Given persistent hemolytic anemia, patient was ultimately placed on plasmapheresis for likely TTP thought to be due to cyclosporin.
Patient did require multiple platelet transfusions over her four week ICU course.
However, upon development of TTP during the last 10 days or so of her ICU stay, she did not require any platelet transfusions.
Of note aside from TTP, it was felt that her persistent thrombocytopenia could be due to lack of engraftment of platelets and failure of new bone marrow to produce new platelets.
Despite a diagnosis of TTP, it was felt safe to transfuse patient with platelets for less than 10,000 or evidence of gross bleed, however, the patient did not require any platelet transfusions since her diagnosis of TTP upon time of transfer to medical floor.
Patient had received IV Ativan, however, her hepatic and renal appearance was almost normal and this was unlikely the cause of her persistent mental status changes and obtundation for greater than 36 hours.
Ultimately, when the question of TTP was raised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], her cyclosporin was discontinued as this was thought to be the cause of TTP, and patient's mental status improved significantly after discontinuation of cyclosporin.
It is felt that there is nothing to do except aggressive rehab and to treat patient's underlying problem.
Patient subsequently started on plasmapheresis on [**2188-9-5**].
Cyclosporin was discontinued approximately [**9-2**], and patient's mental status improved significantly.
She was treated with Solu-Medrol 125 IV x1, Benadryl 50 mg IV x1, Benadryl 25 mg p.o.
She has done very well on this regimen, and this should be continued for premedication every day that she is plasmapheresed.
Graft-versus-host disease:  Patient was originally on steroids and cyclosporin, however, it is currently felt that the cyclosporin has precipitated TTP.
Patient is continued on high dosed Solu-Medrol 40 mg IV b.i.d.
for immunosuppression and prevention of graft-versus-host disease.
She is followed closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] and the Bone Marrow Transplant attendings and at present steroids are her only immunosuppressant.
She was covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals as well as antifungals.
Patient received Vancomycin for three days until her sensitivities returned as amp-sensitive Enterococcus.
The patient subsequently changed to ampicillin 2 grams IV q.8.
for treatment of presumed line colonization.
None of these subsequent cultures have returned positive.
Patient should receive ampicillin through Hickman line for 14 days for treatment of line contamination.
Given patient's poor access, this was not optimal, thus patient was treated through the line and seems to be doing clinically very well.
Access:  The patient had left subclavian quad placed upon arrival to Intensive Care Unit which was subsequently changed over to a left subclavian plasmapheresis line with a side port for TPN by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2188-9-5**].
She has a right subclavian Hickman, which was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2188-7-23**].
Patient has no peripheral IV access given anasarca and difficult stick.
Nutrition:  Patient was given TPN for nutrition throughout her ICU stay given her ventilatory status.
At time of transfer, patient is able to swallow, however, due to lack of appetite, weakness, and epigastric discomfort, patient's p.o.
Thus, she is continued on TPN for nutrition until her p.o.
As all medications were discontinued for bone marrow transplant, patient has been off this angiolytic since early [**Month (only) **].
She has experienced significant anxiety regarding her very difficult ICU course and multiple procedures and interventions.
She has done well on Klonopin and Ativan.
Patient appears to do better with short-acting benzodiazepines such as Versed as against Ativan which appears to make patient somewhat confused for long periods of time.
Graft-versus-host disease status post allogenic matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant.
Caspofungin 35 mg IV q.d.
Acyclovir 400 mg IV b.i.d.
Solu-Medrol 40 mg IV b.i.d.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Ativan 1 mg IV q.4-6h.
Nexium 40 mg p.o.
Nystatin swish and swallow.
Ampicillin 2 grams IV q.8.
