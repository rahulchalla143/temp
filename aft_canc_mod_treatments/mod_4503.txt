He was initially started on Levofloxacin and Unasyn, which was later transitioned to ticarcillin/clavulanate.
Course was also complicated by a blocked J tube, which was evaluted by Surgery, who felt that this should be corrected by surgery at [**Hospital1 18**] since the tube was placed here.

[**2123-8-15**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIA WITH IV AND PER-J TUBE CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1022**] is an 87 year old Korean-speaking gentleman with metastatic gastric cancer s/p subtotal gastrectomy/transverse colectomy/feeding jejunostomy 3 months ago, who had been treated at an outside hospital for aspiration pneumonia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for clogged j-tube.
Upon arrival to the ED, his tube was no longer clogged, but he did have nausea/vomiting after tube feeds.
He was not continued on antibiotics, as he had received a sufficient course and had no fever/leukocytosis/cough.
Upon arrival, the patient had not received tube feeds for a few days and his nutritional status was extremely poor.
Tube feeds also resulted in extreme nausea/vomiting; CT scan showed that there was no obstruction distal to the j-tube, but he did have extensive abdominal ascites and peritoneal implants.
He was started on PPN, and after the family meeting he was allowed to eat thin liquids and pureed solids by mouth.
The patient tolerated this well, and per Palliative Care recs he was given IV Decadron to stimulate appetite, which helped him.
Respiratory Therapy suctioned him; secretions were removed but O2 saturation rose to the 90's only once he was on 100% face tent.
The patient agreed with this plan, and was aware that his respiratory status would likely require further intervention.
--- Mr. [**Known lastname **] overall status continued to decline; he became extremely air-hungry, and this was treated with morphine PRN.
