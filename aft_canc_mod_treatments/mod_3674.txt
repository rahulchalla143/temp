A central line was placed for administration of fluids after which time his blood pressure improved to 127/4.
He was started empirically on Flagyl and Levoquin for cholangitis and he was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He was started on ampicillin to cover for enterococcus.
An ERCP was performed which revealed a previously placed biliary metal stent whic was blocked with debris and sludge.
Cannulation of the metal stent in biliary duct was performed and the sludge and debris were extracted successfully using a 8.5 mm balloon.
A 10 cm by 10 Fr plastic biliary stent was placed successfully into the metal stent.
He was switched to oral antibiotics and discharged with a two week course.
Previous FNA biopsies have been unrevealing and current metal stent preclues a biopsy with subsequent ERCP.
Mr. [**Known lastname 69523**] has an appointment with radiation oncology to determine if cyberknife is possible to be used in conjunction with chemotherapy with a curative intent.
He will subsequently follow-up in oncology clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to determine chemotherapy options.
3) Atrial Fibrillation-  Mr. [**Known lastname 69523**] has intermittent atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization.
He was continued on his home digoxin and a level was found to be 0.4mg.
He was discharged on his previous home regimen on metoprolol and digoxin.
Also, given his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during this admission and his presumed hypercoagulability due to pancreatic cancer, Mr. [**Known lastname 69523**] was started on Lovenox to be continued after discharge.
Lovenox was chosen in favor of Coumadin given that it may be more easily discontinued prior to diagnostic procedures.
He was advised to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management of anticoagulation.
5) s/p Fall- This fall was thought to be due to weakness in the setting of his sepsis.
