Admission Date:  [**2129-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-4-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-12-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zosyn  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**] Chief Complaint: Febrile neutropenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: video assisted thoracic surgery with chest tube and Pleurex catheter placement; subsequent removal of chest tube   History of Present Illness: 48 yo male with h/o HIV and metastatic bladder CA s/p taxotere [**2129-3-4**], recently discharged after admission for w/u of L pleural effusion admitted from clinic with fever/neutropenia.
He has recently taken 2 weeks of levofloxacin followed by Zosyn from [**Date range (1) 79037**] for empiric coverage of a L side effusion that is now thought to be malignant.
He has completed 3 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine and Cis-platinum completed on [**2128-7-29**].
He recently was considered for a trial, but due to risk of interaction with his psychiatric medications, has elected to pursue single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] therapy-- Cycle 1 Day 1 of Taxotere was administered on [**2129-3-3**].
Past Medical History: Diverting Ileostomy [**2128-11-19**] recurrent SBO [**1-21**] metastatic disease HIV- CD4 612/ VL: undetectable as of [**9-24**] Metastatic Bladder CA (as above) Bipolar - hospitalization in [**2125**] at [**Hospital1 **] for psychosis h/o MRSA infection GERD h/o herpes simplex hypogonadism recent pna   Social History: Occasional ETOH [**1-22**] drinks/wk, denies h/o abuse h/o Heroin, Meth, Marijuana Smoking 1 pack/day.
ostomy dressing - c/d/i, no sign of infxn.
SKIN- erythemetous pustular rash over anterior and posterior torso.
He was treated with aztreonam (cephalosporins avoided due to recent severe drug rash from zosyn) and vancomycin.
He continued to spike to 103; Diflucan was added for fungal coverage on [**3-13**].
Antibiotics were narrowed to vancomycin and metronidazole, to continue through [**2129-4-23**].
The patient had been on ZOsyn during his previous admission for empiric coverage of his pleural effusion; the medication was discontinued on the day prior to this admission at which point the patient had started to develop a mild rash.
He was treated supportively with antihistamines and lotion; the rash improved within a few days.
He received 2 thoracenteses during his prior admission with removal of 1.5 L each time; unfortunately the fluid from the second tap was lost and not sent for analysis.
A repeat thoracentesis was performed on [**3-14**] and the patient eventually had video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for both pleurodesis and chest tube as well as Pleurex catheter placement.
Post-operatively, the chest tube clottted and was removed.
The Pleurex catheter clotted, as well, and tPA was administered.
Subsequently, there was significant bleeding into the L hemithorax requiring 16 units of PRBCs and 2 units FFP.
The L hemithorax remains opacified on CXR, likely a combination of clotted blood and effect of pleurodesis; the Pleurex catheter drains only small amounts of fluid, but as the clotted blood degrades, more fluid may be drainable via the Pleurex.
He is comfortable on room air but requires supplemental oxygen at night, which is best provided with humidification because of his sensitive mucus membranes and recent mucositis.
Recent CD4 check low at 80, however, this was checked during acute illness s/p steroids and chemo so thought to be spurious value per ID consult last admit.
He was continued on his outpatient medication regimen.
He was continued on his home medication regimen.
The ileostomy appliance should be applied with as large a margin as is feasible to prevent irritation to the stump.
