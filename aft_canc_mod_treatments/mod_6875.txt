He was evaluated by oncology who recommended palliative radiation, but he was unable to tolerate it due to claustrophobia.
He intermittently refused treatment and was evaluated by psychiatry and thought to be overall competent.
He was treated with ancef and vancomycin givne MRSA colonization, as well as acinetobacter and polymicrobial infection.
He requested discharge AMA on [**3-9**], but per the records, he subsequently requested transfer to a tertiary care facility for possible surgical treatment.
He did receive some treatment at [**Hospital1 3278**], where he was initially seen, but he refused the offered surgery with eye resection and radiation.
Physical Exam: Physical exam on discharge: Tm 97.3 Tc 97.1 BP 106/74 HR 80 R 20 O2 Sat 99% on RA Gen- NAD, cachectic, comfortable in bed but occassionally picking at face and wound dressing Skin- erythema and swelling around right eye HEENT- large, fungating, purulent and foul smelling mass on left face with serosanguinous drainage.
Limited evaluation due to the patient's cooperation and physical status.
He was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] MICU where he underwent successful embolization of bilateral sphenopalatine artery.
He required two more unit of pRBCs after embolization for drifting HCT associated with oozing from his mass.
Radiation Oncology was consulted for palliative radiation; however, this was not pursued as patient was previously unable to tolerate radiation treatment.
Repeat embolization procedure was discussed with Neuro IR, but the decision was made not to proceed with the procedure as the patient would again have to be electively intubated for the procedure and the bleeding had subsided with conservative measures.
A meeting was held involving the ICU team, Ethics, Social Work and Palliative Care where it was decided that there would not be any more interventions for this mass and that it was within the province of the physicians treating the patient to decide not to intervene in this situation.
Respiratory Status: Patient underwent nasotracheal intubation in preparation for elective embolization by Neuro IR.
The placement of his nasotracheal tube was never ideal and was not able to be passed further because it was already hubbed to his nose.
He underwent bronchoscopy for reexpansion of the left lung.
He was treated with an 8-day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn for a ventilator-associated pneumonia.
He was initially covered with cefazolin and ciprofloxacin with clindamycin for oral secretions empirically.
With concern for VAP during his mucous plugging event, his antibiotics were changed to vanc/zosyn, which covered his wound culture from OSH by sensitivities.
At the time of discharge, he is no longer on any antibiotics for his wound as he is CMO.
Given overall goals of care, no further intervention was pursued.
There will be no further interventions for the mass.
