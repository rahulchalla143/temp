Immunostain for SV40 ([**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus) is negative.
Unusual pattern of non-enhancing uniform T1- and T2-hyperintensity confined to the right basal ganglia, of unclear etiology, but likely secondary to the adjacent extensive tumor and peritumoral edema, perhaps on the basis of altered perfusion (though there is no evidence of frank infarction); a less likely consideration is direct tumor infiltration.
COMMENT: Focused MRI with spectrscopy, arterial-spin label perfusion, and dynamic susceptibility perfusion analysis has been recommended, to better characterize both the primary process and the findings in the ipsilateral basal ganglia.
Further pathologic T1-hyperintensity within the right basal ganglia, and in cortex overlying the zones of white matter edema, of uncertain clinical significance.
He subsequently underwent right sided biopsy to identify pathology.
During his medical flight to MA, he experienced SOB and desaturations and upon landing was taken to an OSH ED where he was intubated and later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a subsegmental PE was identified.
Neuro-oncology and radiation oncology consults were obtained, and secondary to the inadequacy of documentation provided, it was recommended to pursue an additional biopsy.
However, due to lack of legal documentation to identify the ex-wife as the health care proxy, guardianship and guidance was initiated with the legal department.
These findings were discusse with GI and endocrien respectively and recommmended following labs periodically.
For his demyelinating lesion he completed 5 days of 1gm/day IV solumedrol and 5 days of IVIG without any response.
He had another MRI without significant change and then underwent Cytoxan induction.
During induction he was aggresively hydrated, treated with mesna and had daily UA's.
He had minimal amount of RBC's in urine which cleared with hydration and resolved after finishing the course of cytoxan.
He will follow-up with neurology clinic where they will discuss continuing cytoxan at that time.
