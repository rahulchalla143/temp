- [**5-/2174**]: found to have a pelvic mass highly suspicious for recurrent disease, started on systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin at [**Hospital6 **].
Due to a resurgence of his pain following three cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin, the patient wished to  receive further chemotherapy, but he was unable to receive chemotherapy at [**Hospital6 **] due to multiple urine toxicology screens positive for cocaine and other illicit substances.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12279**] is a 46 yo male with metastatic bladder cancer with disease progression on chemo who went to a urology clinic appt [**3-20**] for suprapubic discomfort, had a foley catheter placed with minimal urine output and was found to have hyperkalemia and [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of neutropenia.
Urology was consulted and felt that urological procedure (ie stents) was not possible and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were indicated if this was within pt's goals of care.
He felt that he wanted the procedure as a palliative measure and as a way to help transition home.
On [**2176-3-21**] he had bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes placed with good urine output after the procedure.
Renal was consulted and felt that the procedure was indicated for palliation and improvement as a means to a bridge to home.
Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus were all very elevated, HCT and sodium decreased.
He was given insulin and calcium gluconate as well as Kayexalate x2.
He is on chronic narcotics at home.
His discomfort was largely associated with his constipation, and in an effort to make him have a BM, methylnaltrexone was given without effect.
Patient was still passing gas, so we felt it was safe to send him home with an aggressive bowel regimen of lactulose, senna, docusate and bisacodyl both PO and PR.
He was prescribed keflex on the day of admission but did not receive a dose.
He was given vanc and cefepime x1 in ED and was continued on that regimen while in the MICU and was dosed based on his renal function.
No plans for treatment while in the ICU.
Palliative care was consulted for assistance with symptom management and overall goals of care.
While he was nauseaus and not tolerating oral meds, he was placed on a dilaudid drip to control his pain.
He takes enoxaparin 60mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
His dose was held on admission in anticipation of procedure (perc nephrostomy)with the goal of transitioning back to his home dose enoxaparin if perc nephrostomy tubes improve kidney function to baseline.
He was transitioned to comfort care with hospice at home, and discharged directly from the ICU.
