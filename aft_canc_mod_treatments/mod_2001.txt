He was placed on broad antibiotics coverage with vanc/zosyn and azithromycin to cover atypicals.
His oxygenation improved initially, as did his DIC parameters, after treatment with oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
Pulmonary was consulted and felt that antibiotics could be stopped, as there was no clear infectious pulmonary process.
Despite a second course of chemotherapy with irinotecan and docetaxol, his respiratory status continued to worsen.
Given the worsening DIC, he was started on morphine drip for comfort.
His DIC parameters improved with transfusion of 2 bag of plts, 2U FFP, 5 IV Vit K, and 2x PRBCs and showed initial improvement after oxaliplatin and 5-FU in the ICU.
However, after several days he again developed DIC, and salvage chemotherapy with irinotecan and docetaxol was unsuccessful.
Metastatic Esophageal Adenocarcinoma with Bone Marrow Involvement For his metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma, he received cycle 6 of oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
When DIC developed again, he was given irinotecan and docetaxol.
S/p AVR His AVR, bovine valve, was stable and he was not on any anticoagulation at baseline.
On the morning of [**8-26**], his breaths became more agonal and morphine was increased, titrated to comfort.
