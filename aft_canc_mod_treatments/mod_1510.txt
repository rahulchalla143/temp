# Septic Shock - Felt to be most likely [**1-24**] urosepsis given + urine cultures (40,000 e. coli and +group B strep) and h/o urosepsis with only 10,000 pseudomonas growing in urine 3 yrs ago after urologic procedure.
Ddx includes gastroenteritis (viral and bacterial), aspiration pneumonia, biliary source.
Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
Pt initially covered broadly for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime, flagyl, azithro all started on [**2130-2-17**].
Patient required a period of mechanical ventilation and pressors (levophed) but responded well to treatment.
Ultimately, his antibiotics coverage was narrowed to Cefpodoxime for a full 14 day course for pneumonia and UTI.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line placement.
Started diuresis on evening of [**2130-2-19**] given increasing rales, CVP of 15.
Diuresed well with IV Lasix with improvement in his respiratory status.
Upon transfer to the Medicine floors, Lasix was briefly held given his acute renal insufficiency, with improvement in his Creatinine.
# Emesis - Possibly secondary to urosepsis vs viral/bacterial gastroenteritis vs pneumonia vs. intubation/sedation.
Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admission.
Patient's lasix and lisinopril were briefly held upon transfer to the regular Medicine floor, and he was encouraged to liberalize his PO fluid intake, with good gradual improvement of his Creatinine back to baseline.
His lasix and lisinopril are scheduled to be restarted on [**2130-2-25**].
# AVR/CHB pacer dependent - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] on coumadin.
Supratherapeutic likely [**1-24**] ketoconazole interaction and then antibiotics interaction (patient received levaquin at OSH).
Coumadin continues to be held in setting of elevated INR.
When his INR was 7+, given risk for falls, patient received Vitamin K 2mg PO X1 which dropped his INR to 1.3.
Given concerns for thrombolic events with his prosthetic valve, patient was started on heparin gtt.
He was also resumed on Warfarin 5mg daily.
he was offerred a PICC but refused.
Heparin gtt should be continued for 48 hours after INR is therapeutic 2.5-3.5.
# Delirium: Patient was hyperactively delirious in the ICU, likely due to the multiple factors of ICU admission, recent intubation, sedative/hypnotic medications, stress dose steroids, pneumonia/UTI etc.
He was treated with Zydis given concern for laryngospasms with Haldol, to good effect.
Delirium precautions were maintained and brief hypernatremia was aggressively managed with D5 1/2NS.
- Continue delirium precautions: OOB --> chair, physical therapy, family at bedside when possible, maintain sleep/wake cycle, avoid sedative/hypnotic medications, minimize drains/lines - Patient was found to be coughing with pills.
Continue aspiration precautions and crush meds, moist ground solids, thin liquids, 1:1 supervision with meals - Zydis as needed  # Prostate CA: Oncology recommended repeat PSA which is elevated to 95, approximately doubled from one month ago.
po hydrocortisone initially switched to IV given shock but patient has been on home po hydrocortisone regimen since [**2130-2-20**].
