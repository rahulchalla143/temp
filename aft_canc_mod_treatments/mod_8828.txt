Today, she went to nap with her granddaughter and woke up not feeling well; she put the kid in a crib then went to lay down on the cough; unclear what exactly happened but she "fell onto the couch" and when she woke up was covered with dark brownish red blood from her mouth/nose and covering her chest.
She told her PCP about the [**Name9 (PRE) 25714**] pain, who ordered a colonoscopy but she didn't have it yet.
Hct was 25.7  She was noted to look pale and unwell, with NG tube in place, abdomen benign without any tenderness.
She was started on Protonix gtt, 2 PIV's were placed, type and screened, blood was ordered.
MD at that time thought possible L sciatica contributing to LLQ pain, recommended conservative management, fiber and fluids for ?
constipation; she was also reminded that she was overdue for colonoscopy at that time.
Past Medical History: - T1, N2B squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, which was moderately differentiated, s/p left modified radical neck dissection and diagnostic tonsillar biopsy on [**2170-1-10**].
Had positive LN's, s/p radiation therapy that ended in 4/[**2172**].
F/u CT scan without evidence of recurrence, unclear when -- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] - Left mandibular pain after radiation - Mitral valve prolapse - H/o thyroid nodule - H/o positive PPD - Biapical nonspecific pulmonary nodules less than 5 mm in size noted on surveillance CT, stable per last ENT note - Uterine fibroids - LGSIL on Pap smears - H/o hematuria - Depression   Social History: No ETOH, but prior heavy use.
NGT in place, draining light pinkish fluid CTAB except light L base crackles RRR without m/g Abd soft NT ND, benign No BLE edema.
We did not suspect LLQ pain was relevant, given that these symptoms had been present for 6 mos to 1 yr. She received supportive care for GI bleed including PIV x3, Octreotide gtt, IVF's, 2u PRBC's and had EGD the day after admission which showed duodenitis in the proximal duodenum and small ulcer at GE junction.
Of note the pt became oversedated and had an apneic episode at the end of the EGD which was likely due to the Fentanyl/Versed; she received Narcan and Flumazenil, was bag-masked, and did not need to be intubated although a respiratory code had been called.
She was monitored with serial Hct's and eventually switched from PPI gtt to IV bid.
