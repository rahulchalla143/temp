Infant was born by a Cesarean section due to maternal preterm contractions and ongoing concern of lack of growth, oligohydramnios and absent end diastolic flow.
Mother received betamethasone on [**1-10**] and 15th.

Infant had a very large anterior fontanel with splitting of the sagittal sutures and large posterior fontanel.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the NICU, intubated for management of apnea and surfactant deficiency.
The infant received 2 doses of Surfactant and was extubated to C-pap within 24 hours of age.
She remained on C- Pap for a total of 4 days, at which time she transitioned to nasal cannula which she remains on at 100% oxygen at 25 cc l flow that went up to 50-75 cc l flow for feeds.
She did not recieve methylxanthine therapy and only had occasional apneic and bradycardiac episodes, not requiring intervention.She has been free of these episodes for > 5 days prior to discharge.
The infant was initially started on 80 cc per kg per day of D-10-W. Enteral feedings were initiated on day of life #3.
She was on enteral feeds of 138 cc/kg and remaining peripheral IV which required slow weaning because of hypoglycemia when  trialed off IV.
The concentration of IV glucose was weaned slowly from D10 to D5.
IV was discontinued on [**2-21**] and she went to full enteral feeds at 160 cc/kg of breastmilk 30 and remained euglycemic on a q 3 hour schedule, with gavaged feeds over 1 hour.
She received phototherapy and the issue had resolved.
