On [**9-30**] she developed fevers treated with Moxifloxicin QOD.
For the past several days she has c/o intermittent but persistent L. sided flank pain for several days.
On the floor, she was continued on vancomycin and cefepime for prseumed pneumonia.
She undewent thoracentesis of the left pleural effusion with removal of 80-100cc exudative fluid with presence of fibrin clots in serosanguinous fluid and a chest tube was placed.
There was a question on follow up CXR about chest tube position.
The chest tube has put out about 20cc of fluid since placement.
She was placed on a morphine PCA and ativan for pain/anxiety control with some improvement in her symptoms.
She was admitted on [**2167-10-19**] for a sibling match allo transplant with Bu/Cy conditioning regimen.
Her transplant course was very complicated by: - Pneumonia, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring transfer to ICU and intubation - Acute Renal Failure requiring hemodialysis - Neutropenic Fever - Confusion - Fall with small head bleed on CT - Rash from GVH - Anemia requiring multiple transfusions - Thrombocytopenia requiring multiple transfusions - Multiple skin lesions - GVH of liver  Other Past Medical History: 1.

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2168-10-12**]):       This is a low yield procedure based on our in-house studies.
IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 85545**]          ([**2168-10-17**]).
imaging:  CXR [**2168-10-23**]: Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo female with history of MPD/MDS, s/p BMT 1 yr ago, who is admitted with fevers, neutropenia/pancytopenia and splenic infarct and splenomegaly, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with acute respiratory distress, with rapidly expanding left pleural effusion.
chest tube placed [**10-9**] PM drained ~920 cc of blood-colored thin fluid.
Improved on abx, then developed RLL presumed VAP, found to be stenotrophomonas, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftaz (bactrim best but patient has sulfa allergy, resistant to levoflox).
On broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/voriconazole/ceftazidime/acyclovir ppx) ID following, initially was on stress dose steroids, now weaned to daily IV 20mg dose for GVHD.
Her CT scan revealed pan lobar consolidation of LUL/ LLL and patchy involvement in the RLL too with drainage of the pleural space with the chest tube.
Patient was continued on abx regimen since culture data nonspecific/pending (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/voriconazole/levoflox/acyclovir ppx).
Patient was CT scanned which corroborated with infiltrate as opposed to edema and patient was bronch'ed on [**10-17**], minimal secretions noted, growing stenotrophomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftaz (bactrim best but patient has sulfa allergy; resistant to levoflox).
Patient continued on ceftaz(course length to be dictated by ID, likely 2 wks), vancomycin(today [**10-23**] is day [**9-12**], can stop afterwards), vori (can d/c, will need to f/u with ID), & acyclovir ppx.
Chest tube has since been removed with no complications.
Patient initially headed to tracheostomy route but ended up responding beautifully to ceftaz and was extubated [**2168-10-22**].
Antifungal coverage had been changed to micafungin on [**10-27**].
CXR showed worsening R sided pleural effusion and she underwent therapeutic thoracentesis with placement of a pigtail catheter with drainage of >1L serosanguinous fluid, exudative which was removed [**11-1**].
She was started on Vancomycin at time of ICU transfer for possible worsening on chest CT of infectious process.
She was weaned to 3L NC with RR in 20s and was deemed stable for transfer back to floor on [**10-30**].
She also required PLT and PRBC transfusion at this time.
Thoracic surgery placed a new chest tube on the right while intubated with some effect.
Antibiotics were broadened to include tigecycline but the patient continued to require maximal ventilatory support.
Patient now recovering with increased UOP with no acute indication for HD and will likely not require further.
HD line pulled [**10-30**].
Responded to boluses currently when hypotensive earlier in course.
# MDS s/p SCT and PANCYTOPENIA: s/p transplant from sister [**2167-10-27**].
She remains neutropenic on GCSF G-CSF and NPlate, afebrile now.
Will continue folic acid, neupogen as per BMT team.
IVIG therapy was given on [**2168-10-11**].
Pentamidine per BMT for pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
# GVHD: past GVH of skin and liver: have continued to monitor LFTs, on baseline 20mg IV steroids daily, changed to 30mg IV methylprednisolone [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-30**].
# HSV LESIONS (perineal): continue acyclovir 5% cream for local lesion and acyclovir 400mg PO BID for prophylaxis.
