The visualized portions of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
[**2176-10-31**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced, on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and milrinone infusions.
There is an intra-aortic balloon pump in place 3 cm distal to the takeoff of the right subclavian artery.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.
The patient is on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and milrinone infusions.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-10-30**], left ventricular function is now mildly depressed and bioprosthetic aortic valve is now in place.
[**11-11**] CXR: Sternal cerclage wires are intact.
A left-sided PICC catheter tip appears stable in position in the mid SVC.
A right IJ line has been removed.
Received 20 mg IV Lasix in ED, 20 mg IV Lasix on the floor, and 40 mg IV Lasix x2.
Was placed on Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-25**] with initial good UOP with net negative on [**10-26**] of 1.5 L which decreased to ~700 ml net negative on [**10-27**] and then fell to net negative 175 ml on [**10-28**] and on [**10-29**] Lasix drip ([**5-26**] ml/ hr) was initiated to titrate to goal net negative of [**1-13**].5L daily.
He was taken to the Cath Lab, where an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in preparation for surgical mitral valve repair.
Rate has been better controlled since admission and remained in the low 100s with metoprolol tartrate 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
CHADS2 score was 3; anticoagulation was continued with heparin gtt, holding off on Coumadin now due to possibility of surgery.
# Mitral valve insufficiency:  Initial presentation was likely [**2-14**] progression of MV dz, or rupture of chordae, mitral valve prolapse.
[**Month (only) 116**] restart Heparin gtt and Aspirin.
Safe for Coumadin therapy if required.
Op/Post-op course: Cardiac surgery recommended Mitral valve replacement and MAZE and he underwent appropriate work-up for surgery.
On [**10-31**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve replacement and MAZE procedure.
Please see operative note for surgical details.
Initially on transfer to the CVICU, patient required multiple Inotropes and Vasopressor support with an extremely low mixed venous SaO2 at 48% and cardiac index of 1.5 with on Epinephrine and Levophed.
He was therefore transferred to the operating room and underwent emergent coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein graft to the distal circumflex system.
Over the next several days he remained sedated and intubated, pressors were slowly weaned and Amiodarone and Coumadin were started for atrial fibrillation.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed, beta-blockers and diuretics were started and he was diuresed towards his pre-op weight.
On [**11-8**] he underwent repair of his pseudoaneurysm with thrombin injection to the left superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.
Following this procedure he was transferred back to the CVICU for monitoring.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
Of note, he was being treated for a stage 1 blanchable stage 1 coccyx ulcer.
Over the next couple days he continued to improve with resolving delirium and working with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
Head CT was negative for acute event, his mental status improved on reexamination in afternoon and appeared to be back at baseline.
Overnight he complained of inability to void, Flomax was started, Foley catheter was inserted and output was 450cc.
On the POD 13 he was doing well, neurologically intact and was discharged to rehab facility ([**Hospital3 2558**]) with the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
Foley will remain in place and will need a voiding trial done at rehab.
