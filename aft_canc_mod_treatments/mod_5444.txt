Admission Date:  [**2176-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-3-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: CC: Fever to 101  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy with BAL x 2 - Pulmonary biopsy on 2nd bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yo female h/o M4 AML s/p 7+3 and 4 cycles of HIDAC (last [**2176-11-26**]).
She has been seen periodically since discharge to follow her counts and transfused with platelets and RBC transfusions.
Her initial bone marrow was morphologically consistent with AML (type M4) with some monocytic differentiation and her cells were CD34, HLA-DR, CD11c, CD33, CD13, CD64, and CD117 positive and CD41, CD56, and glycophorin A negative.
FISH analysis for an AML1-ETO rearrangement, PML-RARA rearrangement, and a CBFB rearrangement were all negative.
On [**6-28**] she began 7+3 induction chemotherapy with three days of idarubicin 20 mg and seven days of cytarabine 170 mg. A day 14 bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of leukemia.
Improving ground-glass and solid nodules, which have a right upper lobe predominance.
These likely represent cysts and could be further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI.
Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast/lymphocyte yield.

M4 AML:    She was admitted for febrile neutropenia and was cultured and started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
At this point, both MEC re-induction and a Flt3 inhibitor were considered for treatment options and a bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2176-12-16**] in hopes of putting her on a Flt3 ligand inhibitor trial.
She was treated with leukopheresis, hydrea, and blood product support and eventually her DIC stabilized.
Prior to starting clofarabine on [**1-3**], she developed a productive cough and was found to have multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules on chest CT, suspicious for fungal infection vs miliary tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis was ruled out with sputum samples and a bronchoscopy, including a transbronchial biopsy, was negative for an infectious source.
She tolerated clofarabine fairly well developing described side effects of elevated LFTs (one dose was held for one day) and palmar-plantar erythema-dysesthesia.
Febrile neutropenia: On admission, she was started on empiric antibiotics but she continued to have low grade fevers around 100 to 101 with occasional elevations to 103-104.
The ID service was involved throughout her hospitalization and her antibiotic coverage was gradually expanded to include several antibiotics including courses of levofloxacin, aztreonam, flagyl, caspofungin, voriconazole, ambisome, vancomycin, daptomycin, meropenem, and acyclovir.
It was eventually thought that her fevers were most likely due to her leukemia and when she was transitioned to comfort measures, she was given tylenol around the clock to control her temperature.
She was stabilized on BiPAP and transferred back to the oncology floor.
She was comfortable alternating between a BiPAP machine and a non-rebreather.
She was transferred back to the oncology floor on [**1-24**], her antibiotics were discontinued, a morphine drip was started and she passed away on [**2177-1-31**].
