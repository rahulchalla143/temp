During admission, his home lasix and lisinopril were discontinued and his metoprolol and imdur were decreased.
He was discharged to rehab to complete 2L NS infusion.
He was evaluated by speech and swallow for dysphagia and palliative care was involved in goals of care discussion where family was clear about wishes for continued aggressive measures during that stay.
Patient was given 80mg IV lasix with 600cc output, nitro gtt, 4mg IV morphine, antibiotic coverage for suspected hospital acquired pneumonia (ceftriaxone 1gm, levaquin 750mg IV, and vancomycin 1gm IV).
He was placed on CPAP with improvement.
Labs were significant for troponin 0.36, creatinine 1.7, WBC 11.6 with left shift.
Pt was admitted to the ICU p/w s/s of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive urgency, likely secondary to CRI where meds were decreased.
Due to low clinical suspicion regarding hospital-acquired pneumonia, pt was discontinued from ceftriaxone and vancomyin and kept on levaquin.

Prior to the MICU admission, lisinopril and lasix had been discontinued, while the imdur and BB had decreased.
Prior to MICU, the lisinopril/lasix had been d/c'd, and imdur and BB decreased.
Pt tolerated diuresis and responded well to IV lasix, which was later switched to PO administration.
Strict input and output levels were maintained, and showed that pt was tolerating aggressive diuresis.
The goal of diuresis for each day was approximately 500cc-1L per day.
There was also a suspected right lower lobe pneumonia that was treated with levofloxacin for a 1 week duration (renal dosage).
Speech and swallow had evaluted patient and deemed him unable to take anything by mouth, and pt was kept NPO until family and patient could agree upon next step in management, with guidance from medical team.
Pt and family ultimately decided for him to undergo repeat video swallow study which he passed, and the following recommendations were made: moist, ground solids, nektar thickened liquids, pills crushed with applesauce, and sips of thin liquids in between meals.
He is still a known chronic aspirator despite the results of video speech and swallow, and goals of care for nutrition should continue to be addressed at rehab.
He was unable to tolerate thickened liquids, and was ultimately sent for repeat video swallow analysis as per above.
Hypertension: Was controlled with hydralazine and isosorbide, with a goal SBP of 130-140 range.
During this admission, pt also developed constipation, which was treated with senna, colace, dulculax, and finally enema.
Chronic renal insufficency: patient maintained a stable creatinine level that was close to baseline despite aggressive diuresis.
