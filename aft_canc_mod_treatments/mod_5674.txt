Given the patient's recent copious diarrhea, no signs of infection (no fever, no tachycardia), and quick response to IV fluids, hypotension likely [**1-10**] hypovolemia.
The patient recieved 2 L of further maintenace fluids the night after admission.
The acidosis resolved with treatment of his underlying process.
# Cholangitis: The patient was treated with IV antibiotics throughout his course, and was transitioned to oral antibiotics at the time of discharge.
Upon review of his recent LFTs by the ERCP team, there was a question if the biliary obstruction noted at the time of the additional stent placement could have occurred gradually in the recent past.
# Tranaminitis with jaundice: The patient was noted to have a cholestatic picture in the setting of requiring a new stent in addition to the prior stents.
This pain was likely related to his cholangitis and functional biliary obstruction, which improved after stent placement and treatment of his infection.
One episode of chest pain later in the admission occurred with a large dose of oral potassium.
