Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old male with multiple medical problems including diastolic HF, [**Name (NI) 7792**], CVA in [**5-20**] with baseline L hemiparesis and limited vocalization, Alzheimer's dementia, and hx of multiple resistant infections, recent admission in [**8-21**] with similar presentation, admitted from nursing home with fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia found to have sepsis/PNA.
Hypovolemic Shock and Sepsis:He was originally admitted to the medical ICU with leukocytosis and tachypnea.
A central venous femoral catheter was placed for access.
He was noted to have a right apical infiltrate and enlarging right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray.
Given his history of MRSA and ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, he was started on vancomycin and meropenen for a total course of 14 days.
He was given IV fluids in the ED and in the ICU.
He was given 1 amp of atropine and 1 amp of sodium bicarbonate.
Levophed was increased and 2 liters of normal saline were bolused.
He was thought to be significantly hypovolemic given an increased BUN/Cr ratio, hypernatremia and physical exam.
He was given IVF boluses and the levophed was weaned.
He had a PICC line placed in order to receive IV antibiotics at his extended care facility, and his central venous femoral catheter was discontinued.
Hypernatremia: He had persistent hypernatremia after fluid resuscitation and antibiotic initiation.
He was felt to be hypovolemic and his hypernatremia improved with free water boluses via his G tube and D5W administration.
His leukocytosis has trended down consistent with resolving infection in the setting of successful antibiotic therapy.
Hypertension: He is on captopril, metoprolol, and clonidine as outpatient.
He was restarted on low dose metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID during his stay and his blood pressure tolerated this well.
He is being discharged on his home doses of metoprolol, clonidie, and captopril.
He was managed with his home Lantus and insulin sliding scale and did not require an insulin drip.
After initial fluid resuscitation and treatment, his blood sugars remained well-controlled.
He was started on heparin gtt in ED.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and he was monitored on telemetry.
The heparin drip was discontinued in the MICU as it was not believed he had an ischemic event.
