[**2118**]- anal fissure repair [**2105**] ??????
Father had CABG at age 54 and s/p pacer but alive at 87.
She had very significant pain that required ultimately placement of intrathecal catheter(with dilaudid/bupivacaine/clonidine), dilaudid drip, morphine pca, iv ketamine drip, flexeril, baclofen, neurontin, NSAIDS and her usual fentanyl patch.
She was evaluated by radiation oncology, who reviewed her old records from GWU and discerned that she could receive additional  radiation therapy to her spine.
She had to be intubated and under general anaesthesia in order to tolerate her radiation planning and several of her first radiation treatments.
The last few of her radiation treatments did not require this as her pain was better controlled.
She was sent to the ICU twice during this course; once for pain control/intensive nursing after an especially explosive attack of pain, and again for monitoring when her pain regimen was increased.
Pentobarbital drip was started which brought relief.
