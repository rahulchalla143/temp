Additionally, the stomach mucosa was irregular, but no biopsy was performed at the time of endoscopy because of recent bleeding.
Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma:  She is s/p LUL and LLL wedge resections in [**2129**], prior RML lobectomy, with known RUL collapse seconday to invasion, s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy, most recently 30th cycle of Alimta.
Additionally, she was continued on folic acid as an adjuct to her chemotherapy regimen.
Pulmonary Embolisms:  Last documented in [**1-31**], was on coumadin on presentation.
Given her significant GI bleed, coumadin was stopped (and its effects reversed with FFP) and a decision was made to stop anticoagulation henceforth.
Per primary oncology team, the patient's history of PE was related to tumor compression of the pulmonary vasculature, and therefore there is no clear indication for anticoagulation in the future.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor:  S/p resection in [**2121**] without known recurrence, but suspicious lesion was seen on EGD.
Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroid resection for adenoma.
Continued on home levothyroxine.
Resolved with fluid resuscitation.
Lower Extremity Edema:  Likely secondary to chemotherapy vs. venous stasis.
Intially held home lasix due to risk of hemodynamic compromise, but restarted after fluid resuscitation.
Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia: Decreased platelets could be consumptive process in setting of recent bleed but more likely related to recent chemotherapy administration.
Could also be related to PPI administration.
