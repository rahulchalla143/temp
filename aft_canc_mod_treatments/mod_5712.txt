On [**7-30**] he became febrile and hypotensive (BP 70-80s), and Ciprofloxacin was added for a UTI.
In the CCU he was diuresed and received milrinone, with successful diuresis and improvement in his respiratory status.
Since that time he has continued to diurese slowly with lasix IV, with slow improvement in his CHF on exam and CXR.
He has remained stable, with SBP 90-115 and O2 sats 95-98% on 2L.
On discharge he is felt to be slightly volume overloaded, but requires very gentle diuresis to avoid hemodynamic decompensation and intravascular volume depletion.
converted from captopril 6.25 tid to lisinopril 2.5 qhs (has been unable to tolerate higher doses secondary to hypotension) and Lasix 40 mg po qd.
His digoxin has been held due to NSVT (see below).
He has been anticoagulated on a heparin drip, but has begun to bridge to coumadin 5 mg po qd starting on [**2116-8-17**].
He has also had numerous episodes of NSVT, including one 25 beat run; he remains on Toprol 50 qd both for rate control and ectopy suppression.
This has been treated with zosyn IV (14 day course).
On [**8-13**] he again developed confusion and respiratory distress with no new infiltrate on CXR, and vancomycin IV was added for a 7 day course.
A RIJ catheter was removed.
HIT antibodies were subsequently negative x2, his platelets have recovered to >150, and he resumed a heparin drip for anticoagulation for Afib when he returned to the floor after the MICU on [**8-8**].
Since his return to the floor, his INR has slowly fallen to 1.3, and his PTT has returned to therapeutic levels on a heparin drip.
Coumadin was started on [**8-17**] for afib.
4) ID - On transfer to the CCU on [**7-31**] the patient was febrile to 104, and was treated for a UTI with ciprofloxacin.
He was transferred to floor on [**8-3**], but again became febrile to 102.4; he was transferred to the MICU for sepsis and treated with zosyn iv for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He was also found to have bilateral mastoiditis (R>L) by head CT, and was started on tobramycin drops (14 day course) to the right ear.
On [**8-13**] he again developed confusion and respiratory distress with no new infiltrate on CXR, and vancomycin IV was added for a 7 day course.
Pt's right IJ line placed on [**8-5**], a possible source (although culture negative) was removed.
On the day of discharge he is on day 11 of 14 of zosyn, day 5 of 7 of vanco, and day 11 of 14 of tobramycin drops.
Lasix has been titrated to pt's creatinine level.
He has consistently been agitated and required Zydis as well as 1:1 sitters for the majority of his floor stay, although he has become calmer and more oriented in the last several days.
Ammonia, B12, and folate levels were normal at discharge.
It was not felt that he required further neurologic workup at this time and will hopefully improve with resolution of his CHF and infections.
