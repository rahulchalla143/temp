While infection must be excluded, these findings may be secondary to trauma in the setting of pre-existing CPPD arthropathy.
Circumferential thickening of the right pleura in the setting of prior asbestos exposure.
[**11-10**] MRI SPINE Though the evaluation for spine infection is quite limited in the absence of gadolinium and further, by the significant motion degradation of image quality, 1.
L-SPINE 1.
Median sternotomy wires are again seen.
PORT LINE PLACEMENT As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated.
[**11-24**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
The sternotomy wires are unchanged.
PATHOLOGY [**11-17**] GASTRIC BIOPSY: Antral and fundic mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
He underwent cooling protocol and was discharged from the CCU in stable condition.
He was started on cefazolin (pt with PCN allergy) per ID recs.
He did have evidence of infection of his sternoclavicular joint and an aspiration was positive for MSSA, and this was thought to be resulting from his bacteremia rather than a primary infection in the context of a fall.
He will complete an 8 week course of Cefazolin 2g IV q8 (day1=[**2174-11-8**]) and should follow-up with ID on discharage and should also obtain weekly safety labs (CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, LFTs, ESR, CRP) while on antibiotics (next set of labs due [**12-10**]).
He was intubated and coded for 40 minutes, intermittently regaining pulses during the code.
NSR was finally achieved after amiodarone and defibrillation.
After completion of the cooling protocol, the patient was successfully weaned off the ventilator and extubated without difficulty.
The patient will need to follow up with EP on discharge for further assessment and evaluation.
Given these circumstances, it was decided that further intervention, including imaging or surgery requiring anesthesia, would be deferred.
He was treated with IV abx and monitored for neurological change.
Neurosurgery plans for f/u with MRI lumbar spine after completion of abx course, for which pt will be hospitalized given his inability to tolerate MRI without sedation and high risk for complications with anesthesia.
# chronic atrial fibrillation: His coumadin was initially held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR and then [**2-14**] GI bleed.
It was felt that although anticoagulation is often still used up to four weeks s/p conversion to NSR from AF, in the setting of his recent GI bleed, anticoagulation should be held.
He will be discharged on aspirin, consider restarting coumadin after colonoscopy.
He was treated for h pylori infection with flagyl, clarithromycin and IV PPI given equivicol H pylori ab screening test.
In the cardiac ICU, Clarithromycin was switched to tetracycline as it was felt that the medication was prolonging the patient's QTc.
His Metoprolol and lisinopril were titrated to BP control prior to discharge, pressures in 120s-130s on discharge however may need further titration as an outpatient for optimal control.
He was also re-started on lasix prior to discharge given his hx of volume overload as an inpatient, however at a decreased dose given that he had poor PO intake and increased bicarb while in the hospital.
Lasix and lisinopril were initially held, but restarted due to hypertension and volume overload.
He was treated with wound care per podiatry recs and continued on aspirin for his PVD.
He was treated with IV/PO lasix and metoprolol.
PO lasix dose decreased on discharge given pts poor PO intake and increased bicarb, however may need to be up-titrated as an outpatient.
Additionally, when adequate dose for BP/HR control is achieved, would consider switching to Toprol XL for cardioprotection in the context of sCHF.
#) Nutrition: Pt with poor PO intake therefore NG tube was placed when the patient returned from the cardiac intensive care unit.
Placement required IR guidance given his hx of prior nose surgeries.
He pulled the tube before reaching goal tube feeds and it was not replaced given that his PO intake was increasing.
He was cleared for ground solids and small pills with applesauce by speech and swallow, who also stated that he could be advanced to solid diet as tolerated.
#) Urinary retention: Pt failed last voiding trial prior to discharge, therefore foley was re-placed and pt discharged to rehab with foley in place.
He was continued on tamsulosin on DC.
Pt is scheduled to f/u with thoracic surgery on discharge.
#) Hyperlipidemia: His home statin was continued .
#) Anemia: Initially concerning for iron deficiency therfore was started on ferrous gluconate.
Worsened with GI bleed but improved after transfusions and stabilized.
Iron supplementation was held on discharge given his history of consitipation.

In the intensive care unit, you were stabilized and eventually returned to the medicine floor, where we decided to delay further imaging or surgery of your spine given the high risk of intervention.
You remained stable however had decreased oral intake and urinary retention, therefore you were seen by nutrition and had a foley catheter placed.
Please take your medications as prescribed and follow-up with your physicians as outlined below.
The following changes have been made to your medications: -you will need to take IV cefazolin (day 1=[**2174-11-8**] for a total of 6 weeks -please take pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth every day .
