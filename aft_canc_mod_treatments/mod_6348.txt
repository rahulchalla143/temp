[**2131-5-18**] Final pathology of mesenteric mass: PENDING ON DISCHARGE  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2520**] was taken to the operating room on [**2131-5-18**] for exploratory laparotomy given concern of ischemic colitis in the setting of an increased WBC count, rising lactate, and acute decompensation requiring pressors.
A large 3-4 cm mass in the root of the mesentery was identified and sent for pathologic analysis, which returned as a spindle cell tumor, possibly consistent with a desmoid.
An abdominal JP bulb drain was placed to suction, and the patient was taken to the surgical ICU.
His LFTs progressively trended down during his admission, and he will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2132-5-31**] for further management of his ascites.
He was requiring po zofran for nausea, and his abomdinal incision was clean/dry/intact, as was the dressing over his previous JP bulb site.
His [**2131-5-18**] blood cultures returned positive for E.Coli, for which he completed 12 days of appropriate IV antibiotics (initially with vanc/zosyn, then narrowed to ceftriaxone).
The hepatology service was involved in his inpatient care, and their recommendations were followed: he received frequent doses immediately postoperatively of albumin to prevent hepato-renal syndrome; his home aldactone was initially held, and restarted on POD5.
He will continue to take his home aldactone (50 mg [**Hospital1 **]) in an effort to help decrease his ascites.
