History of Present Illness: Patient is a 79 year old male with history of interstitial lung disease on oral prednisone taper (5-10 mg) at home, 3-4L nasal cannula oxygen at night at home, diastolic congestive heart failure, type two diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with recent NSTEMI, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status-post ex-laparotomy with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy ([**2138-9-16**]) with positive margins, common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy and percutaneous drain placement ([**2138-9-16**]) who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**10-26**] with fever, hypoxia, confusion thought to be PNA/CHF treated with levofloxacin and diuresis.
Patient was transferred from surgery to medicine on [**11-1**] after he was found to have hypoxia, with oxygen saturation of 70-80s on NC at transfer.
He was given nebs but no diuresis since [**10-31**] due to increased Cr.
He has been followed by pulmonary consult while in house - unable to get workup for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for high res CT. Has been on 5L NC and stable.
Past Medical History: -Cholangiocarcinoma - unresectable; s/p Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2138-9-16**] after had positive proximal and distal margins.
Percutaneous drain in place.

Family History: Father with DM, mother died at 97   Physical Exam: At time of admission to medical intensive care unit: GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - PMI non-displaced, RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs) SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-16**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait   Pertinent Results: High resolution chest CT [**2138-11-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Aortic valvular calcification of uncertain significance.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old male with past medical history of type two diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease status post NSTEMI with recent diagonsis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status post common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy, percutaneous drain placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
Hypoxia - Differential at time of arrival to medical intensive care unit included exacerbation of his interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] respiratory status was too tenuous to undergo bronchoscopy for further diagonostic purposes.
Given that he had been on long-standing steroids, and after a high-resolution CT was obtained as noted above, therapy for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn was initiated.
Patient was begun on steroids and bactrim for treatment of possible PCP as well.
Gentle diuresis was attempted, although it did not appear as though he was volume overloaded on exam.
He was transfused red blood cells with subsequent diuresis without improvement in his dyspnea.
He required both high flow mask of 100% oxygen as well as 10 L nasal cannula, and was only able to maintain oxygen saturations in the 80's as of [**2138-11-11**].
The patient, along with his family, pastor, and friends, made the decision to not pursue intubation or resuscitation, as the patient understood that it was unlikely that he would be able to be weaned off of the ventilator should he be intubated.
His focus shifted towards lessening the feeling of his dyspnea as his respiratory status worsened.
On the morning of [**2138-11-12**], patient expressed that he wished to stop receiving oxygen therapy and focus solely on comfort measures.
With his family at the bedside, his morphine drip was increased to provide him comfort.
