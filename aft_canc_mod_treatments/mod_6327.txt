ED labs notable for profound leukocytosis with WBC 140.1k, 90% blasts, 6% PMNs, 2%bands, 2% lymphs, Hgb 11.6, Hct 34%, Plts 89k.
Past Medical History: s/p CCY s/p Hernia repair h/o perforated gastric ulcer with surgical management peptic ulcer disease   Social History: Smoked a pipe infrequently many years ago.
Lives with his daughter and son-in-law on [**Hospital3 **].
Note: Blasts comprise 5% of aspirate differential.
The latter may be indicative of recovering left-shifted hematopoiesis.
Erythrocytes are decreased in number, are normochromic, with anisopoikilocytosis including echinocytes, acanthocytes, microcytes, and dacryocytes.
Cytogenetics studies: see separate report Flow cytometry studies: see separate report Cytogenetics Report BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS Procedure Date of [**2135-2-18**] Specimen Type: BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS Date and Time Taken: [**2135-2-17**] 5:30 PM Date Processed: [**2135-2-18**] KARYOTYPE: 47,XY,+8[2]/46,XY[18] INTERPRETATION: Two of 20 metaphases contained an extra chromosome 8 (TRISOMY 8).
Location: INPATIENT FISH evaluation for a chromosome 8 aneuploidy was attempted with the Vysis CEP 8 DNA Probe (chromosome 8 alpha satellite DNA) at 8p11.1-q11.1.
# AML: Newly diagnosed with complications of DIC, tumor lysis syndrome and acute renal failure on admission.
Initially treated with leukopheresis, hydration, hydroxyurea and rasburicase, then developed worsening renal failure and was transferred to the ICU for CVVH as discussed below.
He completed a 7 day course of azacitidine and received gentuzumab on day 8 which he tolerated well with an appropriate response in his counts.
He received 4 courses of IT chemotherapy via LP (MTX x2, Cytarabine x2).
An Ommaya port was placed by neurosurgery and used for IT chemotherapy.
Once he was no longer neutropenic his cefepime and vancomycin were discontinued and metronidazole and micafungin continued.
# PNA: Neutropenic course with pneumonias as discussed above, treated with cefepime and flagyl.
A 7-day course of levoquin was started and continued at discharge.
S/p Rasburicase on [**2135-1-7**] x 1 for hyperuricemia.
Initially was treated with Allopurinol, Hydroxyurea, Rasburicase and Leukopheresis.
He also had increased O2 requirement which was thought to be likely multifactorial related to leukemic infiltrate, volume overload, and question of a LLL pneumonia for which patient has been receving vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient had been having relative hypotension on the floor with blood pressures in the 80s to 90s for which patient was triggered twice on floor yesterday, though these have responded well to small (250 mL) fluid bolus x 2.
# Hyperphosphatemia: On [**1-8**] the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] when it was noted that his phosphate level was 11.9 and nephrology thought that urgent dialysis was appropriate.
Treated with calcium gluconate.
# Heart Failure/Pericardial effusion: Patient's EF was 60% prior to chemotherapy.
Cardioglogy was consulted and it was decided to treat with maximal medical therapy for new heart failure.
He was then started on low dose zyprexa and this resolved.
Ritalin was started with good initial affect, and the patient was briefly noted to be significantly more alert and participatory, although this change did not seem to last more than one day.
His ritalin dose might be titrated up if this continues to be an issue.
His parasthesias abated with treatment of his hypocalcemia.
Patient was provided support with cryo and FFP.
