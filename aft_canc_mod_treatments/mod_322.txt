She was taken to the ER for further management.
She was then given 30 mg PO diltiazem, another 15 IV dilt, then started on diltiazem drip at 10 cc/hr, still in atrial flutter.
After discussion with the family, decision was made to start a heaprin drip and she was transferred to the ICU for rate control.

Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old female with end stage gastric adenocarcinoma with metastases to peritpneum and a history of atrial flutter requesting comfort measures only who presents with atrial flutter and PE prior to placement of PleurX abdominal catheter.
Atrial Flutter: Patient presented with palpitations and HR >150 prior to placement of adbominal catheterization.

No anticoagulation prophylaxis on discharge as per patient's goals of care.

Heparin drip was discontinued on transfer to floor .
