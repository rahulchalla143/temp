Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 35870**] for LE edema with was felt to be due to decreased lasix dose and hypoalbuminemia (LENIs neg, no pelvic vein compression on CT abd/pelv., TTE w/ mild worsening inferior hypokinesis).
Notably his SBP ranged in 80s-100s without symptoms, felt to be due to hypovolemia, excessive doses of ACEi and BB.
He was treated for a positive UCx with ciprofloxacin and notably was found to have urinary retnetion, felt to be due to prostate ca s/p XRT.
He was seen for chemo treatment on [**5-21**], when his BP was 95/43.
Patient was given 500mg IV of ciprofloxacin, however was noted to have decrease in his BPs to 80s systolic, w/o response to 500cc NS bolus and 6mg IV of Zofran.
He was then started on dopamine with improvement in BPs to 130s systolic and tachycardia to 120s.
Past Medical History: - mantle cell lymphoma (s/p chemotherapy, 6 cycles Bendamustine and Rituxan - last session [**2171-10-28**], last cycle of rituximab Day 1: [**2172-2-24**] Cycle end: [**2172-3-22**]) - rheumatic heart disease with acute rheumatic fever (subsequent mitral regurgitation - posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation on [**2171-5-17**]) - s/p left scapular fracture - s/p right first toe fracture - s/p right lower extremity osteomyelitis (age 30 years old) - gout - s/p volar plate injury of 5th digit - Divertiulitis with abdominal sepsis ([**2149**]) - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - allergic rhinitis - cervical & lumbar disc disease (with right sciatica) - prostate adenocarcinoma ([**Doctor Last Name **] 6, s/p XRT [**2158**]) - DM2 - noninsulin dependent - vitamin D deficiency - s/p ORIF left ankle fracture - c. difficile infection  Social History: Lives with his wife and two children.
CXR [**2172-6-4**] 12:11 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M with Mantle cell lymphoma (on bendamustine and Rituxan), atrial flutter, tachy-CM (last EF 45-50%), recent UTI and episode of urinary retention, prostate cancer s/p XRT [**2158**] who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for LE edema, who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] for an evaluation of LE edema, urinary retention and hypotension.
As a result, oncology started Dexamethasone 20mg daily to arrest the lymphoma.
On [**6-18**] after 4 days of steroids with no response oncology met with family who had expressed desires to not have prolonged intubation or life support.
Started on Meropenem for abx and initially on pressors, given fluid boluses.
Finished course of meropenem for UTI but later in hospitalization when in MICU7 (see below) more issues with hypotension requiring pressors so placed back on vanco and continued on meropenem empirically for HCAP.
Warfarin stopped to allow proceedures and on [**6-8**] the pt had diagnostic/therapeutic L thoracentesis by IP revealing exudative effusions (pleural LDH 354, serum 445) with +cytology.
Due to concerns that this and LE edema due to volume overload, cardiology was consulted and recommended transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] on the cardiology floor for a lasix drip.
Ultimately IP placed pigtails on L and a few days later on R. Effusions were successfully drained and stayed resolved with pitails in place.
However, after transfer to the cardiology floor, pt increasingly tachypneic, RR 26-30, HR 120s on tele, sats to 70s on 2.5Lnc, started on NRB wtih increased to 90-92%.
The pt was given lasix 80mg IV x1, started on nitro gtt.
In MICU7 the pt was started on Bipap, continued on lasix gtt with bolus 80mg without significant urine output.
Was electively intubated for pericadiocentesis on [**2172-6-15**] but unable to get off vent after as get intermittently desating to 80s despite passing many of SBTs.
Was fine on the floor for 5 days but after transfer to the MICU (see above) BP decreased to the 70s and he was started on levophed.
Initially cardiology did not think pericardial drainage needed has no evidence that hypotension due to poor cardiac output and SVO2s were high (distributive shock).
Continued to require pressors and later cath (see below) didn't indicate that shock due to tamponade.
Beta blocker was held due to hypotension and warfarin due to need for proceedures.
# Code Status: Initially full code although family expressing that patient would not want prolonged ventilation or life support.
