Admission Date:  [**2179-4-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-4-15**]   Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old female transferred from an outside hospital for a VATS and talc pleurodesis.
She underwent thoracentesis on [**4-4**] with 800 cc of bloody fluid removed.
Two days post thoracentesis the patient again developed respiratory distress with evidence of reaccumulation of her pleural effusion.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for an elective VATS and pleurodesis.
Status post left open reduction and internal fixation.
Xanax 0.5 mg twice a day.
Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
The patient also underwent talc pleurodesis.
She was then maintained on nasal cannula.
She remained stable until the evening following the procedure when she was noted to be somnolent with decreased responsiveness, responding only to painful stimuli.
Her respiratory status improved quickly following intubation and was thought to be presumably due to narcosis following benzodiazepine exposure.
Her ventilation settings were weaned to pressure support.
She was placed briefly on BiPAP which did relieve her respiratory distress.
She was weaned off BiPAP after approximately eight hours.
She also received Lasix for diuresis which marginally improved her dyspnea.
The patient was maintained on face mask on 50% FIO2 and remained stable on this.
She underwent a VATS procedure with a biopsy of a chest wall mass.
She was initially treated with intravenous fluids and Lasix with transient correction of her hypercalcemia.
However, her calcium again trended up and she was given pamidronate 60 mg intravenously times one on [**3-16**].
Should her calcium again trend up, she may benefit from an additional pamidronate dose on seven days.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient initially was hypotensive following intubation with respiratory failure presumably due to narcotic administration.
She was briefly placed on a dopamine drip.
Her blood pressure quickly normalized and she was weaned off the dopamine drip.
She was stable for several days and in fact hypertensive, however, on the evening of [**3-16**], the patient acutely dropped her blood pressure and had to be placed on a Dopamine drip.
She remained on Dopamine for approximately six hours and then was again weaned off of this.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially placed on Levaquin prophylaxis following her VATS procedure.
She received seven days of Levaquin and this was then stopped.
The plan is to obtain a PICC line and plans of starting TPN.
ACCESS:  The patient with left radial arterial line and a peripheral intravenous line.
