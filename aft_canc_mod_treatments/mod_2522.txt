She became acutely ill during her hospitalization there, required to be intubated and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.
The patient underwent on arrival here, assessment showed that the patient was septic with features of ARDS, gallstone pancreatitis and ascending cholangitis were confirmed based on her laboratory work-up and she underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy on the [**12-11**] of this year.
Subsequently her amylase, lipase and LFTs progressively declined, however, the patient was intubated for a prolonged period and was a slow and difficult wean.
The patient recovered from her sepsis and the issue then became of ventilator dependence.
She also demonstrated mental status changes with poor return of mental function after her hemodynamic instability had been overcome.
She grew Enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis from her sputum sample which was taken following some deterioration in her increased requirement of vent support and for that she was placed on Levofloxacin around [**3-25**].
