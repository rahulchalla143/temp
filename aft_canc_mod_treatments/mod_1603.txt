Had abdominal CT scan overnight [**2-16**] also wet read + for SBO, surgery following, possible surgical intervention [**2-16**].
Febrile as well, will start zosyn Will change diet to NPO, IVF for maintenance, all meds to IV if possible, hold bowel regimen for now, monitor closely for further abdominal pain/hemodynamic instability, guaiac all stools.
