Admission Date:  [**2134-9-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-12-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 85265**] is a 80 yo Armenian-speaking F with a history of multiple myeloma, [**Known lastname 2320**], and multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for constipation, nausea, and vomiting, recently started on anticoagulation for DVT, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] one day after discharge with a large dark stool and concern for GI bleed.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**8-6**] - [**8-12**] and again from [**8-16**] - [**8-18**] for constipation in the setting of chronic narcotic use (fentanyl patches, dilaudid pca, tramadol, and oxycodone in recent past) for her multiple myeloma pain.
During this admission she was also found to have a R common femoral vein DVT and was started on heparin gtt.
This was transitioned to lovenox, which was held [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] for dark maroon stool and a Hct drop (29.6 --> 24.8) with concern for lower GI bleed.
Her lovenox was restarted on [**9-5**] and her Hct was stable at 26 on discharge.
Pt was given protonix 80 mg and then started on gtt.
She was also given Ciprofloxacin for UTI.
Of note, the patient's Multiple Myeloma - which was diagnosed a year and a half ago - was recently thought to be unamenable to chemotherapy by oncology given the pt multiple medical issues including poor PO intake and anasarca.
She was discharged to rehab on TPN per request by her family who after many goals of care discussions decided that they wanted to pursue aggressive supportive care with the hope of eventually starting chemotherapy.
Diagnosed approximately one and a half years ago, and has been treated with velcade/bortezomib and dexamethasone.
She has significant pain and is on chronic narcotics.
While such a pattern may be seen with supplemental oxygen administration, this is usually seen at high FIO2, reaching 100% and review of this patient's OMR confirms that her FIO2 has been consistently at 40, last measured this morning.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 85265**] was an 80 yo Armenian speaking woman with history of multiple myeloma and recent hospitalizations for constipation/ileus complicated by DVT and NSTEMI, on lovenox and full dose aspirin who presented with BRBPR.
Her telemetry was showing an Afib rhythm with a HR in the low 100s.
## PEA arrest s/p cooling protocol c/b subclinical seizures: Her PEA arrest was attributed to macroaspiration on [**9-14**], with a question of family feeding patient despite NPO status.
Her warming complicated by subclincal seizures noted on EEG which improved on anti-epeleptic medication.
Code blue was called and she required CPR and defibrillation to restore a palpable pulse.
Serial EEGs captured at least two short bursts (less than 10 seconds of) electrographic seizures over an extremely low voltage burst suppression pattern -- a record signifying an extremely poor neurological prognosis in the setting of cardiopulmonary arrest.
Pt was put on Keppra for seizure proph.
# Bacteremia - The patient started spiking fevers through vancomycin and zosyn.
She was started on linezolid, then switched to dapotmycin because of its lower fluid requirement.
## Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive s/p second PEA arrest requiring norepinephrine and fluid boluses secondary to tension pneumothorax, aspiration, and Afib with RVR.
Norepinephrne was later weaned with placement of a chest tube and rate control.
Positive blood culture from [**10-12**] grew VRE and pt was transitioned to linezolid, then daptomycin as above.
Attempted to wean off of pressors but continued to require neo.
A chest tube was placed emergently with decompression of the thorax.
The chest tube was later removed and repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of the pneumothorax.
She improved on treatment with reduced work of breathing and reduced oxygen requirement as she was satting 98% on room air.
An 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn was started in the MICU and continued on the floor.
In addition, she received respiratory therapy to provide cough assistance therapy and bronchodilators.
## Acute on chronic CHF:  She was diuresed in the ICU with lasix bolus and drip.
Unclear how much she put out from MICU documentation, but has been off lasix x 1 day.
Her beta blocker was continued.
Prior to hospitalization the patient had been anticoagulated on coumadin for a recent DVT.
Her anticoagulation was held given her recent GI bleed.
Amiodarone was started with relative success.
After the patient's second PEA arrrest she did have guaiac negative stools and a slowly falling hematocrit that did require intermittent blood transfusions.
On [**9-24**] she had a presumed aspiration event that resulted in another PEA arrest becoming asystole requiring CPR and defibrillation.
In the MICU she received TPN and transitioned to TF after PEG placement.
She later was started on ceftriaxone for urinarlysis c/w UTI; however, this was discontinued after urine cultures were negative.
Finally, she was treated with fluconazole for persistent yeast in her urine despite frequent Foley replacement.
Diuresis and free water restriction were held in setting of GI bleed, Na was followed.
# Goals of care: Several conversations were held with the family (most often the grandson [**Last Name (un) **] during her hospitalization about their goals for her long term care which were to provide aggressive supportive care with TPN and rehab with hopes to pursue further outpatient oncology opinions relative to future treatment.
