Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old man with PMH of L parietal stroke (perioperative during AVR replacment [**2128**]), prostate ca s/p radiation therapy, afib off coumadin for the past few days due to hematuria (INR subtherapeutic 1.2), hx a. comm aneurysm, and two previous episodes of seizures (first in the setting of his stroke and second in the setting of hypertensive encephalopathy), who was noted to have started talking "gibberish and was confused" while getting a hair cut, attempted to get out of chair but was unsteady with EMS called and noted to slump to one side and have a "GTC" He was treated with ativan/valim and transferred to ED at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was intubated and had an episode of hypotension to 80s.
Given clinical concern for sz activity by the intensivist team, he was treated with a total of 11mg of ativan.
He did not have further seizures on continuous EEG monitoring for the next two days.
At this time, he was started on heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.
Surgery was called and they did not recommend any intervention but would allow the bleed to tamponade on its own.
Treated with esmolol gtt/metoprolol bridge and hydralazine PO.
Regarding anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation, he was started on aspirin 325 mg daily after transfer to the neurology step-down unit with the plan to transition to coumadin on [**2134-11-28**] which is 3 weeks from the retroperitoneal bleed.
He was found to have a LUL PNA on CXR, along with WBC/tachypnea and respiratory distress, for which he was empirically treated with Vanco/Zosyn, which was narrowed to Levofloxacin after organism on sputum was identified as MSSA.
With his bleeding he again spiked fevers and his antibiotic coverage was expanded to Vanco/Zosyn.
He was extubated on [**2134-11-13**] and his antibiotics were changed to Linezolid PO for a likely 10 day course.
He was noted to have an LUL infiltrate on CXR and was treated for HAP as above, then narrowed to coverage for MSSA.
He completed the 10 day course of Linezolid on [**2134-11-22**].
