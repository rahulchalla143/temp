He was admitted [**Date range (3) 54045**] for portacath placement and feeding jejunostomy.
Reports that, since the chemotherapy, he has not been tolerating his tubefeeds and has been having nausea and vomitting, at times reddish-brown.
In the ED, patient was found to be guaiac positive, and patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation given concern of GI bleed as hematocrit was found to be 23 on presentation.

---------- ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2115-8-29**] 9:23 AM Gas-distended loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels in upper abdomen possibly secondary to partial high small bowel obstruction but previously administered contrast via jejunostomy tube has all proceeded into the colon.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old male with coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and stage IIA esophageal tumor currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy, now with nausea and vomiting and GI bleed.
NG lavage and endoscopy was deferred as tube could not be passed and history of esophageal cancer with concern of exacerbating hematemesis.
Tube feeds were stopped for bowel rest, and IV fluid resuscitation was initiated.
Nausea/vomiting:  Intractable nausea and vomiting was thought to be initiating event for hematemesis leading to present hospitalization, and was thought to be due to a combination of chemotherapy and possible distal obstruction.
As noted above, patient was given bowel rest by stopping tube feeds.
Patient was also administered anti-emetics (ondansetron and compazine, initially standing, then PRN) with good effect.
Radiographic studies were implemented to evaluate for distal obstruction leading to vomiting, and it was noted that J-tube placed during last admission was in place and operational.
Nonetheless, following transfer from ICU and adequate control of nausea and vomiting, tube feeds were reinitiated without complication.
Anti-emetic medications were further titrated as tube feeds were advanced, and tube feeding rate reached goal prior to the day of discharge.
Esophageal cancer:  With the exception of concerns for distal obstruction, patient's malignancy was not felt to play a direct role during present admission.
Thoracic surgery was initially consulted with the concern that hematemesis was due to esophageal cancer.
However, hematemesis resolved following control of vomiting, and radiation therapy was continued during this hospitalization with good effect.
On hospital day 7, patient's cell counts reached nadir (absolute neutrophil count was 150) as expected following chemotherapy prior to admission.
Mechanical mitral valve/Atrial Fibrillation:  These issues were stable throughout hospitalization, however, anticoagulation by warfarin was held during initial hospital course.
As hematocrit stabilized, patient was reinitiated on warfarin with bridging heparin therapy.
Patient did well on this regimen, and heparin was discontinued after patient had reached a therapeutic [**Hospital Unit Name 263**] for 36 hours.
At the time of discharge, patient was tolerating tube feeds at goal and was adequately anticoagulated with no signs or symptoms of GI bleed or nausea/vomiting.
Patient was discharged home with visiting nursing services with orders to aid patient in adjusting tube feeds to increase free water intake and gradually convert tube feed cycles to 8 hours on 16 hours off.
Patient was to continue radiation therapy as outpatient and to follow up with oncologist as planned.

2) Patient's last admission was due to hematemesis secondary to vomiting from overaggressive tube feeds.
Please advance tube feeds extremely conservatively.
Patient requires total fluid intake goal of ~2 liters a day.
Please do the following: a) Administer tube feeds (Deliver 2.0 3.5 cans with Promod 20 grams/day) 35cc/hr (total 840cc feeds), with 300 cc free water flush over q8hour cycles.
- Administer Normal Saline IV one liter over 10-24 hours for one week.

2) If nausea does not resolve, stop tube feeds for an hour to 24 hours until nausea resolves.
Followup Instructions: Radiation oncology for radiation therapy [**2115-9-6**].
