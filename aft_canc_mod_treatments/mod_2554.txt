Continued ceftriaxone and azithromycin and sent sputum culture which were negatve.
Pneumonia treatment as discussed above.
# Dysphagia: Secondary to known esophageal strictures from radation tx for thyrood CA.
NPO for a few days while we determined what were her options for nutrition.
Unable to do dilation while in the hospital (current condition, O2 req) so we decided to place L PICC and begin TPN [**7-21**].
TPN would be a bridge until her medical condition improved and she would be able to tolerate the dilation.
Palliative care was consulted to discuss nutrition options and end-of-life issues.
# Medullary/Papillary thyroid CA: S/p radiation c/b esophageal strictures.
# Hypertension: Started Clonidine patch since pt will be unable to take PO pills while she waits for dilation.
If she does not go for dilation in 2 weeks, she may need to start IV levothyroxine at home.
Per endocrinology, she will not receive levothyroxine until dilation when she can take it PO.
