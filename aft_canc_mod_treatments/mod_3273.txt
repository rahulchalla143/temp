DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Lidocaine was instilled through the Reverend [**Known lastname 53197**] endotracheal tube to suppress cough.
The patient received sedation per ICU protocol.
The bronchoscope was then inserted into the airways and airway inspection was performed at the level of the carina.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma s/p left mainstem stenting admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis and respiratory failure.
#Respiratory failure - Initially the respiratory failure was thought to be d/t either a CAP or postobstructive PNA, and the patient was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl for possible aspiration PNA.
Respiratory culture grew OP flora and moderate growth of beta streptococci, not group B.  Metronidazole was stopped and the patient was treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin for a total of 7 days.
Addidionally, the patient was wheezy on physical exam and was given albuterol and atrobent nebulizers, as well as steroids in the setting of hypotension and an inadequate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.
The patient was difficult to wean from the vent, and the ventilator readings suggested an element of resistance.
A discussion was held with the patient's sister, brother, and health care proxy, as well as the BC communinty of priests, and it the decision was made to withhold futher aggressive measures such as stent placement in the right bronchus in the setting of known progression of disease.
Antiobiotics and steroids were stopped, and the patient was extubated at 1 p.m. on [**9-16**] with family and friends present.
Morphine was started prior to extubation and titrated to patient comfort.
#Sepsis - The patient presented with an elevated white count, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
Fluid boluses and phenylephrine were used to maintain MAP >65.
On the day of his death antibiotics and steroids were stopped.
Hem/Onc spoke with the patient/family/health care proxy and were unable to offer any further treatment options.
Initially the flutter was controlled intermittently with IV Lopressor and diltiazem, but was unsuccessful.
Amiodarone was started transiently but stopped per recommendation of cardiology d/t it's ability to make Aflutter worse.
D/C cardioversion was attempted and successful, but the patient only remained in NSR for approx 36 hrs.
A diltiazem drip was started for rate control, and this was successful.
No indication for HD and no further intervention.
