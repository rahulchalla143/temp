Hypovolemia, required fluid resuscitation.
INVASIVE PROCEDURES ON THIS ADMISSION:  Central venous monitoring and exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions and drainage.
She presented to an outside hospital with these complaints with CT scan that showed pockets of free air in the pelvis but a difficult to interpret CT in the setting of bilateral total hip replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, breast cancer, bladder cancer, hypertension, COPD, gastroesophageal reflux, hypercholesterolemia and osteoarthritis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right total hip replacement, aortic aneurysm repair in [**2187-3-29**], left mastectomy, cystoscopy with bladder biopsies.
She was given intravenous antibiotics and made NPO.
A repeat CAT scan showed less free air than on previous CAT scan and a chest CT was suggestive of lung cancer with suggestion of metastases with replacement of her liver.
Given her underlying malignancy and diffuse metastatic disease, nonoperative management was attempted for this abdominal process which was thought to be diverticulitis.
She was started on parenteral nutrition and fluid resuscitation was initiated.
Discussion with the family regarding her finding of probable lung cancer was entertained.
With broad-spectrum antibiotics and serial exams, her condition stabilized although her abdominal examination continued to worsen.
Given the CT findings and her increase in white blood cell count, risks and benefits of an operative procedure were discussed.
The family wanted to proceed with surgical intervention.
Therefore on [**2188-1-28**], the patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy with drainage of phlegmon and lysis of adhesions.
Supportive therapy was initiated with BiPAP and other measures.
After discussing the patient's condition with her two sons, she was made comfort measures only and no further interventions were implemented.
