There is a right subdural hematoma along the convexity of the occipital lobe, with a parafalcine component.
Moderate-sized right subdural hematoma along the occipital convexity and the falx, with a possibly cystic component as well.
Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube.
Once the patient has been extubated, dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended to allow for assessment of stability of left apical thickening, which is asymmetric compared to the right.
In addition, she was no longer on any sedating or paralyzing medications that may influence our exam.
She was transferred to the ICU and continued on mechanical ventilation and completed her mannitol dosing.
Another series of family meetings was held and they decided to withdraw ventilatory support and make the patient CMO.
The patient was then given morphine for comfort and extubated.
