He received 2 units pRBCs and 1 units platelets in clinic yesterday and then received 2 units pRBCs and 2 units platelets today.
ROS is positive for frequent nose bleeds.
The patient received Levaquin in Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic.
The patient was subsequently started on Gleevec on [**2103-10-9**] at a dose of 400 mg p.o.
The patient remains on Hydrea and Gleevec today.
Patient underwent bone marrow aspirate/biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] [**12/2103**] which showed hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia and left-shifted granulopoiesis, consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
He has been maintained on hydrea since his diagnosis, recently treated with ARA-C x 2 weeks and most recently with Etoposide which he started on [**2105-5-13**] and completed on [**2105-5-27**].
Removal of 2 lesions, one on the patient's face, which was most likely consistent with actinic keratoses, and one on the patient's anterior chest wall consistent with a likely dysplastic nevus.

He subsequently developed major splenic infarction, of uncertain etiology, requiring ICU monitoring.
Potential etiologies included his underlying CMML vs infectious (+AFB fungemia) vs embolic/thrombotic (DIC vs HIT).
He was treated supportively for his CMML with hydrea.
Heparin was held over concern for HIT (although his low plts were felt most likely in setting of consumption from splenomegaly + productive deficit from recent chemotherapy).
He was formally evaluated by the surgery consult service who felt he was not a surgical candidate, and that he should be monitored medically.
The patient was managed medically with antibiotics and transfusions prn, however he continued to decline clinically and complained of increasing pain in his abdomen.
Therefore discussion was made with patient, his wife, his primary oncologist and ICU attending to make goal of care comfort and pain control on [**6-10**].
Pain was controlled with IV morphine as needed, and the patient died on [**6-11**].
The patient was started on empiric treatment with Cefepime for neutropenic fever.
The patient was started on Flagyl po [**5-31**].
The patient defervesced and Cefepime was discontinued on [**6-3**] because it was felt that it may halt the resolution of  cdiff infection.
On [**6-5**] Flagyl was changed to po Vancomycin.
Pancytopenia/Anemia - Finished Etoposide [**2105-5-27**].
He then was transfused an additional unit of pRBC's, 2units of FFP and a unit of plts in the ICU prior to changing goals of care to comfort measures only.
Hydrea 500 mg qod was discontinued due to pancytopenia.
