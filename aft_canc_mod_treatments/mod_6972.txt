She has been on Xeloda since [**92**]/[**2185**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and after extensive discussion with the hematology and oncology services, it was felt that the patient was in need of an exploratory laparotomy and likely colectomy in order for relief of this obstruction.
Therefore, the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2186-4-8**] and underwent a total abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy, sigmoid colon mucous fistula, and omentectomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
She remained intubated and spent the night in the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory support and management of fluid status.
Therefore, she was aggressively rehydrated with lactated Ringer's, and pain control was achieved postoperatively with the use of PCA.
In terms of their recommendations, they suggested getting her back to her oral medications as fast as possible, but in the meanwhile that methadone PCA would be the best choice for her.
She did not really respond to the methadone PCA and required some dilaudid intermittently, but by postoperative day #4, she was showing evidence of bowel activity and, therefore, was started on her PO pain medications along with some additional Vioxx which actually did control her pain.
She was given physical therapy, and given instructions regarding a stoma.
