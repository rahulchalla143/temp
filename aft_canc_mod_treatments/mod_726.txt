She has had recent mild COPD flares, with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and wheezes, with improvement on a prednisone taper.
She presented with complaints of SOB, and was treated with IV solumedrol and avelox.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-1-6**] repolarization abnormalities are less apparent.
# Hypotension: Hypotensive to 80s on presentation, but had resolved and remained stable with IVF hydration.
Most likely volume depletion in the setting of nausea/vomiting and poor PO intake, as well agressive antihypertensive regimen in the setting of 25 lb weight loss.
Blood pressure medications were held in the ICU and on the floor and her blood pressure remained well controlled with SBP 110 - 140.
Given her stable blood pressure and tachycardia with ambulation, as well as known CAD, her atenolol was restarted on discharge.
Her lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide/spironolactone were not restarted.
She was restarted on a PPI since plavix was on for medical management of CAD.
Advair and albuterol were continued per home regimen along with standing atrovent nebs in the ICU.
The patient was started on a Predisone taper.
On the floor her wheezing improved on this regimen and she kept her oxygen saturation above 90% on room air with ambulation on the day of discharge.
As the patient's symptoms improved with transfusion and prednisone and she did not want anticoagulation, further evaluation for PE was not initiated.
# Anemia: The patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for a hematocrit drop to 26.
Her creatinine returned to baseline in response to IV fluids.
# Code Status: The patient expressed her wishes to be DNR/DNI and not undergo invasive procedures going forth.
