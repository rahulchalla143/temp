In the [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd NS x2L, ceftazidime 2g IVx1, vancomycin 1g IVx1, albuterol nebs x2, robitussin with codeine, tylenol 1g, NTG gtt.
In the MICU, he was treated with vancomycin, azithromycin, and zosyn for pneumonia refractory to levofloxacin.
His O2 requirement was weaned down.
However, on hospital day 2, he developed hypertension with acute shortness of breath; this was treated with a NTG gtt.
Isosorbide DN was added to his BP regimen replace the NTG.
Because of his dyspnea and tight, wheezy lung exam, he was started on steroids for COPD exacerbation, although he does not carry a history of COPD.

had episode of respiratory difficulty overnight requiring numerous interventions including lasix (although CXR afterwards showed no signs of CHF), albuterol nebs, nitro for afterload reduction, and finally BiPAP .
# Respiratory distress/Multifocal pneumonia - Patient readmitted for multifocal PNA that did not respond to levofloxacin as an outpatient.
It was thought that the patient either did not receive long enough treatment with Levofloxacin or possibly that the patient's pneumonia was resistant to Levofloxacin.
The patient was started on Zosyn/Vanco to cover broadly given progression of symptoms and radiographic appearance of PNA as well as Azithromycin to cover atypicals.
The patient had a second episode of respiratory distress with RR 40s and was given bipap with improvement of rr 20-30.
The patient did not require intubation in the MICU.
The patient was started on IV solumedrol for wheezing thought to be consistent with COPD/reactive airways disease.
He did not require endotracheal intubation.
Although the patient does not have known COPD, he was started on IV steroids for presumed reactive airways disease contributing to his severe respiratory distress.
He was started on Solumedrol IV and then subsequently switched to Prednisone.
He also received nebulizer treatments and his wheezing has improved during his hospital course.
He will complete IV antibiotics and a Prednisone taper after discharge at the [**Hospital 100**] rehab MACU.
Upon discharge, he was requiring 2-3L Nasal cannula to maintain saturation of 96%.
He was transiently put on a nitro gtt which improved his SBPs to 160s-170s and was transitioned to isosorbide DN and metoprolol after it was clear that he was no longer septic.
His antihypertensive regimen can be further uptitrated as necessary in the outpatient setting.
He is s/p transurethral resection [**12-29**].
# h/o DVT - The patient's coumadin was stopped in the ICU in the event a procedure was necessary and he was bridged with a heparin gtt.
Upon discharge, his INR was 2.2 and heparin gtt was no longer needed.
