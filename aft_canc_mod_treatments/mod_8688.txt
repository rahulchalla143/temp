Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M with h/o metastatic pancreatic cancer (dx [**2113-1-2**]) s/p Whipple procedure, COPD, and HTN who presented with N/V and abdominal pain after discharge on [**8-10**] s/p treatment of SBO admitted for management of DKA and continued decreased PO intake at home.
Family reports that patient had missed at least one dose of home glargine PTA.
The pt was started on an Insulin drip at 2 U / hour initially (glucose 150 on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) with D51/2NS 1L over 2 hours.
Once the patient's anion gap had closed the the insulin drip was stopped and sc insulin was started.
Patient has had minimal po intake so home dose of glargine was decreased to 6U and patient was maintained on regular insulin sliding scale for glucose control.
On the floor pt continued to have hiccups and was started on decadron.
His AG closed to 18, however was transferred to ICU for insulin drip.
Because the pt could tolerate less and less oral intake due to painful hiccoughs, his BG remained low and insulin was cut back.
They remained low even as insulin glargine was cut back to 4units qam.
The insulin was stopped and fingersticks were cut back to qday as the patient's status declined.
2) N/V/Abdominal Pain:  Likely related to DKA in part, however patient with extensive intra-abdominal procedures and recent hospitalization for small bowel obstruction (SBO).
Patient was not requiring antiemetics during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.
He has had chronic hiccups since his Whipple procedure which respond well to Prochloroperazine initially.
He was on thorazine and reglan initially.
Baclofen tid was also added and seemed to help, however pt was very sleepy on a combination of these medications.
PO doses of medications were tried, but IV medication was required as the hiccoughs themselves prevented PO intake.
Thorazine and reglan were used, primarily.
Baclofen was orally available but not well tolerated - the patient only took this medication periodically.
Morphine concentrated elixer was tolerated and reduced pain.
This was changed to IV morphine as the pt became more ill and began to refuse even the elixer.
The patient received fluids by PICC line to prevent dehydration.
There were long discussions regarding post-hospital placement.
Because of recurrant partial SBO, the patient's family wanted care that could include NGT placement in case of discomfort.
5) COPD:  At home patient on albuterol prn.
Patient was started on Zoloft but had difficulty taking it regularly because there is no parenteral formulation of SSRI.
There had been some talk of a PEG tube during his previous admission to relieve his SBO but this seems to have improved somewhat.
In the end, TPN was not thought to be a good option given the poor prognosis, however PICC was placed for IVF administration to maintain hydration.
Family, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] had a discussion regarding disposition and an agreement was made that pt would benefit from stay at [**Last Name (un) **] house, which is very close to pt's house.
In the end, the pt was thought to benefit from Medical Acute Care Unit level care where NGT could be placed and there would be no reason for return to the ED (as the pt would be hospice level care).
The patient was kept as an inpatient at [**Hospital1 **] after family refused a number of placements and no appropriate placement could be made.
