He received 6L of NS as well as pain meds.
[**4-12**] Blood culture bottles returned positive within 24h for Group A strep, and antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h.
We were consulted regarding duration of therapy and infectious concerns related to port and hip prosthesis.
Patient received XRT to Left hip on [**2137-5-1**] prior to consultation.
He then underwent resection with allograft replacement of the left proximal femur in 01/[**2136**].
Port placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] [**2137-4-15**] for access.
Replacement of the musculature with abnormal low attenuation is most consistent with local recurrence of chondrosarcoma, possibly with tumoral necrosis secondary to chemo radiation treatment.
These two foci may represent atelectatic lung, due to slightly expiratory phase of imaging, however, they do bear attention on followup studies as they were not present on most recent prior.
# Chondrosarcoma: doxorubicin was started on [**2137-5-6**].
He was started on penicillin for a planned 14-day course.
Suppressive therapy would be considered.
# Transaminitis: with elevated AST and ALT since [**2137-4-30**], after the patient was initially started on ceftriaxone.
After the discontinuation of ceftriaxone and initiation of penicillin once blood culture sensitivity came back, his LFTs trended down again.
