She was also given DDAVP for presumed dysfunctional platelets.
Last night she was also found to be febrile and was started on Cefepime and Flagyl and then changed over to Zosyn as she complained of severe nausea on Flagyl.

woman with myelodysplastic syndrome and resultant pancytopenia and recurrent GIB associated with ulcerations in her small intestine.
The patient received numerous PRBC transfusions.
She continued to receive prbc's nearly every other day to maintain a stable hematocrit, and she received HLA matched platelets on nearly a daily basis to maintain her platelet count over 50. .
# Neutropenic fever: The patient finished her 5th day of decitabine for MDS treatment on [**9-12**].
Previous to decitabine therapy the patient had adequate cell counts, and after decitabine the patient became progressively  neutropenic.
The patient placed  on several antibiotics, including vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl, and fluconazole, and continued to spike.
Antibiotics eventually switched to Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl (cefepime was discontinued secondary to drug rash), to Vanc/Aztreonam/Caspofungin.
Clinical suspicion for PCP was high, and after consulting ID, the patient was maintained on Vanc/Caspo/Meropenem, and the patient was begun on Bactrim and steroids empirically, unable to perform bronchoscopy with the high likelihood of being unable to extubate her.
Soon after Bactrim administration her fevers stopped.
She was continued with a full 14 day course of IV Bactrim.
After completing this course she was transitioned to Bactrim DS 3 times weekly.
Thought initially to be due to fluid overload in setting of increased platelet and prbc transfusions, and CT on [**9-24**] showing bibasilar atelectasis.
Oxygen improved with lasix on [**9-26**] and [**9-27**], and patient was saturating at 94% on room air on [**9-27**].
ID reccomended broad antibiotic coverage, and biggest concern was for PCP in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.
She was subsequently begun on Bactrim and steroids.
Soon after bactrim administration the patient stopped spiking fevers, however she persisted with low oxygen saturation and required 6L O2 by nasal cannula.
The patient's O2 saturation ranged from 89-94%, and appeared to improve with lasix administration.
She occasionally required masked ventilation to maintain O2 saturation over 90%.
After six days of bactrim therapy, her bactrim was discontinued out of concern that it was contributing to the patient's neutropenia.
Primaquine and clindamycin were begun instead.
Patient was stabilized and transeferred back to the floor on NRB 100%, she continued on IV antibiotic regimen of meropenem and Bactrim.
She remained afebrile and was continued on Bactrim and voriconazole.
She was able to be weaned to 99% on 3L nasal cannula prior to discharge.
Her prednisone dose was tapered, she was discharge on Prednisone 30mg AM, 10mg PM per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] who will follow her at the rehabilitation facility.
# MDS: The patient is s/p decitabine treatment from [**9-12**], and gradually became neutropenic.
She was administered neupogen and her counts eventually recovered slowly.
Further treatment for underlying disease at Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] discretion.
Once she was taken off the IV meds her sodium level rose, 130 upon dishcharge.
#Sundowning: Her mental status would wax and wane at nighttime, multifactorial etiology of undrlying infection, hypoxia, hyponatremia and medications.
Her medication list was reviewed and with treatment of her underlying disease her mental status improved.
