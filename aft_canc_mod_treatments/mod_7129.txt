Following induction of anesthesia and intubation, Kefzol was administered.
Patient received another dose of epinephrine 1 mg IV and lidocaine 100 mg, followed by amiodarone 300 mg.  Second DC shock of 300J failed to convert patient out of VT/VF.
The patient then was noted to be pulseless and received CPR for 3-5 minutes with resultant ROSC.
For her rash, patient was given diphenhydramine 25 mg and famotidine 30 mg.  Due to these complications, TAH was cancelled.
Full ROS was not obtained on admission to ICU as pt was intubated and sedated.
Symptomatic uterine fibroids: had caused pain in the past, and patient was recommended to have TAH due to size of fibroids 2.)

PCXR ([**2184-10-4**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are low in volume but clear.
Withdrawal 15 mm is recommended.
PCXR ([**2184-10-5**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-4**], the endotracheal tube has been removed.
EKG [**2184-10-4**] (#1): sinus tach with inferior and lateral ST elevations EKG [**2184-10-4**] (#2): sinus tach with new Q-waves in inferior leads  Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, the pt is a 54 yo F who presented initially on day of admission for an elective hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids.
Prior to surgery, following intubation and administration of IV Cefazolin, the patient developed hypotension to the 40's/20's.
Then given IV epinephrine with subsequent development of narrow-complex tachycardia, which degenerated into VT/VF, with  unsuccessful debibrillation, subsequent PEA arrest, received CPR for approximately 4 minutes and return of spontaneous circulation.
During the episode, the pt was noted to have a diffuse body rash, which responded to Benadryl and famotidine.
She has been instructed to abstain from cephlasporins and penicillins, and to avoid antibiotics in general if possible for now, until she follows-up in [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic after discharge.
She also received a prescription  for Epipen's, and was instructed on how to administer and also given an informational handout.
With regards to concern for the epinephrine potentially triggering her arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, this was discussed with Cardiology, and felt that the low dose of Epinephrine would make this very unlikely and was not contraindicated.
# VT arrest:  The patient developed VT/VF following her anaphylactic shock and administration of IV epinephrine, and was noted to have some wall motion abnormality on bedside Echo, EKG changes, and elevated troponin.
However, they did recommend that she be on an Aspirin for the next 2 weeks and to have a follow-up Exercise-stress echocardiogram in 2 weeks with appropriate Cardiology follow-up.
# Uterine Fibroids:  Unfortunately, given the pt's pre-operative course, the pt's TAH was cancelled.
She will need to continue on Aspirin for 2 weeks and have a outpt exercise-stress echocardiogram, which has already been scheduled, and follow-up with Cardiology after the stress testing.
She will follow-up with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she has pending culture data, including a MRSA screen, blood culture, urine culture, and catheter-tip culture.
She will follow-up with her Gynecologist to determine when to pursue her hysterectomy that was originally scheduled for this admission.
Urine culture, blood culture, catheter tip culture ([**10-5**]) 3.
Medications on Admission: Vitamin D  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) for 2 weeks: please continue for 2 weeks till [**10-20**].

Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for an elective GYN surgery for fibroids, however, prior to your sugery, your developed an anaphylactic allergic reaction with low blood pressure to an antibiotic (cefazolin) and also developed a cardiac arrest, requiring CPR and electric shocks.
You were kept intubated and monitored in the ICU.
There were some mild abnormalities seen on ultrasound of the heart, so the cardiologists recommend that you take Aspirin for the next 2 weeks.
You will then have follow-up testing of your heart and will follow-up with Cardiology outpatient.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] note the following medication changes: 1.
Aspirin was STARTED.
We also recommend that you also avoid any antibiotics until you are seen in follow-up by the Allergy Specialists, especially the class of antibiotics known as penicillins and cephlasporins.
