Platelets have been from 49K to 78K with a macrocytic anemia (both low methylmalonic acid and B12 levels noted).
PSH: s/p appendectomy 50 years ago s/p tonsillectomy 60 years ago.
Neck: L subclavian central line placed Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Transfusion Reaction Investigation: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced a temperature increase of 2.4 degrees F over the course of receiving an entire unit of leukoreduced, irradiated, compatible red cells.
Daptomycin = Sensitive @ 1.5MCG/ML, Sensitivity testing performed          by Etest.
Screen predicts NO synergy with penicillins or          vancomycin.
Consult ID for treatment options.
New scattered areas of centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities in the lungs, with the differential including atypical infection, drug toxicity, and inflammatory changes.
[**2136-5-15**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: DIAGNOSIS: Markedly hypocellular marrow consistent with ablative chemotherapy effect.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of markedly hypocellular marrow (less than 5% cellular) consisting primarily of stromal cells with rare scattered plasma cells and scant hematopoietic precursors.
There is focal background eosinophilic material consistent with chemotherapy effect.
Daily Blood Cultures [**2136-5-11**] - [**2136-5-19**]: VRE   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old male with a new diagnosis of AML admitted for 7+3 induction chemotherapy.
He had a long course on the BMT service (7-[**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]), with initial 7+3 induction chemotherapy, with 14 day marrow that was packed and subsequent randomization to cytarabine +/- clofarabine, which he tolerated well, and day 28 marrow was empty.
He was anticoagulated for his cephalic vein clot, discontinued after a 5-pt hematocrit drop and guaiac positive stool.
A central line was placed for additional access.
On [**5-21**], his VRE was noted to be resistant also to daptomycin; antibiotics were changed to linezolid.
His respiratory status continued to worsen, and he required intermittent NIPPV.
Management of his severe heart failure was initiated with captopril and continued Lasix.
Hematocrit was stable; PE was in the differential, but heparin was deferred given the severity of his prior upper GI bleed.
Tolerated chemotherapy well, but hospital course complicated by pancolitis and VRE bacteremia (see below).
He tolerated the chemotherapy well.
No leukemia was seen in the marrow and the patient was started on neupogen on [**5-17**] to help his counts recover in the setting of bacteremia.
Was initially broadly covered with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Micafungin, and Flagyl and Acyclovir) until blood cultures grew VRE (E. faecium) from his venous line blood culture.
Vancomycin was discontinued, and Daptomycin was started.
He had a new PICC line which was pulled on [**2136-5-12**] and the tip was cultured and again showed no growth.
Per recommendations from the infectious disease team, the patient was switched to linezolid on [**5-14**].
On [**5-18**] the patient was switched back to daptomycin, at a higher dose, with gentamycin for synergy per ID recommendations.
The patient was briefly anticoagulated with a heparin gtt at low dose, however, he dropped his hematocrit from 25 to 20 and had hemeoccult positive stool, so this drug was stopped.
Petechiae in setting of low platelets, was given transfusions for plt < 10,000.
Treated with Sarna and rash improved over the next several days.
Treated with immodium as needed for comfort.
# Depression/Panic disorder: Held nortriptyline during chemotherapy, can be restarted on discharge at discretion of outpatient oncologist.
Given a banana bag (MVI, thiamine, folate) the first day in house, and treated with IM B12 shot on Day 1.
Kept on valium CIWA scale, but no signs of withdrawal.
