Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):  ============== ECG [**2120-3-15**]: Sinus tachycardia.
2.Increase in the burden of metastatic disease, including adrenal, pulmonary, nodal, and soft tissue metastasis.
In the ICU a central line was placed in order to follow central venous pressure and resuscitation with fluids was initiated.
The pt was initially on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin) and these were narrowed to ciprofloxacin once the pt's blood and urine cultures grew E. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
The patient was on intermittent norepinephrine for blood pressure support for less than 24 hours, and was then able to be weaned off pressors entirely.
As pt had positive blood cultures it was decided that pt should stay on IV abx and continued for a 14 day course of IV ciprofloxacin (day 1 =[**2120-3-15**], day 14 [**2120-3-28**]).
Patient had a PICC line placed on [**2120-3-19**].
Initially the pt's tachycardia was responsive to IVF but ultimately the pt was loaded amiodarone for better rate control.
The pt did well on amiodarone and on [**2120-3-17**] the amiodarone loading was completed and the pt continued with a heart rate in the 80's.
Pt was stable on this regimen at time of transfer.
It is possible that this dose of metoprolol may continue to require uptitration for continued rate control.
However in consultation with the patient's primary oncologist a heparin drip was initiated.
The patient was then transitioned from heparin drip to lovenox.
The decision was made to place an IVC filter and stop lovenox therapy.
Patient's Evista was stopped given thrombogenic side effects.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Given progression of patient's disease in spite of chemotherapy treatment her primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] does not plan to offer additional chemotherapy treatment.
# Thrombocytopenia: The pt's platelets were markedly lower during this admission and did decrease by greater than 50% from admission.
After discussions with the patient's primary oncologist it was decided that there were multiple possible causes of thrombocytopenia (vancomycin exposure, recent chemotherapy with dacarbazine) in addition to heparin, and HIT Ab was not sent per oncology recommendations.
# Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy.
# GERD/hiatal hernia: Continued omeprazole, anti-emetics prn  # CODE: The pt was DNR/DNI per discussion the pt's family.
