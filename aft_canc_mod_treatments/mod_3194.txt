Prior to this, he was admitted from [**Date range (3) 48682**] for treatment with ATG for 5 days.
No antibiotics were given at that time.
Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy on [**7-19**] that demonstrated tracheobronchitis with diffuse upper airway erythema and some mucosal bleeding, but no signs of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage.
Pt was treated with diuresis as needed, standing atrovent inhaler (per pulm recs), steroids were tapered, platelets were maintained > 50, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated.
Prednisone dose was increased and he received 2units of PRBCs and 2 units of platelets.
At discharge the patient's Hct was 28.7 and plts were 28.He was discharged on [**2123-7-30**] on prednisone and PCP prophylaxis [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ bactrim.

Steroids were increased for concern for DAH, lasix intermittently given for concern for chf.
Patient requiring non rebreather for most of time, but was still able to walk/talk.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team consulted several times prior to today, but patient always remained stable and decision by heme team to keep patient on their service.
Addition of broad spectrum antiviral, anti-pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 48683**], and anti-bacterial treatments slowly added in succession and treatment with high dose steroids completed.
Recently ([**Month (only) 596**]/[**Month (only) **]) pt with trending downward HCt, easy bruisability.
BM bx was performed in [**2123-5-28**], that demonstrated normal cellularity of approx 30-40%, trilineage dysplasia, <1% myeloblasts (on nucleated cells).
At this time, decision was made to proceed with ATG/cyclosporin therapy vs BMT.

Thoracic Surgery followed, VATS biopsy was not indicated at the time as would likely have had nonspecific findings after all his treatments.
Desatted with disruption of PEEP during bronch, requiring high PEEP due to parenchymal disease.
PEEP too high for bedside trach, so we were anticipating the need for a surgical trach, also b/c of tracheal tear.
He was kept off tube feeds and on prophylactic antibiotics for mediastinitis, but he remained without signs of infection, so the antibiotics were stopped and tube feeds were restarted.
2) MDS: s/p antithymoglobulin treatment.
After transfusing 1 unit of platelets, platelet count remained at 6, and the patient was transfused 2 more units of platelets during the night.
Patient was bagged and intermittently placed on the vent, but did not tolerate mechanical ventilation with sats dropping to low 80s.
He was then paralyzed with boluses of vecuronium to make breathing ventilating the patient easier.
Patient was placed on pressure support ventilation and started on a morphine gtt at 430am.
