Denies any fever or chills, though notes she was recently treated with an antibiotic for diarrhea.
She was started on prednisone for suspected PMR and sent for a temporal artery biopsy to rule out temporal arteritis.
Her brain mets were treated with total brain irradiation and she is scheduled to start chemotherapy for the lung masses [**9-29**].
She was given aspirin 325mg x 1 and levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 for CXR showing new retrocardiac opacity and lactate of 3.5.
Past Medical History: # [**Doctor Last Name 933**] or (hyperactive thyroid) patient s/p RAI, on replacement.
Has been on prednisone and GI PPX with steroids.
An 8 French drainage catheter was then placed over the wire and an additional 350 cc of serous and mildly bloody fluid was removed and sent for analysis.
Final hemodynamics after removal showed pericardial pressure to be subatmospheric, RA pressure decreased to 5 mm Hg with return of the y Descent.
Post  procedure ECHO confirmed placement of the catheter in the pericardial space as well as well as complete resolution of the pericardial effusion.
Patient went into paroxysmal atrial fibrillation post procedure and was given 300mg Amiodarone IV as well as 5 mg of IV lopressor with good resultant rate control.
Pathology: [**2112-9-25**]: Pericardial fluid:   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, .
Discharge Labs: Na 136, K 4.2, Cl 101, HCO3 17, BUN 25, Cr 0.6, Gluc 94 Ca: 8.6 Mg: 2.2 P: 3.7 WBC 11.3, Hgb  9.2, Hct 27.8, PLT  391    Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o female with non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain and C2 vetebral body, hypertension and hypothyroidism admitted with cardiac tamponade.
Patient went for right heart catheterization, with placement of right-sided pericardial drainage catheter, which showed large bloody pericardial effusion.
Due to persistent output through the pericardial drain, a surgical pericardial window was placed along with a temporary pericardial chest tube (removed after 24 hours).
CT Surgery was comfortable following the patient outside of ICU care, and patient will be transferred to heme-onc service for management and preparation chemotherapy next week.
#Paroxysmal Afib: S/p pericardial drain placement, patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
She received metoprolol 5mg x3, diltiazem 10mg x2, Amiodarone 150mg x3, and started on amio gtt 1mg/min over 2.5h before she converted to NSR.
She was maintained on amio 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and this was stopped before leaving the CCU.
Likely new onset related to irritation of drain placement.
# Shortness of Breath: Likely secondary to pleural effusions (secondary to leakage from pericardial window) and atelectasis and possibly anemia.
She can continue on furosemide as needed while on the OMED service (and possibly on discharge) if short of breath or if effusions grow in size.
# Hypertension: Recently diagnosed with hypertension and started on amlodipine 5mg daily.
Her amlodipine was increased to 10mg daily which controlled her pressures well.
The Amlodipine dose was decreased back to 5 mg PO daily.
# Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Metastases to brain and spine, s/p total brain irradiation, scheduled to start chemo week of [**2112-10-2**].
# Hypothyroidism: She has a history of Grave's disease s/p ablative therapy.
She was continued on her home dose of levothyroxine without complications.
