Her AFP was documented as 4.2 at that time and she was scheduled for ERCP for stent placement.
ERCP was performed [**2123-1-26**] and revealed no evidence of extrahepatic biliary stricturing, diffuse stenosis of intrahepatic ducts with no lesion appropriate for stent placement.
Since the ERCP, patient has noted increased somnolence and fatigue; she has been falling asleep during conversations and has trouble going up and down stairs.
Stable, chronic, non-radiating RUQ pain well controlled with oxycodone prn.
Patient was admitted from clinic today after detailing these complaints for management of suspected infection and possible hepatic encephalopathy.
[**2-14**]: Resection of segment VII HCC 2.
[**6-17**]: Resection of segment VI HCC 3.
HCC s/p segmentectomy  Social History: She is a dentist who works with her husband in a mutually owned dental practice in [**Location (un) 686**].
Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 97.1 BP: 90/60 HR: 101 RR: 16 02 sat: 99% RA Wt: 61.7 kg GENERAL: NAD, AAOx3 HEENT: NCAT, OP clear, MM dry CARDIAC: RRR s mrg LUNG: CTA with diminished BS at bases bilaterally ABDOMEN: mildly distended, S, mild TTP R side > L side without rebound, guarding, or rigidity, no appreciable fluid wave or shifting dullness EXT: WWP, [**12-12**]+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally, 2+ pulses NEURO: DERM: Spider angiomata on trunk.
Clamped right-sided transhepatic pigtail catheter in place with no appreciable change in size of two hepatic abscesses within segments VII and VIII since [**2122-12-18**].
ERCP [**2123-1-26**]: Cannulation of the biliary duct was obtained and contrast medium was injected, revealing a normal-appearing CBD, cystic duct and gallbladder.
An area of contrast extravasation at the right posterior intrahepatic duct apparently corresponds to a prior drain site seen on a previous CT examination.
Cefepime & CEFTAZIDIME sensitivity testing confirmed by Microscan.
Removal of the right transhepatic drainage catheter with reaccumulation of fluid posterior to the right hepatic lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 year female with history of PBC complicated by cirrhosis, HCC s/p surgical resection, HCC recurrence s/p TACE complicated by biliary ischemia and hepatic abscesses s/p surgical drain placement and IV abx who presented with somnolence as well as fevers and was found to be hyponatremic with recurrent hepatic abscesses and blood cultures positive for MDR Pseudomonas.
Her old PICC line was discontinued and she was started on cipro monotherapy given her documented allergy to penicillin.
A new double lumen power PICC was placed on [**2-9**] after the patient had been blood culture negative and afebrile for several days.
She was also desensitized to penicillin per MICU protocol and started on Zosyn prior to discharge.
Interventional radiology was consulted for hepatic abscess drainage, but felt that the abscesses were small enough where antibiotic penetration would be possible without drainage.
She was treated with lactulose, lasix, aldactone, cholestyramine, ursodiol, and oxycodone with only minor modifcations in dosing when compared to her previous home regimen.
Mental status improved to baseline and patient was alert and oriented times 3 on discharge after sodium correction with fluid restrcition and administration of lactulose.
The patient's home mesalamine regimen was continued.
CODE: The patient's code status was established as DNR/DNI this admission following a conversation with the patient and her family concerning her poor prognosis given her worsening liver failure secondary to treatment refractory, progressive HCC.

You were found to have recurrent liver abscesses and your blood was infected with an antibiotic resistant bacteria called Pseudomonas.
Your old PICC was removed as a result of the infection and a new one was placed several days later for continued long term IV antibiotic treatment.
You were desensitized to pencillin and will be started on an extended course of Zosyn (a stronger penicillin related antibiotic) and Cipro.
It appears that the abscesses are too small to be drained at this time and should respond to your antibiotic regimen.
Unfortunately, it also appears as though your known liver cancer continues to progress despite all the treatments you have received.
The following changes have been made to your home medication regimen: - You will be on Zosyn 4.5 grams IV every 8 hours indefinitely - You will be on ciprofloxaxin 400mg IV twice daily indefinitely - Your home furosemide dose has been decreased to 20mg daily - Your home spironolactone dose has been decreased to 50mg daily - You will be started on lactulose which should be titrated to help ensure daily bowel movements .
