he has been admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] for sork-up for a newly identified pancreatic mass found during a recent episode of gallstone pancreatitis.
ERCP was unable to perform sphincerotomy or obtain brush sample secondary to significant inflammation and edema.
The patient was sent to [**Location (un) **] NPO on TPN for bowel rest in the hope that there would be a redcution in the edema so that a Whipple procedure might be possible.
he also received 2 liters of fluid, a CXR was performed in addition to blood cultures.
Patient was transferred to the ICU for further management fo sepsis   Past Medical History: Pancreatitis s/p ERCP.

The right subclavian PICC line extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
Status post Whipple procedure and removal of surgical bed drains.
A couple of foci of gas are consistent with removal of the drainage catheters, but no new fluid collections identified.
Diagnostic consideration for this lesion include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm versus pseudocyst related to prior pancreatitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo male with recent pancreatitis from pancreatic CA on TPN sent in for fever and hypotension SBP 70s concerning for sepsis.
Differential includes pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, line infection from TPN picc, and infectious diarrhea.
- CT scan ABD - cont vanc, and flagyl - can now d/c levo as has not grown any gram neg's in 48 hours - surveillance cultures to make sure is clearing infection - consider Echo to r/o endocarditis - goal to keep fluids even, can give IVFs is patient dry or febrile - catheter tip - coag negative staph  .
- multiple cdiff negative, have good reason for diarrhea with bacteremia, will d/c flagyl .
Due to significant inflammation around pancreas, ampulla could not be visualized and brushings could not be obtained.
Pt had been transferred to [**Hospital1 **] in [**Hospital1 1474**] so that he could remain on TPN in an effort to reduce this inflammation and possibly move forward with a Whipple.
