Admission Date:  [**2159-5-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-6-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-2-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year-old female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets, history of PE, recent radiation therapy and steroids who presented in [**2159-4-2**] with myopathy presumed secondary to sterids, which have been given for her brain mets.
She was treated with Levaquin given her temperatures and differential diagnosis of increased PE burden load, infections or pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer.
Her induced sputum was negative and BOL was done and also negative.
She was given Bactrim and she had improvement in the shortness of breath after her Bactrim was started and improved room air sats and was sent home on Bactrim.
She presented on clinic on [**5-30**] with hypotension for which she was given intravenous fluids.
The patient was given Vancomycin and a gram of intravenous fluids.
Currently the patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further medical care.
Breast cancer left side diagnosed in [**2129**] status post [**2150**] mastectomy with 5 out of 9 positive lymph nodes.
She was treated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant and then later with Tamoxifen from [**2151**] to [**2156**].
In [**2158**] she had mediastinal lymphadenopathy treated with Taxol and changed to Navelbine on [**3-7**].
She had diagnosed brain mets in [**2159-3-4**] right side cerebella and parietal for which she was treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and Decadron.
History of pulmonary embolism in [**2159-4-2**] treated with only aspirin secondary to brain mets.
Protonix 40 mg q day.
Colace 200 b.i.d.
Heparin subq.
Prednisone 40 q day.
Clindamycin 900 q 8.
Levaquin 500 q day.
She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion.
Given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz, Levaquin and __________ and Clindamycin.
Lab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Clindamycin and _______________ was discontinued early in hospital course.
In addition, Vancomycin, Levaquin were also discontinued.
She was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy.
Unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days.
The patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory.
She required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neo-synephrine.
Later during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back.
It was quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine.
She was also given stress dose steroids.
As mentioned above the patient's hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine.
By [**6-7**], however, the patient had been off of neo-synephrine, but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband/health care proxy.
Initially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Ceptaz, Levaquin, Clindamycin and _________.
She was negative for PCP and subsequently _____________ was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage.
In addition her Vancomycin and Levaquin were also discontinued.
By virtue of discussions on [**6-7**] the patient was deemed to be CMO and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point.
She was initially supported with tube feeds during her Intensive Care Unit course, but at this point the patient is CMO and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued.
Subsequently all antibiotics, blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn.
Currently she is comfortable with morphine and Ativan prn.
Tylenol prn.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn.
