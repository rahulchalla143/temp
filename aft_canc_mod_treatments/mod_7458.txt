Final Report HISTORY: Status post left frontal craniotomy for excision of left frontal lobe mass.
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed utilizing sagittal and axial T1, axial T2, axial gradient, axial FLAIR and diffusion with ADC map sequences without intravenous contrast.
After the administration of intravenous contrast, axial T1 and sagittal MP-RAGE sequences were performed with coronal and axial MP-RAGE reconstructions.
FINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy and excision of the left frontal lobe enhancing parenchymal mass.
There is minimal scalp swelling in the region of the left frontal craniotomy and minimal extra-axial fluid at the surgical site.
Within the surgical bed within the left frontal lobe, there are blood products and surrounding edema within the white matter with minimal surrounding mass effect.
IMPRESSION: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with excision of the left frontal parenchymal mass.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2-2**] for resection and patient was transferred to neurosurgery after the resection.
Of note, given the concern for malignancy, Dilantin was switched to Keppra 1g [**Hospital1 **] and he did not have any further events concerning for seizure.
