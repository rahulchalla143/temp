Admission Date:  [**2154-10-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-10-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3853**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: chest tube placement  History of Present Illness: 79 yo w/GIST, diastolic CHF, Afib presents with dyspnea on exertion and chest pain.
- GIST: Diagnosed in [**2143**], treated with surgery and multiple intermittant courses of gleevac, complicated by side effects.
She had partial gastrectomy and GIST resection in [**2143**], and a GIST omental metastasis resection in 03/[**2153**].
Started on Sutent since [**2153-10-1**].
- DIABETES MELLITUS - Chronic DYSPNEA, exertional - HYPERTENSION - HYPOTHYROIDISM - CVA in [**2136**], Residual R hemiparesis and intermittent aphasia, - TIA in [**2148**] - Status post knee surgery in [**2137**].
Completely decompressed urinary bladder with Foley catheter in place and no residual urine noted within the bladder.
On review of the prior CT, no distended bladder is identified - it is possible that the post void residual seen was due to above loculated hemoperitoneum given the extent of fluid as described.
Complete drainage of right pleural fluid collection after placement of right basal pleural catheter.
These findings should be reassessed in [**3-19**] weeks (or per continuing surveillance plans for intraabdominal malignancy) with a contrast CT study.
Interval drainage of right pleural effusion with pleural catheter in place and hydropneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo w/GIST, diastolic CHF, Afib presents with dyspnea on exertion and chest pain, found to have dropping Hgb likely source was hemoperitoneum and hemothorax .
She underwent chest tube placement by IP at the bedside (see below).
She was also seen by Surgery Consult for possible surgical intervention, however, given the metastatic disease, she is a poor surgical candidate.
Furthermore, pt and her family did not want to pursue surgery as an option.
Her case was discussed with IR and they could not see a localized source of bleeding on the CT scans and suggested a tagged RBC scan to further eval for bleeding.
However, b/c of [**Last Name (un) **], even if a tagged RBC scan could localize bleeding, angiography and intervention would come at high risk for worsening [**Last Name (un) **] given contrast load and risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
# Distolic Heart Failure: Home lasix was held on admission due to [**Last Name (un) **].
IV lasix was started and a Foley was placed.
Her medications were then discontinued when the family decided to shift the concentration of the patients care towards comfort.
IP was consulted for a thoracentesis and a chest tube was placed, which drained significantly bloody effusion.
Improved after transfusion of PRBC's as well as IV diuresis for presumed volume overload with acute on chronic [**Last Name (un) 9215**].
[**Last Name (un) **] then recurred, in the setting of intravascular volume depletion with acute blood loss anemia and aggressive IV diuresis.
Urine lytes c/w pre-renal etiology, Foley catheter placement and abdominal imaging ruled out post-renal obstruction.
Creatinine and UOP improved with additional PRBC transfusion.
# ICU course: Patient transferred to ICU on [**10-19**] due to concern for hemoperitoneum, oliguric renal failure, and compartment syndrome.
Per daughter/HCP, do not want to proceed with surgery and paracentesis not an option given increased risk of bleeding.
Her insulin sliding scale and ceftriaxone were discontinued.
She was started on dilaudid IV 0.3-0.6mg q1h:PRN for shortness of breath and pain.
Her symptoms were agressviely managed and support was offered to the family.
