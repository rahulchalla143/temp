He was also seen to develop loculated pleural effusions, and so he had a pigtail placed on [**8-25**]; CXR post placement revealed a right lung fluid in new loculated effusion/ hydropneumothorax towards apex with the left effusion unchanged.
THe patient then had a chest tube placed on the left for drainage of that effusion.
When drainage had decreased significantly and there were no signs of pneumothorax, the patient's left and then right pigtails were removed, which he tolerated well.
He remained on the ventilator and had a tracheostomy placed on [**9-24**], which he tolerated well.
He triggered 6x on the floor for dyspnea and hypotension.
Pt given albumin for volume expansion transiently resulting in an increase in BP into the 90s.
[**1-9**] overwhelming nursing concern, transient hypotension, concern for worsening hypercarbia, decrease in mental status, pt transferred to ICU for further management.
Pt intubated for hypercarbia and for fluid management concern as latest cxr revealed volume overload versus underlying pna(no fevers)  [**9-8**] - Pt self-extubated in AM, reintubated in CVICU, was hypotensive, femoral a-line and RIJ triple lumen placed.
Pt taken back to OR for ~5hr exploration as to acute decompensation, bronchoscopy unrevealing, on ex-lap multiple loculated abscesses found and drained, JPs left in place, anastomosis no leak.
Overnight in CVICU had a slight dropoff of UOP and mild hypotension, responded to fluid bolus.
[**9-9**]-off pressors, excellent urine output, transfused 1UPRBC, continues on TPN, started on lasix gtt to augment diuresis for possible closure, vanc trough appropriate  [**2162-9-10**]-Transfused 1 unit of PRBC's with goal of keeping patient above goal of 30.
[**9-12**] washout Monday with closure; diuresis augmented with lasix gtt and diamox, rate increased to blow off more co2, TPN concentrated, non contrast head and chest shot, negative 3+L over 24h  [**9-13**]-Pt to OR for attempted closure.
Had Left chest tube placed for pleural collection.
Pt still not on pressors making 50-80cc's hour.
[**9-14**] - albumin added in attempt to decrease edema, lasix bolus to [**Male First Name (un) **] albumin as neg balance reaching even.
[**9-15**] lasix boluses d/c'ed in favor of lasix gtt, [**State **] patch tightened, IR/CT guided drainage deferred to tomorrow AM, vivonex 20cc/hr to be held at midnight started.
For IP drainage of right apical effusion today, if drainage successful chest tube to be d/c'ed by thoracic.
[**9-17**]- maintained negative, R chest tube removed by thoracic surgery [**9-18**] - Continue to make 1/2L negative, follow BUN/Cr, daily CXR [**9-19**]-started vanc--goals remain similar as yesteday.
[**9-20**] - TPN reordered, lasix gtt to continue per thoracic, titrate to goal 0-1L negative.
Post-line CXR - small line near left heart border, rads resident read as possible pneumomediastinum, again line on repeat CXR.
Possible pneumomediastinum unlikely related to line placement, pt w/ esophagectomy, ?air tracking from open abdomen or surgical site, pt remain hemodynamically stable overnight.
[**9-22**] Went back to OR today, DC left chest tubes, dc both JP drains, DC ng tube, placed bovine pericarial matrix on superior portion of wound, and closed the infraumbilical portion.
Want to continue vanc, zosyn, fluconazole for a few more days.
Fentanyl was weaned from 200 to 150.
[**9-23**] TF advanced w/ TPN x 1 more day.
No change in vent setting (kept on CMV) as NPO for trach in AM.
[**9-24**] trach'ed, picc line in place, vac changed in OR, sedation weaned, resp weaning as much as possible [**9-25**] - On [**9-25**] the patient was noted to be febrile to 103 - though with a stable blood pressure, and he was pancultured for concern with sepsis.
He underwent takedown of the vac dressing and the pericardial mesh with opening of the skin closure on [**9-26**] at the bedside.
[**9-27**] - no HIDA scan, ostomy nurse creates large vacuum sump for EC fistula, 2UPRBC xfused, TPN continues, no tube study necessary for EC fistula as prior contrast passes distal to the fistula, currently on only Zosyn - added Vanco due to new culture data from cath tip [**9-28**] - Pt taken by IR for placement of cholecystostomy tube.
[**9-29**] - Bactrim started for stenotrophomonas.
Lasix gtt started for diuresis.
[**9-30**] - ID consulted, [**Last Name (un) 2830**] caspo bactrim started, hemodynamically stable so far, weaned of versed gtt with intermittent ativan used for sedation, daily cultures to be obtained with sputum per ID [**10-2**] - tolerating PS (PS18/PEEP5/50%) x 12 hours overnight.
[**10-3**] - became intolerant of CPAP+PS placed back on the vent, spiked to 102 pan cultured, lasix gtt restarted with goal -500/-1L negative, CXR in am to be obtained, nutrition labs obtained, OT consulted, abx continue [**10-4**]: DC vanco, DC [**Last Name (un) 2830**], started vivonex tube feeds for nutrition; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] wants daily plan update emailed to him from team.
Given albumin with hope of mobilizing extravascular fluid(albumin 2.0).
Started patient on methadone 20 Q 8 and PO valium 10 Q 6.
DC fentanyl and versed drip.
[**10-5**]: vent regimen to PS20 (from PS25) 2-3x/day for diaphragm exercise.
Cr to 1.2 today - hold lasix gtt; good uop.
Bowel regimen started (MoM, colace, dulcolax), enema next; received 2 units PRBC; restarted lasix gtt at low dose in PM for net pos 3 L --> aim for euvolemia.
[**10-6**] : Continued to tolerate PS20 throughout the day and night; lasix gtt held [**1-9**] to reduced effect and rising BUN/Cr over the course of the day; speciation of sputum culture from [**10-1**] shows bactrim resistance -> tobramycin added [**10-7**] - tobra d/c'ed, increasing cr, lasix gtt d/c'ed.
o/n high peak pressures (PIP 40s, plateau 30s), severe resp acidosis + metab acidosis, anuria/oliguria, back to pressure controlled ventilation 10/31 - hypothermic x 2 (both axillary temps), bedside echo adequate intravascular filling with nl contractility; bronch for elevated airway pressures, no plugs, minimal thin secretions, BAL sent; left IJ placed w/ SvO2 monitoring, SvO2 80s.
Bicarb 2 amps x 2.
[**10-9**] - [**10-11**] - off caspo, tobramycin d'c'd.
Reamined on pressure support ventilation, poor tidal volumes.
He required increasing sedation to fentanyl 400/hr.
The patient also underwent a gastrograffin study that revealed free flow of contrast from the rectum to the distal transverse colon with drainage into the anterior abdominal wound via colocutaneous fistula without evidence for an obstructing lesion in the left colon.
His antibiotics were continued.
He remained on PCV ventilation but became hypocapnic but also with a low bicarb.
On half dose tube feeds with fat free TPN.
Hemostasis was achieved through application of Surgicell.
failed attempted cardioversion at 50, 100 and 200J.
[**10-22**]: CT torso - no changes/new acute issues very hypotensive, tachycardic overnight, was in A flutter, cardioversion x 2.
Patient continued on pressors, tpn, amiodarone for afib, stable ventilartory setting but continued to have rising liver finction tests and required increased doses of pressors so that he also had a very positive fluid balance for a few days in a row.
