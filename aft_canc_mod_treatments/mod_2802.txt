Bbronchoscopy - endoluminal laser therapy 2.
Bronchial artery embolization  History of Present Illness: 63M with h/o COPD and T4N2 IIIB NSCLC diagnosed in [**2133-10-27**] s/p 4 cycles of carboplatin and taxol and 8000gy radiation (6600 cGy between [**2134-1-8**] - [**2134-3-17**] and 1400 cGy from [**2135-11-3**] - [**2135-11-9**]) who presented to the [**Location 1268**] [**Location **] on [**2135-12-31**] with hemoptysis.
His first episode of hemoptysis resulted in admission [**2135-10-30**] to [**2135-11-4**] which was notable for tx to MICU and flexible bronchoscopy with limited visualization due to clot; he received palliative radiation as above.
After this he was breifly hospitalized for "walking PNA" and received a course of antibiotics (he thinks augmentin) and did well until [**2135-12-31**] when he began coughing up bright red blood ([**3-1**] teaspoons, then 150cc later in day).
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy with intraluminal laser therapy as he can no longer receive XRT to central or left side of his chest.
COPD, intubated x2 for exacerbations, FEV1 = 1.24 (36%) in [**7-1**]; 1L home oxygen at night 3.
PROCEDURE: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, and written informed consent was obtained.
A pre-procedure time out was performed.
Local anesthesia was achieved via injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.
Using fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was accessed using a 19 gauge single wall puncture needle.
The needle was removed, and a 5 French sheath placed over the wire.
A 5 French pigtail catheter was advanced over the wire to the level of the aortic arch.
A right bronchial artery was visualized exiting from the thoracic aorta, with multiple collaterals traversing the mediastinum and terminating in abnormal appearing vessels within the left aspect of the mediastinum, consistent with tumor vasculature.
A fasttracker catheter was selected and advanced superselectivel into a second order bronchial [**Last Name (un) **] of the right bronchial artery.
Embolization was performed via injection of 500 to 700 micrometer embospheres to the end point of arterial stasis.
Following the performance of embolization, the catheter was repositioned to the left subclavian artery and selective arteriography performed.
Also due to the tiny size of these collateral vessels as well as the possible pulmonary territory that they supply, a decision was made to forego embolization of these small collaterals and if bleeding should not be controlled they may hypertrophy in the future .
The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications evident at the time of the procedure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26080**] was admitted to the medicine floor for bronchoscopy and possible endoluminal laser therapy as he has had maximal XRT to the chest.
There is no indication for endobronchial therapy for his lung cancer.
He underwent left bronchial artery embolization by interventional radiology.
The patient coughed up 1 cup of clots/blood post-procudure but was hemodynamically stable.
He was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He was started on a diltiazem drip and oral diltiazem with good response.
The diltiazem drip was weaned and he was stable on oral diltiazem and metoprolol.
He was started on levofloxacin for possible post obstruction pneumonia.
He was weaned from the ventilator on [**2136-1-6**].
He was started on a diltiazem drip and oral diltiazem with good response.
The diltiazem drip was weaned and he was stable on oral diltiazem and metoprolol.
He was maintained on diltiazem and metoprolol.
This may be a malignant pericardial effusion and showed be followed with repeat echos.
GERD: He was continued on lansoprazole.
