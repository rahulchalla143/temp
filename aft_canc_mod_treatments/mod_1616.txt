On [**2140-7-25**], she developed hypoxia post thoracentesis requiring NRB and was transferred to the MICU.
IP placed a pigtail catheter to drain re-accumulated right pleural effusion [**2140-7-26**].
She was able to be weaned to 3L NC and went back to the medical floor for management of hyponatremia and worsening renal function.
She underwent ABO (A) incompatible liver (she was blood type O) with splenectomy on [**2140-8-9**].
Pheresis was done just prior to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for Anti A titer of 512.
She required blood products in the immediate postop period, but remained hemodynamically stable.
A total of 13 treatments were done.
Immunosuppression consisted of steroid taper per protocol, CellCept [**Hospital1 **], ATG and Prograf which was started on postop day 1.
Urine output increased around postop day 7 and dialysis was stopped ([**8-19**]).
Urine output was approximately 2 liters, however, creatinine and BUN continued to increase up to 105.
Dialysis was resumed on [**8-24**], and continued daily on [**8-25**] and [**8-26**].
The plan was for her to continue on hemodialysis at least twice weekly on Mondays and Fridays.
On [**8-25**], the temporary dialysis line was exchanged for a tunnelled HD line in interventional radiology.
A right-sided 23-cm tip-to-cuff hemodialysis line with tip was seen in the right atrium, ready for use.
Therefore, a feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were started.
She required intermittent sliding scale insulin for hyperglycemia due to steroids.
The splenic bed JP drain output appeared milky.
Drain output volume decreased from 900ml/day to 300ml/day.
