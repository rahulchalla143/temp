Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: 1.
Liver, right lobe, lobectomy 1.
Parenchymal resection margin is free of tumor.
Minimal steatosis is identified (involving <5% of the parenchyma); no iron deposition is seen on iron stain.
Parenchymal resection margin is free of tumor.
Note:  Immunostains of the tumor are positive for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2, and negative for CK7 and TTF-1, with satisfactory controls.
This immunophenotype is consistent with a colonic origin, supporting the above morphologic diagnosis.
