However, the basal cisterns at this stage remain preserved  MRI: Rim enhancing lesions in the right cerebellum, left frontal corona radiata and left post-central region and right parieto-temporal lobes with surrounding edema and mass effect as described above; abnormal enhancement surrounding the right lateral ventricle likely representing subependymal extension.
Possible leptomeningeal involvement given the subependymal enhancement.
NS consult/close f/u if no surgical intervention is contemplated   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 112340**] is a 51 yo F with LUL and RUL FDG avid lesions who presented to [**Location (un) 1459**]/[**Hospital3 **] in [**Month (only) 958**] with unintentional weight loss and severe left sided chest and arm pain admitted for expedited workup of lung lesions, now found to have altered mental status and brain masses.
Given the extent of edema and pt's worsening mental status, Pt was started on dexamethasone 12mg iv x 1, followed by dexamethasone 4mg iv q6h.
Pt reportedly had seizure like activity on [**2132-4-23**] evening, and Pt was started on levetiracetam 1000mg iv x 1 and 750mg iv q12h.
Given changes in mental status and marked concern from neurosurgery consult service, discussed with Neuro-onc attending, who transferred pt to neuro-icu for dexamethasone (4mg IV Q6H and mannitol 25g Q4H).
Patient was extubated on [**2132-4-26**] and [**2132-4-27**] a family meeting was held at the bedside with palliative care, neurosurgery, SICU team, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] and patient's mother/sister.
It was explained that patient will likely not survive and she is too unstable to receive any treatment at this time, including whole brain radiation.
Per Dr. [**Name (NI) 86075**] recommendations, mannitol was weaned off on [**4-28**].
At that point the family understands that the primary issues are to control her symptoms including pain, discomfort, agitation, anxiety.
Given the lack of clinical improvement, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] and the medical team agreed that radiation therapy is not safe and should not be pursued and that the patient be made comfort care only.
Guardianship paperwork was completed as patient cannot make her own decisions and she has no healthcare proxy appointed.
#Comfort: She was started on haldol, ativan and dilaudid which helped with her agitation.
Palliative Care followed the patient and made recommendations on adjustments to medications to maximize comfort.
The patient's mannitol was stopped on [**4-28**] and she was transferred to the Medical Oncology team.
DDx included fungal infection, infiltrating malingancy, bony mets, pulmonary embolism and ACS.
ACS was unlikely given ECG with no changes and ongoing nature of chest pain with reproducibility on palpation and position changes.
# RUE, RLE numbness and weakness:  Atrius records suggest RLE/LUE sensorimotor neuropathies, but unable to discern on exam due to lack of Pt participation.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] mother describes that Pt has R upper extremity and R lower extremity numbness and weakness for at least 2 weeks.
Gabapentin was started a few weeks ago to try and help with her numbness.
