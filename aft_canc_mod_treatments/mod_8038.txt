Patient has been on multiple chemo/hormonal therapy in the past (see below).
She underwent ERCP with stent placement and was discharged after therapeutic paracentesis and abx course.
More recently, she has been started on gemcitabine and was last seen by her oncologist on [**8-27**] in clinic for administration of the next dose of her 1st cycle.
However, she was found to have severe mucositis with an ANC of 740 (WBC 1.1) and it was decided to hold off further chemo for now and reassess next week.
She was given one dose of Cefepime 2gm IV, 500mg of Levoflox and Tylenol and was admitted to the ICU.
She was treated with Zoladex and tamoxifen initially and then switched to Femara with Zoladex secondary to progression of her disease.
- In [**5-11**] she noticed a large lump in her R breast and her tumor markers had increased so treatment was again changed to Aromasin.
She received a total of 5 cycles of single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Taxol and then on [**2131-1-9**] was started on weekly Taxol and D1,D15 Avastin IV as her umor markers were increasing - [**8-10**], she was also started on Zometa, which has not been repeated since then due to severe side effects.
- Her CA27.29 continued to rise despite Taxol/Avastin x3 cycles so she was switched to Xeloda/Avastin on [**2131-4-9**].
- Admitted on [**7-4**] for CBD compression due to liver mets, s/p biliary stent and therapeutic paracentesis; received also adriamycin during this admission - [**8-11**], she was started on gemcitabine, was on d#8 of first cycle on [**8-27**] when severe mucositis was noted.
# Respiratory distress: She was orally intubated due to increased O2 requirements as well as increased work of breathing on [**8-30**].
Difficulty to wean was thought most likely secondary to multiple etiologies including ARDS, pulmonary edema, and total body volume overload resulting in pressure-dependent atelectasis.
She was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for broad-spectrum coverage, fever quickly resolved, and continued to have negative cultures.
She also received a course of stress-dose steroids.
Out of concern for line infection, her central line was removed and a new one placed.
She remained pressor dependent despite frequent crystalloid and colloid boluses.
Etiology of the coagulopathy was thought to be multifactorial including liver failure and hemodilution [**3-9**] fluid overload.
Serial coags were followed and FFP administered as needed.
It was thought most likely pre-renal, secondary to hypovolemia, and initially her renal fuction improved s/p volume repletion.
s/p biliary stent placement.
Was on Gemcitabine to treat her liver mets, however recently stopped for severe mucositis.
Her primary oncologist was aware of pt's presence in the ICU and did not feel that she was a candidate for any further therapy.
# Her family advanced her code status to comfort measures only when it was felt that further medical treatment was futile.
Aldactone 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Prilosec 40mg daily Ursodiol (does not know dose) Viscous lidocaine as needed .
