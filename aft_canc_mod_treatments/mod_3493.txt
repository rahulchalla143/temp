# Neuroendocrine tumor: Preliminary BM biopsy was consistent with neuroendocrine tumor, not lymphoma.

CT chest with opacities and concern for possible infectious process, and the patient was broadly covered with vancomycin and zosyn for possible PNA.
# Hypotension: The patient became increasingly hypotensive as acidosis worsened and ventilation and sedation were increased.
An arterial line was placed without complication and the patient was started on levophed, which was uptitrated to maximal settings, and vasopressin which produced temporary increases in SBP.
Pressors failed to maintain BPs as the patient became more acidemic, and despite receiving multiple crystalloid boluses with LR, the patient's MAPs began to steadily decline.
