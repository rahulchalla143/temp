Admission Date:  [**2171-10-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-11-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-1-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for tracheostomy & PEG tube placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy PEG tube placement Lumbar Puncture Red blood cell transfusion Platelet transfusion Chemotherapy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 22yo male with PMH significant for mediastinal germ cell tumor with airway obstruction s/p cycle 3 of cisplatin & etoposide ([**Date range (1) 32684**])who presents for elective tracheostomy & PEG tube placement.
Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-20**] after undergoing stent placement in the left mainstem bronchus and Y stent placement in the trachea.
At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for acute respiratory distress.
Patient had multiple episodes of desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better ETT positioning.
Patient's double lumen ETT was changed to a single lumen on [**7-26**] for better ventilation.
Course complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube placement which were d/c'ed on [**8-24**] and [**8-25**].
He was transferred at this time to [**Hospital1 18**] for Y stent placement and then transferred back to [**Hospital1 2177**].
He was extubated on [**9-21**] and initially did well but could not adequately handle the secretions so he was taken to the OR on [**9-27**] for tracheostomy by ENT.
The procedure was technically difficult since the Y stent was too high.
Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**].
Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol, dexamethasone, and IV fluids.
Chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions on Neupogen.
Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF.
However, with stabilization, patient underwent cycle 2 of carboplatinum and etoposide on [**8-4**].
From an ID perspective, following cycle 1 of chemotherapy, patient was diagnosed with a VAP on [**7-28**] and was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
Cefepime was changed to Zosyn when patient's sputum culture was (+) for Achromobacter on [**8-7**].
He completed a 15 day course of gentamicin and cefepime, despite nephrotoxicity as pseudomonas in wound culture was only sensitive to Gentamicin.
Patient was then started on Vancomycin due to MRSA from R quinton tip culture.
Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in sputum and urine.
He was placed on empiric Flagyl at this time.
Patient then had temp spike through above broad antibiotic coverage and empiric caspofungin started on [**9-15**].
Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor response.
Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal.
R Quinton placed in R IJ and patient was started on HD on [**8-17**].
He eventually responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection.
Past Medical History: # Germ cell tumor in mediastinum - s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy # pancytopenia [**3-15**] chemotherapy   Social History: Patient was a student at [**State 1558**] in accounting.

Stent positions, including the tracheal and left main bronchus components, is unchanged.
Nasogastric tube is looped in a very distended stomach.
Position of tracheostomy tube, right PICC catheter, and anterior mediastinal widening is not significantly changed.
The above findings likely represent hemorrhage related to tumor necrosis following radiation therapy.
Stable leftward shift of the midline and subfalcine herniation.

He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a Y stent was placed and extubated and did well for 1 week; he was subsequently reintubated at [**Hospital1 2177**] due to increased secretions and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tracheostomy.
He tolerated the procedure well on [**10-3**] and has been stable post- tracheostomy.
He tolerated SBT and was placed on tracheal mask at 5pm on [**10-4**] and tolerated well.
Propofol was been weaned.
He was put on pressure support due to thick respiratory secretions, however was weaned to trach mask after 5 days.
He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin.
He was initially requiring mechanical ventillation but then tolerated trach collar mask after a few days.
Patient continued on trach collar during his stay, with a stable oxygen requirement of 35-40%.
He completed a course of treatment for MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
Vancomycin, cefepime, tobramycin and flagyl were all re-started.
s/p 3 cycles of etoposide & cisplatin ([**Date range (1) 24155**]).
He completed a course of whole brain ([**6-15**]) and chest (15/15) radiation therapy.
He then underwent another course of chemotherapy on [**2171-11-7**].
On [**11-13**], patient had abrupt decline in his neurological status, and resultant left sided total paralysis.
Keppra was initiated and continued as seizure prophylaxis.
Steroids were also initiated and increased at the time of the neurological decline.
It is possible that this is a drug toxicity from chemotherapy (was given cisplatin and carboplatin) or that this is related to IV contrast for abdominal CT.
However, ARF developed weeks after last chemo dose and 4 days after getting contrast on [**10-6**].
He received several transfusions to help with his anemia.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia after his chemotherapy, and was transfused frequently to keep his platelet count around 100, to avoid any further bleeding from his brain metastases.
# FEN: Given tube feeds via PEG.
Was evaluated by speech and swallow and found to tolerate solids and thin liquids.
The patient's father desired that antibiotics and intravenous fluids be continued, and these wishes were respected.
