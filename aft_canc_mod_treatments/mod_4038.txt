Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Longstanding history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with myeloid metaplasia s/p splenectomy [**2188**], previously treated with hydroxyurea and splenectomy.
He was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia on the [**2196-6-6**], negative for NPM mutation and for the FLT 3 mutation, treated with induction chemotherapy of idarubicin and Ara-C, but had persistent disease and was therefore reinduced with mitoxantrone, etoposide and Ara-C on the [**2196-6-1**].
He recovered from those, was discharged from the hospital on [**2196-7-26**] to complete a course of IV meropenem and daptomycin for his E. coli and VRE bacteremia.
He did not have a sibling donor, but a [**5-24**] matched unrelated donor was identified and the patient has agreed to participate in protocol 07-384, reduced intensity conditioning for an allo hematopoietic stem cell transplant using clofarabine, total lymphoid radiation and ATG.

Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
Examination of the sigmoid and descending colon including the splenic flexure demonstrates thickening of the bowel walls with areas of surrounding fat stranding as well as areas of mucosal enhancement.
There is mucosal thickening around the ostiomeatal units with obstruction of the infundibulum on the right.
The olfactory fossae are [**Last Name (un) 36826**] type [**1-20**] bilaterally with some demineralization of the cribriform plate and lateral lamellae; left cribriform plate is higher than right.
Extensive soft tissue swelling, which is centered in the right oropharyngeal mucosal space and palatine fossa, extends into the right pyriform sinus of the hypopharynx and likewise involves the right submandibular space and right neck soft tissue planes.
Multifocal lytic and sclerotic bone lesions, unchanged since [**2196-5-18**].
New fluid opacification of the bilateral sphenoidal sinuses, which may represent acute infection or may be due to pooling of secretions after endotracheal intubation.
PORTABLE CXR [**12-1**] Left internal jugular line ends at mid SVC.
The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina and is appropriate.
Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is beyond radiographic view.

Erythrocytes are decreased in number and exhibit anisopoikilocytosis including targets, elliptocytes, dacrocytes, and occasional red cell fragments.
The majority of marrow is replaced by fibrosis, with scattered dysplastic erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic cells and overall cellularity not greater than 10%.
[**2196-12-6**] BONE MARROW BIOPSY SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.

# RELAPSED AML Patient was s/p MUD transplant at time of admission.
Given disease relapse after allotransplant, immunosuppression tapered off.
He underwent MEC reinduction d1 [**11-5**] with Hydroxyurea [**11-4**] and [**11-5**].
Initially, given history of E. coli and VRE bacteremia, he was empirically started on meropenem and daptomycin, then broadened to voriconazole given hx fungal PNA.
Pseudomonas from throat swab noted to have evolved resistance to ciprofloxacin along with MDR E. coli.
Patient was started on colistin on [**12-16**].
Patient had hx PCR+ C diff so he was empirically started on PO vancomycin.
He was made NPO for bowel rest.
Briefly required levophed and vasopressin for BP support.
Intubated for airway protection for 11 days until patient had cuff leak, decreased secretions, and improvement in swelling.
Tonsillar necrosis was treated supportively with normal saline washes and daily debridement by ENT.
Ulcer continued to bleed at a low-level and patient was unable to manage oral secretions, so he required frequent suctioning.
Continued on daptomycin for gram positive coverage of oral bacteria, in case of translocation through necrotic tissue.
Flagyl was added for oral anaerobe coverage.
Given inability to swallow liquids or solids without aspirating, he was kept NPO on TPN.
# PNEUMONIA In the ICU he developed a RUL seen on CXR which was treated as ventilator associated pneumonia.
Sputum originally grew pseudomonas, with the same sensitivities as in blood, which was treated with zosyn with double coverage with tobramycin.
Repeat cultures from throat showed evolution of cipro resistance to the Cipro and colistin was started as above.
# Hx GERD: Continued omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY, then transitioned to IV PPi once he was no longer tolerating POs.
