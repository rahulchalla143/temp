Admission Date:  [**2147-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-6-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-11-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plavix / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis, fever, inability to ventilate  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy revision Arterial line Central venous line Peripherally inserted central catheter  History of Present Illness: 73F h/o DM, multiple CVAs, disseminated TB on tx since [**12-28**], trached for resp failure with prolonged intubation/failure to wean living at MACU/[**Hospital **] rehab, developed resp distress at 0530 on [**2147-5-30**], RR-36-40; HR 136, T noted to be 99.8, BP noted to be 125/68.
Pt apparently was already on vanc and imipenem starting [**2147-5-29**] for presumed VAP pna.
Difficulty with bag valve mask as well.
IVF given, BP with pressors rebounded to 110s-120s.
The patient was bronched and 80% occlusion of trach tube with granulation tissue was noted distal to the end of trach.
The tube was then pulled back with successful re-inflation of the L lung.
Pt previously admitted on [**2146-12-4**] for ataxia, was dx'd with acute stroke, disseminated TB, seizurers, was trached due to prolonged intubation/failure to wean, then xferred on [**1-31**] to [**Hospital1 112**] for further care.
TB meds switched at beginning of [**Month (only) 956**] - no response to holding rifampin.
Past Medical History: -Pulm TB (pan sensitive) with liver/spleen granulomas s/p R sided vats, r supraclavic LN, liver bx + -h/o +PPD w/o tx -AFB on BAL [**2147-1-2**] -tx continious since 2/1 per prior dc summ -1)Diabetes mellitus - diet controlled 2)OSA - on BiPAP 12/8 3)Cataract in the left eye 4)CVA/TIA (positive MRI) - right frontal with L arm/hand hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA  in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA 5)Asthma 6)Hypercholesterolemia 7)Seizure- uncertain diagnosis - L arm involuntary movements [**2144**] 8)Recent colonoscopy in [**2144**] with single sessile 4-5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance, s/p removal.
Attention can be focused on this lesion on subsequent imaging.
[**6-8**] CXR - Tracheostomy tube tip is 2 cm from the carina.
Right PICC line tip projects over the mid SVC.
The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and required levophed for blood pressure support that was slowly weaned off during her stay.
She was treated with cefepime and tobramycin per ID team.
#Pulmonary: Respiratory failure - Due to mechanical failure, tracheomalacia resulting in tracheostomy tube obstruction.
IP was consulted and revised her trach with placement of [**Last Name (un) **] device and excision of granulation tissue.
Also became significantly volume overloaded after fluid resuscitation due to hypotension and was diuresed successfully but continued to require mechanical ventilation due to occasional apnea and serially poor RSBIs.
Review of rehab records indicate she was requiring ventilatory support throughout.
Continued ventilatory support with AC or MMV as tolerated.
[**Month (only) 116**] attempt to wean with further treatment of VAP.
She was treated initially with vancomycin and imipenem.
Based on sputum culture data from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab she was changed from imipenem to cefepime and vancomycin was discontinued.
Repeat sputum cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] again grew pseudomonas that was now resistant to cefepime, therefore tobramycin was added.
Per the ID team, the patient should be treated for a 14 day course of cefepiem/tobramyin which will complete on [**2147-6-17**].
Daily tobramycin peaks and troughs should be measured and the dosing adjusted to prevent toxicity (the patient was therapeutic at discharge).
Disseminated TB - Pulmonary TB with liver/spleen granulomas s/p R VATs; diagnosed [**12-28**] and has been on a regimen of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrizinamide as she could not tolerate a 4-drug regimen.
Pseudomonas again cultured from sputum supporting new VAP.
Plan to complete 14 day course tobramycin and cefepime, ie through [**2147-6-17**].
However, tobramycin was stopped 2 days early for concern of worsening renal function.
Also on 9 month regimen of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrizinamide for disseminated TB.
Differential included infection (although being treated with pathogen-directed antibiotic), medications, transfusion reaction, MDS/AML, or central cause.
Heme-onc was consulted as patient has underlying MDS with borderline AML transformation, but they did not believe that her fevers were due to her underlying hematologic disorder.
She was started on standing dosed tylenol and LFTs should be followed every week.
Renal: Acute prerenal failure which resovled rapidly with intravenous fluids.
Renal function should be followed daily while continue treatment with tobramycin for VAP.
Heme-Onc: -Pancytopenia - h/o MDS with bone marrow Bx revealing borderline transformation to AML.
# GI: patient continue on tube feeds and tolerated them well, however with free water bolus patient had vomiting with this.
HIT+ - During prior admission.
No heparin products were given.
DM2: Continued on glargine 15 units QHS and ISS.
#FEN: Tube feeds.
#PPX: Lansoprazole, venodynes, no heparin given HIT+ #ACCESS: PICC was removed prior to discharge #Code: FULL confirmed with HCP #Dispo: [**Hospital1 **] acute rehab #Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (Son,HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102690**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102691**]  Medications on Admission: ethambutol 800mg po qd ([**2147-2-21**] x 1yr) inh 300mg po qd  ([**2147-2-19**]) pyrazinamide 1250 mg qd ([**5-23**] recorded start) pyridoxine 50 mg po qd imipenem 500 IV q 8h vanc 1 g iv q 8h flagyl 500mg po q8h -mucomyst inh q 4-6 hrs -albuterol/atrovent inh -asa 81 -darbo 100 mg sc q 12h -gabapentin liq 100 tid -glargine 15sc q 12H + HISS -metop 12.5 po bid -oxycodone prn -asa 81 -sertraline 100 qd -simvastatin 40 qd -artificial tears  Discharge Medications: 1.

Pseudomonas pneumonia, ventilator associated 4. respiratory failure, ventilator-dependent 5. tracheal obstruction with granulation tissue, debrided 6. focal tracheobronchomalacia   Discharge Condition: Fair   Discharge Instructions: Your tracheostomy was revised to improve your breathing and you were treated for ventilator associated pneumonia.
Your creatinine increased slightly which we presume is secondary to one of the antibiotics you were receiving.
Your sodium was also rising, and we increased the amount of free water boluses through your feeding tube.
