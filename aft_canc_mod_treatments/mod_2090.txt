Marked coronary calcifications  Brief Hospital Course: 73 y.o male with Burkitt's lymphoma presents with new seizures after recent intrathecal [**Hospital 3454**] transferred to OMED/BMT B service to initiation of CODOX chemotherapy [**9-7**].
Plan: ## Neuro: Patient's seizure was likely secondary to intrathecal chemo causing irritation of epileptogenic foci from a prior R MCA stroke, arachnoiditis from chemo, infection or stroke.
MRA did show moderately significant carotid stenosis bilaterally that will require resumption of Plavix once patient completes chemotherapy.
Patient was started on ceftriazone, vancomycin and acyclovir for possible infectious meningitis.
For possible arachnoiditis secondary to intrathecal ara-C, patient was continued on dexamthasone and then gradually tapered.
Finally, patient was loaded with dilantin and switched over to keppra at the time of discharge.
## Lymphoma: Last chemo [**2134-9-3**] with intrathecal ARA-C and prior to this hyper-CVAD on [**2134-8-27**].
Patient had a porta-cath placed for chemotherapy [**2134-9-8**] am.
Patient was discharged on Cipro for coverage for e.coli vs klebsiella.
Since he was febrile and neutropenic on admission, the patient was treated for IV bactrim for a 14 day course which he completed a day after discharge.
## Cardiovascular: Patient went into Afib with RVR after receiving chemo on last admission and was converted to sinus on amiodarone and metoprolol.
Pt was continued on these medications until [**8-29**] when he was admitted for bradycardia.
Lopressor held at that time and pt did well on amiodarone alone.
Amiodarone was scaled down to QD dosing from [**Hospital1 **] dosing in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Patient has an extensive cardiac history including CABG in the 80's and more recent stent placement for unstable angina.
Pt was on plavix prior to chemo which was discontinued due to low platelets.
Aspirin was resumed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] however subsequently discontinued for portacath placement and in anticipation of low platelets secondary to chemotherapy.
Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and took PO lasix as needed for pedal edema.
## Parkinsons: Patient was continued on Carbidopa-Levadopa and Entacapone per outpatient regimen.
Pt usually on new Strateva which is non-formulary so usually placed back on this regimen as an inpatient.
## BPH:   A foley was placed during the chemotherapy course since patient was having some difficulty using urinal and voiding secondary to post-ictal left hand weakness.
