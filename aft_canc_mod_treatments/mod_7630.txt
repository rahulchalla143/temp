IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 93676**]          [**2129-2-24**].
Brief Hospital Course: 56 y/o woman with CLL s/p 4 cycles of [**Hospital1 **] treatment on Neupogen s/p febrile neutropenia and septic shock requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course described below per day:  In the ED T 102.9, P170, BP 113/65, 100% on RA.
She received 8L NS, cefepime 2gm, vancomycin 1gm, caspo 70, platelets 2u, and decadron 10mg.
She also received zosyn x 1 and gentamicin x 1.
The primary team thought they saw parasites on a peripheral smear and ID was consulted.
Was weaned off pressors on [**2-25**] with MAP > 65.
also had episodes of hematochezia and dropped to 24.3 on [**2-26**], GI consulted and concluded that bleeding is likely from polyp documented on previous colonoscopy, deferred colonoscopy to outpatient setting unless bleeding increases.
Had received 2 units PRBC's and 1 unit of platelets during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] ====================== [**2129-2-25**] -Initially was on three pressors but weaned off over the course of the day with preservation of MAP's >65 -Blood cultures with GNR's, caspofungin discontinued (OK w/ hematology and oncology) -Echo showed new LV dysfunction with LVEF 20% per echo (new since [**2129-2-11**]) -Had hematochezia and AM Hct 24 and Plt 9.
Ordered for one unit of blood and one unit platelets.
________________________________ [**2129-2-26**] -remains off pressors with stable BP -had multiple episodes bloody diarrhea (marroon, liquidy but not quantified) during the day.
per BMT, consider Plt goal >30, Hct goal >25 -Changed PPI to IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] -Stool culture and C diff sent- considering Shigella or other entero-invasive bacteria causing both bloody diarrhea and bacteremia.
Pt getting a lot of blood products and abx during the day although having diarrhea.
Premedicating before products with tylenol and benadryl so may be missing a fever today with these meds.
[**2129-2-27**] -GI: bleeding is likely from polyp documented on previous colonoscopy.
-Heme onc: Continue GCSF, give IVIG for sepsis in setting of CLL and hypogammaglobulinemia, aggressive platelet goals given hematochezia w/ plts>50K -Transfused 1 bag platelets -ID: stool studies for salmonella, shigella, e.coli 0157, yersinia; abdominal CT to r/o abscess in setting of GNR sepsis (we didn't order this because of the patient's questionable renal fxn in setting of decreased urine output and b/c our suspicion was low); hold gent until level comes back.
continued to be on neupogen as per heme/onc recommendations in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Also started on prednisone.
was also continued on prednisone and triamcinolone cream for her skin GVHD which was not an issue during her stay in the hospital.
Also continued on Acyclovir during her stay.
Was switched to ceftriaxone 2g IV Q24H as klebsiella was pan sensitive and as instructed by ID.
Has not been started on any afterload reduction presumably due to hypotension and sepsis.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider starting afterload reduction and possible diuresis once patient is hemodynamically stable, and outpatient echo.
