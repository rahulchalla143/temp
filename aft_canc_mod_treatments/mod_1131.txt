He carries a presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease since [**2166-6-8**] when he presented to [**Hospital 25143**] Hospital in New [**Location (un) **] with small bowel obstruction, and abdominal CT demonstrated "...ileocecal valve appears abnormal.
On [**2166-7-10**], he was started on prednisone 60mg, and was subsequently tapered to 40mg daily prior to admission.
At that time he complained of fatigue and dyspnoea and continued to have abdominal distention.
Otherwise, ileocecal valve, cecal butt, appendiceal orifice are normal ... same is true of ascending,hepatic flexure, transverse, splenic flexure, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.
Retroflex in rectum shows normal dentate line.
Father was a heavy smoker and died of oesophageal cancer.
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS:  Extensive involvement by MALIGNANT B-CELL NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA, high-grade, see note.
INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS nuc ish(MYCx2)(5'MYC [**9-10**]'MYCx1)[93/100] FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
A MYC rearrangement is found in more than 90% of Burkitt lymphomas, but can also be found occasionally in other histologies of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman who presented being treated at OSH with steroids for several weeks for diagnosis of Crohn's disease.
He had a paracentesis done on [**2166-7-29**] to remove fluid to help with respiratory distress from restriction in the setting of abdominal distention.
He was treated with high dose steroids.
The morning following the paracentesis ([**2166-7-30**]) the patient deveolped worsening abdominal distention and pain and respiratory distress.
Surgical evaluation was requested and patient was moved to the MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 25144**] ICU) for further care where he was intubated and broad spectrum antibiotics were given given concern for evolving sepsis.
CT scan showed peritoneal carcinomatosis and bowel dilitation but no evidence of free air.
Surgical consultation concluded that no surgical intervention was indicated.
The patient had central venous catheter, femoral dialysis catheter and arterial catheter placed to allow administration of chemotherapy and management of hypotension and worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia expected to worsen with tumor lysis.
Chemotherapy was initiated and broad spectrum antibiotics were continued.
The patient was placed on Cyclophosphamide to treat the lymphoma.
The patient developed worsening sepsis requiring pressor support and aggressive IVF resuscitation.
Cultures eventually did return with Clostridium perferingens.
He subsequently required 4 pressors to support his BP.
The patient was unable to maintain his cardiac output and he was give nitrogen mustard and a second dose of cyclophosphamide emergently in hopes of reducing his tumor burden.
The patient was given large amounts of bicarb to attempt to counteract his acidemia in addition to the CVVH.
The patient subsequently passed away despite aggressive intervention with his family and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the bedside on [**2166-7-31**].
