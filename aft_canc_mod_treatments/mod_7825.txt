Liver disease was well controlled until after her colectomy in [**2129**], when her bilirubin began to rise.
In the last two months, she has become more symptomatic with jaundice and volume overload.
She was admitted directly from liver clinic for hypotension to the 70s and need for expedited transplant work up.
Vanc/ceftriaxone was started for coverage of SBP and PNA given recent respiratory symptoms.
She was also given albumin for SBP treatment.
While on the floor, maroon stool was noted in her colostomy bag and hematocrit was found to be 17.9, therefore transfusion was started and she was transferred to the ICU for urgent EGD.
Past Medical History: -UC s/p total colectomy in [**2129**] -PSC diagnosed in [**2111**] -cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2129**] (c/b jaundice and ascites) -CML on gleevac (since [**2127**]) -foot fracture s/p surgery -deaf in R   Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 91442**] is independent with her ADLs.

Sequela of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, para-esophageal and left upper quadrant varices, recanalisation of the para-umbilical vein, and trace of perihepatic ascites.
Teeth Panorex [**2132-10-22**]:  Lower right 2nd molar s/p root canal with continued surrounding radiolucency.
EGD/Ileostomy in the ICU were remarkable for absence of varices and a non-bleeding ulcer at the GE junction with old blood in the stomach.
She was started on a PPI and octreotide for GE junction ulcer and peristomal varices.
Peristomal bleeding was stopped by transplant surgery with Surgicel.
She was also discharged on a PPI for ulcer prophylaxis.
Leukocytosis was initially concerning for SBP given ascitic fluid, however she was unable to undergo paracentesis under IR due to scant amount of fluid present.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and albumin for presumed SBP.
On day 2 of hospitalization, blood cultures grew strep viridans so ceftriaxone was continued.
She was discharged on ciprofloxacin daily prophylaxis for SBP.
Hypotension improved following a total of 6 units PRBCs and stabilization of bleed.
Patient admitted for expedited transplant workup which included MRCP, PFTs, ECHO, CXR, screening mammogram, pap smear, right heart catheterization, and Panorex (given history of strep viridans).
The patient also underwent all routine pre-transplant laboratory testing.
Hematology was consulted for recommendations on management of CML in a transplant patient.
They continued the patient on gleevac, and commented that CML with gleevac use should have no effect on peri-transplant management or post-transplant prognosis.
The patient will follow up with her transplant hepatologist as an outpatient.
She will need a bone mineral density test as an outpatient.
Creatinine did not improve at discharge.
Etiology of non-gap acidosis unclear, as patient was without diarrhea, evidence of fistula or medication which could be contributing.
Acidosis improved during the admission with IV fluids.
Hyponatremia likely hypovolemic, as it normalized with fluid resuscitation.
# Ulcerative colitis s/p total colectomy with end ileostomy: Chronic.
Routine ostomy care was maintained throughout admission.
Patient stable on Gleevac which was continued in house at the recommendation of the hematology service.
During admission, gleevac was decreased to 200 mg daily, as the patient became increasingly pancytopenic (WBC count nadir 1.4, baseline 3.0).
As part of the patient's pretransplant workup, the hematology/oncology team noted that CML with gleevac use should have no effect on peri-transplant management or post-transplant prognosis.

For your anemia, you were transferred to the ICU, where you underwent upper endoscopy and ileoscopy.
The bleeding was stopped by our surgical colleagues with surgicel and you were transfused 6 units of packed red blood cells.
You were treated with a medication called octreotide to decrease the pressure in your varices.
You were treated with antibiotics for presumed "spontaneous bacterial peritonitis", or infection of ascites.
You underwent blood cultures that were positive for a bacterium - streptococcus viridans.
Upon discharge, you will start ciprofloxacin 250 mg daily to prevent against future episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
They feel that your CML and use of gleevac will not be affected by a liver transplant in the future.
On discharge, you should decrease your gleevac dose to 200 mg daily.
While in the hospital, you underwent a near-complete pretransplant workup.
Medications changed this admission: DECREASE gleevac to 200 mg daily START ciprofloxacin 250 mg daily for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis START protonix 40 mg daily for GI bleeding prophylaxis APPLY silver nitrate around ostomy as needed for bleed HOLD potassium until you have undergone follow up lab testing with your PCP  Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (LF) 91443**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] Specialty: FAMILY MEDICINE Location: PRIMARY CARE OF [**Location (un) **] Address: [**Street Address(2) 91444**], UNIT#A1 [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 91445**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91446**] **We are working on a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 1 week.
