Numerous lytic bony lesions, similar in appearance to cervical spine pathology seen on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] C-spine of [**2194-2-15**], and likely represent extension of the same underlying disease process.
Destructive paraspinal mass in the mid thoracic spine, more fully evaluated by previous cross-sectional imaging studies  C-spine x-ray [**3-1**]:  In comparison with study of [**2-20**], there is little change in the corpectomy and posterior fusion spanning C2 through C7.
Please refer to these for further details.
Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
No aberrations were detected with the:  1) LSI IGH/CCND1XT Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe for IGH at 14q32 and CCND1XT at 11q13 in 100/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
Up to 5% of cells in normal samples can show apparent 13q deletion using this probe set; 3) LSI IGH/FGFR3 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe for IGH at 14q32 and FGFR3 at 4p16 in 100/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal FISH finding can result from the absence of a deletion or rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
On arrival, he underwent emergency operation, C3 corpectomy with post fusion of C2-7.
After the surgery, Anesthesia recommended that he remain intubated until POD#2 since he was a difficult intubation and was prone for several hours.
On [**2-20**] he developed "gurgling" with respirations and Tachypnea to the 30s with mild desaturation to 80 on RA which improved to 97 on 2L NC.
The patient also had a fever to 101 and was started on empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia in addition to heparin GGT for PE.
On [**2-21**] he was also started on Decadron 10mg q8 for airway swelling which was increased to q6 for swelling/multiple myeloma per Oncology recommendations.
He received a total of 4 days of steroids at this dose (later changed to 40 daily instead of 10q6).
On [**2-22**] he was heard to be grunting and required increasing support from the ventilator.
He has not requested any pain medicine for it.
The pt was supposed to complete a 7 day course of vanc/zosyn for pneumonia, but he continued to spike fevers so the antibiotics were not stopped.
While waiting for the UCx, the pt's zosyn was d/c'ed on [**2194-3-6**], and ciprofloxacin was started.
The UCX grew yeast on [**2194-3-6**] and fluconazole was started.
His eosinophil count was elevated so ID recommended a course of Ivermectin which he completed for possible Strongyloides infection.
His dentition was noted to be poor and an oral facial surgery consult was obtained for a complete dental extraction.
The pt was started on radiation therapy and velcade for multiple myeloma treatment.
He underwent a bone marrow bx before the start of treatment.
He tolerated therapy well without significant pain or nausea noted.
Oral surgery examined the pt and did not feel this was related to his prior dental extraction.
#Transitional- 1. follow up appointments with hematology oncology, ortho-spine, radiation oncology and neuro-oncology were made post discharge.
He also has a follow up appointment with a dental clinic to be fitted for dentures  Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: 1. enoxaparin 120 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).
