Brief Hospital Course: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p [**Month (only) **] with sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation, admitted with septic shock; source unclear, but differential diagnostic considerations included pneumonia, infectious diarrhea, or less likely cholangitis.
With his compromised respiratory status, intubation was discussed with the family, but since he had an underlying malignancy of the biliary tree and numerous co-morbid conditions, his family decided that it was in his best interest to to avoid intubation.
He was therefore treated with antibiotics, supportive care for septic shock including volume resuscitation directed by CVP monitoring, vasopressors, and euglycemic control.
Cortisol levels responded appropriately to ACTH stimulation and so steroids were not used.
Thoracentesis was considered for large pleural effusions, but given his family's stated goals of care, invasive procedures were declined, especially with the increased risk of hemothorax as he was anticoagulated with coumadin on admission.
After 72 hours of ICU-level management of septic shock, hemodynamics stabilized but oxygenation did not improve, and his mental status declined.
His daughters decided to withdraw supportive measures that were likely only prolonging his life without meaningful benefit, given that he was unlikely to recover to his pre-hospital functional status and also had a likely malignant lesion of the biliary tract.
Narcotics and benzodiazepines were used to control pain and agitation.
On hospital day 5, the patient expired with his daughters at his bedside.
