Pulmonary- His chest tubes were removed on POD#3 with no demonstration of air leak and outputs less than 150cc q24hr interval.
Cardiovascular- he developed Afib w/ a RVR ~ 36hrs post-operatively necessitating ICU transfer and neosynephrine/amiodarone supplementation.
Ultimately, he was transitioned to an oral regimen of amiodarone and beta blockade and converted to sinus rhythm.
FEN/GI- he was maintained on protonix for stress-ulcer prophylaxis (he takes it chronically) and was able to tolerate a regular, heart-healthy diet by POD#1.
GU/Renal- His BUN/Cr remained normal during his peri-operative course and his foley was rmeoved on POD#4 after the thoracic epidural was taken out.
Endocrine- he was transiently given SSIR for peri-operative glycemic control/prophylaxis HEME/ID- he remained afebril with no outstanding infectious disease issues during his post-operative convalescence.
He received 2 additional doses of kefzol immediately post-operatively and his surgical site incisions appeared C/D/I.
