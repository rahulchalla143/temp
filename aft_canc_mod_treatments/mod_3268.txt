He has a h/o thoracic spine compression fractures, and during this hospitalization received a T3-T7 laminectomy/spinal fusion in [**2-26**] for acute cord compression in the setting of a code blue and one chest compression.
He had a [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission for respiratory depression thought [**1-18**] medication sedation effect, and was called out to BMT on [**3-21**] after his pain Rx were adjusted and his sedation had improved.
He was continued on azithromycin for infection prophylaxis, and plan was made to continue this at the discretion of the outpatient physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] can decided when or whether or not to stop.
It was recommended to start Advair and Albuterol-Ipratropium as well as pulse dose steroids.
He had documented PE's in the past and was continued on anticoagulation.
While he was on stress doses of hydrocortisone during his ICU stays, these were changed back to his prednisone 10mg in AM and 5mg in PM without incident.
As such, the patient was restarted on IV vanco & meropenem for planned 8 day course, but on [**3-27**] pt was found increasingly somnolent with PCO2>100.
PT was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], was put temporarily on positive airway pressure with improvement in mental status.
These were progressively d/c'd, and the pt was weaned down to 0.5L NC and continued on azithromycin for infection prophylaxis and discharged to rehab.
#Osteopenia, s/p laminectomy - Pt has had multiple fractures in the past due to chronic steroid use.
Ortho was consulted and for each fracture determined that no surgical intervention was warranted.
Ortho was again consulted and cleared him for ambulation they recommended cervicothoracic brace for comfort.
He was taken urgently to the OR for urgent T3-T7 laminectomy and fusion by ortho spine.
Endocrine was consulted for assistance with management of severe osteopenia and recommended that we continue to give high dose vitamin D and calcium supplementation daily.
# Retroperitoneal Bleed - In preparation for vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty, the pt's warfarin was discontinued and he was started on a Heparin gtt.
The morning after initiation of the drip the pt was noted to be tachycardic on vitals and pale in appearance.
The heparin gtt was turned off and a stat CBC showed a 7 point Hct drop.
He was bolused 2L NS and given a total of 5 units of blood.
He was transfered to the ICU for further management and hemodynamic stablization.
A code blue was called and abruptly cancelled after patient awoke following one chest compression.
Given that he was no longer a candidate for anticoagulation, in conjunction with a h/o multiple pulmonary embolisms, he was taken to IR for placement of an IVC filter which was placed on [**3-8**].
We initially continued his home doses of PO Dilaudid, Oxycotin and Gabapentin, but due to oversedation and respiratory compromise, his Rx were adjusted.
Ultimately, the Pain service was consulted and recommended celebrex, ritalin [**Hospital1 **] for synergy, APAP, cymbalta, oxycontin, and small PO doses of dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
The pt had anisocoria observed in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in setting of nebulizers, and had head CT which was negative.
Pt had had cataract surgery in 04 and [**4-26**].
ID was consulted and he was placed on Vancomycin and meropenem for his cellulitis.
He completed a two week course of IV antibiotics with significant improvement in erythema and swelling.
His wounds were dressed daily per wound care recommendations.
#DM II- We continued twice per day dosing of NPH which required frequent titration while on pulse dose steroid.
He was also placed on humalog sliding scale for prandial coverage.
#[**Name (NI) 10952**] Pt was on chronic warfarin for mult PE in past.
# GVHD [**Name (NI) 2701**] Pt has been suffering from severe GVHD since his allo transplant in [**2142**].
He is on chronic prednisone at home.
He was then placed on pulse dose steroids and given IVIG which resulted in improvement in his respiratory symptoms.
We continued Acyclovir, Bactrim and Voriconazole for immunosuppression prophylaxis.
