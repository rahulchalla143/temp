Additional hx from the patient noted that the patient has had a colonoscopy in [**2163**] with non-malignant polyps and her last mammogram was at an outside institution, reportedly normal one year ago.

The gallbladder wall thickening and edema could be related to inflammatory processes within the right upper quadrant, including hepatitis, duodenitis or pancreatitis.
Malpositioned endotracheal tube terminating within the cervical esophagus.
2) The patient's NG tube is positioned with its distal tip within the second portion of the duodenum causing significant mass effect upon the posterolateral wall of the duodenum.
This tube should be withdrawn approximately 5 cm to avoid iatrogenic lesion of the duodenal mucosa.
Low attenuation lesions within the liver as well as retroperitoneal and periportal lymph node enlargement are also better assessed on this prior study.
At this point, she was transferred from the BMT unit to the ICU for closer monitoring and for initiation of chemotherapy.
Allopurinol was also started and continued throughout.
Her urine was also alkalizinized initially due to high levels of uric acid.
She was placed on steroids during her chemo regimen as well.
Her counts recovered and her filgastrim was discontinued.
She was intubated for several days, but required minimal ventilatory support.
She was grossly 19 liters positive and was aggressively diuresed with lasix and metalazone.
She remained intubated with failure to wean for 2 weeks despite diuresis and treatment of a LLL consolidation on CXR and confirmed by CT.
Thus, the patient was bronched on [**4-18**] which showed evidence of tracheo-bronchitis, so voriconazole was added to her course in addition to IV acyclovir with oral HSV lesions.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had a repeat bronch on [**4-22**] which showed significant bronchitis only mildly improved since Friday and the patient was kept on caspofungin with fungal cultures negative as her airways resembled "rotting ground beef" and appeared fungal in nature.
After much diuresis and continued antimicrobial treatment, the patient had a RSBI of 27 on [**4-24**] and was successfully extubated.
# ID:Pt was started on levo/flagyl on admission for concern of possible cholecystitis.
She was continued on cefepime/caspofungin x [**6-14**] d from last bronch(flagyl d/c'd on [**4-16**], voriconazole and acyclovir also d/c'd, vanco d/'c 5.22).
Her antibiotic coverage was empiric in the setting of febrile neutropenia and LLL consolidation which resolved on CXR.
# Abdominal Wound:She had  a vac dressing in place which was followed and changed as needed by surgical service.
They did not believe that this wound was currently infected, but it was watched closely and ppx vancomycin was administered and continued as empiric coverage with no positive blood cultures in the setting of her febrile neutropenia.
The vac dressing was removed by surgery and dressings were wet to dry [**Hospital1 **].
Her renal function did improve, and her fluids were decreased as tolerated.
#hypertension - on IV lopressor and hydralazine titrate to BP <160 #fluid status/diastolic heart failure:clinically euvolemic - will aim for goal even for now since she had metabolic alkalosis from contraction after she was diuresed 19 liters over 3 weeks.
# Family meeting on [**4-17**] with daughter [**Name (NI) 13762**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] that decided to continue with plans for further chemo and plan to extubate as tolerated.
Daughter met with team on [**4-23**] and asked for extubation on [**4-24**].
Family opted for comfort measures only.
