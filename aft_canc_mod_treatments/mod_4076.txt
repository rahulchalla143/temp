Postop course complicated by actinic esophagitis (s/p PEG tube placemnt and tracheostomy).
Pt was started on ceftriaxone + Levofloxacin.
He was intubated and started on hemodialysis.
ATB treatment was switched to Vancomycin, Meropenem, Fluconazole.
Also started on PO Vanc for questionable C diff.
Stage 3 lung cancer as well as a separate Stage 1 lesion, status post incomplete round of [**Doctor Last Name **]-Taxol and is currently undergoing radiation therapy.
He has been on a variety of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing agents in the past and has had at least two sessions of electroconvulsive therapy.
He did extremely well on Clozaril between [**2099**] and [**2102-5-7**] until it had to be stopped because of seizures.
Substance Abuse history: Records indicate that pt has a history of drug abuse including heroin but pt has refused to talk about it further.
Physical Exam: T max 100.4 T c 99.8 HR 117 BP 105/58 RR 20 SpO2 100 % ABG 7.36/34/152/20 MV AC TV 450 RR 12 PEEP 5 Fi02 30 % I/O 5241/1605 Net 4 d -233 Gen : intubated , sedated HEENT: ET tube in place, NG tube Chest: R subclaviban, R chest c chest tube in place decreased BS on the R CV: RRR no m/g/r Abdomennt, nd Ext: edematous, R femoral line .
Tip of a dual channel right subclavian line projects over the SVC.
ET tube is in standard placement and nasogastric tube is coiled in the upper stomach.
A dialysis catheter recently placed in an outside hospital is responsibe for the small right pneumothorax which persists despite a right pleural tube.
A new, partially enhancing, 7 x 4 cm left paratracheal mediastinal mass with central hypodensity is likely necrotic tumor (unless the patient has had recent mediastinoscopy or transbronchial procedure, in which case some components could be hemorrhage; it has too much internal tissue structure for an abscess).
Right pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
[**2105-2-13**] CXR: Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular heads, changed in position when compared to [**2105-2-12**].
Right-sided chest tube is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Interval advance of endotracheal tube with its tip now at the clavicular heads.
Status post left upper lobe resection with residual left-sided hydropneumothorax, unchanged.
Right-sided chest tube and tiny right apical pneumothorax, unchanged.
[**2105-2-14**] CXR: HISTORY: Stent repositioning.
Endotracheal tube is noted with its tip at the clavicular heads.
Nasogastric tube is present with its tip in the stomach.
Right-sided chest tube is unchanged.
Right subclavian central venous catheter is again seen with its tip in the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was intially admitted to Thoracic Surgery for surgical resection of recurrent cancer obstructing the left main stem bronchus.
However, given his poor prognosis, a palliative stent was placed by Interventional Pulmonary.
The patient was continued on vancomycin (until [**2-15**] to finish 14 days course) and zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia that was started at outside hospital.
Per Infectious Disease recommendations, Bactrim was also started for stenotrophomonas grown from sputum culture, and Zosyn was disconinued on [**2-12**].
The pneumothorax which developed at the OSH [**1-8**] central venous access attempt was managed with a chest tube and avoidance of PEEP on the ventilator.
After the palliative stent placement, the patient was weaned off ventilator and extubated on [**2-13**], however, on the following night, the patient developed respiratory distress, was tachypneic at 40-50s, and was reintubated.
CXR at that time showed worsened collapse of the left lower lobe from the obstruction, and the patient was empirically restarted on Zosyn to for post-obstructive pneumonia and the stent was repositioned on [**2-14**].
Subsequently after this decision, all aggressive measures were discontinued and the patient was placed on morphine for comfort.
