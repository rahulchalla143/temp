Recommend correlation with prior exams when available, and MRI for assessment of full disease extent.
EEG ([**2118-11-29**])- This EEG gives evidence for a focal slow wave abnormality over the left frontal polar region suggestive of a subcortical/cortical junctional structural abnormality.

He was extubated successfully on HD1 and was weaned off of nasal cannula by HD2.
Patient has known RUL mass, so concern that brain mass was metastatic lesion, however, as lesion crossed midline and invaded through bone, it did not follow pattern of typical hematogenously spread met.
Patient was loaded with dilantin in the ED, and kept on EEG in the ICU.
Dilantin was titrated up for goal trough >15.
ENT was consulted and did not feel that it was safe to biopsy this lesion, given invasion through bone and risk for post-procedure CSF leak.
Patient was started on dexamethasone to decrease vasogenic edema.
Patient was treated with antibiotics, and underwent bronchoscopy with biopsies of mass.
Block was sent for k-ras, alk, and EGFR mutations.
Patient was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl sent home with augmentin to finish a 7 day course.
