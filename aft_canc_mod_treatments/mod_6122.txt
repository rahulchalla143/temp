Patient's Y-stent was placed [**2163-1-26**] and complicated by cough, copious secretions requiring multiple therapeutic aspirations.
Patient states he is compliant with Mucomyst nebs and Mucinex, and he uses oxygen "almost constantly," always at night.
Bronchoscopy showed no complete opacification, right sided secretions and granulations (non-obstructing).
The patient was difficult to arouse after the procedure, with episodic respiratory depression (O2 sat 70%) and required high flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask.
Patient was admitted to the MICU for bipap (which he did not tolerate) prior to stent replacement and lung debridement in the OR on [**9-14**].
Interventional pulmonary was found copious purulent secretions around the previous stent which was removed but a new stent could not be placed.
Plan is for re-placement of the stent in ~ 4 weeks.
On call-out from the MICU, plan was to observe patient's respiratory status, especially with ambulation, taper his steroids over 3-4 weeks and discharge home.

Brief Hospital Course: 67yo male with end stage COPD, tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent, squamous cell carcinoma s/p RUL resection with Cyberknife treatment, s/p flex bronchoscopy admitted for COPD exacerbation.
He was titrated down to his home 3 liters of oxygen with goal sats 88-93%.
He was also treated for COPD exacerbation with solumedrol --> prednisone and azithromycin.
He went for a exchange of his Y-stent on [**9-14**], however, while the old stent was removed, a new stent was not placed due to purulent secretions.
He will need to have a new silicone stent placed, which is planned for [**10-12**].
Pt remained afebrile but with an elevated white count so he was started on Zosyn/Cipro ([**2163-9-15**]) for pseudomonas infection.
Patient was given albuterol/ipratropium and advised to resume CPAP at home, avoid smoking while using supplemental oxygen.
# Tracheobronchomalacia: Patient was followed by Interventional Pulmonary.
He was restarted on Mucomyst and Mucinex per their recommendations.
Patient is scheduled for replacement of Y-stent in 4 weeks as out patient, after resolution of current infection.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to intravenous steroids and ongoing pseudomonas bronchitis.
# Chronic respiratory acidosis: Likely chronic, progressive hypercarbia/obstructive sleep apnea in setting of non-compliance with CPAP.
On day of discharge, discussed with patient the utility of CPAP and its role in preventing a similar episode of slow recovery from respiratory depressing medications (bronchoscopy on [**9-12**]).

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on Simvastatin .
