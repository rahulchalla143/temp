7) When available, multiplanar and 3D images will be reviewed, and an addendum will be issued to the report.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is  not present.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2168-1-5**] and bronchial washings/brushings came back suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
Sputum was sent for culture, AFB,  nocardia and fungal culture and subsequently grew Pseudomonas.
The patient initially improved on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Was thought to be intravascularly "dry" with FE NA of <0.2%, not responding to Lasix trials.
The patient required pressor support following catheterization and was transferred to MICU service after intubation.
New cardiomyopathy was diagnosed as [**Last Name (un) **]-tsubo apical ballooning syndrome based on ventriculography images.
This was managed with diuresis with Natrecor and Lasix as needed and she was continued on digoxin for inotropy.
The patient subsequently completed 10 days of Vancomycin and 14 days of Zosyn for Pseudomonas pneumonia.
She was also treated for COPD with high dose IV steroid taper and standing alb/Atrovent MDIs and fluticasone.
Her respiratory status improved and she tolerated the spontaneous breathing trial and was extubated on [**2167-1-20**].
She was restarted on high dose steroids due to marked wheezing on lung exam.
ID service recommended Imipenem and Cefepime for double coverage although the organism was only intermediately sensitive to Cefepime.
Extensive discussions were held with the patient (when sedation was decreased) and the family regarding prognosis and further treatment options including need for tracheostomy.
The patient and family did not want tracheostomy and the decision was made to change the code status to comfort measures only.
She was on heparin drip but developed significant hematuria requiring transfusion.
Heparin drip had to be discontinued and hematuria started to clear.
Glycemic control was maintained with insulin drip with frequent finger stick checks.
FEN: tube feeds.
Disposition: Following extensive discussions with family members and health care proxy, based on the poor overall prognosis and lack of clinical improvement despite maximum medical management and support, the decision was made to change direction of care to focus solely on comfort.
