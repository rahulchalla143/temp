[**2191-11-25**] chromosome analysis positive for t(9,22), BCR-ABL  [**2191-11-25**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
[**2191-11-28**] liver biopsy Sections are of liver parenchyma with a patchy dense lymphoid infiltrate composed of medium-sized lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, round-to-irregular nuclei, pale chromatin and occasional small nucleoli.
The fragment has no connection with the subclavian line whose tip projects over the proximal parts of the right atrium.
Intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine alternating weekly.
Presented with 4-6 weeks fatigue and bruising and initial WBC 14 with 73% lymphoblasts and plt 6), s/p removal of IR apparatus from R atrium/ventricle [**11-28**] following transjugular liver bx and echo showed some clot after this.
Had emergent echo showing pericardial tamponade and went for drainage and to CCU post drainage of  400ml blood (Hct 25) .
RUE DVT found on doppler U/S [**12-30**] and anticoagulation with treatment dose LMWH started [**12-31**] post LP with a plan to hold LMWH if Plt <50.
Recurrent vasovagals and tachycardia and seen by neurology who suggested compression stockings / trial of midodrine.
Bactrim was also held on [**1-4**] b/c of LFTs and pt was placed on inhaled pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
# ALL: Pre B cell ALL Ph C +ve: C1 HyperCVAD started [**12-1**].
Imatinib was started for treatment of PHL+ leukemia, and cycle 1 of hyperCVAD was started on [**12-1**].
Cefepime, vanc and allopurinol stopped [**12-22**] when counts improved .
Added po fluconazole and trim/sulfa for prophylaxis [**12-19**].
Imatinib was stopped on [**1-4**] b/c of rising LFTs.
# Elevated LFTs: followed by hepatology during admission, on liver biopsy [**12-29**] was secondary to leukemic infiltration (see CCU course for liver bx complications).
Improved with treatment of leukemia.
Her liver biopsy was complicated as detailed below and required IR intervention and subsequent CCU admission.
On [**1-4**] imatinib and bactrim were also stopped as LFTs had remained elevated.
LFTs improved after these medications were stopped.
# Liver biopsy with complication requiring IR intervention: During her liver biopsy, IR dislodged a 7cm catheter in her right atrium and were unable to retrieve it.
Pain was controlled with morphine, ativan, lidocaine patch.
At this point her ECG showed even lower voltages (when compared with previous ECGs) and had a large heart on CXR.
On [**12-6**] the patient was found to have a pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology in setting of chest pain, SOB, decreased voltage on ECG, and a pulsus paradoxus of 15mmHg.
She was rushed urgently to cath lab for drainage which drained 300ml serosanguinous fluid.
Post procedure there was trivial residual effusion on removing drain.
Imatinib was initially held due to concerns for precipitating effusions and was only restarted after MTX (as Part B) was cleared and re-comenced [**12-31**].
Pt was encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and was given IV boluses of fluids.
This was felt to be a vasovagal episode perhaps exacerbated by dehydration - given IV fluids and decreased lorazepam to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
Triggered [**1-1**] for further syncope, likely vagal episode, BP 79 systolic.
Cortisol normal.
Pt received several boluses of IVF w/good response.
Pt was then placed on maintence fluids and encouraged to increase her PO intake with improvement.
Furosemide 20mg po [**12-24**] to diurese remaining pleural fluid prior to Methotrexate.Rpt CXR [**12-25**] to show resolution of effusions prior to starting Part B [**12-25**].
# Anxiety/depression:  Home medications were paroxetine 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] and 1 mg ativan [**Hospital1 **].
Paroxetine was tapered and discontinued for concern for effects on platelet function in an already thrombocytopenic patient.
# Low grade fever (max 100.3 - 100.1 on [**12-10**]) in context of neutropenia: IV cefepime and vanc started on [**12-6**].
She had no true fevers and counts improved by [**12-22**] at which point antibiotics were discontinued.
# RUE DVT: Unilateral swollen R arm with PICC - went on to U/S and showed clot extending from subclavian to brachial vein - for anticoagulation with enoxaparin post LP on [**12-31**] and to hold LMWH if Plt <50.

Secondary: Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade requiring drainage Hypotension Syncope Upper extremity DVT, non-occlusive, catheter-associated  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You also had a procedural complication requiring interventional radiology to remove a dislodged catheter.
This required emergent drainage to allow the heart to return to normal functioning.
You feeling of faintness resolved but you continued to have low blood pressures.
The catheter was removed and a repeat U/S on [**2192-1-12**] showed that the DVT is still there, but it is non-occlusive so anticoagulation was not started.
Given your improvement in blood counts and symptoms, it was felt that you could safely go home for several days after your intrathecal chemo today ([**1-13**]) to await the next round of treatment early next week.
- Please decrease your dose of paroxetine to 30mg daily (rather than twice daily) - Please use olanzapine 5 mg twice daily as needed for anxiety - Please START taking omeprazole 40mg daily.
- Please START using nystatin four times a day.
- Please continue to take all of your other home medications as prescribed.
You will be readmitted for your next cycle of chemotherapy on Wednesday, [**2192-1-18**].
