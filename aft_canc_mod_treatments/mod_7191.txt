Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old male with history of emphysema, SCC diagnosed in [**8-/2129**] s/p left upper lobectomy and s/p neoadjuvant chemoradiation, PE/DVT in [**11/2129**], pericardial effusion w/ tamponade requiring pericardial window in [**1-/2130**], s/p IVC filter placement who presented from clinic with SOB and CTA showing multiple PEs and multifocal right sided pneumonia.
Pt was initially admitted to OMED service and started on heparin drip for the PEs, and given ceftriaxone, vanco and levoflox for the pneumonia.
He then became hypoxic and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further monitoring.
He required intubation for worsening respiratory status, which was initially felt to be mostly related to pneumonia.
There was also a concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage so he underwent a bronchoscopy showing minimial bleeding.
Heparin drip was stopped as it was felt his bleeding risk was higher than PE risk given his filter.
His respiratory status and chest xray began to improve initially on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Her family was updated on the poor prognosis and the decision was made to withdraw treatment and make the patient CMO.
