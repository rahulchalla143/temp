Chemotherapy (etoposide and carboplatin) was initiated during this hospital course.
It was likely partly due to medications (narcotic pain medications among them) as well as a possible contribution of infection (pneumonia as described below).
Some of his pain medications were then discontinued, and narcotics were used with caution for his pain.
As he was also hypotensive at the time (see above) vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl were all started.
Vanco was then discontinued, and treatment with levo/flagyl was continued, with a planned course of 10 days.
He was given bowel regimen for constipation, treatment for hypercalcemia as below, and pain medications.
This improved somewhat with hydration and lasix, but remained above normal.
The patient received a dose of pamidronate on [**2103-2-9**], after which the calcium level remained normal.
