Studies:  Portable CXR [**2131-6-22**] FINDINGS: Patient's positioning compromises the quality of the film as well as comparison with prior radiographs.
An NG tube is identified.
A G-tube is seen within the stomach.
Left superior medial periorbital margin (E):  Negative for carcinoma.
Total maxillectomy, left (K-AK):  -Basal cell carcinoma, infiltrative type, present at inferior orbital rim margin (slides K, L, AH) see note.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 85 yo F h/o HTN, DM, dementia with psychosis, basal cell carcinoma admitted for surgical resection of basal cell carcinoma of the left face.
Surgical resection and Gtube placement was performed [**6-11**] with post-op course complicated by hypercapnia, aspiration PNA, tachycardia, hypernatremia, and ARF.
Operative and post op course Pt was admitted for surgical resection of large left facial tumor.
She underwent a resection of left facial tumor; partial orbitectomy; partial palatectomy soft tissue face and cheek; partial rhinectomy; local tissue rearrangment left eye.
She tolerated the procedure well, and was extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.
On face mask and 12L her sat was 96%.
Overnight in the ICU the pt remained npo with 100% saturdation on non-rebreather.
On POD#1, pt was weaned from supplemental oxygen to room air.
Pt was restarted on home medications, continued on Unasyn, and tube feeds were started.
On POD#2 pt was transferred to the medical service after which she underwent the following complications throughout her MICU and hospital stay: hypercapnia, aspiration PNA, GIB, tachycardia, hypernatremia, and ARF.
These problems were managed over the course of a prolonged hospitalization to the point she was relatively stable with the main underlying problems being poor airway control with high aspiration risk and PEG tube management.
That evening she also pulled her PEG tube out.
Goals of care were readdressed the following day with the health care proxy who decided patient should be made DNR/DNI and focus on comfort measures only and to avoid PEG tube replacement.
She is written for concentrated liquid medications and suppositories as routes of medication.
She is written for morphine to be used for respiratory distress.
