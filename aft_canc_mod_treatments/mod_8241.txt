Given IVF and pRBCs.
These were felt [**1-12**] chronic steroids and naprosyn use.
He was started on PPI and sucralfate and monitored in ICU for 1-2 days.
It could not be clipped but was injected with epinephrine which stopped the bleeding at least intraporcdurally.
Hematocrt found to be 17 so given more transfusions and went to the OR for an ex lap where they did a duodenectomy and oversewing over arterial bleed site in the ulcer.
He received a total of 18units pRBCs and 2units of FFP while at the other hospital.
He had a dilaudid pca but was not using it well (forgetting to hit the button) so was switched to fentanyl boluses (50-100mcg every couple of hours).
He had been being treated with levoquin but the Ecoli was resistent to this and since it was presumed bacteriuria this was stopped.

While in the ICU, he was transfused several units of PRBC and was on Pantoprazole gtt and NPO initially, then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] PPI and clears.
Started on TPN for nutrition.
After transfer to the floor, Hct was 24 but Hct continued to slowly trend down and he was noted to have liquid black stool, so he was made NPO once again and received several transfusions with 2 units per day for several days.
Patient received a total of 16 units PRBC while hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**].
He will also continue pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID after discharge.
Patient took only one dose of naproxen and denied other NSAID use prior to admission, so this is unlikely to be source of multiple ulcers.
Wound remained clean, dry and intact with staples and retention sutures in place.
Staples were removed prior to discharge, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (surgeon from [**Hospital **] Hospital who performed operation), however retention sutures are to remain in for one month after surgery and should be removed on [**2118-7-1**].
Pain control was attained with IV dilaudid PRN initially and was transitioned to PO dilaudid when able to take PO.
Also received tylenol three times a day.
# Hypertension: Initially home lisinopril was held given active GI bleed, but was restarted at low dose during admission.
He was restarted on lisinopril and is being uptitrated to his home dose of 60 mg daily, now at 20mg daily on discharge.
Further diuresis was initially held to ascertain hemodynamic stability in the MICU.
We continued to monitor his fluid status as well as his vitals which remained stable during the rest of this admission, however pt was given several doses of IV lasix on the floor for symptomatic relief given anasarca.
# Leukamoid reaction: Patient was on decadron but WBC count has trended upward to a peak of 32.
His foley catheter was discontinued and his WBC decreased throughout hospital course.
# Neck Abscess: treated at OSH, on admission was treated with wet-dry dressings  # Prostate CA complicated by bone mets: Held naproxen and steroids given acute GI bleed, although patient denied taking any NSAIDS except for one single dose of naproxen prior to admission.
Was due for chemotherapy on [**6-22**], however given patient was still hospitalized this was not done.
# DM blood glucose was well-controlled on ISS along with regular insulin in TPN  # HL: initally statin was held, restarted when able to take PO  # Depression: prozac was held initially while patient was NPO then restarted once diet was advanced.
