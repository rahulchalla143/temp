He was initially placed on nitro gtt for BP control.
His BP regimen was changed by increasing his metoprolol to 50 TID, adding back his home amlodipine 10mg and adding hydral.

This showed 2 WBC, insufficent for determination of clonality.
Beta-2 microglobulin was noted to be elevated in the CSF..  Intrathecal methotrexate was considered but neuro-oncology expressed concern that this would not adequately reach the subependymal region where the metastatses were seen.
He was ultimately transferred to the BMT service, where he was given a cycle of intravenous methotrexate.
He subsequently received leucovorin and hemodialysis to minimize methotrexate toxicity.
He was given leucovorin until the methotrexate levels in his blood were undectable.
