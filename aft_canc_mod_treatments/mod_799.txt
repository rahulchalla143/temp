This episode was mostly relieved with SL nitro x 4 tabs and morphine 1 mg IV x 2 doses.
After these medications, the pain was gone but patient reports feeling residual "neck pulsations."
He went for cardiac catheterization on [**6-11**]; balloon angioplasty was performed but no stents placed.
Once on the floor, patient had one "dark" bowel movement which was not saved for guaiac; subsequent bowel movements were normal-colored although soft consistency in setting of second colonoscopy prep.
PPI was switched to famotidine 20mg IV BID since pt was on Plavix.
BPs 90/40 at last clinic visit, this may be in part due to GIB as well as increase in ACEI and lasix recently.
Lasix and ACE inhibitor were held during admission to avoid hypotension.
ACE inhibitor and lasix were held and blood was transfused x 4 units; creatinine improved to 1.1 suggesting that medications/anemia/dehydration may have been contributing factors in this case.
His coumadin was held in setting of GI bleed.
Patient was instructed to hold coumadin until he could follow up with PCP and the medication could be safely restarted.

You were admitted to the ICU where you received 4 units of packed red blood cells by transfusion.
You were transferred to the cardiology service and you went for cardiac catheterization which showed an occlusion of one of your coronary arteries, and balloon angioplasty was used to expand the lumen of the blood vessel to improve blood flow.
You also went for an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy to try to identify the source of the bleeding that you experienced prior to your admission.
We made the following changes to your medication regimen: -DO NOT TAKE Coumadin (warfarin) until/unless instructed to do so by your cardiologist or primary care doctor.
-BEGIN TAKING Ranitidine 150 mg PO twice daily as a substitute medication for omeprazole -BEGIN TAKING Colace 100 mg PO daily as needed to keep stool soft (softer stool may help to prevent future episodes of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract).
Do not take this medication if you are already having soft stool or are having diarrhea.
-CHANGE Lisinopril to 5 mg PO daily (down from 10 mg) because your blood pressure has been well-controlled recently and the higher dose may cause it to go too low.
Hematology: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 11574**] office to inform him that you did not receive your usual dose of 60,000u of Procrit on Friday (our injections are only 20,000u).
Otherwise, see him on Friday for your next dose as you usually would.
