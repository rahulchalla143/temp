Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo and with gradient echo technique.
After administration of gadolinium intravenous contrast, sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was repeated.

TECHNIQUE: 64-MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained with IV contrast.
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Correlation with ultrasound could be performed.
There is pneumobilia and dilatation of the intra and extra hepatic ducts.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: There are postoperative changes status post hernia repair in the right anterior pelvis.
There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder.
BONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post median sternotomy.
The patient is also status post posterior fixation of the spine.
Ultrasound could be performed if indicated.

BONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post median sternotomy.
The patient is also status post posterior fixation of the spine.
Ultrasound could be performed if indicated.
Surgical evaluation for extent of disease and resectability.
The pancreatic duct dilation is slightly increased from the prior study with unchanged biliary duct dilation with stent in place.
RADIOLOGISTS: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**].
Under ultrasonographic guidance, the right brachial vein was entered using a micropuncture sheath.
Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018 guide wire was advanced into the SVC.
The PICC line was then trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance.
The tip of the line was placed in the superior SVC just above the right atrium.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 36 cm double lumen PICC line with the tip in the superior vena cava just above the right atrium.
THYROID ULTRASOUND: The right lobe measures 2.1 x 2.4 x 5.3 cm.
The left lobe measures 1.9 x 2.1 x 5.3 cm.
Rare atypical degenerated cell of uncertain significance.
Sensory responses of bilateral sural nerves were absent.
EMG of right tibialis anterior showed marked, ongoing denervation with fair activation and markedly reduced recruitment.
In addition, PP, vibration sense and proprioception was decreased, but this part of the exam was limited due to inattention and not reliable.
Few fasciculation R-triceps (not in tongue).
SHe required BiPAP for a few days but her NIFs steadily improved and then normalized without acute intervention.
CV: Pt has history of PAF, has been maintained on coumadin as an outpatient.
Has now been maintained on heparin gtt given possible need for further procedures.
Antihypertensive regimen continued per outpatient regimen.
Currently on heparin drip, coumadin started [**2155-6-17**].
GI/Oncologic: Pt with mildly elevated amylase and lipase after her biliary stent placement.
Rare atypical degenerated cell of uncertain significance.
CEA 1.4 (normal)  Pt continued on pancrease.
Now on chronic suppression therapy with dicloxacillin.
