Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old left-handed woman with left atrial myxoma, pAfib on aspirin (large rectus sheath hematoma while on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p pacemaker placement for sick sinus syndrome, history of DVT, CHF, Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, CRI, and hypothyroidism, who presented with an episode of altered level of consciousness (no recorded witness account of what actually happened).
On admission her neurological examination was significant for a right facial droop and dysarthria, and this progressed to RUE weakness in UMN distribution on morning after day of admission, along with hypophonic speech, motor aphasia but intact comprehension.
The possible etiologies included a Sz leading to alteration in level of consciousness (she is at increased risk given history of AD) or a small stroke.
She was admitted to neurology service and was treated with IVF, her BP medications were held and blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate.
Given prior significant bleeding with coumadin, she was maintained on ASA 325mg daily.
Her IVF were discontinued give CHF (see below).
She has a history of dCHF and was found to be tachypneic on morning of admission, likely due to IVF administration for stroke protocol.
EKG was not concerning for ischemia and CXR was consistent w/ CHF, likely an acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation  She was maintained on home dose of lasix and provided with IV boluses.
Given worsening encephalopathy, Lasix at this time was held and she was given 500cc D5W.
She will require aspriation precautions and a repeat S&S evaluation.
Patient will require careful volume status monitoring and hyponatremia monitoring.
It was also confirmed that patient would not have wanted tube feeds.
