Diursed 4000 cc's yesterday after 20mg IV Lasix.
Upon transfer, she was reported to be afebrile on antibiotics and was able to lie flat.
Pleurx catheter draining minimal fluid.
She is still having chest discomfort which she describes as pressure.
Vitals on transfer were T 98.2, HR 74, BP 119/68, RR 18, 94% on 4L NC .
Past Medical History: Anterior wall STEMI with Trop peak to 4, treated medically given prognosis, however cathed [**2196-4-26**] for continued chest pain which showed no angiographically apparent CAD COPD Stage IV NSCLC with liver mets and recurrent effusions s/p pluerex catheter placement [**2196-3-26**] at [**Hospital3 **] chemo-induced neuropathy anemia, neutropenia chronic back pain GERD chronic cough   Social History: Lives at home with husband.
CARDIAC: Difficult to auscultate given course breath sounds.
Pertinent Results: WBC on admission 17.8 which decreased to 10.3 by discharge Hct 43.9 --> 37.0 Plts 535 --> 369 Coags reflected Heparin gtt while admitted but this was stopped after cath, INR 1.1 on discharge.
[**4-26**] cath Coronary angiography:  right dominant LMCA, LAD, LCX, RCA:  No angiographically-apparent CAD.
Medical Management 2.
Discontinue Clopidogrel   Brief Hospital Course: Pt's course is complicated as she has received care at several hospitals ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 46**]) and documentation was not fully provided on transfer here, but in brief:  74yoF with stage IV metastatic (to liver) NSCLC including recurrent effusions requring Pleurex catheter transfered from OSH where she had an anterior STEMI [**2196-4-16**] which was medically treated for a week (?
On arrival, pt was treated with ACS protocol including BB, ASA, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Nitro gtt.
Therefore, Heparin gtt, statin, and Plavix were discontinued and pt should continue on ASA and BB only, and could consider adding ACEi if bp/Cr tolerate.
Brief episode of hypoxia: On admission, pt with normal O2 sats on 4-5L NC however day after admission had acute hypoxia, to mid 80s on 5L, during which she was also having chest tightness.
She was transitioned to a NRB with improvement in oxygenation to normal.
She was nevertheless diuresed with 20 mg IV Lasix and called back out to the floor with stable oxygenation, and had no further issues.
She was not continued on daily standing Lasix but if oxygenation becomes an issue, would consider diuresis gently.
Unclear exact etiology of such acute hypoxia but DDx considered included mild CHF, mucus plugging, aspiration; less likely PE given that she was on Heparin gtt at that time.
She recently had a left sided Pleurex catheter for malignant effusions, which over time has tapered off.
We discussed with the patient that she should follow up with the doctor who placed the catheter for further management.
She was continued on her pain regimen with Oxycontin, oxycodone PRN.
COPD exacerbation vs PNA and apparently new cavitating lesion: Extremely unclear on admission as we received no d/c summary, but she was apparently being treated for COPD exacerbation with IV Solumedrol and Zosyn/Levaquin.
We continued these on admission and eventually switched her to a Prednisone taper, outlined on med reconciliation.
Paratracheal and bilateral hilar adenopathy with chest tube at left base noted.
We also continued Xopenex, Ipratropium nebs.
Code status: On transfer to the CCU, code-status was re-discussed with the patient and family determining that her status should be DNR/DNI, and paperwork was filled out to this effect.
The patient is still considering palliative chemotherapy and are not ready for Hospice.
