He underwent right radical nephrectomy on [**2112-4-18**] revealing an 11.5 cm renal cell carcinoma, firm and grade 2.
He underwent re-excision to obtain clean margins.
He was followed with surveillance imaging and on CT on [**2116-1-14**], torso revealed liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease.
He was referred here for discussion of high-dose IL- 2 therapy.
He passed eligibility testing and began cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 on [**2116-3-9**] receiving 13 of 14 doses week 1 and 10 of 14 doses week 2.
Follow-up CTs revealed disease regression in the hepatic and right adrenal mets, and he was admitted for cycle 2 week 1 of therapy on [**2116-6-8**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic kidney cancer as above, hypertension, anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism after IL-2.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
daily on hold, mirtazapine 50 mg p.o.
daily, multivitamin 1 tablet daily, Colace 100 mg daily, levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient was admitted and went through interventional radiology for central line placement prior to therapy.
During this week he received 5 of 14 doses with therapy stopped early due to development of shock attributed to capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy.
He was initially hypotensive on treatment day #2 without response to fluid boluses and was subsequently placed on dopamine 6 mcg per kilogram per minute with Neo-Synephrine added secondary to persistent hypotension.
He went to maximum dose dopamine and Neo-Synephrine, and was eventually weaned off Neo-synephrine followed by dopamine of the following day.
He was placed on continuous blood pressure bedside and central telemetry monitoring.
IL-2 therapy was held until he was weaned from pressors and he was given his fifth dose of interleukin-2 on Wednesday at 4:00 p.m.
He subsequently developed significant hypotension unresponsive to maximum dose Neo-Synephrine and dopamine, requiring the addition of Levophed, and was transferred to the ICU for further hemodynamic monitoring.
He returned to 11 Riceman on [**2116-6-25**] and further IL-2 was discontinued given the severity of side effects noted.
Other side effects during this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; rigors improved with Demerol and significant fatigue.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.5 with associated oliguria and metabolic acidosis improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
IV fluids were maintained given acute renal failure in the setting of hypotension.
He was anemic without need for packed red blood cell transfusion.
pruritus, cephalexin 500 mg b.i.d.
loose stools, Lasix 20 mg p.o.
