Levophed and Neo-Synephrine were started.
Antibiotics were changed to Zosyn, sparfloxacin, vancomycin, and Levaquin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2156-2-14**], treated with thalidomide, prednisone, Decadron and Cytoxan with refractory disease and continued myeloma.
The patient was also on Procrit and Lupron.
She received intermittent transfusions as an outpatient.
MEDICATIONS:  Prior to massive septic shock included: Metoprolol 150 mg b.i.d.
Nifedipine CR 30 q.day.
Allopurinol 100 mg q.day Procrit 40,000 q.week.
Albuterol p.r.n.
Her medications on transfer were: Neo-Synephrine drip.
On arrival at [**Hospital6 649**], her temperature was 98, her blood pressure was 70/59, went up to 93/68, heart rate 110 on Levophed, Neo- Synephrine and Vasopressin.
Her vent settings were AC 500/26/5/1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  HYPOTENSION SECONDARY TO GRAM-NEGATIVE SEPTIC SHOCK:  The patient was continued on pressors and given many liters of I.V.
An arterial line was placed and followed as well for titration of pressors.
She was initially started on cefepime and vancomycin.
When the Pseudomonas was identified, she was treated with Zosyn and ciprofloxacin.
Her pressors were eventually weaned off and she completed a course of antibiotics for her sepsis.
OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient developed fungemia secondary to central line, broad-spectrum antibiotics and TPN.
The patient was started on ampicillin.
The ventilator was used often to help blow off the metabolic acidosis the patient had.
The patient also received liters of bicarb drip in the acute episode to address her acidosis that was not compatible with life.
She was supported with FFP, platelet transfusions and red blood cell transfusions.
HYPOCALCEMIA:  The patient was on a calcium drip.
MYELOMA:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] followed the patient regarding her myeloma, spoke to the family on multiple episodes saying that there was no treatment that could be offered to the patient, given the fact that she had already had multiple treatments without response and that she presented with multi-system organ failure with peripheral plasma cells and was deemed not a candidate for further treatment of myeloma.
Multiple CAT scans confirmed this and she was supported with FFP and platelets to prevent further bleeding.
The patient received stress dose of steroids for her sepsis, as she did not have an appropriate stress response.
Thrombocytopenia, as mentioned before, the patient had DIC and was supported with platelets to prevent bleeding.
After two units of packed red blood cells, the patient began to become more tachycardic, sinus tach at 150 - 160.
