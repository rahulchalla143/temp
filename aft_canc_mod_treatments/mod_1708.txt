The back pain was unchanged from his usual back pain, secondary to his ALL, and was not relieved by morphine or methadone.
Of note, he had another admission earlier in [**Month (only) **] at which point he developed a strep viridans line infection (from PICC line)-- the PICC line was removed, he was treated with a course of PCN G which was changed to augmentin at his last admission with the last dose due either yesterday or today.
He was given ceftriaxone, vanco, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis coverage.
The differential diagnosis was felt to include lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia) or a blastic transformation/progression of a mature B cell lymphoma.
It was felt that these findings should be interpreted with caution since no blasts were identified on a corresponding peripheral smear.
Given his significant liver dysfunction and other medical co-morbidities, the initial treatment regimen chosen for the patient consisted of R-CHOP, which was initiated on [**2116-3-4**].
He received a second cycle of chemotherapy on [**2116-3-24**], consisting of R-CHOP without vincristine, which was held secondary to neuropathy.
Modified Hyper-CVAD Course A was given on [**2116-4-10**], with a second course given on [**2116-5-15**] and a third course on [**2116-6-22**].
He was treated with rituximab 500mg, given in three doses of 100mg, 200 mg, and 200mg on [**10-9**] - [**10-11**].
In addition, he was treated with rituximab 375mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2, doxorubicin 20mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20mg from [**10-19**]- [**10-21**].
After extensive discussion, he opted to continue palliative chemotherapy with rituximab and prednisone.
Rituximab was started on [**2116-11-16**] at 100mg, with plans to continue threrapy with 200mg daily on [**11-17**] and [**11-18**].
Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
He is a recovering heroin addict who used IV drugs for over 30 years before becoming clean, but he admits that he intermittently uses illegal drugs, most recently in early [**Month (only) 359**] (cocaine) and did heroin ~5 years ago.
