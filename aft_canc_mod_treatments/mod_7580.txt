Status post partial gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy.
Recommend clinical correlation with LFTs and ultrasound can be considered.
Multiple non-obstructing sub 4mm renal calculi.
[**2107-10-4**] Barium Swallow/Small Bowel Follow Through: IMPRESSION: No emptying of barium from stomach after 85 minutes likely represents obstruction at the gastrojejunal anastamosis.
The patient was about 6 weeks s/p subtotal gastrectomy with [**Last Name (un) **] gastrojejunostomy and J Tube.
Neuro: Patient reported severe pain that has been constant ever since surgery at her J-tube site.
The patient received Dilaudid IV and oxycodone through the J tube with some relief.
Higher doses of narcotic pain medication did not seem to help her pain dramatically.
Regarding her nausea she was treated with IV zofran and PR compazine which somewhat improved her symptoms, though she continued to vomit persistently despite aggressive antiemetic therapy.
Later in her admission she was placed on Ativan for retching which subjectively helped to some degree.
She was started on Vanc/Zosyn and transferred to the ICU.
During her ICU stay she initially had some SBP in the 80's which responded nicely to fluid boluses.
She was started on tube feedings via J-Tube on HD 1.
She tolerated the tube feeds well, though she persistently vomited clear, foamy fluid (not tube feed-like in appearance).
This showed lack of gastric emptying as outlined in the reports section.
They recommended obtaining a CEA during this admission which was done.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for further chemo/radiation options.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge on HD 9, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating tube feeds, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was adequately controlled.
