Admission Date:  [**2182-11-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-1-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-4-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Leukopheresis Central line placement and removal Arterial line placement and removal Intubation Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 53yoF with h/o DM2, Etoh abuse who presented to an OSH with confusion and urinary/fecal incontinence after approximately two to three months of non-specific symptoms, most noticeably fatigue.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was leukopheresed and started on hydroxyurea.
Of note, pt had recent a recent work-up in [**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) **] for weightloss (~30lbs over past year) which included labs notable only for anemia and CT Abd which per husband "showed pancreatitis."
Because of her history of cough/myalgias, she underwent nasal washings for the flu and was put on droplet precautions; the DFA came back positive, and per ID's reccomendations, oseltamivir was begun.
Given her functionally neutropenic state, cefepime and vancomycin also were initiated for a possible bacterial process, with azithromycin added later for atypicals.
Although afebrile following this, her temperature curve could not be interpreted due to steroids given in stress-dosing.
On this antimicrobial regimen along with diuresis, her sats intially improved, and she was able to be extubated.
However, the following day her steroids were stopped and she became increasingly tachypneic and re-spiked a temperature.
She was unable to be weaned off the ventilator, and eventually developed pulmonary changes consistent with end-stage ARDS/fibrosis.
She was started on steroids, and remained intubated.
After 2 weeks on steroids repeat CXR should slight improvement of diffuse infiltrates.
Her ventilatory settings were gradually weaned and she was able to tolerate PS with minimal pressures and PEEP.
Unfortunatley she had an event of hemoptysis in which she desaturated into the 70's and required increase vent support.
After this event she had no further hemoptysis however she required AC on the vent.
It was then decided to hold off any attempts at weaning and keep the patient on full vent support until she cleared the infections and was afebrile.
The patient had increasing respiratory distress from [**2183-2-8**] onward and became increasingly difficult to ventilate with worseining CXR on full coverage of antimicrobial agents.
In addition, she required three pressors support over the period from [**Date range (1) 8361**].
She was intially leukopheresed, bringing her WBC down from 60,000 to 30,000 and was started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol.
More definitive chemotherapy was initially put on hold given her poor respiratory function/infection (as described below) and her initial echo with and EF of 30%.
After being non-neutropenic for 7 days or so her counts began to drop at which point it was discovered she had VRE and MRSA bactermia.
At this point from heme/onc position the patient would require induction chemotherapy to induce remission and then the only curative measure would be BMT.
However given the patients condition this was not an option as she would not survive chemotherapy given her state of health.
ID: The patient had a positive DFA, and was started on tamiflu empirically.
She was also then started on amantadine empirically.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for frequent fevers.
She was also started on ambisome, which was discontinued due to renal failure; then caspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole due to concerns for cholestasis.
She was continued on imipenem and voriconazole empirically for febrile neutropenia.
Galactomannan and histoplasma antigen were both negative.
Pt was then on imipenem and voriconazole for several weeks while she was neutropenic.
She was off antibiotics for at least seven days.
So she was restarted on daptomycin, and  cefepime was added as well for fever of neutropenia.
Her central line was removed and changed to PICC line however she then developed MRSA in her bld cultures.
She was continued on the daptomycin which will cover both VRE and MRSA.
All central lines were removed and she was converted to PIV's, giving her a central access holiday.
She continued to spike and was found to have sparce growth of aspergillus in her sputum.
Hypotension: The patient was on and off pressors throughout the hospitalization.
She did not require any further pressors.
She was given fluid boluses as needed and PRBCs.
As she improved form a resp standpoint, her right eye was re-addressed.
Unfortunately she had developed severe muscle weakness during her stay likely secondary to steroids and critical illness.
