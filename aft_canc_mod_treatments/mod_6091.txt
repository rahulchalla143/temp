She had bronchoscopy with argon laser ablation and resection of endobronchial tumor, along with y-stent placement on [**2183-3-21**].
There is also palpable abnormality in the skull treated with palliative radiation therapy.
On [**4-21**] she had a radical left nephrectomy which involved entry into the chest and placement of a Chest tube; transfused 2 units in the OR.
Chest tube was pulled on [**4-23**] wuth subsequent CXR revealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
She was given lopressor 5mg IV and HR decreased to low 100s; O2 sat improved to mid 90s on 2L nc with coughing.
Subsequently, O2 sats on 50%FM 90-95% and remained tachycardic 120s (sinus) so was bolused with IVF.

The left chest tube is in place.
[**4-22**] CXR:FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-21**], following placement of the chest tube to waterseal, there may be a very tiny left apical pneumothorax medially, though this would be of no clinical significance.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma.
In the first two post-operative days, pain control was especially difficult to obtain.
Although the epidural catheter was working, its level was too high to cover the entire incision, and a significant narcotic load was necessary to control the pt's pain.
Chest tube was pulled on [**4-23**] wuth subsequent CXR revealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
She was given lopressor 5mg IV and HR decreased to low 100s; O2 sat improved to mid 90s on 2L nc with coughing.
PICC was placed for venous access--PA/LATERAL ordered to confirm Picc placemant as ther was some concern that it might be coiled on portable film but was in place on repeat film.
Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid PCA initially which was subsequently changed to MS Contin [**Hospital1 **] with PO dilaudid for breakthrough.
She was seen by orthoopedics to clarify weightbearing status since had hip metastases with cortical involvement on CT. Orthopedics recommended weight bearing as tolerated using walker and she cleared physical therapy for discharge home with home PT.
She was weaned off oxygen and was satting mid 90s at rest on room air and 88-91% with ambulation on discharge.
She was given prescription for home oxygento use with exertion.
She was continued on nebs including mucomyst, levalbuterol and ipratropium and given flutter valve device.
