Admission Date:  [**2154-11-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2154-11-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-3-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  OBMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old female with a history of M4 AML who, on day 16 of status post ARA-C daunorubicin chemotherapy at [**Hospital 45098**] Hospital in [**State 2748**], was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of refractory thrombocytopenia resulting in a right frontal and mid-brain intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage.
She was treated with hydroxyurea, ARA-C, daunorubicin and this course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, for which the patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for her FNN.
Marked thrombocytopenia requiring multiple transfusions (greater than 20 bags of platelets), packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma, which brought her platelets up to 134.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  AML M4 [**9-30**], status post ARA-C, daunorubicin, neutropenic fever, in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization, cesarean section, endometriosis.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT SERVICE: Vancomycin 1 gram every 12 hours intravenously, ceftazidime 1 gram every eight hours, AmBisome 180 mg intravenously every 24 hours, pantoprazole 40 mg once daily, Epogen 30,000 units weekly on Monday, Nystatin swish and swallow every six hours, hydrocortisone cream 2.5%, vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneously day two of three, Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day, Senna 1 mg by mouth twice a day, normal saline at 100 cc/hour, potassium and magnesium sliding scales, and Tylenol 650 mg every four to six hours.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to Bone Marrow Transplant service, temperature 98.2, pulse 76, respirations 18, blood pressure 154/90.
Neurologic: Bilateral ptosis, pupils as above, left hemiparesis with left upper motor neuron signs, increased tone in left upper extremity, brisk reflexes on left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 48-year-old female with AML status post ARA-C and daunorubicin one month ago, with intracranial bleed in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
The patient's other problems are febrile neutropenia, splenic lesions on abdominal imaging, difficult to replete electrolytes, residual neurologic deficits from her intracranial bleed, and her AML.
Hematology/Oncology:  The patient was transfused around 20 bags of platelets during her Medical Intensive Care Unit course, and this in combination with her natural platelet production resulted in her platelets being in the 500s upon discharge.
She is not yet in any state for any bone marrow transplant with her occasional confusion and residual neurologic deficits from her intracranial bleed, and will require a good deal of rehabilitation before this is done.
Neurology:  Status post her right mid-brain and right frontal lobe intracranial bleed, the patient slowly recovered some degree of mental status.
However, she did have a large degree of frontal disinhibition and did require a 24 hour sitter for her stay in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit because she often would get out of bed, saying that she needed to go home.
She also pulled out her tubes and lines.
She remained having a right dilated and fixed pupil of 3 to 4 mm with bilateral ptosis and in inability to open her eyes.
Infectious Disease:  This woman with AML and initially with neutropenia did not spike any more fevers while on our service.
Her vancomycin and ceftazidime were discontinued at this time, however, her AmBisome was continued to treat the question of fungal lesions that appeared in her spleen.
She had a complex liver cyst and bilateral pleural fluid collections as other incidental findings.
They felt that they would definitely continue AmBisome until her next intervention.
The Infectious Disease team felt that fungal disease should be ruled out before initiating her possible future bone marrow transplant.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Her potassium and magnesium were difficult to replete, most likely secondary to her AmBisome therapy.
She was placed on a potassium and magnesium sliding scale and her levels were kept in the normal range after this.
Lines:  The patient has a Hickman catheter which was placed on the [**10-31**], which remained clean, dry and intact throughout the hospitalization.
At that time, she can undergo further rehabilitation and long-term treatment can be decided upon by her team there.
Intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage in the setting of thrombocytopenia 3.
Liposomal amphotericin B 180 mg intravenously every 24 hours 2.
Magnesium repletion sliding scale 3.
Potassium repletion sliding scale 4.
Protonix 40 mg intravenously every 24 hours 5.
Epogen 30,000 units subcutaneously weekly, which likely may be discontinued; her last dose of the Epogen was [**2154-11-25**] 6.
Nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc by mouth every six hours as needed 7.
Ativan .5 to 1 mg by mouth as needed 8.
Benadryl 25 mg intravenously prior to her AmBisome dosing 9.
