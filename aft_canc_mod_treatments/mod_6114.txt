She was initially diagnosed in [**2178-11-17**] and received R-CHOP therapy in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2178**].
She had a stent placed in her right ureter.
She has since been found to have a rising LDH and hypercalcemia, and decided with her local oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 20676**] [**Name (STitle) 31966**], to enter into a study protocol #DF 09-111, "Safety and Efficacy study of Ofatumumab in combination with ICE or DHAP Chemotherapy in Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Lymphoma Prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation."
She has had rhinorrhea since her ureteral stent placement two weeks ago.
Biopsy of a left inguinal node showed grade 3b follicular lymphoma with a MIB of 50-60%, and she was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP completing therapy in [**2179-3-18**].
PET scan was negative at the completion of chemotherapy and her most recent prior CT scan was done in [**10/2179**] and also was negative for disease relapse.
However, in early [**2180-5-17**], she underwent restaging CT done without contrast because of an elevated creatinine and she was found to have a large right pelvic sidewall mass (6.5 x 3.1 cm) causing obstruction of her ureter causing right hydronephrosis.
She followed up locally with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for labs and Zometa while decided whether or not to pursue treatment at [**Hospital1 18**].
