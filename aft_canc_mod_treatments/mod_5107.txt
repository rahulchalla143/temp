LINE PLACEMENT	Study Date of [**2174-11-25**] 12:47 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC.
The left internal jugular catheter has been removed.
XR TOE(S), 2+ VIEW LEFT	Study Date of [**2174-11-30**] 11:43 AM FINDINGS: Mild degenerative changes at the first interphalangeal and metatarsal phalangeal joint with small osteophytes.
Consider interval anterior and inferior myocardial infarction.
A 1.8 x1.8 thrombus is seen in the apex left ventricle, adjacent to the akinetic segment (best appreciated on cine loop #50).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 64819**] is a 55yo M w/hx of CP and AML s/p MUD Allo-SCT [**5-26**] complicated by GVHD of the skin and mucous membranes with a hx of GIB who presented with a left lower extremity DVT and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension sepsis and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics as treatment.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed possible prostatic abscess and this was later confirmed on prostatic ultrasound.
He received Pip/Tazo/vanc/[**Doctor Last Name **] and this was changed on ID advice to nafcillin in addition to high dose trim/sulfa.
He was treated with IV heparin drip and changed to LMWH.
LV thrombus was confirmed on echocardiogram and cardiology were consulted recommending continued anticoagulation and repeat echo as an out-patient.
He was transferred to the floor on [**11-27**] and remained afebrile and worked with PT with his mobility improving on transfer to rehabilitation on [**12-6**].
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], pressors were initiated and a left IJ central venous line was placed.
His blood pressure improved with dopamine and was successfully weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours while continuing IVF boluses as needed.
He was initially placed on stress dose steroids due to risk of adrenal insufficiency as he is on chronic prednisone.
Once his hemodynamics improved his hydrocortisone was stopped ([**2174-11-27**]) and he was resumed on his home dose of 10mg prednisone daily.
His HCT dropped slightly in the setting of intravenous rehydration, but he did not have hematochezia, melena or hematemesis.
He was seen by urology who determined that this hypodensity was not amenable to drainage and advised IV antibiotics.
Cultures were all negative aside from a urine culture that grew Staph from [**2174-11-17**] and he was started empirically on vancomycin, pip/tazo and metronidazole on [**11-25**], and metronidazole was discontinued after C.difficile toxin returned negative on [**11-27**].
Follow-up urine cultures were negative and he was changed from vanc/pip/tazo to naficillin 2g q4 on [**11-29**] in addition to high-dose trim/sulfa to cover for prostate abscess.
He remained afebrile on the unit and ID recommended a 2 week course of IV antibiotics in addition to a 2 month course of oral trim/sulfa.
A PICC line was successfully inserted on [**12-2**] (unable to pass axilla on left and difficult but successful insertion on right) to complete his Abx course on  Nafcillin IV to finish on  [**12-9**] and oral trim/sulfa to finish [**2175-1-23**].
He will be seen by ID after 4 weeks of since IV antibiotic therapy with a repeat prostatic ultrasound at that time.
He will be seen by ID on [**12-29**] and a prostate ultrasound will be repeated with an enema 1 hour prior.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-25**] and a heparin IV infusion was started.
He was switched to enoxaparin on transfer to the floor.
His left leg edema improved with elevation and oral furosemide was commenced.
He was started on a heparin IV infusion.
Cardiology were consulted and recommended continued anticoagulation with cardiology f/u and repeat ECHO as outpatient to determine duration of treatment.
He was started on metoprolol and lisinopril as cardioprotective drugs.
He underwent EGD showing erosive esophagitis without active bleeding (at OSH in NH).
Patient was transfused a total of 5 units PRBCs during this admission and was discharged to home as his HCT stablized without further bleeding.
GI were consulted and recommended continuing high dose PPI (pantoprazole) [**Hospital1 **] and if pt developed any sign of GI bleeding, for repeat endoscopy.
#Hyperlipidemia: We continued Pravastatin .
# L toenail detached: L toenail fell off [**12-4**] and treated with triamcinolone cream.
