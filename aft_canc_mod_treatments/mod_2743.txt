EtOH withdrawal - he was given thiamine, folate and MVI, maintained on a CIWA score with diazepam scheduled for elevated CIWA scores - multiple Code Purples were called as he tried to leave - the patient required ICU level care for alcohol withdrawl - he required restraints and psychiatry was consulted - they felt he likely had acute benzodiazepine intoxication, so valium was held in favor of PRN haldol - ultimately he came off CIWA and required no more haloperidol - of note he had transaminase elevation to the 100s-200s, with normal alk phos and bilirubin, this was suggestive of hepatocellular injury, chronic Hep C vs. mild EtOH hepatitis .
