Her complete hospital course is outlined as a timeline and by problem below: =============================== EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT/ORTHOPEDICS COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was seen in the ED by orthopedic surgery and her LLE compartments were measured.
The pressures (in mm Hg) were 45, 78, 35, and 38 for the posterior superficial, posterior deep, anterior, and lateral comparments, respectively.
She tolerated the procedure well and recovered in the PACU without acute events.
She was given 10mg IV lopressor but her heart rate only came down to the 160s and SBPs were in the 80s to 90s.
The MICU team was consulted at this point because it was likely that she would require either adenosine or electro-cardioversion.
This then recurred a doszen times, each episode was symptomatic with SOB and systolic in 80s; they all terminated with 6mg IV adenosine.
The frequency of these episodes decreased with esmolol drip.
PE: Oncology comfortable with pt being on coumadin over lovenox for PE even in setting of malignancy given her significant complication on lovenox.
INR bumped to 6 after one dose of 5mg coumadin in the setting of concurrent Abx.
Patient convereted to NSR with 6mg IV adenosine x1.
Underlying causes were thought to be due to recent surgery, 2 missed doses of diltiazem on the day prior, new pulmonary embolism, hyperthyroidism, or myocardial infarction.
-Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was on warfarin 2 mg daily, INR on admission to medicine was therapeutic at 2.2; remained therapeutic at 2.7 at time of discharge (goal [**3-11**]).
Left lower extremity compartment syndrome: Due to hematoma that patient developed while on lovenox for bilateral pulmonary emboli.
-Status post fasciotomy and subsequent wound closure by orthopedics.
-Patient completed post-operative course of antibiotics with Keflex on [**2188-12-16**].
-Per MICU sign out, [**Date Range 5564**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] is okay with treating patient with coumadin vs. Lovenox.
Normocytic anemia: Baseline HCT approximately 30; 28.9 on admission to floor.
Metastatic NSCLC:: Patient not on any current treatment; per pt, completed last chemotherapy course in [**9-14**].
COPD: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has emphysema superimposed on a baseline of restriction related to volume loss from her lobectomy.
