She underwent vigorous CPT and incentive spirometry and was maintained on antibiotics which was eventually Cipro and Vancomycin.
The wound was cultured, and she had moist-to-dry dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] from that point on.
The cultue was positive for sparse growth of Pseudomonas, Beta strep and coag + staph.
From a GI standpoint, she was maintained on cyclic tube feeds and also had a speech and swallow evaluation for dysphagia, which did not reveal any dysphagia or aspiration.
Following her diuresis early on, she remained euvolemic on Lasix 20 mg PO BID with a creatinine of 0.9.
Due to her prolonged hospitalization and deconditioning, she was discharged to rehabiliation facility for continued physical therapy with the hopes of returning home eventually.
