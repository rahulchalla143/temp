Nonsmall cell lung cancer - status post right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**8-31**] on which day she underwent a right upper lobe lobectomy with a mediastinal lymph node dissection without note of intraoperative complication.
Postoperatively, the patient was extubated without difficulty and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.
Pain control was provided by an epidural catheter which was notably placed intrathecally.
Placement of this catheter intrathecally required the patient to stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit on postoperative day one, but otherwise she was doing well with incentive spirometry and aggressive chest PT.
Pain control was not an issue, and the patient successfully passed her voiding trial, and was therefore discharged to home in good condition.
