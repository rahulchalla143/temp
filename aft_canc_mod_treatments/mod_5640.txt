HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old white male with an extensive past medical history including metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with metastases to the skull, status post radiation therapy times 18, and metastases to right iliac crest.
The patient underwent 18 rounds of radiation therapy to the skull as well as one round of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin on [**2104-9-2**].
He has a history of significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with multiple flares and is currently on a number of inhalers at home.
He endorses increased fatigue and general malaise since chemotherapy was initiated.
His Intensive Care Unit course was unremarkable, and his hypotension and urinary retention resolved with intravenous fluid administration.
Specific occurring in the Intensive Care Unit and previous Medicine Service will be discussed in more detail below.
Rheumatic heart disease; status post aortic valve replacement.
Ablation for atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placed in [**2098**].
Status post open cholecystectomy.
ALLERGIES:  Allergy to PROCAINAMIDE and SULFA DRUGS which cause thrombocytopenia.
Coumadin 10 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
Neurontin 900 mg p.o.
Flomax 0.4 mg p.o.
Proscar 5 mg p.o.
Klonopin 1 mg p.o.
Glyburide 5 mg p.o.
NPH insulin 6 to 8 units q.d.
Zestril 40 mg p.o.
Spironolactone 12.5 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 67-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2104-5-7**] with metastases to skull and possibly the liver; status post aortic valve replacement secondary to rheumatic heart disease, on Coumadin, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and a history of gastrointestinal bleed presenting with cough times two weeks as well as lower extremity rash and pain following chemotherapy treatment on [**2104-9-2**].
At the time of discharge, he was still requiring supplemental oxygen as well as albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments three to four times per day.
Radiology/Oncology was consulted after the patient left the Intensive Care Unit for a possible radiation therapy to open the right lower lobe obstruction.
Options were discussed, and it was thought that there was little chance that any radiation therapy would prolong the patient's life, and no further therapy was recommended.
LOWER EXTREMITY RASH:  The patient's main complaint on presentation was a painful, erythematous, petechial rash in the bilateral shins; status post chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin approximately one to two weeks prior to admission.
With evidence of postobstructive pneumonia by chest x-ray and CT scan, additional antibiotics including clindamycin, Flagyl, and vancomycin were used intermittently.
A unifying diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis was proposed; however, they diagnosis could not be fully assessed, as a magnetic resonance imaging could not be performed secondary to hardware from pacemaker in aortic valve.
During his Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had an episode of agitation coinciding with the administration of Fentanyl which was relieved with Risperdal.
Although it was not completely clear, Fentanyl and morphine were used sparingly throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
It was thought that metabolic factors were contributing in part, as well as the possibility of carcinomatous meningitis, as well as a viral etiology.
He has a history of congestive heart failure as well as atrial fibrillation, and aortic valve replacement status post rheumatic heart disease.
With intravenous fluid resuscitation, the patient's creatinine trended back to baseline and was 0.9 at the time of discharge; reconfirming that the patient's acute renal failure was secondary to prerenal causes.
During his hospitalization, the patient had one episode of self-discontinuing Foley catheter which led to bloody urine, which subsequently was flushed and cleared.
He had been followed with serial hematocrits prior to hospitalization with hematocrit dropping as low as 27.
The patient was anticoagulated with Coumadin secondary to aortic valve replacement.
Coumadin was restarted at a lower dose of 5 mg p.o.
Hospice medication regimen including Roxanol, Ativan, Levsin, ABHR gel.
Insulin sliding-scale.
Finasteride 5 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q.4-6h.
Flovent 110 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.
Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d.
Nystatin swish-and-swallow 5 cc p.o.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Klonopin 1 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
