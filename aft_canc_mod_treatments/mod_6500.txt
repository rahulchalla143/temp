Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo male with hx of severe COPD with hx of hospitalizations requiring intubations in the past, squamous cell lung cancer with hx of LLL lobectomy, presents in transfer from [**Hospital1 **] s/p episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He does require BiPAP at night with settings [**11-24**] with 14 backup rate, and 30% FIO2 to maintain O2 sat between 88 and 92%.
During that hospitalization, he was treated with CPAP and underwent bronchoscopy for concern of RLL collapse which revealed mass obstructing the bronchus, and was confirmed to have recurrence of squamous cell cancer.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for radiation therapy per recommendations of their pulmonary consult, despite requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] where his oncologist is.
# Severe COPD, CO2 retention Floor course unclear, however patient was initially admitted to the floor, where BIPAP was not started.
Patient was taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was placed on standing nebs, and he was placed on BIPAP.
As definitive treatment of this issue would be relief of dead space via XRT of his obstructing SCC, and because his oncological care is at the [**Hospital1 84145**] transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for initiation of XRT was undertaken.
Plan going forward: - Transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for XRT - Continue NEBS - Continue BIPAP at 12/5 with 14 backup rate, and 30% FIO2 to maintain O2 sat between 88 and 92% .
