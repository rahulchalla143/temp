#GIB: Most likely cause for GI bleeding is gastric lymphoma, considering the malignant aspect of the lesion on prior endoscopy and worsening CT scan of the abdomen showing worsening retroperitoneal masses.
Pt has not been taking NSAIDs and Prednisone has been d/ced , making gastritis less likely this time.

He was initially maintained on a PPI infusion, which was changed to Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
Pt received a total of 3 UPRBC during this admission and did not require further transfusions while on the floor.
In setting of high risk procedure and pt's wishes to not continue with further XRT and invasive procedures or surgery, no further EGD or gastric biopsies done.
