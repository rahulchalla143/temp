1) Nausea/ Vomiting/Gastric outlet obstruction: Upon presentation the patient was initially admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for management of his volume depletion and presumed gastric outlet obstruction.
On [**2123-8-3**] a percutaneous G-J tube was placed beyond the site of gastric outlet obstruction but was not able to transverse a distal jejunal obstruction.
He was not able to tolerate feeds through this tube and due to pain at the site and no clear utility it was exchanged on [**8-5**] for a simple venting gastrotomy tube.
Therefore, decision was made to medically manage nausea with ondansetron, lorazepam, and prochlorperazine while patient remained on TPN feeds and attempts were made to address his total body disease burden.
In conversation with his oncologist, after mechanical attempts to bypass obstructions failed, the patient and his partner chose to pursue palliative ECF regimen with goal of tumor bulk reduction and symptomatic improvement (primarily a hope of being able to tolerate more of a PO diet).
To this end the patient was transferred from the surgical to medical oncology service on [**2123-8-10**] and his chemotherapy was initiated.
He tolerated the initiation of chemotherapy without initial ill effects and was discharged on continuous infusion chemo to follow up with his primary oncologist.
3) Nutrition: Patient was unable to tolerate any significant PO nutrition so received TPN through PICC placed [**2123-7-29**] and then portacath placed [**2123-8-3**].
An attempt at enteral feeds was briefly made but was not tolerated.
Initial attempts to control this led to significant oversedation but eventually was able to tolerate fentanyl patch and oral hydromorphone regimen with minimal pain unless abdomen was pushed on or other provocative events occured.
The patient was discharged on oral hydromorphone and a fentanyl patch as his standing pain regimen.
He expressed a clear preference for his spouse to perform all line and dressing cares, which was very understandably taxing on her and social work and palliative care remained involved to help with coping and support decision-making as best as they were able.
4) Goals of Care:  Despite multiple well cited conversations with the family where providers explained the patient had incurable disease with goals aiming at comfort and palliation the patient and particularly his wife expressed sentiments relating to his cancer being "cured."
5) Chronic biliary obstructions: The patient was continued on his standing levofloxacin and ursodiol, there were never any signs of current, active infection so antibiotics started in the ED were stopped on [**7-27**].
The patient was discharged with [**Month/Year (2) 269**] with plans for home TPN and infusional chemo through port and PICC lines in place.
