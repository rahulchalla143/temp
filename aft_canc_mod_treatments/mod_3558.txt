[**2118-9-30**]: Port-a-cath Flow Study: 1.
Good flow was obtained on aspiration of the port at the end of the examination.
Patient has prior distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and radical left nephrectomy.
This could represent postoperative thickening but correlation with any prior imaging is advised to exclude the possibility of local recurrence.
The remaining portion of the proximal pancreatic body, neck and head appear normal.
Multiple sub cm ovoid hypoattenuating areas mainly in the left lobe ,these may represent small cysts but are too small to characterise on CT and should be correlated with prior imaging or interval follow up as small hypovascular metastases cannot be excluded.

While in the ED, the patient had cultures drawn, and was initially treated with Cefepime, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Hydrocortisone.
Upon transfer to the MICU, the patient was maintained on therapy with cefepime and vancomycin  for treatment of febrile neutropenia.
The patient had received 3L NS hydration initially and was given FFP with intention to reverse the patient's elevated INR (patient on coumadin for DVT) for possible LP.
Overnight in the ICU on the day of admission the patient had two episodes of hypotension, with systolics in the 60's to 70's range necessitating 2NS and 2LR boluses, again with good response.
It was the impression of the treating attending oncologist that the patient's presentation and diarrhea was consistent with chemotherapy induced diarrhea rather than an infectious diarrhea.
For this reason, the patient was started on anti-motility agents including lomotil and questran.
The patient upon transfer to the floor had a rectal tube and foley in place.
The patient has not required fluid bolusing since trasnfer to the floor, but has been receiving constant IV hydration with NS with 20mEq KCl requiring electrolyte repletion q12hr.
As the patient has had a normal serum pH she has not been receiving oral or IV bicarbonate but continues to receive hydration and volume repletion with NS at 125 to 175 cc/hr.
As the patient continues to have significant GI output, she will require ongoing hydration and additionally should receive electrolyte panels with repletion q12hrs until no longer needed.
In an attempt to decrease the patient's GI output, in addition to lomotil and questran which were initiated on admission, the patient has serially been given Kaopectate and the day prior to discharge was started on Octreotide and Metamucil to help bulk her very liquidy green stool.
The patient has now been afebrile > 48 hours, and is currently receiving still cefepime 2gm IV q8hr, now Day 8 (started [**2118-9-29**]) and Flagyl which was initiated in place of Vancomycin (now Day 4, initiated [**2118-10-3**]).
As the patient has been afebrile for > 48 hours consideration may be made towards discontinuing these medications but will be left to the discretion of the receiving hospital.
DVT - The patient on admission was being treated with 2.5mg po qhs of coumadin qhs for known DVT diagnosed in 08-[**2117**].
However, as above, given reversal of somnolence with volume rescucitation alone, an LP was not performed.
The patient's coumadin was held throughout her stay as she continued to have a supratherapeutic INR without coumadin, thought likely to be secondary to her poor PO intake as well as extinguishing gut flora with antibiotics.
The patient in error however was given a dose of 2.5mg coumadin x1 despite a holding order the following day.
As the patient's INR was greater than 5, but without any evidence of any ongoing bleeding, the patient's coumadin continues to be held and an addiitional 2.5mg PO Vitamin K was administered.
Of additional note, the patient has been noted previously and again this am to have occasional schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
The patient should continue to have her INR carefully monitored at the receiving hospital with consideration towards additional Vitamin K SC/IV for reversal of INR > 5.0 or FFP with any signs of bleeding.
Upon transfer to the receiving hospital, plans will need to continue to be initiated towards port removal or alternatively attempts could be made to have an attempted snare by interventional radiology for removal of a fibrin sheath if present.
Pancreatic Ca: As discussed in H+P, the patient is currently s/p distal pancreatectomy, left adrenal/nephrectomy, ometectomy treated additionally with XRT and Xeloda, follwed by gemcitabine/cisplatin, and most recently treated with xeloda/irinotecan s/p two 3-week cycles.
Alternatively, patient could additioanlly receive FOLFOX or taxotere as well.
The patient is being discharged to receiving hospital currently with plans towards continuing management of diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities as outlined above and will continue treatment planning with regards to her pancreatic Ca with her oncologist.
HTN - Given patient's admission for hypotension, her outpatient regimen of propranolol was held during her hospital course.
Upon resolution of large GI output and decreased need for IV volume sresuscitation, consideration could be made towards reinitiating patient's antihypertesnive regimen.
FEN- patient was kept on a low fat, lactose free BRAT diet with supplemental pancrease given.
