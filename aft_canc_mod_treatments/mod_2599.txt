No groin hematoma EXTR: palpable femoral pulses bilaterally, right popliteal palpable; left mid-calf extremity with some mild phlebitis in elevation and with ACE bandages in place.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#0.
There was some concern for left lower extremity phlebitis by HOD#[**2-19**] and the patient continued leg elevation with ACE bandages, although NSAIDs were avoided given his on-going renal concerns.
His beta-blocker dosing was titrated to a HR < 110 and 2U of packed red blood cells were administered on POD#[**2-19**].
On discharge, he had no cardiac issues, his blood pressure had normalized with his beta-blocker, and his home Coumadin was continued for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient was continued on Plavix in the post-op period for the placement of the left anterior tibial stent.
Supplemental oxygen was weaned on POD#1.
GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following their procedure and transitioned to sips and a clear liquid diet on POD#[**1-18**].
The patient was transitioned to a regular diet on POD#3 and IV fluids were discontinued once adequate PO intake was established.
HEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was trended closely and he was transfused 2 units of packed red cells over the course of HOD#[**2-20**] which was attributed to demand ischemia.
He was continued on Coumadin in the post-op period given his need for anticoagulation related to atrial fibrillation.
Antibiotics were not required in the post-op period.
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin sliding scale.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on heparin 5000 units SQ TID for DVT/PE prophylaxis and encouraged to ambulate immediately post-op.
GI prophylaxis was sustained with Protonix/Famotidine.
He was discharged with VNA services given his peritoneal dialysis and LLE dressing changes for his phlebitis.
