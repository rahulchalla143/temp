2) Proper placement of the NG tube.
Respiratory failure - etiology was multifactorial, due to a multifocal pneumonia, RSV bronchiolitis, and myasthenia crisis.
He was therefore treated with a 5-day course of ribavirin, as well as Synagis.
Further, due to his neutropenia, pt was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime as febrile/neutropenic, doxycycline for atypicals, and vanco for possibility of MRSA)for his presumed multifocal pneumonia.
Pt was intubated in the ED and ventilated; Over the first 2 weeks of his hospitalization, as the above treatments proceeded, pt required decreasing amounts of ventilatory support.
Eventually, his mental status (as detailed below) and ability to manage secretions were thought to be the major impediments to extubation, he had a trach placed on [**2191-3-20**].
He did well for a few days off any ventilatory support, and then on [**2191-3-28**] became hypotensive and went into hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Mental status - After propofol was weaned, pt did not clear his mental status as predicted: he had intact brainstem function but could not follow commands and did not move his extremities spontaneously.
While pt was receiving IVIG and his secretions were increased, this was lowered to 40mg po tid, and then uptitrated to 60mg po tid with resolution of these symptoms, after the IVIG was completed.
He was maintained on the pyrdidostigmine throughout his course and it was felt the myasthenia contributed to his poor respiratory status.
Pt was therefore placed on vancomycin for a 2 week course.
Pt's sputum cultures did not grow any bacteria; however, repeated nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for RSV antigen and he was treated with ribavirin and palivizumab x 2.
He was treated with acyclovir for his HSV infection as he had oral ulcers.
He was covered with meropenum for possible VAP on [**2191-3-28**].
He was placed on stress dose steroids, which ere weaned to his outpatient prednisone dose.
He did require transfusions of platelets and PRBC.
FEN - Pt was maintained on tube feeds.
He had increased insensible losses, particularly during the time of ribavirin treatment due to the tent in place, as well as in the context of his fevers.
In addition, pt was maintained with tight glycemic control (goal <120) with fingersticks four times daily and an inuslin sliding scale.
He was made comfort measures only and passed away comfortably with his family at his side on [**2191-3-28**].
