On [**2179-10-28**] after the pulmonary embolism was noted, the patient was started on heparin GTT and monitored with serial PT and PTT checks for treatment for pulmonary embolism.
The patient was tried to be weaned off the vent but was unable to secondary to desaturations.
On [**2179-10-30**] Levaquin was restarted after a sputum culture sent when the patient spiked a temperature to 101.
On [**2179-11-1**] secondary to large doses of heparin being used to control the patient's PTT, heparin drip was turned off and argatroban was started with a goal PTT of 50 to 70 and were monitored q.6h..
Hydralazine, Lopressor IV, enalapril IV and labetalol drip were used to control blood pressure; goal of 150 cc.
Pulmonary toilet was maintained, and sputum continued to drain when the patient was turned from side-to-side.
Over the course of the next 10 days the patient's respiratory status waxed and waned with pulmonary edema and rounds of Lasix IV were used to control this; and eventually Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Physical therapy was consulted on [**2179-11-2**]; and based on weightbearing status as above started therapy and followed the patient for remainder of course; eventually getting the patient to ambulate using a walker with an arm rail.
The patient was started on Coumadin 5 mg initially and INRs were checked.
The patient was maintained on telemetry for the first 5 days while on the floor.
