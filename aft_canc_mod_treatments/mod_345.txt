Operative findings included extensive intra-abdominal adhesions from his prior cholecystectomy.
A 5 French catheter was placed.
On [**12-2**], focal contrast extravasation from the right portal vein stump into the region of the JP drain was seen.
Successful exclusion of the right portal vein stump with placement of covered stents in the main and left portal vein was done with no further extravasation, however there was still persistent thrombus in the main and left portal veins after mechanical thrombectomy (Angioget).
Heparin drip was initiated and the patient was placed on empiric Ceftriaxone.
He was started on TPN for nutrition support.
Micafungin was started for moderate growth of yeast from a sputum specimen on [**12-7**].
The heparin was stopped and he was started on bivalarudin.
Lactulose and Rifaximin were started.
The patient underwent Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (brain dead donor)non- ABO compatible liver transplant.
Plasmaphereis was performed prior to OR.
Procedure consisted of piggyback, portal vein-to- portal vein anastomosis, common bile duct-to-common bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube, infrarenal iliac artery conduit to the common hepatic artery of the donor, and portal vein thrombectomy for portal vein/superior mesenteric vein/splenic vein thrombosis.
He was left with an open abdomen, was transferrred back to the SICU intubated.
Liver biopsy results from [**12-28**] showed Zone three hepatocyte apoptosis/necrosis with focal drop-out, consistent with preservation/reperfusion injury.
Because of the previous peritoneal fluid VRE positive cultures the patient had been on daptomycin, had remained on the micafungin for the sputum yeast and had additionally been on Zosyn.
He received 19 days of linezolid and then per ID recommendations he was switched to Tigecycline because on [**1-13**] he underwent a technically successful aspiration/drainage of a complex intraperitoneal fluid collection.
10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was placed and left to bag gravity drainage.
On [**1-9**] he had drainage of a non-infected pleural effusion.
Cholangiogram revealed a tight curve/loop in the mid common bile duct, with possible evidence of a subtle stricture just above this curve with mild upstream biliary dilation, An 8cm by 10Fr biliary stent was placed across the mid-CBD.
Coumadin was started on [**1-19**] for h/o portal vein thrombus/HIT+ and adjusted daily.
A post pyloric feeding tube was in place and he has been receiving tube feeds.
The patient had multiple speech and swallow evaluations including video swallow that demonstrated aspiration.
He remained NPO with meds given as suspesions via the feeding tube.
He was on strict aspiration precautions.
Intensive speech therapy was recommended for rehab.
Psychiatry evaluated and recommended risperdal.
Wound measures 22cm x 9cm x 2cm.
On [**1-22**] thyroid function tests were sent (TSH 13, T4 3.0) , he was found to be hypothyroid and was started on Levoxyl.
Intermittent HD was performed and on [**1-28**] had successful uncomplicated placement of a 15.5 French x 23 cm tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis catheter via right internal jugular venous access with the tip of the catheter terminating in the right atrium ready for use.
No heparin was used during HD for line flushes (HIT +).
The xray done at the time of the line placement was concerning for increased bilateral pleural effusions.
ID followed throughout and recommended a 4-week course of therapy, which changed to tigecycline, from the day of the first negative blood culture for VRE ([**1-16**]) and an indefinite course of fluconazole given his many anastomoses and high likelihood of recurrence.
Imodium was started twice daily.
He is currently on a prednisone taper per transplant clinic guidelines.
Patient remains on coumadin therapy.
