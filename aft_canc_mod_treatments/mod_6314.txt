Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate ([**Location **]) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc.
If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin prior to your injury, you may safely resume taking this once cleared by your Neurosurgeon.

Continue Dilantin 100mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days then discontinue.
You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam) as well, you will not require blood work monitoring.
