Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: (-)Diabetes, (-)Dyslipidemia, (+)Hypertension .
Other Past History: - Chronic atrial fibrillation - [**Last Name (un) 51827**] type apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Tricuspid valve prolapse with severe regurgitation and RV volume overload - Hypertension - CLL - diagnosed [**2137**], CT C/A/P ([**2-/2138**]) was negative for enlarging lymphadenopathy.
- BPH s/p TURP - shoulder surgery repair ligament - bilateral total hip replacements  Social History: Married.
1+ DP pulses.
Visualization of the tibial veins was difficult due to leg swelling.
Incidental note is made of a right groin node measuring 2.4 cm.
There is a small subcentimeter lower pole cyst in the right kidney and a 1.2 x 1.5 cm parapelvic cyst in the left kidney with a single thin septation.
Having presented to clinic with volume overload the week prior to admission, patient's torsemide was increased to 40mg daily, and his spironolactone was discontinued.
Patient was started on furosemide drip on admission at 20mg/hr with metolazone 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to which he diuresed well.
He was placed on 1L fluid restriction per day.
Furosemide drip was gradually increased to 40mg/hr with metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] with improvement in lower extremity and scrotal edema, though patient persisted with thigh and sacral edema.
Patient had successful CVVH and was near euvolemic upon discharge back to the floor where torsemide and metolazone was tried for diuresis.
Patient subsequently spiked a fever [**5-12**] to 102 (see below) and was transferred back to the CCU.
Unfortunately, the patient was unable to sustain blood pressures high enough for CVVH, and so was maintained on a levophed drip much of the time to assist with CVVH.
Patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring levophed pressor support.
Pressors were weaned off [**5-14**].
The patient was maintained on nafcillin as per ID recommendations throughout his stay.
Hyponatremia - Hypervolemic hyponatremia fluctuated in the setting of diuresis with a nadir of 125.
He had been subtherapeutic on warfarin because his warfarin dosing had been reduced previously.
The primary team attempted to restart the patient's warfarin, however in the setting of uremia and anticoagulation, the pt began to bleed from puncture sites and instrumentation sites after a tunneled line was placed.
The patient remained afebrile for his last two weeks, and a systematic approach was taken to identify the source, however this was unsuccessful.
His symptoms were controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.
Anemia - Hematocrit remained stable.
In the setting of bleed after procedure, and in the setting of longstanding anemia, the patient was transfused with pRBCs to maintain a Hct of ~29%.
BPH, s/p TURP - Patient has frequency of urination for at least a couple of years.
Was started on tamsulosin the week prior to admission at cardiology clinic appointment but did not notice subjective improvement, likely in setting of acute renal failure and decreased urine output overall.
Tamsulosin was discontinued per outpatient cardiologist.
# Left leg Varicosity Patient had left leg varicosity with uncontrollable bleeding during last hospitalization with stitch placed in his wound by Vascular Surgery with successful hemostasis.
Vascular surgery removed stitch on admission.
Venous duplex ultrasound was done to look for reflux, showing no evidence of proximal DVT in lower extremities, though nonocclusive tibial vein thrombosis could not be ruled out.
Gout - Allopurinol was held on admission in setting of acute renal failure.
Medications on Admission: Warfarin 1 mg p.o.
daily torsemide 40 mg p.o.
daily (dose had just been increased week prior to admission) metoprolol succinate 25 mg p.o.
daily allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily (STOPPED LAST WEEK, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**]: spironolactone 12.5 mg p.o.
