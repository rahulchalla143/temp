Initial concern was for meningitis given presentation and risk factors.
He was started vanc and ceftriaxone for empiric coverage.
This raised concern for TB meningitis given cranial nerve palsy, negative CSF cultures, and risk factors (HIV, latent TB- untreated, etc).
This was discussed with ID and they recommended deferred treating given atypical appearance on MRI.
Discussed patient with our attending and initiated empiric treatment for TB meningitis given high mortality for untreated TB.
While in the MICU, he was continued on antibiotics despite negative cultures.
Given transaminitis and elevated t-bili, TB medications were discontinued per Liver team recs.
He was restarted on TB medications given negative work-up to date.
Patient was maintained on IV fluids and tube feeds.
Patient thought to have mucus-plugged leading to acute desaturations requiring MICU transfers.
Patient started on salt tabs and fluid restricted to 1L per day.
He was given lactulose regularly given concern for hepatic encephatology.
TB medications were resumed after remainder of work-up was negative without another bump in LFTs.
