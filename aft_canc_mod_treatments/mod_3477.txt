Thoracotomy changes are seen on the left.
[**2109-11-13**]:  Status post pneumonectomy with two round areas of opacity in the left hemithorax, which may represent loculated fluid collections and/or postoperative hematoma.
PICC: [**2109-11-18**] Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
Respiratory: He required aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and chest PT to Right lung to maintain oxygen saturations in the high 90's.
He eventually weaned off oxygen with saturations 97% on Room air.
Chest-tube was removed on POD 1.
Cardiac: He required a small amount of pressures for hypotension.
On POD4 he had an episode or rapid afibrillation and hypotension after lopressor & diltiazem IV.
He was transferred back to the TSICU converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone and beta-blocker.
His amiodarone was titrated to maintance dose and beta-blocker changed to toprol daily.
His potassium level was also elevated to 6.6 and was normalized with insulin, and Kayexalate.
The foley was removed  Incision: Left thoracotomy site clean  Pain: Epidural managed by the acute pain service.
