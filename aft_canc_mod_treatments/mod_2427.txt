HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient underwent a routine PAP smear which revealed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and subsequently underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure on [**2189-6-1**].
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy for stage IA2 adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Current medications included Triphasil.
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:  Vaginal deliveries times two.
Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.5, pulse was 85 to 115, blood pressure was 110/55, oxygen saturation was 95% to 100% on 3 liters via nasal cannula.
The patient complained of having hot flashes on hospital day three and was subsequently started on Premarin p.o.
It was noted that the patient was requiring oxygen via nasal cannula.
This was done as the patient was requiring oxygen as previously mentioned, and the x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis with patchy air space consolidation.
On postoperative day four, secondary to the patient's oxygen requirements and inability to wean off of supplemental oxygen, and an arterial blood gas that was 7.48/38/42/32/6, there was great concern that rather than this being venous that the patient might in fact be in respiratory compromise.
The patient was immediately started on a heparin drip for a goal of PTT of 60 to 100.
The patient was then started on Coumadin on [**2189-7-17**] to maintain anticoagulation.
The heparin drip and Coumadin were discontinued.
The patient was assessed to have an abdominal bleed, and an immediate transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells was started.
With the suspicion of hemoperitoneum, the patient was scheduled to have re-exploration for hemoperitoneum.
The patient underwent the procedure on [**2189-7-22**] for evacuation of 3 liters of hemoperitoneum.
The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and 1 unit postoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit.
Additionally, the patient had been started on oxacillin for her cellulitis.
The patient had tolerated the procedure well and convalesced appropriately.
The patient's Coumadin was restarted, and her inferior vena cava filter was discontinued on [**2189-7-30**].
The patient's Coumadin dose was adjusted between 2.5 and 7.5 to try and obtain an INR between 1.8 and 2.2.
The patient was started on ceftazidime.
Additionally, the patient had been started on oxacillin for wound cellulitis.
On [**2189-7-26**], the patient's Flagyl was discontinued, and the subsequent day the other intravenous antibiotics were discontinued.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION: The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition during the course of her hospital stay after her surgery for the evacuation of hemoperitoneum.
The patient was weaned off her total parenteral nutrition on [**8-1**] until the remainder of her course.
The patient tolerated her oral intake toward the end of her stay.
Intermittently, the patient's phosphate, magnesium, and potassium were repleted.
Status post radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymphadenectomy; complicated by pulmonary embolus and hemoperitoneum.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg p.o.
Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Tagamet 200 mg p.r.
Premarin 1.25 mg p.o.
