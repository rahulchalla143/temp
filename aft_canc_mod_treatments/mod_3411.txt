Admission Date:  [**2113-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-5-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Ancef  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8480**] Chief Complaint: Laryngeal cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, tracheal biopsy ([**5-15**]) Total Laryngectomy ([**5-23**])   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 56 year old male who presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center on [**5-8**] with stridor and respiratory distress.
Prior to presentation he had complained of 5 weeks of cough, shortness of breath, and a sore throat for which he had been treated with steroids and antibiotics without improvement.
He was therefore started at cefazolin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Past Medical History: 1. h/o sinus surgery 2.
Chest tube placed [**2076**], unknown reason 3.
FOE via tracheotomy tube reveals circumferential narrowing below tracheotomy tip, but patent trachea and clear view to carina with no obvious massess.
Neck: supple, no LAD, 8 portex in place CV: RRR Lungs: CTA b/l ABD: soft, NT, ND  Pertinent Results: .......RADIOLOGY STUDIES: ...[**5-14**] CT TRACHEA FINDINGS: A tracheostomy tube is present, with tip terminating within the anterior tracheal lumen above the level of the aortic arch.
Multiplanar and 3D images confirm the presence of an intraluminal mass and adjacent luminal narrowing as well as circumferential thickening of the airway.
Tracheostomy in place.
...[**5-15**] BRONCHOSCOPY DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was consented and topical lidocaine was given in the oropharynx in the usual fashion.
The vocal cords were visible only on deep inspiration.
The bronchoscope was removed and then reinserted via the tracheostomy.
...[**5-18**] IVC FILTER PLACEMENT: PROCEDURE: Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 380**] performed the procedure.
Prior to cannulation of the femoral vein, the femoral artery was entered with hemostasis achieved by manual compression.
The large draining vein in the left lower IVC was later cannulated with a C1 Cobra catheter with contrast injection demonstrating this to be a prominent lumbar vein.
ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was achieved via the administration of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed given in divided doses throughout the intraservice time of 55 minutes.
.......PATHOLOGY SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: CERVICAL ENDOBRONCHIAL AND PROXIMAL TRACHEA ENDOBRONCHIAL BXS (2).
B Proximal trachea, endobronchial biopsy: Respiratory mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation and focal squamous metaplasia with mild to moderate atypia.
Larynx, laryngectomy (E-AG):         A. Carcinoma, most consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma with focal squamous differentiation, larynx.
D. Skin and trachea with changes consistent with tracheostomy site.
Immunohistochemical stains performed on a section of tumor show the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1:AE3/CAM 5.2), smooth muscle actin, calponin, and p63.
On arrival he was continued on the cefazolin for presumed pneumonia based on MSSA in a BAL.
He was immediately started on a heparin drip with a goal PTT between 60 and 80 for the pulmonary embolus.
An ENT consult was obtained and a total laryngectomy was recommended for T4Nx laryngeal cancer, suspiscious for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
In preperation for the procedure, b/l lower extremetiy ultrasounds were done to search for a cause for the pulmonary embolus.
Therefore, an IVC filter was placed by interventional radiology in anticipation of being off anticoagulation for several days during the immediate postoperative period.
The heparin drip was stopped 6 hours prior to the procedure and restarted afterwards.
He tolerated this procedure well, for details please see the operative report.
No further testing was recommended, however they recommended restarted the heparin drip postoperatively once surgically safe and to discharge him on lovenox.
Perioperative beta-blockers were not recommended.
He was therefore transferred to the ENT service and on [**5-23**] he underwent a total laryngectomy with modified left neck dissection.
His heparin drip was stopped 6 hours prior to the procedure.
He tolerated the procedure well and was extubated, for details please see the operative report.
He was kept NPO with a dilaudid pca for pain, and clindamycin and levofloxacin for perioperative prophylaxis.
He was transferred out of the ICU on POD2 and started on tube feeds through a dobhoff tube placed intraoperatively.
On POD3 the heparin drip was restarted and the pain service was consulted for continuing pain not controlled by the PCA.
They intially recommended adding neurontin and later recommended adding a fentanyl patch for continued pain.
He was given IV lopressor x 2 with no effect and a cardiology consult was obtained.
He was then given IV diltiazem and became hypotensive with a SBP of 70.
He was transferred to the ICU where he was started on an amiodarone gtt and given several fluid boluses with good blood pressure response.
He continue to do well until POD8 when developed nausea and emesis, possibly related to the amiodarone which was therefore stopped.
However, they did recommend [**5-19**] weeks of treatment with a beta-blocker.
He was started on 25mg lopressor [**Hospital1 **] which he tolerated well without any signs of hypotension.
His potassium level ranged from 3.6-3.8 requiring potassium supplementation daily.
He will therefore be discharged home with potassium supplements.
He was therefore started on a clear liquid diet which was slowly advanced.
Prior to discharge he was transitioned from IV heparin to lovenox 80mg subcutaneous injections [**Hospital1 **].
He will be visited at home by a VNA for respiratory care and assistance with tracheal stoma care.
The laryngectomy tube will be left in place for 1 month postoperatively to prevent narrowing of the stoma.
The stoma stitches and staples were removed prior to discharge.
Enoxaparin 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: Eighty (80) mg Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).
