Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo F w/history of throat cancer now admitted after falling at home, with associated rhabdomyolysis and renal failure.
Oncology felt that due to her poor performance status, she would not be a candidate currently for treatment until her performance status improved.
A palliative care consult was placed, and patient was started on sublingual morphine and lorazepam for comfort and pain.
She will benefit from radiation therapy to her brain as well, to be performed as an outpatient if she chooses to proceed.
She was maintained on her inhalers, and will leave the hospital on oxygen as needed.
She was also given IV diuretics as needed, with minimal improvement in her oxygenation.
She was initially started on dilantin and was evaluated by neurosurgery and neurooncology, and was felt not to need antiepileptics.
The dilantin was subsequently discontinued.
For the patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, his initial CK and LDH were elevated, with blood on UA, without RBCs.
She was given aggressive IVF hydration with improvement in her creatinine.
She was started on vancomycin, which was discontinued once final cultures returned.
