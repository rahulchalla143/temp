ABDOMEN: soft, large echymossis on LLQ, G tube with moderate amount of erythema surrounding it.
Accordingly, she was treated for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn.
She stayed in house, receiving IV abx and XRT.
While in hospital, the patient was restarted on tube feeds to ensure proper nutrition and avoid the burden that PO was placing on the friable mucosa of the pharynx in the field of the XRT.
Accordingly, we asked consultants from both surgery and then GI to evaluate the g tube.
Given how new it was and the fact that it was not placed by a [**Hospital1 18**] practioner, the goals of gtube management shifted to wound care.
The patient received 1.6L IVF and was ordered for 2 units PRBC prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Patient was sent for surgery where the bleeding artery was oversewn and the G-tube was replaced and re-sited with another G-tube.
Nevertheless, an EKG was ordered that was improved when compared to the admission EKG and a unit of blood was transfused over three hours.
The patient was continued on her antibiotic course for HAP and was gently diuresed with fluid goal of -500 to -1L.
During the night, the patient intermittently required increased oxygen for saturations down to 88%- this was thought to be related to inadequate clearing of oropharyngeal mucus plugs with a component of sleep apnea.
The patient's mental status improved, but the patient had possible left sided hypesthesia and mild left upper extremity motor weakness.
ASA was restarted but her plavix was held in light of the patient's recent GI bleed.
She presents with delirium for Pneumonia, CHF, and GI bleed .
GI bleed - after the operative repair she is stable.
Continue tube feeding.
Arterial Disease - Patient should remain on Aspirin and Clopidogrel.
We used a short course of lasix to improve the balance .
We recommend regular nebulizer treatments, oral care and suctioning.
