You were seen several times by the psychiatry team who felt that the best step for your after discharge from the hospital was to go to a geriatric psychiatric facility so that your medications can be properly dosed before you are ready to return home.
Your medications were adjusted in case they were contributing to this, and your urinary retention was improving at the time of discharge.
The following changes were made to your medications: - STOP Warfarin (Coumadin) - STOP Amitriptyline - STOP Ativan - STOP Tramadol - STOP Tylenol #3 - START Seroquel twice a day as needed for anxiety or insomnia (in addition to your normal nighttime seroquel dose) - START Protonix 40 mg twice a day - Your medications will be further adjusted at your geriatric psychiatric facility.
