Abdominal imaging first with x-rays showed some distended bowel pattern and temperature curve increase to 101 range.
Nasogastric tube was placed given that it was believed that she was experiencing a bowel obstruction.
She had pretty mild output but her abdominal x-rays never improved, and the computerized tomography scan showed dilated bowel, so on [**2-21**], after discussion with the family and the Transplant Team, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy for small bowel obstruction unresolving.

However, with blood products and resuscitation she improved.
A family meeting was set up between the Transplant Surgery, attending staff and the patient's family and they desired to proceed full course with further chemotherapy as well as hyperalimentation as necessary with the plans of getting Mrs. [**Known lastname 1557**] to a point where she would be safe to go home and continue treatment.
