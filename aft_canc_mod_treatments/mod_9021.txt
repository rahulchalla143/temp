The TPN was restarted and he underwent colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, both of which showed nonspecific friability and ulcerations with erythematous areas.
The patient remained stable, however, on [**2-15**], it was found on physical examination that his midline abdominal wound had again dehisced with exposed bowel and a serosal tear representing a new small-bowel fistula.
The ICU course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, high blood sugars requiring an insulin drip.
The perioperative antibiotics had been discontinued the day before and he was restarted on Ceftriaxone at that time.
The patient continued to require pressors and developed sepsis.
Antibiotics were changed from Ceftriaxone to Cipro.
He was then placed on IV Cipro.
On postoperative day #6, he was noted to have necrosis along the incision line and wound breakdown.
The staples were removed and the wound debrided.
He was started on wet-to-dry dressing changes.
He continued to be intubated, sedated, on pressors, TPN and Somatostatin.
Pressors were weaned on postoperative day #8 and on postoperative day #9, he was extubated without problems.
[**Name (NI) **] remained in the ICU, however, for further management secondary to altered mental status, which slowly improved.
The patient was given an aspirin, additional Lopressor, and started on oxygen.
However, he continued to complain of intermittent abdominal distention and fullness, limiting his p.o.
He was continued on the TPN for further nutritional support.
Based on the further recommendations from the Department of Psychiatry, he was maintained on Remeron and Ritalin to help manage his depression and attentiveness.
He is not requiring any pain medication at this time.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  As per above, after a prolonged course of the NPO with intermittent abdominal pain, distention, the patient is able to tolerate some PO intake, which is limited by a feeling of early satiety and intermittent distention, relieved by bowel movements.
He continues on a diet, ad lib with TPN for full nutritional support.
He was, thereby, started on Doxycycline 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
He did, however, have an Enterococcus UTI for which he was treated with Ampicillin.
He has also had difficulty with urinary retention requiring multiple Foley catheter insertions.
He was started on Flomax on which he continues at this time.
HEMATOLOGY:  Over the course of his ICU stay, he required several transfusions postoperatively.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient initially required an insulin drip immediately postoperative for management of high blood glucose while on TPN.
He has been stabilized on a regimen of 70 units of insulin in his TPN with fingersticks in the low to mid 100s.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Initially, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was afebrile, however, he developed pneumonia postoperatively, growing Klebsiella oxytoca and gram-positive bacteria, further identified as coagulase-positive staph.
He was treated with a full course of antibiotics for this, including Ceftriaxone and Ciprofloxacin.
However, he continued to have an elevated white blood cell and low-grade temperatures.
Urine culture, from [**3-8**], grew Enterococcus and yeast, for which she was treated with a full course of Ampicillin.
WOUND:  After the patient's initial fistula closed with development of the new fistula, as stated above, postoperatively the incision underwent extensive flap necrosis and breakdown.
He is able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker and one person.
He is currently stable with a volume of 1600 cc per day; 75 gram per day of amino acids; 320 grams per day of dextrose and 50 grams per day of fat with an additional 600 units of heparin; 70 units of insulin and 15 mg of zinc.
dressing changes to the anterior abdominal wound with moist saline gauze and DuoDerm hydrophilic gel.
He is to receive physical therapy for ambulation.
