The patient had undergone an L4-S1 laminectomy and left epidural tumor removal on [**2147-7-17**].
He had two small openings, approximately 2-3 cm, with no fluctuants and no drainage currently reported.
He was placed on a Neo-Synephrine drip.
He was seen by Infectious Disease who recommended starting Vancomycin and Ceftazidime for antibiotic coverage.
He was also seen by the Cardiology Service for episodes of bradycardia and sinus pauses, and it was felt that the patient would eventually need a pacemaker placement; however, due to infection, this would have to be delayed until infection cleared.
He was also seen by the Plastic Surgery Service who recommended a flap closure of his wound.
On [**2147-9-4**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Plastic Surgery for a flap wound closure of his lumbar incision.
His flap incision was well perfused and clean, dry, and intact.
He did have a JP drain in place.
This was pan-cultured, and he was started on Ciprofloxacin for added coverage.
Currently the patient is on Vancomycin 1 g IV q.12 hours for a total of six weeks.
He had a PICC line placed postoperatively which showed good placement after a chest x-ray confirmed placement.
His JP drain continues to be in place draining anywhere from 5-30 cc a shift.
He was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and felt to require acute rehabilitation due to the fact that he is going to need cardiac telemetry due to his sinus pauses.
EP fellow again evaluated the patient and felt that the patient was safe to be transferred to rehabilitation with telemetry and will follow-up postinfection treatment for possible pacemaker placement.
