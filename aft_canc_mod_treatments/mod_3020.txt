Admission Date:  [**2151-5-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: s/p PVI for refractory atrial fibrillation with hypotension and bradycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation ([**2151-5-11**])   History of Present Illness: 66 year old male with hx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2148**] s/p numerous failed chemical and electrical cardioversions presents with fatigue.
He has been cardioverted a total of 3 times, last on [**3-12**], and he has been on amiodarone since [**8-25**] (previously on sotalol and dronedarone).
Attempts to wean off dopamine were unsuccessful.
He normally takes 5mg of Coumadin on Mondays, 2.5mg all other days of the week.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  [**2147**] cardiac catheterization (NEBH): mild CAD, Normal LVEF -PACING/ICD: 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Atrial fibrillation diagnosed initially in [**2148**] s/p cardioversion in [**2148-12-16**], treated with sotalol with subsequent recurrence.
- Prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy ([**2143-8-16**]) - ?
Sleep apnea (has not had sleep study yet) - Kidney stone - Resection of basal skin cancers - Appendectomy   Social History: Patient is married with three children.
Vitiligo over hands and neck PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  On discharge: unchanged, vital signs stable  Pertinent Results: On admission:  [**2151-5-11**] 07:10AM BLOOD WBC-6.5 RBC-4.50* Hgb-16.1 Hct-45.1 MCV-100* MCH-35.7* MCHC-35.6* RDW-13.1 Plt Ct-215 [**2151-5-11**] 07:10AM BLOOD PT-30.0* INR(PT)-2.9* [**2151-5-11**] 07:10AM BLOOD Glucose-128* UreaN-22* Creat-1.0 Na-141 K-4.2 Cl-102 HCO3-27 AnGap-16  MICROBIOLOGY: none  IMAGING: none  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 11312**] underwent pulmonary vein isolation, electrical cardioversion, and right atrial flutter ablation yesterday.
He was hypotensive upon anesthesia induction and required mild pressor support with dopamine during the procedure.
Upon extubation his sinus rate improved to 60, but needed continued pressor support.
In the CCU, he was weaned off dopamine and his systolic blood pressures were steady off dopamine.
# Hypotension s/p PVI: After PVI procedure, patient became bradycardic and hypotensive in the PACU, requiring pressor support with dopamine.
# RHYTHM / bradycardia s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation: The patient had bradycardia to the 50s-60s, with some junctional escapes.
Bradycardia is not a common occurrence s/p PVI, as we are generally more concerned about more mechanical consequences such as tamponade or pulmonary vein stenosis, rather than electrical disturbances that may cause a bradyarrythmia.
Though is some debate and a paucity of data about chronic anticoagulation s/p PVI, most agree to continue anticoagulation based on CHADS2 score (=1).
He will continue on warfarin + ASA for anticoagulation, long-term course to be decided as outpatient possibly with argatoban, to be discussed with PCP.
Current medication regimen is actually quite appropriate for systolic HF, even though this is a recent finding.
He has been on a statin for control of his hyperlipidemia and was continued on this during his hospitalization.
