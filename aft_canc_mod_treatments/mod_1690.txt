At this point, a discussion with the family was initiated with the presence of medical oncology, interventional pulmonology and critical care.
As there were no more therapeutic options available from an oncologic or airway standpoint, all were in agreement that it would be in the best interest for the patient to pursue a nonaggressive approach.
Therefore, the patient was made comfort measures only, and was started on a Morphine drip.
