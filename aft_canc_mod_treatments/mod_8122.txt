The pain is not worsened by walking but is alleviated by pain medication and rest and she denies symptoms of claudication, leg swelling, or rest pain in the past.
She was started on a heparin drip (with bolus) and transferred here for further management.
While here, she was evaluated by vascular surgery and taken to the OR for RLE CFA/[**Doctor Last Name **] thrombectomy, fasciotomy and aortic stent placement.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is in pain from the groin site where the procedure took place earlier.

Large left partially loculated pleural effusion with a Pleurx catheter in place and little aeration of the visualized left lobe.
Note:  The carcinoma is positive for CK7, mammoglobin, and very focally for progesterone receptor and negative for CK20, TTF-1, GCDFP and estrogen receptor.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF PATIENT SUMMARY: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 y/o lady with metastatic breast cancer who presented with cold right foot, now s/p intervention for arterial thrombus who was found to have pericardial effusion with tamponade for which she is s/p pericardiocentesis.
patient is s/p pericardiocentesis with no current evidence of tamponade.
The patient had pericardial drain removed on [**2154-5-19**].
Repeat TTE after removal of drain, performed on [**2154-5-20**], demonstrated no significant increase in pericardial fluid.
A pericardial drain was placed, and subsequently removed once drainage had decreased and patient was stable on anticoagulation.
Left pleural effusion: s/p pleurx [**5-15**] (also drained 1L on [**5-17**]).
We appreciated Thoracic Surgery recs.
Right arterial thrombus: She is now s/p R groin/[**Doctor Last Name **] cutdown, aortic stent, RLE thrombectomy, and 4 compartment fasciotomies.
Her malignancy makes her hypercoagulable, but the fact that she developed an arterial thrombus while on Lovenox is difficult.
Vascular surgery will decide upon outpatient anticoagulation regimen.
We continued patient on heparin gtt (goal PTT 60-80 per Vascular) while on the CCU service.
Pain control was achieved with tylenol, dilaudid IV.
We appreciated Vascular surgery recommendations while the patient was on the CCU service.
She was initially anticoagulated with a heparin drip, but eventually discharged on 80mg lovenox [**Hospital1 **], and a factor Xa level was checked after the second dose to ensure that she was therapeutic.
Hypotension: hypotension periodically to SBP 70s-80s, fluid responsive.
Pain meds might have a very minimal contribution as well.
No e/o bleeding (no bloody or melenic bowel movements, no overt bleeding from surgical wound) aside from small amount of bloody drainage from pericardial drain.
Received 2 units of pRBCs on [**2154-5-19**].
Recent pulmonary embolism: Was on a heparin drip throughout CCU stay.
She was on Lovenox (100mg daily) as an outpatient, but she had a LE arterial thrombus on Lovenox (daily dosing).
Following discussion between hem/onc and vascular surgery, it was decided to start her on [**Hospital1 **] 80mg lovenox for anticoagulation, given the proven efficacy of lovenox over warfarin in cancer-associated thrombosis.
Metastatic to bone, liver, stomach, and likely lung - recurrent left sided pleural effusions s/p repeated drainage and left pleural catheter placement [**5-15**].
Right sided PE one month ago.
She was eventually transferred to the OMED service and following discussion with outpatient oncologist [**Doctor First Name 391**] Khitrik-Palchuk, she was started on a new regimen on navelbine + trastuzumab.
-continue 80mg [**Hospital1 **] lovenox for anticoagulation.

A drain was placed to remove the fluid but it recurred so a pericardial window was cut into the lining of your heart to help the fluid drain.
You were then transferred to the oncology service for chemotherapy, and were started on navelbine and herceptin.
We increased your dose of lovenox to prevent you from getting further blood clots.
We made the following changes to your medications: STARTED: -Standing Acetaminophen for pain -Oxycodone for pain -Senna and colace to help you move your bowels  INCREASED Lovenox to 70mg twice daily.
DECREASED citalopram from 80mg to 40mg because there can be an interaction with your omeprazole.
(The two medications combined can cause irregularities in your heart rhythm).
