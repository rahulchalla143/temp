In the Emergency Department, the patient received Oxacillin, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.
She received Cardizem 5 mg intravenously with a decrease in her heart rate to the 70s and a decrease in her systolic blood pressure to 62.
The patient received normal saline boluses and a Dopamine drip was initiated.
The Dopamine drip was discontinued and her blood pressure correspondingly fell to 69 systolic.
At that point, Neo-Synephrine drip was started, which she tolerated well.
MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was maintained on Oxacillin and Levofloxacin which was eventually changed to Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
She continued to receive normal saline boluses and Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure which was subsequently weaned in several days after admission.
The patient continued to have episodes of atrial flutter requiring Diltiazem boluses intravenously as needed, however, she had a tendency to drop her blood pressure with this medication.
After successfully weaning the Neo-Synephrine, the patient had another episode of hypotension requiring reinitiation of Neo-Synephrine.
Her maintenance fluids were discontinued.
The patient's Theophylline was discontinued secondary to her continued episodes of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and this medication's likely erythrogenic potential.
Vancomycin 15.7.
Two separate blood cultures from [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated nutritionally variant Streptococcus sensitive to Clindamycin, Gentamicin, Penicillin and Vancomycin.
Status post right total knee replacement [**2191-4-25**], secondary to osteoarthritis.
Vancomycin one gram intravenous q12hours.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Mirtazapine 15 mg p.o.
Ipratropium Bromide four puffs four times a day.
Salmeterol two puffs twice a day.
Fluticasone Propionate 110 mcg two puffs twice a day.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q12hours.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers q6hours p.r.n.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 77 year old female with Strept variant bacteremia, endocarditis involving aortic valve, infectious source likely the right knee, who was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit after requiring short term use of pressors secondary to hypotension.
Her Medical Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by episodes of supraventricular tachycardia requiring intravenous Diltiazem.
The patient was transferred to the medical floor for continued intravenous antibiotic administration, treatment of her arrhythmia, and transition to an acute care rehabilitation facility.
She required pressors for several days, but was quickly weaned off this medication.
Her initial blood pressure support medication was Dopamine, however, her rhythm did not tolerate this as she went into supraventricular tachycardia.
The Dopamine was discontinued and she was initiated on Neo-Synephrine which she tolerated very well.
In the Intensive Care Unit, she required Diltiazem to be administered on three separate occasions.
When she arrived to the medical floor in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, 25 mg of intravenous Diltiazem was required to convert the patient into normal sinus rhythm.
Her blood pressure tolerated this medication well, she had lowest systolic blood pressure of 100 during this episode.
The patient remained on telemetry which demonstrated several more episodes of this supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient was initially on an ace inhibitor on admission, however this medication had been held secondary to her low blood pressure.
Captopril was initiated on [**2195-12-1**], and will continue to be titrated up as tolerated.
Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency Department on [**2195-11-24**], which demonstrated Streptococcus-nutritional variant, sensitivities as above.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was started on Oxacillin and Levofloxacin as well as Vancomycin.
This was changed to Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in the Intensive Care Unit.
Upon arrival to the medical floor, the patient was started on Gentamicin and Levofloxacin was discontinued at that time.
Upon return of the sensitivities for this organism, Vancomycin was changed to Penicillin.
The orthopedic service felt that the original knee tap was not indicative of the knee as the source of infection, however, they did recommend a longer course of antibiotics given the concern for the prosthetic joint.
Penicillin and Gentamicin were continued on the medical floor with a goal Gentamicin dosing and interval for synergism (trough goal less than 1.0, peak between 2.0 to 3.0).
The patient will require intravenous antibiotics for a total of six weeks of Gentamicin, last dose to be administered [**2195-12-12**].
The patient's last dose of Penicillin will be administered on [**2196-1-9**].
While on Gentamicin, she will require peak and trough levels until the goals are met and q.Monday, Wednesday, Friday creatinine determinations.
Two sets of blood cultures will be required two weeks after completing the antibiotics and the patient's knee will need to be reevaluated at that point.
She has been maintained on Metered dose inhalers including Atrovent and Serevent as well as Pulmicort.
Her inhalers were continued throughout the admission, however, the [**Last Name (un) **]-DUR was discontinued secondary to its erythrogenic potential.
While admitted, she has required supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than 93%.
Prior to discharge, her oxygen requirements had slightly increased from three liters per nasal cannula to four liters nasal cannula.
With each occurrence, she felt prompt relief after using her Atrovent and Albuterol MDI.
She received Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers during these episodes with a good effect.
The patient's hypoxia may be related to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and will require continued maintenance and rescue inhalers, nebulizers as needed.
She received one unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit to 30.0.
Hypotension, requiring pressors in the Intensive Care Unit.
Mirtazapine 15 mg p.o.
Salmeterol two puffs twice a day.
Fluticasone Propionate 110 mcg two puffs twice a day.
Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o.
Maalox 15 to 30 ml p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Albuterol nebulizer solution q6hours p.r.n.
Ipratropium Bromide nebulizer q6hours p.r.n.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q8hours.
Captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
Diltiazem 60 mg p.o.
Penicillin G Potassium 3 million units intravenously q4hours, last dose [**2196-1-9**].
Gentamicin 60 mg intravenously q12hours, last dose [**2195-12-12**].
The patient will require q.Monday, Wednesday, Friday creatinine levels and Gentamicin peak/trough levels.
The patient will also require weekly complete blood count and liver function tests while on Penicillin.
