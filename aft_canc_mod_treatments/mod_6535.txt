History of Present Illness: 42 yo man with history of depression and suicidal ideation, anxiety, history of hyperaldosteronism, poorly-controlled hypertension, type A dissection s/p emergent repair ([**11/2143**]), type B dissection extending to iliac arteries, now transferred from vascular surgery service for further management of malignant hypertension.
In summary, he was scheduled for an elective fenestration of his type B dissection and possible left renal artery stenting on [**4-14**].
He was on ACEi, BB at that time, but not on an aldosterone antagonist.
At that time it appears he underwent a secondary hypertension work-up with a PAC/PRA of 80 (16/0.2), VNA 1.7, serum metanephrine and normetanephrine of 282 and 608 respectively.
He was discharged on a regimen of amlodipine, labetalol, hydralazine, lisinopril, HCTZ, clonidine patch, and spironolactone.
He was subsequently followed by CT surgery with serial CT scans.
His initial post-op showed a 17 mm myolipoma in the right adrenal gland and a type B dissection extending from SCL to internal/external iliacs.
He states that prior to this admission, his wife had been helping him with his BP meds and that he has been compliant.
He denies any vision changes, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea.
Past Medical History: Type A aortic dissection s/p emergent repair ([**11/2143**]) Type B aortic dissection (SCL->ext/int iliacs; all major vessels originate from true lumen, left RA originates from both) Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Prior abdominal surgery s/p mesenteric biopsies Adrenal myolipoma Depression History of suicidal ideation  Social History: He currently lives at home with his wife.
Although there is no change in the mediastinal contours, complications related to prior aortic dissection and repair cannot be excluded and a CT of the chest should be obtained if there is clinical concern for such complications.
[**4-15**] CT ABD: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a right adrenal lesion measuring 1.8 cm x 1.7 cm, which is predominantly fatty in attenuation, with internal Hounsfield units of approximately -70 [**Doctor Last Name **].
Brief Hospital Course: A 42 yo man with history of malignant hypertension, type A aortic dissection s/p emergent repair in [**11/2143**], type B dissection, and depression admitted for hypertensive emergency requiring ICU stay.
He was taken to the cardiovascular ICU on admission, where he was started on nitro and labetalol drip.
This was switched to oral labetalol, HCTZ-triamterene, clonidine patch, lisinopril, and hydralazine; meds were than adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 130-150, which has been recommended by the vascular surgery service.
Per their recs, he was started on aldosterone antagonist therapy first with spironolactone then eplerenone to avoid gynecomastia.
At time of discharge, his antihypertensive regimen consists of clonidine patch, labetalol, eplerenone, and amlodipine at the doses listed later in the report.
He was started on a clonazepam, risperidone, and citalopram per their recommendations.
Aldosterone and renin levels were sent, although the utility of these tests is questionable given that he was on spironolactone at the time the labs were drawn.
He will continue on eplerenone for the time being, and will follow-up in endocrine clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] in early [**Month (only) **].
Vascular surgery did not feel endovascular intervention was necessary and recommended blood pressure control as above.
# Type B aortic dissection: On CT scan, there was evidence of aortic dissection, with dissection flap extending into the left renal artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
Vascular service deferred surgical intervention, and felt that blood pressure control with target SBP 130-150 was the preferred treatment.
