MR of head ([**10-28**]): Status post resection of posterior fossa extra-axial mass with blood products noted in the resection cavity and along the left perimesencephalic cistern.
MR of head ([**10-21**]) - before occipital cranieotomy): Status post ventriculostomy with associated postoperative changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient with hx of neurofibromatosis was electively admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**10-20**] for scheduled 3rd ventriculostomy to address posterior fossa tumor recently identified this past summer.
He underwent 3rd ventriculostomy per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-21**] and occipital craniectomy for posterior fossa tumor on [**10-27**] per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He tolerated both procedures well but had post-operative complication after the craniectomy with tongue swelling which delayed extubation.
Steroids were given post-operatively which also benefitted the tongue swelling.
Also, sutures from the occipital craniotomy removed prior to discharge.
