Hypodense areas now seen in left cerebellum may represent developing areas of infarction.
EEG [**2190-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG shows a fairly repetitive alternating pattern between what looks like a mild diffuse encephalopathy to more significant slowing perhaps related to the intermittent use of medication although it may also represent a combination of increased intracranial pressure and/or projected abnormalities.
Ventriculostomy catheter in right foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**], with minimal decrease in biventricular hemorrhage.
The ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged in position.
[**2190-2-5**]: CTA-IMPRESSION:  1.
Further evaluation with MR recommended on non-emergent basis.
A central venous catheter is noted within the SVC, but the tip is not identified secondary to dense contrast material.

Head CT shows SAH with IV extension.
Patient was then noted to have a narrow complex rhythm, intervention cardiology was called to the ER but no intervention was indicated at that time.
Post-angio his Head CT was stable, patient required frequent EVD flushes.
Patient was then placed on paralytics as he was overbreathing the vent and had abnormal ABGs.
A Heparin drip was initiated post-angio.
EVD flushed and TPA'd which did not help and a Nicardipine drip was initiated to bring down his pressure with no effect.
He was then sent to head CT emergently to reassess given his clinical picture and inability to get good exam due to paralysis.
His CT head showed increased IVH and worsening SAH so the Heparin drip was turned off.
He received a Dilantin 500 mg bolus for level of 7.4.
Once off paralytics the patient was following commands but no movement to his [**Month/Day (4) **] were noted.

His antibiotics were changed to provide double coverage for GNR to Cefepime and Cipro.
[**2-3**] CVP was 11 and was requiring fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure goals (SBP 180-200).
antibiotics were changed to flagyl per ICU recommendations.
Patient was also requiring boluses of neosenephrine after nimodipine was given.
Hypertonic saline was started for Na of 129.
He was started on bromocriptine for control of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
