On visiting Dr.[**Name (NI) 6444**] office on the 12th, the patient had copious clots irrigated from the patient's bladder via a Foley catheter that was placed at the appointment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes a 15 year history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chemical pleurodesis in [**2161**] for three spontaneous pneumothoraces secondary to a long history of smoking, and emphysema and blebs, bilateral inguinal hernia repair in [**2160**], left inguinal hernia reoperated in [**2162**], bilateral cataract surgery in the 70s.
MEDICATIONS:  Tambocor 100 mg by mouth every morning and 50 mg by mouth every evening, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth every morning, Diltiazem 240 mg by mouth every evening, Digoxin 250 mcg every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Flomax .4 mg every morning, Zestril 10 mg by mouth every morning.
Additional clots were irrigated from the patient's bladder, and he was started on continuous bladder irrigation.
He was transfused a unit of packed red blood cells.
They made several recommendations, and recommended that the patient no longer be on Digoxin because it is renally cleared and the patient has impaired creatinine clearance.
They instead recommended that he be put on beta blocker perioperatively and postoperatively.
On [**5-13**], the patient underwent radical cystoproctatectomy with ileal loop urinary diversion for a preoperative diagnosis of invasive bladder cancer.
The patient was quite hypertensive postoperatively, and required treatment with intravenous Lopressor, intravenous enalapril.
The patient's blood pressures were thus controlled with intravenous enalapril, intravenous Lopressor, and as needed Hydralazine.
He did pull out one of his ureteral stents when he became disoriented on postoperative day one.
The patient was continued on Kefzol and Flagyl for five days postoperatively.
The patient was kept nothing by mouth with a nasogastric tube for several days postoperatively, as he had no bowel sounds and no reports of flatus.
He had an electrocardiogram that was done that showed that the patient continued to be in sinus rhythm and was not in atrial fibrillation, and he was ruled out appropriately with a set of CPKs.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was discontinued on [**5-21**], and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation on the 22nd.
Tambocor 100 mg by mouth every morning and 50 mg by mouth every evening 2.
Labetalol 200 mg by mouth twice a day 3.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily 4.
Zestril 10 mg by mouth once daily 5.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily 6.
Percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four hours as needed for pain 7.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day, hold for loose stools 8.
Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every four hours as needed for fever  One thing of note, the patient, after being transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit, was put on labetalol, which seemed to control his blood pressure very well, and the Medicine team, who was taking care of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit, felt that that would be a good medication long-term, however, the patient should definitely see his former cardiologist to adjust his antihypertensive and cardiac medications within one to two weeks.
