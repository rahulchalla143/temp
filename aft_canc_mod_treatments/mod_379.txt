A/P: 89 year old female with metastatic colon cancer c/b biliary stricture requiring stenting and recent admit for cholangitis and bacteremia who now presents with fever, leukocytosis, and worsened LFTS.
Purulent material was drained and a new stent was placed.
She was started on ciprofloxacin after the procedure per recommendations of the ERCP team but blood cultures grew out two strains of Pseudomonas and E. coli, at which time she was placed on zosyn.
She remained afebrile and was discharged on cephalexin and cipro based on sensitivities.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her attending gastroenterologist that supervised the ERCP, was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding additional stenting measures that would prevent restenosis of the CBD.
He stated, however, that additional procedures were not indicated at this time, and that he was hopeful that the patient would not again experience re-obstruction and subsequent cholangitis.
IR was consulted and they placed an exnternal drain because an internal drain could not be placed after the ERCP placed stent became clogged.
The external drain was functioning well.
Zosyn and Cipro were started for double coverage with a plan to continue for a total of 14 days.
She likely has some component of iron deficiency anemia and was therefore started on iron supplementation.
#) Hypertension: Antihypertensives were held because the patient's blood pressure was low to normotensive, and because she was bacteremic.
#)Oral Candidiasis: Patient was found to have thrush and started on nystatin swish and swallow with significant improvement.

Secondary: Metastatic colon CA Biliary stricture Pseudomonas bacteremia Anemia Breast CA s/p L mastectomy h/o lower extremity DVT, s/p IVC filter in [**2-8**] HTN Hyperlipidemia CAD, h/o NSTEMI   Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating food   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of nausea, vomiting, and fever.
To treat you for this, we performed an endoscopic procedure and drained your bile duct.
You now have an external biliary drain to prevent bile from collecting in your liver and hopefully to prevent you from getting another infection.
You will need to continue these antibiotics for several days after you leave the hospital.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
