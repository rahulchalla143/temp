IR guided Percutaneous Catheter (PTC) to biliary ducts 3.
IR guided Metal stenting of biliary ducts via PTC 4.
IR placement of venting gastric tube and jejunal tube   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 109733**] is a 82 year old woman who was diagnosed with stage I (T4N0M0) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon in [**2181**].
She underwent resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy including 5FU-LCV given at Cape Code Hospital Cancer under the direction of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 7049**].
Has not been taking BP meds over the past 5 days.
Note: Immunostains for CDX-2 (diffuse) and cytokeratin 20 (focal) are positive within the tumor, while immunostains for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1 are negative.
The study is not tailored for evaluation of the upper abdomen, only to confirm a large porta hepatis low-attenuation lesion, new left-sided biliary pigtail catheter without pneumobilia, new small volume ascites in the left subphrenic space (400B, image 33), uniformly thickened adrenal glands stable since [**2183-10-14**], stable left renal pelvis dilatation and a mild sliding hiatus hernia.
[**2183-10-20**] Abdominal Series: ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPH, SUPINE AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS: On the decubitus views, there is no evidence of free air to suggest perforation.
Metallic biliary stent is visualized along the right lateral margin of the lumbar vertebral bodies.
A transhepatic biliary catheter is visualized extending through the biliary stent with the tip seen in the region of small bowel overlying the midline.
Visualization of a metallic CBD stent with a biliary catheter seen extending through the stent into the small.
Stent projects in the right abdomen.
[**2183-10-26**] Portable CXR for NGT Placement: NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
A new NG tube tip is in the stomach.
[**2183-10-29**] GJ tube placement: PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure, benefits, alternatives and risks involved.
An 8-French Bright-Tip sheath was placed over the guidewire and the guidewire removed.
Using a combination of 5-French Kumpe catheter and 0.035 angled Glidewire, the catheter was successfully advanced past the pylorus and the duodenal mass, into the proximal jejunum.
The guide wire was removed and small amount of contrast injected to confirm the position.
Then a 0.035 Amplatz wire was placed and the catheter as well as the Bright-Tip sheath were removed.
Through the peel-away sheath a 16 French MIC gastrojejunostomy catheter was placed and advanced into the proximal jejunum.
The catheter was secured in place by sliding the plastic disc on the outside.
Sterile dressing and a Flexi-Trak device was applied.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided placement of a 16-French MIC gastrojejunostomy tube with the tip of the jejunostomy port terminating distal to the ligament of Treitz.
The gastrostomy port to be connected to low-wall suction overnight and the catheter can be used tomorrow morning for feeding purposes.
The patient was seen by a surgical team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who reviewed the case [**2183-10-16**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and indicated that palliative surgery at this time was not advisable.
After a family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided to pursue rehabilitative placement and consider palliative chemotherapy if the patient's functional status improved.
# Obstructive jaundice: Pt underwent an attempted ERCP [**2183-10-14**] for decompression but cannulation of the ampulla was unseccessgul due to tumor mass.
On [**2183-10-15**] she underwent percutaneous catheter decompression via Interventional Radiology team and tolerated both procedures without immediate complication and with lab evidence of decompression.
IR metal stenting of the biliary tree was performed trhought the percutaneous catheter under sedation and local anesthesia on [**2183-10-20**].
The patient experienced significant post procedure pain thought secondary to the lengthy tumor that was cannulated for stent placement.
Her pain was treated with narcotic analgesia.
Perforation was ruled out with abdominal plain films.
The drain and stent resolve the obstruction.
# COPD with Hypoxemia and Hypercarbia: The patient developed a new oxygen requirement shortly after her initital percutaneous biliary catheter was placed.
She was maintained on 2 liters NC oxygen over the subsequent days.
On the day following placement of her metal biliary stent on [**2183-10-20**], the patient became acutely more confused with an increasing oxygen requirement.
THe patient was tranferred for 1 day to the ICU for management for hypoxia and hypercapnea.
Her hypoxia was likely due COPD, narcotics, and volume overload from IVF and resolved with IV Lasix.
Narcotic analgesia and benzodiazepines were entirely stopped.
The patient's prophylactic heparin was discontinued at this time.
She continued to be intermittanting guaiac positive, most recently on [**2183-10-31**] after started tube feeding.
A nasogastric tube was placed for decompression with good relief of the patient's symptoms.
On [**2183-10-29**] a venting gastrojejunostomy tube was placed without complication and the patient's nasogastric tube was removed the following day.
Late on the evening of [**2183-10-31**], the patient developed abdominal distension and right upper quadrant pain, a repeat abdominal film again showed multiple air fluid levels consistant with small bowel obstruction despite little output from when the patient's venting G tube was placed to suction.
Tube feeds remain off and the patient and family have opted against TPN, but instead they would like her to continue with IV fluids.
A foley catheter was placed and the patient responded to gentle IV hydration at 75cc/hr with return to her baseline mental status in 24 hours and normalizing of her BUN/creatanine to 13/0.5 over ensuing days.
Her fluid status has been difficult to manage given her poor nutrition, small bowel obstruction with nasogastric drainage, and propensity for congestive heart failure prior to her intensive care unit transfer.
# HTN: The patient had not been taking BP meds for the week prior to admission and was normotensive, so BP meds were held.
Medications on Admission: fexofenadine 180 mg daily-has not been taking last five days and asymptomatic lisinopril-hydrochlorthiazide 20-25- has not been taking last 5 days.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).

Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Prochlorperazine Edisylate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with jaundice caused by bile duct obstruction from tumor to the abdomen.
To relieve the bile duct obstruction, you underwent percutaneous catheter drainage of the biliary tree, after unsuccessful ERCP attempt.
The surgeons reviewed your case and felt that introduction of metal stents via the percutaneous catheter was the best initial method to maintain patency of the blocked biliary ducts.
A feeding tube was placed, but we have not been able to use it because of the obstruction.
Nutrition has been limited to only intravenous fluids.
Bleeding from your upper gastrointestinal tract thought to be due to the tumor invading your duodenum and requiring blood transfusion.
Acute renal failure and unresponsiveness in the setting of the small bowel obstruction due to hypovolemic shock was treated with fluids by IV.
