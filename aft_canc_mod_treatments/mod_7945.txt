CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
IMAGING:  MRI of thoracic spine [**2182-1-16**]: Significant for T10 and T11 fractures with cord compression at these levels and cord edema.
Posterior skin staples are seen.
Clinical correlation would be useful and endoscopy can be performed if necessary.
CXR [**2-24**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right sided port and left internal jugular central venous line are in unchanged position without pneumothorax.
Nevertheless, in the future, Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] should receive Fya-antigen and K-antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.
Approximately 31% of ABO compatible blood will be Fya-antigen and K-antigen negative.
Free Kappa/Lambda light chains   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] is an 81 yo woman with PMH significant for multiple myeloma who was admitted from her nursing home for an elective laminectomy for cord compression.
SURGICAL COURSE: Pt was admitted to the hospital electively and was brought to OR where under general anesthesia she underwent posterior thoracic laminectomy and fusion.
Post operatively, patient was hypotensive, she recieved 250 bolus of fluid and 1 unit of PRBCs in the PACU for a hematocrit drop from 30-26.
MICU COURSE: In the MICU [**2-23**] she was volume rescuscitated with 6L isotonic fluids after CVL was placed and MAP improved to >65 with minimal time on norepi for BP support.
Patient was placed on vancomycin and cefepime given clinical instability.
She was placed on stress dose hydrocortisone which was subsequently tapered.
#Urosepsis: Patient was continued on Cefepime as treatment for infection.
Of note, her sepsis in the ICU was thought to be due to a pan-sensitive Klebsiella UTI (see sensitivities in results section.)
We considered changing to PO Ciprofloxacin to cover this UTI.
Although the patient did not have a cough and was weaned off oxygen on the floor, Cefepime was continued for possible HCAP as well as UTI.
Of note, the patient has a port for IV antibiotic administration and so no additional line will be required.
It was confirmed with neurosurgery that there was no need to be on antibiotics from a post-surgical perspective.
# Possible adrenal insufficiency: The patient had been on standing steroids for approximately one month prior to admission for cord compression.
These were initially tapered post surgery but then she was given stress dose steroids in the ICU.
An AM cortisol on [**2-27**] was 15 on dexamethasone was reassuring.
Plan to discharge on prednisone and taper completely off steroids.
She recovered and was placed back on her home insulin regimen.
However, on the floor FS were 60s- 80s, in the context of poor PO intake, and so her pm insulin glargine was reduced.
She will be discharged on reduced glargine with humalog sliding scale.
PO Flagyl was started on [**2182-2-27**], with plan to treat throughout the duration of her antibiotic treatment and for a few days afterwards, as long as symptoms persist.
# Multiple myeloma: Patient was on thalidomide and dexamethasone prior to admission.
# S/P laminectomy and fusion of T10-11: Patient's back wound is not completely approximated but appears stable.
Patient comfortable on pain regimen of Oxycontin, Oxycodone and Gabapentin.
Wound care recommendations were included in discharge instructions for rehab center.
The patient was discharged on her home lasix dose.
Her Cr was improved from baseline at discharge, but she does have upper and lower extremity edema, likely from large volume fluid resuscitation during her stay.
Patient continued on Carbidopa-Levodopa .
Her BP did not improve despite aggressive IVF resuscitation and her mental status also did not improve.
Meds stopped except IV morphine prn and scopolamine patch.
PCP's office made aware of death along with neurosurgical service.
