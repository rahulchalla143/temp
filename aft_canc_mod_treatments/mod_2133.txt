She has been admitted for chemotherapy in preparation for donor lymphocyte infusion vs. second bone marrow transplant.
Her steroids were increased last Friday to 40mg daily from 30mg daily.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HX: - Acute myelogenous leukemia s/p allo transplant - [**2110-8-4**]: 5 of 6 matched family member allogenic BMT for AML.
Abd X-Ray [**10-23**]: FINDINGS: Left nephrostomy tube is present.
Stool and air is present in the colon.
Aspirate Smears: The aspirate material is inadequate for evaluation due to a lack of spicules, hemodilution, and clotted sample.
In the remaining half, the cellularity is variable (overall 10%) and is comprised predominantly of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
Maturing myeloid and erythroid precursors are extremely scant.
A CD34 immunohistochemical stain is performed to better assess presence of blasts, given the architectural distortion by background fibrosis.
The CD34 stain highlights scattered interstitial mononuclear cells within the fibrotic areas overall comprising ~10% of marrow cellularity (the remaining being lymphocytes and plasma cells).
Definite staining amongst blasts is not seen, however, scant tissue remains on deeper sections used for immunohistochemical staining.
Left-sided nephrostomy tube is seen in place.
[**2114-11-15**] Antegrade Nephrostogram:IMPRESSION: Persistent narrowing of the distal left ureter, probably from the extrinsic compression, unchanged from the study from one month ago   Brief Hospital Course: #) AML.
pain was controlled with Fentanyl PCA.
On discharge, she is to follow-up with her outpatient oncologist for a repeat bone marrow bx and further discussion of additional chemotherapy/mini transplant.
She was given lorazepam 1g IV for anxiety and sent for CT abd/pelvis without contrast.
She was given a 1L NS bolus with transient improvement of her blood pressure to 95/50s.
She was also given aztreonam 2g IV, vancomycin 1g IV, and metronidazole 500mg IV.
She also received morphine 1mg IV for pain with little relief.
#) Hypotension: In the setting of severe abdominal pain, she was found to have SBP in 80's, which responded well to fluid boluses.
Initially, there was concern for sepsis, and she was started on stress dose steroids, which were ultimately tapered down.
She was empirically covered with aztreonam, vancomycin and caspofungin.
Given she has a hx of hives to penicillins, she was premedicated and tolerated the meropenam without incident.
Ertapenam as QD antibiotic was discussed, but as there was no literature to support its efficacy against lactobacillus, she was discharged with VNA services to help administer her IV meropenam.
She was s/p urgent placement of L nephrostomy tube, and had been responding well.
Urology was consulted regarding taking out her left nephrostomy tube prior to discharge.
She was started on TPN for nutrition given her abdominal pain and was gradually weaned off.
