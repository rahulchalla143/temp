EKG: AFib with rate 156   Brief Hospital Course: 71 year-old man with metastatic rectal CA with brain mets reulting in seizures presenting with tachycardia, fever, and CT findings consistent with multifocal PNA.
CXR showed new multifocal pneumonia, and so broad spectrium antibiotics were initiated (vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime).
Blood pressure improved with fluid boluses and patient did not require pressors.
