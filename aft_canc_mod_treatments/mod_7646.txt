The endoscopy was done because of diffulty swallowing and showed an obstructuion of your esophagus.
After the procedure you bled, so you were transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
A barium esophogram showed a possible connection (fistula) between the trachea (airway) and your esophagus.
You had two repeat endoscopies in which biopsies were taken and a new stent was placed.
This pneumonia was treated with IV antibiotics.
Increase warfarin dose to 3mg daily.
Lansoprazole 30mg 2x a day (this medication takes the place of omeprazole (Prilosec) because it dissolves in your mouth and avoids having to swallow another pill that might have difficulty passing the esophageal stent).
