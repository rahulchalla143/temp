Galactomannan and beta glucan negative.
Treated with Azithromycin and Cefpodoxime.
She later developed ARDS and was started on IV steroids and pressors.
She was started on an antibiotic regimen which eventually included Linezolid, Meropenem, Voriconazole and Acyclovir (prophylaxis dose).
The patient was started on high dose Methylprednisolone 60mg Q8h on [**2-9**].
A pigtail catheter drainage of R chest loculated effusion was planned for [**2-11**] but was not done.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management given her extensive past medical care at [**Hospital1 18**].
Autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2103**] 3.
Non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2110**], MUD on [**2115-9-20**] ATG conditioning c/b serum sickness; Cellcept discontinued in [**2115-5-8**], only on low dose Prednisone recently (increased transiently to 20mg for pruritus) 4.
Cardiomyopathy, chemotherapy induced.
GVHD related to transplant with dry eyes and occasional oral involvement 8.
PCP infection in [**8-/2114**] and remains on Bactrim 10.
BK viremia and viruria- [**2115-11-7**] 13.
46 yo female with a long history of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease, s/p autologous SCT [**2101**], s/p sibling donor allogenic transplant [**2110**], and s/p unrelated allogenic SCT with D 0 on [**2115-9-20**].
Her post transplant course was notable for "serum sickness" thought related to ATG with fevers, rash, and joint pains.
She was started on prednisone for control of the symptoms and the steroids have subsequently been discontinued.
[**Doctor First Name 16883**] was started on IV ganciclovir.
On [**2115-10-8**], she was switched to valganciclovir for continued treatment.
Unfortunately, her CMV viral load increased further and she was readmitted for IV Foscarnet on [**2115-10-24**].
With improvement in her CMV viral load, she was discharged to the apartments on [**2115-11-9**] on IV ganciclovir.
She was switched to Valganciclovir 900 mg twice per day in mid [**Month (only) 359**].
She also was treated for a short period of time with Keflex for possible infected SK on her hand.
Her Bactrim was switched to Atovaquone and her Keflex was discontinued.
Subsequent EBV viral loads were < 8 and CT of the neck showed decreasing adenopathy.
Treated with 6 cycles of MOPP/ABV hybrid followed by XRT.
- Recurred in [**4-/2103**] with minimal disease and went to autologous transplant in 4/[**2103**].
- s/p nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor on [**2110-5-8**] with evidence for recurrent disease.
- s/p 3 cycles of gemcitabine and Navelbine completed on [**2110-12-15**] followed by donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2110-12-26**] at a dose of 1 x10 to the 7th T cell per kilogram.
- s/p 3 cycles of CEPP chemotherapy with the first cycle given without procarbazine and completed on 03/[**2111**].
- s/p DC/DLI infusion on [**2111-6-5**] on the DC/DLI protocol with DLI dose of 3 x10 to the 7th T-cell per kilogram.
- Evidence for disease recurrence in [**8-/2111**] and status post four weeks of Rituxan, last given on [**2111-10-7**], supported with Leukine injections.
- s/p donor lymphocyte infusion at a dose of 1 x10 to 8th T-cell per kilogram on [**2111-10-22**].
- s/p enrollment on [**Company 2860**] study involving anti-CTLA-4 antibody with donor lymphocyte infusion in 05/[**2112**].
- Evidence for recurrent disease while on protocol and status post two cycles of Navelbine and gemcitabine.
- s/p DLI at a dose of 0.79 x10 to the 8th T-cell per kg on [**2112-11-25**].
- Began Gemzar, Navelbine once again on [**2113-3-16**], s/p 4 cycles supported with Leukine injections for the second, third and four cycles.
- Status post DLI at a dose of 1.15 x10 to the 8th T-cell per kilogram on [**2113-7-7**].
- Noted for progressive disease in [**2114-4-7**] and now s/p 2 cycles of Gemzar/Navelbine in [**Month (only) 547**]/[**2114-6-7**] with C2D8 on [**2114-6-20**].
- Plan to move forward with two more cycles of Gemzar/Naveline but developed fever, shortness of breath and increasing white count requiring admission in NY and then follow up admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed infection.
- Treated for PCP infection with IV Bactrim and currently on Bactrim prophylaxis.
- Persistent elevation in white blood count with increased abdominal adenopathy and began treatment with Methotrexate for two doses with minimal response.
- Treated with three cycles of ICE chemotherapy, last cycle in 1/[**2115**].
She was given high dose steroids and then treated with three cycles of DHAP starting of [**2115-4-17**], with 3rd cycle on [**2115-6-3**].
She received a 4th cycle of DHAP on [**2115-8-5**] for further treatment while undergoing workup for allogeneic transplant.
- Received dose of Velban on [**2115-8-30**] due to increased white count and to temporize her disease prior to her admission.
- Admitted for 2nd allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with ATG/TLI conditioning.

feeding tube ?
A left subclavian infusion port ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction and right internal jugular line in the upper SVC.
The ET tube ends 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube is within the stomach but coiled on itself and pointing towards the GE junction.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-17**] 3:21 PM FINDINGS: The NG tube has been replaced with a feeding tube that ends near the GE junction.
A new tracheostomy tube ends less than 1 cm from the carina.
The left venous infusion catheter ends near the cavoatrial junction.
New feeding tube tip near the GE junction.
Tracheostomy tube ending less than 1 cm above the carina.
A larger bore tube remains in place, possibly representing a feeding tube, and has been advanced further into the stomach since the prior radiograph.
With the exception of the change in tube positions, the appearance of the chest is relatively similar compared to the prior study of earlier the same date except for slight worsening of diffuse pulmonary opacities.
Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position including a relatively low lying tracheostomy tube.
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a single dilated loop of small bowel is present in the left upper quadrant and is of uncertain etiology.
IMPRESSION: Newly placed nasogastric tube in standard position.
The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of low SVC.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Multifocal pulmonary opacities and bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right, persist.
A right internal jugular catheter has been removed.
A tracheostomy tube, left IJ line and MediPort catheter remain in place.
Multifocal opacities are again noted, probably little changed since the prior chest x-ray, allowing for differences in penetration.
