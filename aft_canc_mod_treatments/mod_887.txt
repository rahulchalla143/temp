LEFT ADRENAL BIOPSY ([**2180-12-10**]): A small cluster of atypical cells, which fail to mark with immunostain for pancytokeratin AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2.
No immunoreactivity is seen for keratin (AE1/AE3; CAM 5.2), chromogranin, synaptophysin and inhibin.
SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Received 1 tube Cytolyt and 2 slides in fixative.
CLINICAL DATA: 64 yo man with leukocytosis, new lung mass and bilateral adrenal masses, suspicious for metastatic lung ca.
MRI confirmed neural compromise, and steroids were initiated.
Radiotherapy was also started for symptom relief.
A non-rebreather mask was applied, with improvement in saturations to 90s, enough to allow for transfer back to the floor.
On the floor, he continued to require increasing oxygen requirements, and heparin was started for presumed PE.
Given the above, septic shock was felt to be the most likely etiology, with possible post-obstructive pneumonia given obstruction by tumor; concerns were also raised regarding tumor lysis in view of recent lab data with elevated K, phosphate, uric acid and low calcium.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started after cultures drawn, as well as steroids in the setting of hypotension.
He remained hypotensive, requiring pressure support with pressors.
Given his critical status, a discussion was held with the family, and they wished to continue aggressive management, but wished that CPR not be performed.
Then Vasopressin was added.
Neosynephrine was lastly added in an attempt to maintain an adequate blood pressure, with little change.
He had ongoing acidosis on serial ABGs, along with hypoxemia (nadir pH 7.0) with PaO2 decreasing to less than 40 despite therapy and ventilator adjustments.
