Marked extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation to 1.6 cm with mild-to-moderate intra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation with high-density material within the distal CBD with pancreatitis in the head and neck, raising the question of gallstone pancreatitis.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed.
Stone fragments and sludge were removed using a balloon.
A biliary stent was placed.
Normal pancreatic duct (sphincterotomy, stent placement, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  [**2179-5-18**] Echo: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
S/p gallbladder pancreatitis: Patient presented with hypotension and sepsis which resolved with significant IV fluids (10L on night of admission).
Advanced Endoscopy was consulted and an ERCP with sphincterotomy was performed on [**5-15**] and plastic stent was placed wo complication.
RUQ U/S showed no gallstones so surgery decided they would not place a decompressiont tube, and already decided he wasn't a surgical candidate for CCY.
He was on zosyn intially, narrowed to cipro/flagyl, then just cipro on [**5-17**] when his BCx sensitivities returned.
Other possible etiologies include recent chemotherapy or other toxic medications (such as his outpatient statin).
We trended his LFTs, which improved post-procedure, and held his Simvastatin during the hospitalization and also at discharge as pt's life expectancy is 6 months and the benefit of simvastatin is over the course of many years.
# Anemia: Known Fe deficiency thought to be [**3-3**] gastritis from NSAID use for pain control of arthritis.
Currently 2.1, even with aggressive hydration.
# Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Lung: Received Navelbine on [**2179-5-4**].
Further management was deferred to the outpatient setting.
