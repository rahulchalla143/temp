The double-lumen left jugular catheter tip is in distal SVC.
The left PICC line tip cannot be visualized, but most likely is in the superior or mid SVC.
The post-CABG sternotomy wires and sutures are unremarkable.
The NG tube has been removed in the meantime.
PICC LINE PLACEMENT  INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with CABG and mitral valve repair.
The procedure was explained to the patient.
TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire and a double-lumen PICC line measuring 42 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the left basilic venous approach.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2194-3-17**] 2:30 PM  VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  Reason: assess swallow  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman s/p cabg REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess swallow INDICATION: 67-year-old woman status post CABG.
VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW: A video fluoroscopic oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was done in conjunction with the speech and swallow pathology division.
Brief Hospital Course:     Initially the patient was diuresed aggressively with a Lasix drip and IV diuril with very good effect, becoming 3-4L negative per day.
She lost approximately 15-18lbs of fluid weight this way.
After active diuresis, she was changed to a maintenance dose of oral Torsemide and HCTZ which maintained her volume status.
However, her diuretic regimen will likely need to be altered after her surgery.
She was also seen by dental who recommended the extraction of teeth #21, 22, 28, and 29 which was done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**].
Cardiac surgery also recommended an evaluation by GI given her history of GI bleeding and the increased intraoperative risk given the large heparin dose she would get.
She was continued on her PPI twice daily for further prophylaxis.
In discussion with the patient and the cardiac surgeons, it was felt appropriate to continue with the surgery.
Please see OR report for details, see tolerated the operation and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU on Milrinone, Levophed and Epinephrine infusions.
She received Vancomycin perioperatively as she was an inpatient preoperatively.
For several days postoperatively the patient remained intubated and sedated on inotropes and pressors.
She had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation and was startedon amiodarone, as well as heparin and coumadin.
She was started on flagyl for ?
On POD #4, she required re-intubation for apnea.
Seen by ID for continued  leukocytosis of unknown etiology and started on empiric vanco and zosyn.
Her creatinine rose to 2, and she required higher blood pressures, as well as torsemide and albumin to maintain urine output.
Milrinone and vasopressin weans continued.
She was started on digoxin for rate control.
She was seen  by electrophysiology who recommended waiting for clinical improvement prior to pacer placement.
She was started on natrecor for diuresis.
She was started on tube feeds.
Left sided chest tube was placed for pleural effusion.
Yeast grew from her sputum and urine and she was started on fluconazole.
She had no further episodes of bradycardia and did not require a pacemaker.
Diuresis and volume status continued to be an issue.
She was seen by heart failure and started on sildenafil.
On [**3-7**] she underwent bilateral thoracentesis.
Dialysis catheter was placed on [**3-9**].
CVVH was started for fluid removal.
She had rapid atrial fibrillation, and was given iv amiodarone and again became bradycardic.
Speech and swallow evaluation recommended starting nectar thick and pureed consistencies, with tube feeds as primary source of nutrition.
Tunnelled dialysis catheter was placed on [**3-16**].
She received tube feeds overnight for supplementation.
Repeat swallowing evaluation on [**3-24**]  receommended continued nectar thick lequids and pureed foods, as well as small sips of thin liquids and modified barium swallow prior to advancing diet.
She continues on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, and has received 0.5 mg for 4 days.
