Status post percutaneous tracheostomy.
Status post insertion of chest tubes.
He was managed conservatively with medication but follow-up EGDs showed Barrett's type changes which eventually were found to have a small focus of adenocarcinoma at 30 cm.
Given the extent of his disease, in the clinic it was felt that he would be a good candidate for esophagogastrectomy without need for adjuvant therapy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2178-6-30**] for preoperative preparation for his surgery which took place on [**2178-7-1**].
There was no note of intraoperative complication or excessive blood loss and the patient underwent a total esophagectomy which was thoracoscopically and laparoscopically assisted with an esophagoscopy and jejunostomy placement by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well without note of excessive blood loss or intraoperative complication.
Therefore, postoperatively, he was managed aggressively with intravenous benzodiazepine (Ativan) for prophylaxis against delirium tremens.
Otherwise, his pain was initially managed with an epidural catheter and subsequently he was switched over to IV narcotics.
From a respiratory standpoint, postoperatively the patient was extubated on postoperative day 2 but failed extubation and required reintubation subsequently.
Essentially, he failed extubation three times requiring placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2178-7-14**] which the patient was discharged with.
The reasons for failure of extubation seemed to be related to some mild laryngeal edema of which the etiology is unclear but the patient was breathing well without need for supplemental oxygenation.
He otherwise had no cardiac medications although occasionally he was seen to go into first degree heart block.
At the time he was evaluated, cardiac enzymes were sent but these were negative and therefore it was felt that he could safely continue his low dose Lopressor.
This was managed conservatively with broad spectrum antibiotics and the patient actually did undergo an esophagoscopy which did not evidence any visible leak and the anastomosis looked good during the esophagoscopy.
Otherwise, he was maintained on lansoprazole.
From a nutritional standpoint, the patient was given tube feeds for nutritional supplementation through his jejunostomy given the fact that his oral intake was limited, but by postoperative day 19, the patient had passed a swallow evaluation allowing him to eat soft solids which he tolerated well and was continued on a diet of full liquids for the first week which was advanced to soft solids after the second week in conjunction with his tube feeds which would be adjusted during his follow-up visit.
The swallow evaluation showed that he can take thick liquids and solids and soft solids.
He was given heparin subcu along with Venodyne boots for DVT prophylaxis.
The patient was pancultured including blood, urine, sputum and JP fluid.
He was empirically started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl, pending return of culture data but these all were negative.
At the time of discharge, it is felt that there was no source of infection and he had adequately been treated and therefore his antibiotics were stopped.
Otherwise, his only infectious complication postoperatively was a urinary tract infection which was covered with the vancomycin and levofloxacin.
It was felt that by postoperative day 21 that as the patient had adequate pain control with PO medications, was otherwise stable from a respiratory perspective, had no cardiac issues and was otherwise obtaining adequate caloric nutrition with his tube feeds and was beginning to take PO's and otherwise had been afebrile, that he could be discharged to a rehab facility in fair condition with follow-up in two weeks.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  He was sent with a fluticasone aerosol inhaler 110 mcg two puffs [**Hospital1 **], albuterol inhaler one to two puffs q6h as needed, lansoprazole 30 mg po qd, Tylenol 325 mg one to two tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, albuterol nebulizer treatments, Colace prn, Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, Reglan 10 mg po qid ac hs, Zofran prn, Ativan 2 mg po q4h as needed.
