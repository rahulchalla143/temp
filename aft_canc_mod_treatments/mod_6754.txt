CXR showed a RML/RUL infiltrate and the patient was given Levaquin and ceftriaxone.
Cardioversion (100 J) was performed with conversion to NSR.
After cardioversion, blood pressure once again fell to 77/49 and norepinephrine was started.
A right IJ line was placed.
Five liters of NS were administered.
By the time he arrived in the MICU, he had received 6 liters of IV fluids and had transiently been on norepinephrine.
Norepinephrine was discontinued soon after arrival to MICU, and blood pressure has remained stable in the 90s-120s systolic range throughout the MICU course.

Reactive mesothelial cells, inflammtory cells and proteinaceous debris.
# Atrial flutter / atrial fibrillation with RVR: He required cardioversion in the ED and had subsequent episodes of low BP with atrial flutter.
One possible etiology for atrial arrythmias was his malignancy irritating his heart.
While in the ICU, he reportedly had significant pauses on a combination of digoxin, calcium channel blocker as well as beta-blocker for rate control.
Per EP consults, nodal-blocking agents should be avoided given propensity for pauses (had a 30 second pause).
He was given Flecainide on [**4-10**] and then started on amiodarone [**4-11**] with appropriate effect.
From that point onwards, he was predominantly in sinus rhythm with intermittent atrial pacing with two episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**4-12**] which resolved with fluid and Mg.
Additionally, anticoagulation was not started given previous hemoptysis and malignancy.
He was instructed to take Aspirin 325 mg daily.
He was continued on an amiodarone taper upon discharge with plan to maintain on 200 mg daily as final target dose.
Reticulocyte 2.1, inappropriately low, consistent with marrow suppression.
Interventional pulmonary performed bronchoscopy [**4-13**] and placed one bronchial stent, but were unable to place a more distal stent.
They also performed right thoracentesis with removal of 1.8 L fluid on [**4-14**].
He was transitioned to Augmentin prior to discharge.
He was not discharged on antibiotics given patient and family wishes to pursue hospice and comfort measures only.
We had numerous discussions about continued pneumonia given his obstructing tumors.
# Lung cancer: Based on OMR notes, treatment would be palliative at this point and was deferred to his outpatient oncologists.
He did will with Ativan and Zyprexa.
He received Compazine for 3 days with fair relief but began to complain of urinary retention symptoms, a known side effect, so this was discontinued.
We also considered Haldol rather than Zyprexa, but this medication may interact with Amiodarone causing Q-T prolongation and Torsades de [**Last Name (un) **].
Thus, he was discharged with Ativan and Zyprexa as primary anti-nausea agents.
Patient received 3.5 liters of IVF in 8 hours.
Concern was initially for SIRS/SEPSIS, and interventional pulmonary was contact[**Name (NI) **] about possible bronchoscopy/thoracentesis.
He was bolused 1 L and given an additional 1 L over 10 hours.
He resolved to SBP > 100 with these interventions.
