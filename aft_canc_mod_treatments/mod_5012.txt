The right-sided PICC line overlies the upper SVC.
The NG tube is in the distal stomach.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 96 136 80 338/391.57 66 25 46     Pathology Examination  DIAGNOSIS:  Segment of bowel containing previous ileo-colonic anastomosis:  1.
Partially disrupted previous anastomosis site with surrounding fat necrosis, acute and chronic inflammation, and granulation tissue.
There are numerous adhesions and areas of apparent fat necrosis.
The specimen is represented as follows: A = ileal margin, B = colonic margin, C-E = adipose tissue near site of anastomosis, F-G  = ileal and colonic tissue at site of anastomosis, respectively, H = normal appearing ileum, I-R = adipose tissue for lymph nodes.
Vancomycin, Cipro and Flagyl were given in the ED.
Because of the predicted problems with fluid management due to diabetes insipidus as well as the known durability of ileocolic anastomoses the patient was treated by right hemicolectomy with ileocolonic anastomosis.
She was again taken to the operating room on [**1-10**] for resection of ileocolic anastomosis with right upper quadrant phlegmon, drainage of intraperitoneal abscess and formation of ileostomy.
Her ostomy output was initially high; she was later started on Loperamide to slow down output to allow for better absorption of her oral intake.
She has required intermittent IV fluid replacement to replete the losses from her ostomy output.
During her postoperative period she was placed on enteral tube feedings and later underwent a Speech and Swallow evaluation; she was assessed as an aspiration risk and was placed on nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids.
The wound ostomy nurse have been closely involved in her care.
Also inferior to stoma at 6 o'clock position, is small wound from old drain site, 0.5 cm with 1.5 cm depth(much less tunneling).
Patient has large abdominal incisional line with stay sutures, at the distal site is partial-thickness wound 0.5 cm, slightly raised from skin level, bed is pink, and edges attached.
Cleanse incisional line with commercial wound cleanser.
She was hyponatremic during her ICU stay and was felt due to volume depletion; she was given IV fluids and the problem was corrected.
Intravenous fluids were increased as felt likely from hypovolemia related to her increased ostomy output.
Also of note she was previously on Vancomycin and did have elevated levels; the Vanco was stopped; this along with the Lithium and high ostomy output all are felt to be contributing her acute renal failure.
Her IV fluids were increased and will likely require further adjustment given her history of diabetes insipidus.
She was placed on a renal diet.
