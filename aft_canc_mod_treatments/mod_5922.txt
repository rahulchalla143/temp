He has a long-standing polyradiculoneuropathy, which began in [**2135**] or [**2136**] with numbness over his right 4th finger.
He has also recently been treated with IVIg, but this has had to be held due to an acute worsening of his chronic renal insufficiency - last treatment was [**2148-12-26**].
However, at the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], he developed tingling in his nose and hands, and his prednisone was increased to 10 mg daily alternating with 15 mg daily.
He was due for an IVIg treatment on [**1-8**], but at that appointment, it was noted that his Creatinine had risen up to 1.9, which had been a gradual increase over the prior 6 months.
As his neuromuscular fellow points out, "All this has occured in the setting of prednisone weaning, making steroid induced myopathy less likely."
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline Cr 1.2-1.4, but with elevation of his creatinine over the last month, now up to 2.0.

2+ DP pulses.
Fragmented bone marrow biopsy with maturing trilineage erythroid dominant hematopoiesis.
There are postoperative changes in the lower cervical region with patient status post anterior discectomy.
His neurologic exam is notable for diffuse weakness, worse distally than proximally though with bilateral IP involvement.
Surgery was recommended, but as his platelets dropped during the admission, surgery was felt to be unsafe until his platelets could be stablized.
Eventually, after IVIG infusions and transfusions of several packs of platelets immediately afterwards, his platelets rose to >100,000 and he was taken to the OR on [**2149-1-30**] for anterior discectomy and fusion.
Stress dose steroids were given perioperatively.
Dilaudid PCA was used postoperatively to control pain, then transitioned to oral narcotics.
His platelets remained stable for 48 hours after the procedure (80-100,000 range) but on post-op day three dropped to 72,000...
CIDP Prednisone was continued initially at his home dose.
Stress dose steroids were given perioperatively, as above.
He will be due for his next dose of IVIG early next week.
In the past he has been receiving his IVIG infusinons at the infusion clinic at [**Hospital1 18**].
He is also maintained on prednisone for this, which at time of discharge is being administered at doses of 10mg and 15mg on alternative days (please restart this regimen on day #2 of [**Hospital1 **] as he is to get 1 more day of 40mg prednisone for a gout flare).
Respiratory illness On post-op day 3 following the discectomy and fusion (decompression of spinal cord), he was found to be febrile to 103.5 axillary, with low level of responsiveness and sats in the low 80s (80-82%), tachypneic on exam with rhonchorous lung sounds, and no improvement with high-flow nasal cannula.
He was placed on non-rebreather O2 and sats increased to high 90s; ABG was: pH 7.40 pCO2 46 pO2 123 HCO3 30 BaseXS 2.
He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanco, levaquin and flagyl), and maintained on nonrebreather as this was unable to be weaned without substantial drop in oxygen saturations.
He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagl to cover for aspiration pneumonia and also to cover for MRSA given his long hospital course.
He did not require intubation; his O2 requirement was decreased after 2 days in the ICU and he was able to breath on room air >48 hours prior to discharge.
We plan to continue him for 7 additional days with Vancomycin and Flagyl.
He was treated with IV Fe Gluconate.
Diabetes Team held metformin in preparation for possible surgery and imaging studies, continued glyburide, while covering with ISS.
He was switched to glipizide at the recommendation of the Renal team.
HTN: the patient was changed from atenolol to metoprolol given his renal insufficiency.
He was still hypertensive to the 160s-170s - hence amlodipine 5mg daily was added onto his regimen prior to discharge.
Rheumatology was consulted who recommended: - 2 days of prednisone 40mg - colchicine 3x/week - recheck his uric acid level in 1 month (it was 7.1 on [**2149-2-3**]) - by discharge, his knee and L 1st MTP were improved.
