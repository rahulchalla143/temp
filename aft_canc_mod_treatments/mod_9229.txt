Chest tube placement [**2102-5-5**] 3.
Pericardiocentesis [**2102-7-27**]   Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46yo male with M7 AML, refractory to induction w/ 7+3, then MEC, then FLAG.
Developed fever and pulm infiltrate in weeks prior to transplant, s/p nondiagnostic VATS.
Eventually defervesced on Ambisome, Imipenem and Voriconazole.
s/p matched unrelated allo transplant [**2102-5-29**] due to escalating blasts after conditioning w/ Cytoxan/Busulfan.
Post transplant course complicated by febrile neutropenia, respiratory failure requiring intubation, [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlusive disease w/ hepatic failure, acute renal failure, graft vs. host disease, seizures, small intracranial hemorrhage, transient episode of bradycardia/asystole of unclear etiology, and pericardial effusion.
The patient underwent chemotherapy with the FLAG protocol, which included Fludarabine, Ara-C and GCSF.
He remained neutropenic and pancytopenic on day 15 after therapy, and prophylactic antibiotics were started (Levaquin).
He was given multiple PRBC and platelet transfusions.
The patient's originaly scheduled MUD-BMT for [**5-7**] was postponed secondary to the ID issues outlined below, and due to the non-diagnostic bone marrow biopsy.
He had a line placed on [**5-19**] for initiation of the preparatory regimen with busulfan/cytoxan, started on [**5-23**], which he tolerated well with mild nausea and some diarrhea.
He started cyclosporine infusion [**5-29**] for GVHD prophylaxis, and stem cell infusion began [**5-30**].
Methotrexate was not started secondary to his pleural effusion, which drained 700cc of bloody fluid on thoracentesis on [**6-22**].
His GVHD was ultimately controlled on steroids and cyclosporin, which was gradually increased to maintain a serum level between 450-500.
Discharge cyclosporin dose was 324gms/day on 25mg Prednisone [**Hospital1 **] to prevent GVHD.
He was given blood transfusions in-house to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 25 as well as platelet transfusions to be greater than 10.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was intially started on Bactrim, Diflucan and Acyclovir for prophylaxis.
Levaquin was added once his ANC was less than 500.
On [**2102-4-24**] the patient spiked to 102.4 and Cefepime was added.
Ambisome was started on [**4-27**] for presumed pulmonary aspergillosis.
Vancomycin and flagyl were added to the regimen on [**4-27**].
A repeat CT scan on [**4-30**] showed worsening of the lung lesions, and ID recommended discontinuing flagyl and cefepime, and starting meropenem, in addition to a pulmonary consult.
Meropenem was changed to imipenem on [**5-1**] for better [**Month/Year (2) 10305**] coverage.
Additionally, his R IJ TLC had become edematous, warm, and tender, and was taken out [**2102-5-1**] - cultures of the tip were negative, and his L subclavian portacath was removed [**2102-5-2**] also because of concerns for infection.
He had a L chest tube in place for 24 hours after the procedure.
Atrovent NEBs were started for wheezing.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**5-17**], as the patient had been adequately treated for his corynebacterium bacteremia (>14 days).
On [**6-2**] there was noted to be some erythema surrounding his TLC, therefore vancomycin was added.
On [**6-4**] (day 5 s/p MUD) the patient spiked a fever of 103 and flagyl was added for presumed C. Diff.
Levofloxacin was added at this time.
The patient spiked up to 104.5 on [**6-5**] with rigors, at which time cefepime was also added and imipenem discontinued as it was thought he may have developed imipenem resistant organisms.
The patient was then on ambisome, cefepime, acyclovir, vancomycin, flagyl, and levaquin.
The patient was transferred to the ICU on [**6-9**] secondary to hypotension requiring pressor support, which was weaned off within 24 hours.
At this time he was on Meropenem (no imipenem secondary to concern for seizure potential), levaquin, flagyl, ambisome, and vancomycin.
IV Bactrim was started on [**6-13**] for stenotrophomonas coverage after he spiked a temp of 102.4 and became hypotensive requiring further pressors, however it was discontinued when his blood cultures came back negative and his platelets dropped.
Pt continued to be treated for aspiration pneumonia/bacterial sepsis, and was extubated on [**6-28**].
Thoracentesis was performed on [**7-4**] and drained 600cc of fluid, which was culture negative.
Levaquin was discontinued on [**7-21**] as the patient had been afebrile for many days, without positive blood cultures.
Cefepime was started on [**7-25**], however was changed to aztreonam secondary to development of a rash that had also been previously noted with cefepime.
Additionally, a CMV viral load came back with 1470 copies, therefore gancyclovir was started.
Ambisome was changed to voriconazole.
Pt will be d/c'd on IV caspofungin and PO valgangciclovir, the latter to be continued until day 100 s/p MUD.
On [**6-9**], at the time of development of his [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlussive disease, with rapid development of ascites and massive fluid overload with presumed redistribution hypovolemia and decreasing urine output, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became hemodynamically unstable and had to be transfered to the ICU for pressor support and closer monitoring.
In the ICU he received aggressive volume repletion and a couple of short course of pressors.
His metoprolol was held, pacer pads were left on his chest, and atropine was kept at his bedside.
The patient developed tachycardia up to 150 just after receiving his dose of pentamidine on [**7-19**].
He was given IV Lopressor x 2 and his rate came down to 110 with the second dose.
He was seen by cardiology and started on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
His clonidine patch was tapered to 0.2 mg on [**7-22**], however his pressures were slightly higher to the 160s and 170s, therefore metoprolol was increased from 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-24**].
His clonidine patch was further tapered and hydralazine prn was d/c'd.
Pt d/c'd on metoprolol and nifedipine SA.
An echo was done on [**7-26**] that showed a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular invagination, right atrial collapse, and impending tamponade, therefore on [**7-27**] the patient had a pericardiocentesis that removed 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
He also developed bilateral pedal edema, facial edema, and IVF were changed to keep vein open.
He was started on a defibrotide protocol on [**6-7**], and ambisome was decreased due to potential hepatotoxicity.
He was given lactulose for presumed hepatic encephalopathy.
Pt was on defibrotide per protocol, was d/c'd after liver size seems improved, and lfts's trend down/stabilize and U/S of Liver [**2102-7-12**] showing hepatopetal flow.
Cyclosporine was restarted due to concern for GVHD.
He did not have any diarrhea while in the ICU on Solumedrol and cyclosporine.
He was treated with solumedrol that was slowly tapered as the diarrhea resolved.
He was started on Budesonide on [**7-19**].
Pt remained diarrhea-free on steroids and cyclosporine through discharge.
RASH: The patient deveoped a hives on his arms, chest, abdomen, and ears 10 minutes after reinfusion on [**5-30**] which was treated with benadryl and hydrocortisone with improvement.
He was loaded on Dilantin as well.
Dilantin was tapered, and then d/c'ed on [**6-16**].
He was on a heavy propofol drip during intubation because when sedation was lifted he became very aggitated, pulling out tubes.
He was noted to be talkative and interactive s/p extubation, and his altered mental status was thus attributed to his hepatic and renal impairment which was resolving at the time of his improvement.
Defibritide was held d/t risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, but restarted in a few days.
Placed on Keppra, which was eventually weaned off d/t a falling WBC count/marrow suppression.
Neurology and psychiatry were both involved, and recommended starting haldol at a low dose, in addition to maintaining the Ativan at 1 mg IV q 6 hours.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did have an isolated elevated ammonia level at 115 on [**7-23**], however it was in the 20s on [**7-24**] and lactulose was not started.
Cyclosporine was discontinued on [**7-23**] because of cyclosporin toxicity as suggested by an MRI on [**7-23**] showing questionable edema in the occipital and parietal lobes bilaterally.
Cyclosporin was soon restarted and pt was d/c'd on 324mg/day continuous infusion.
As his anxiety improved, ativan was tapered to just prn, and pt was maintained on Haldol 1mg at bedtime.
DIET, FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained on a neutropenic diet initially.
When counts decreased during chemotherapy, he was maintained on intravenous fluids.
Once his hydration reached an equilibrium after chemotherapy, he was switched to KVO during the day and maintenance fluids at night times one liter.
He gradually was placed back on a neutropenic diet and was able to take in adequate nutrition to meet caloric requirements.
However, on [**6-5**] nutrition recommended that he start supplemental TPN in addition to PO, as his PO had decreased s/p reinfusion secondary to nausea and vomiting, and on transfer to the ICU he was placed exclusively on TPN in early [**Month (only) **].
After transfer back to the BMT unit, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was strictly on TPN until he was cleared to eat by speech and swallow on [**7-17**], and he began taking in PO, very minimally secondary to poor taste.
We began switching his medications to PO at this time, which he tolerated well.

Repiratory Failure requiring intubation 2.
Host Disease treated with steroids and cyclosporine 6.
