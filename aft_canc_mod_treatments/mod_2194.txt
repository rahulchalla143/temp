Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is an 83-year-old man, Russian-speaking, with a Left temporo-parietal glioblastoma multiforme, s/p resection in [**2197-11-24**], chronic Left frontal SDH and bilateral DVT's recently on Fragmin, and living in [**Hospital 23645**] Rehabilitation Center receiving daily brain XRT.
He initially presented with right arm weakness and non-fluent aphasia after an XRT session, and was found to have extension of his SDH.
The patient was started on seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin and started on dexamethasone for potentially radiation-induced subacute encephalopathy.
With improvement in his symptoms, the patient passed a video swallow with restrictions: Pureed consistency, thin liquids, crush all pills and aspiration precautions.
The patient completed his scheduled XRT therapy while in the hospital.
The temozolamide was discontinued as this was intended only to be administered in the peri-radiation period and the patient is not tolerating who pills (and this medication cannot be crushed).
The progress at that time will determine further therapy vs. hospice care.
The patient was continued on home metoprolol for rate control.
The patient was discharged on prophylactic lovenox dose.
He was s/p IVC filter placement and was on Fragmin prior to admission.
The patient received a 7 day course of Ceftriaxone IV.
