Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1319**] is a 63 year old male with metastatic melanoma (V600E B-Raf mutant) who has been partially responsive to experimental treatment, who presented to the ICU with spontaneous bleeding, hematuria, and DIC.
He was admitted to the ICU and required multiple blood product transfusions for support.
In the end, he and his wife decided to not continue to pursue aggressive measures, given the grim prognosis for his metastatic melanoma.
# DIC: Labs on admission consistent with DIC-- thrombocytopenia, anemia, low fibrinogen, elevated INR/PT, high D-dimer and fibrin degradation products.
Etiology thought to be likely his widely metastatic melanoma, especially now that there are new foci of metastatsis and bone marrow infiltration.
He also need 5 transfusions of platelets and 1 unit of FFP.
Within the first few days of his stay, his DIC seemed to improve with decreasing transfusion requirements, however he continued to have ongoing anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions.
# Anemia: Throughout ICU stay, patient required frequent blood transfusions to keep hct >21.
Initially, this was attributed to DIC, however DIC abated and his PRBC requirement continued to increase.
Hematology was consulted and felt that hemolysis was unlikely, with his elevated LDH due to his metastatic melanoma and haptoglobin falsely lowered by multiple transfusions.
Pt transitioned to comfort care on [**2-26**] and received no further transfusions.
At that point, he was placed on continuous bladder irrigation with 3-way foley.
Urology was consulted and suggested frequent hand irrigation, however he continued to have frequent clots requiring foley changes.
Pt was offered a cystoscopy and clot evacuation procedure to help reduce the bleeding and clot burden, which was causing significant discomfort for the patient when passed during bladder irrigation.
However, he refused on [**2-26**] and transitioned to comfort care.
Recommended alkalinizing urine, however given anuric status, bicarb was stopped so as to not volume-overload him any further.
Pt had an HD dialysis line placed with IR and initiation of HD on [**2-20**].
Pt and his wife chose to transition to comfort care on [**2-26**] and did not receive any further HD sessions.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has finished cycle 6 of experiment MEK inhibitor therapy and was in-between cycles on admission.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2133-2-20**] showed very extensive infiltration of his bone marrow with melanoma.
Pt was started on nafcillin on [**2-17**] for MSSA bacteremia.
However, Pt had a CT abdomen, which showed a possible RUL pneumonia, and antibiotics were switched to vancomycin and cefepime.
Pt's antibiotics were discontinued on [**2-26**] when he transitioned to comfort care.
Received 2 doses of methylnaltrexone to help reverse opiate effect on the gut.
Given persistent and worsening pain, CT abd/pelvis again obtained which showed hematoma of right iliacus muscle, likely contributing to worsened belly and back pain, but no significant enlargement relative to prior.
His pain improved once his medication regimen was liberalized after transition to comfort care.
# Altered mental status:  Days into admission, patient was became intermittently altered and somnolent which was attributed to his narcotics.
Pt did seem to be more awake and alert when he used his CPAP at night and after dialysis.
HD was stopped on [**2-26**] at Pt's request.
# Hypertension:  Pt was intermittently hypertensive to 150s, started metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with improvement in BPs, but this was later discontinued.
