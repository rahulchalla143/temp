Admission Date:  [**2105-4-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-4-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2042-11-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 108541**] is a 62-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer status post surgery and XRT in [**2089**] status post radical resection in [**2103-3-7**], atrial fibrillation and flutter, status post failed ablation in [**2104**] who presented to the Emergency Room on [**2105-4-13**] with shortness of breath and cough.
She was treated as an outpatient for a right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia with Amoxicillin but presented to the Emergency Room with worsening symptoms as described above.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Atrial fibrillation/flutter status post incomplete ablation in [**6-6**], status post DC cardioversion in [**2104-7-6**].
5) Left sided breast cancer status post surgery and XRT in [**2089**] and status post radical resection in [**2103**].
8) Possible lung cancer of the right lower lobe status post resection in [**2101**].
11) Superficial cutaneous Mycobacterium infection undergoing treatment with Cipro and Clindamycin.
MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Aldactone 25 mg a day, Calcitonin q day, Fentanyl patch, Lasix 40 mg q day, Lopressor 50 mg tid, Naprosyn 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Nystatin swish and swallow, OxyContin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **], Potassium Chloride 20 a day, Prednisone 4 a day, Ultram prn, Tylenol #3 prn, Vicodin prn.
The patient was admitted to the floor for treatment of what was presumed to be community acquired pneumonia, now failing oral antibiotic treatment.
ID service was consulted given the patient's relatively immunocompromised state as she was on Prednisone for her rheumatoid arthritis and given the fact that she had a mycobacterial infection on her right forearm which had not been completely treated with oral antibiotics.
She was treated quite broadly with antibiotics including Vancomycin, Imipenem, Tobramycin and Gatifloxacin.
Initially she expressed very clearly that she did not want to be intubated or resuscitated for any reason at all, however, it was felt that her worsening lung process was likely infectious and likely to get better with antibiotic treatment and given this bit of information, she consented to be intubated for hypoxemia and also for a bronchoscopy which was performed on [**2105-4-18**].
Samples were taken including fungal AFB, routine bacterial and viral cultures, all of which yielded no specific pathogen.
She had poor urine output initially which was somewhat responsive to fluid boluses but became unresponsive to fluid boluses.
At that point she was about 5-6 liters positive and diuresis was attempted as she had difficulty coming off of the ventilator and was still requiring FIO2 of 60%, PEEP of 10.
She was made comfort measures only, was placed on a Morphine drip and passed away on [**2105-4-22**].
