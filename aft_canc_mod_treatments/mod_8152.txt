Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with history of lymphocytic lymphoma and recent hospitalization two weeks ago for pneumonia and multiple admissions for orthostatic hypotension presents from home with fall resulting in SAH with other issues including ARF from poor PO intake, relative hypotension, and worsening anemia.
Neurosurgery was consulted and did not see need for surgical intervention.
Repeat NCHCT was stable and no interventions were necessary, and no anti-epileptics were warranted.
He denies any recent medication changes.
Given his long h/o orthostatic hypotension and failed trials of medical therapy in the past, we felt it was best that he be evaluated by a specialist in the field.
There was no evidence of GI bleed, hemolysis labs were negavtive and SAH would not have explained the degree of [**Name2 (NI) **] loss.
The patient received 2 units of pRBCs in the ICU, and 2U PRBCs on the medicine service.
He received one unit of platelets in the MICU and remained relatively stable therafter.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease:  BUN and Cr were elevated from baseline in the setting of poor po intake.
Creatinine began to correct with fluid resusitation and returned to a baseline of 1.6.
# DM2 without complications:  was maintained on home dose NPH 10 U qAM (70 % of basal while NPO) with humalog SSI (when eating).
#BPH:  Finesteride was held due to orthostatic hypotension.

The neurosurgeons would like to make sure that this resolves, so they would like you to get a head CT in one month and go see them for a check-up.
Your florinef medication was stopped earlier this year since it was causing many side effects.
Doctors in that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] will assess your orthostatic hypotension and figure out what medications might help you.
