Admission Date:  [**2148-4-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-8-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Recurrent HTLV1 associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 72 year old female with past medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia who was newly diagnosed with the lymphomatous form of HTLV associated T-Cell lymphoma/leukemia in [**2147-5-30**].
She received fluids and bisphosphonate for hypercalcemia and CHOP*1 before being discharged on Zidovudine and Interferon alpha therapy.
Interferon had to be discontinued due to cytopenias and AZT was continued through [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
She recieved an additional six cycles of CHOP coupled with Denileukin diftitox and was in complete remission at the cessation of cycle five (her fourth as an outpatient).
Next, she received two additional cycles of CHOP + Denileukin diftitox consolidation before proceeding to maintenance therapy with Denileukin diftitox two doses Q14 days.
Her LDH had peaked in the 1300-1600 range and then she went on to receive CHOP w/ Denileukin diftitox on [**2148-2-26**].
She was admitted to NEBH from [**Date range (3) 79098**] with neutropenic fever and phayrngitis for which she was treated with levofloxacin.
Since that admission, she reported dealing with recurrent lymphadenopathy with palpable cervical, preauricular, occipital, and axillary nodes.
The highest fever she has had was 101.4 after a Denileukin diftitox dose two days prior to presentation.
She had developed adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30%) and had to stop [**Hospital1 **] 3 days into therapy.
She had a brief stay in the Medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) from respiratory distress, which was felt to be pulm edema and was treated with aggressive diuresis.
She was also started on vanc/levofloxacin for suspected line infection and pneumonia on [**5-20**].

Recommend correlations in the clinical context of lymphoma.
There is persistence of previously-noted regional LV wall motion abnormalities, with additional global LV hypokinesis.
The ET tube tip at the origin of the right main bronchus and should be pulled back at least 3 cm.
By the time of dictation of this study findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], that informed me that the ET tube had been already re-positioned.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old female with coronary artery disease and hypertension presenting with recurrent HTLV-1 associated Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) after 8 cycles of CHOP w/denileukin diftitox.
1) Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (lymphomatous form): The patient was admitted for further treatment of her ATLL.
After obtaining an echocardiogram to assess her baseline cardiac function and ejection fraction chemotherapy with the [**Hospital1 **] regimen was started late in the evening of [**2148-4-19**].
Given her previous exposure to eight cycles of CHOP there was consideration of the amount of adriamycin she had previously received as she was calculated to be near her upper limits of acceptable dose.
Nevertheless, as she was proceeding with [**Hospital1 **], which has a much lower risk of cardiac toxicity secondary to the anthracycline being given as a slow infusion, the possible benefits of [**Hospital1 **] were considered to outweigh the risks.
[**Hospital1 **] was given per protocol with our standard premedication regimen of ondansetron and 100 mg of prednisone daily for nausea and the patient initially tolerated it well with minimal nausea and no other issues.
Despite her limited course of chemotherapy the patient responded well with significant decrease in her palpable lymphadenopathy and a drop in her LDH.
She was briefly placed on filgrastim for concern of preventing her nadir given concern of an active bacteremia (see below) but this was stopped on [**2148-4-29**] without significant leukopenia and she was never neutropenic.
She also had mild mucositis treated with local cares with good improvement in her symptoms and she took good PO throughout her hospitalization.
After the patient was presumed stable with regards to her systolic CHF decompensation and febrile illness, she was treated with ARA-G therapy day one [**2148-5-8**].
While the patient was being treated with ARA-G, tumor lysis labs were checked Q6H and she was treated with allopurinol and fluids.
An abdominal x-ray prelim read showed no evidence of free air, no air-fluid levels, only a large air-filled stomach.
She was immediately brought down to the Medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]), where she was intubated on arrival.
On [**2148-4-21**] she received one unit of pRBC's as well as continuing fluids with her chemotherapy (she was also on prednisone).
She had received 20 mg of IV furosemide with this blood given known low-ish ejection frection.
Chest rardiograph revealed acute pulmonary edema and so she received 40 mg IV furosemide and had 0.5 inch nitro paste placed.
ABG revealed 7.22/62/74 so she was transferred to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP).
She improved dramatically with BiPAP and began to put out brisk urine and never required intubation.
She had some mild feeling of chest pressure at the worst of her respiratory symptoms but was otherwise without chest pain and she improved quickly with diuresis and she was transferred back to the floor on the evening of [**2148-4-22**].
The diffuse hypokinesis continued to suggest a general cardiomyopathy overlying ischemic cardiomyopathy (with adriamycin considered the most likely cause).
Aspirin was held given concern for recent chemotherapy and thrombocytopenia, but she was started on a good heart failure regimen with long acting beta blocker and low dose of short acting ACEi (as her BP's were relatively low).
The patient remained mildly hypotensive, thus metoprolol was decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
During the course of ARA-G, the patient required extensive diuresis given the large amount of fluids to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
She ultimately responded well to 80mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **].
During her course on the oncology med service she episodes of dyspnea with O2 desats at night and tachypnea with crackles in her lungs, which responded to lasix at increasing doses up to 300 mg per night.
On [**5-23**], despite a negative fluid balance during the day, she had an acute episode of dyspnea characterized by labored breathing, clear lungs, and desaturations that did not improve with nebs/O2 mask.
She defervesced with therapy but spiked a fever to 102.7 in the ICU and was empirically started on vancomycin and meropenem.
Meropenem was stopped the following day but vancomycin was continued given the patient's blood culture came back positive and she had an indwelling port for chemotherapy.
As her blood cleared the decision was made to attempt to salvage the patient's port so she continued to receive vancomycin with vancomycin locks of her ports.
Pulmonary was consulted for possible bronchoscopy, however the decision was made to treat for possible pulmonary infection empirically with levofloxacin for 7 days.
Vancomycin and Levofloxacin were restarted on [**2148-5-20**] to treat the presumed line infection and possible pulmonary source.
This resolved by the following day after being put on more aggressive medications for dyspepsia and after having a large bowel movement on a better stool softening regimen.
She was treated with oral antihistamines and topical steroids.
Prophylaxis: She was on TMP-Sulfa for PCP prophylaxis at home and was started on acyclovir for viral prophylaxis when she was admitted given her presumed T cell dysfunction and vulnerability to viral infections, these were discontinued prior to discharge as she was not neutropenic.
No anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis but the patient ambulated regularly.
