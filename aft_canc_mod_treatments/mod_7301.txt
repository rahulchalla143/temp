Stage IV colon cancer (metastases to liver, pleura).
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 30984**] is an 84-year-old man with stage IV colon cancer with metastases to his liver and his pleura, who has been accumulating large right-sided pleural effusions.
He had reaccumulated a large pleural effusion on his right side and was therefore admitted for elective drainage of this effusion, and insertion of a PleurX catheter for future management of his effusion.

The patient became acutely hypoxic on the evening of [**2114-10-4**] secondary to what was felt to be worsening pulmonary edema, given the patient had not been taking his Lasix for several days.
He was diuresed aggressively with Lasix at which time his oxygenation improved, and his mental status and respiratory status improved.
Therefore, he was transferred to the ICU for drainage of his effusion and possible initiation of positive pressure ventilation if necessary.
The patient stabilized with additional diuresis not requiring a BiPAP mask, and on that same day underwent drainage of his pleural effusion, at that time 2.4 liters of clear fluid were drained.
A PleurX catheter was placed.
Extensive discussions were held with the family and eventually the palliative care service, who had been seeing the patient, met with the family and the decision was made that the patient would be placed in hospice palliative care without further aggressive intervention.
He was then set up with discharge to hospice and palliative care on the [**2114-10-8**].
