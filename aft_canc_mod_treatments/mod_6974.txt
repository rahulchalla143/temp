HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  73-year-old male with a history of hormone resistant prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2137**], failed radiation seeds and Lupron therapy presented to he Emergency [**2146-3-22**] with three weeks of progressive shortness of breath.
In the Emergency Room the patient was noted to be hypoxic with paradoxical breaths and he was placed on pressure support mask, ventilation and had three liters of grossly bloody fluid drawn off the from the right lung by the Intensive Care Unit team under supervision of Interventional Pulmonary.
The patient was on four liters nasal cannula at that time sating 98% and seemed symptomatically greatly improved.
The patient was taken to the medical floor for further management but this morning the patient was noted to be tachypneic, hypoxic with an arterial blood gases revealing the following numbers 7.31, 60, 78, with O2 sats in the 94% range on two liters nasal cannula with patient using accessory muscles and the patient was noted to be quite lethargic and somnolent.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit team for further management.
Prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2137**], status post radiation seeds, Lupron treatment, PSA still climbing despite therapy.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q 8.
Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Aspirin 162 mg p.o.
Elanzepine 2.5 mg p.o.
Dulcosate 100 mg p.o.
Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o.
Pleural fluid analysis gram stain, no organism, no growth, no Acid fast bacilli.
Albumin 2.9, cytology pending.
Arterial blood gases: 7.39, 60, 78, on four liters nasal cannula, lactate 0.9.
Mask ventilation was continued to prevent respiratory compromise.
The patient was also found to have a post obstructive pneumonia and aggressive chest physical therapy and bronchoscopy was considered for sputum removal.
It was thought that the patient would not benefit from bronchoscopy and that his pulmonary function was compromised on numerous fronts.
Ultrasound was performed by Interventional Pulmonary service to ascertain if he had re-accumulated any pleural effusion for further thoracentesis and it was found at that time that the patient's right diaphragm was greatly elevated which was the cause of his decreased breath sounds on the right.
The Interventional Pulmonary Team felt there would be no benefit in thoracentesis since pleural effusions were small and probably not compromising the patient's oxygenation and ventilation significantly.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and myself had a thorough discussion with the family, explained these findings and given the fact that the patient's pulmonary function was severely compromised due to metastatic process which could not be resolved it was thought that intubation and cardiac resuscitation would not be appropriate.
After lengthy discussions with the palliative care team and social work the family decided to make Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] measures only and he was placed on a Morphine drip.
All antibiotics and non-essential medications were withdrawn and the patient was taken off of mask ventilation and succumbed to respiratory failure in 24 hours.
