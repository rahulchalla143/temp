He was immediately typed and crossed for multiple units of blood, platelets and FFP.
His history of myeloproliferative disorder was known and he had a CAT scan done at the outside institution which revealed severely injured and spontaneous rupture of his spleen, as well as significant amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
The vessels were doubly ligated with a 0 Vicryl tie and then a 2- 0 suture ligature.
Attention was then placed again to the left upper quadrant where there was still slight diffuse ooze.
Layers of Surgicel were placed and the area was packed again.
post-op the patient was transferred to the ICU for further management  Neuro: Initially the patient was kept sedated until he was ready for extubation.
His Rate was controlled with IV lopressor and then PO once he was tolerating a diet.
He did require a few doses of IV lasix over the course of his hospital stay to decrease some pulmonary edema he developed from his aggressive resuscitation.
GI: He was kept NPO with a NGT initially.
GU: Foley was kept in place until we felt he had diuresed enough.
The catheter was removed and his urine was sent multiple times for UA and culture due to the cloudy appearence of it.
He did require a few more units of platelets due to his drifiting platelet count.
He was vaccinated prior to discharge  ID: He was given a few doses of Keflex for what appeared to intially be a wound infection but later appeared to be dependent erythema.
Once he was taking POs he was started back on his home regimen of glyburide and metformin.
He did not require rehab at this point.
Further clinical and laboratory studies are required for a nosological diagnosis.
Clonality could not be assessed in this case due to extreme paucity of numbers of B-cells.
