In the ED at the [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to have a temperature of 100.2F and was given a dose of ceftriaxone prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**].
He completed a course of augmentin 4 days PTA.
NK T cell lypmhoma of the nose (dx [**9-10**]) - s/p CHOP x 3 with high-dose methotrexate with minimal response - started on anti-EBV treatment (valgancyclovir, AZT) in [**12-10**] - started XRT [**2130-1-11**]   Social History: Pt.
Positives include: [**2-16**]  sinus aspirate Aspergillus [**Country 11730**] [**2-24**]  sinus aspirate Aspergillus [**Country 11730**] (subsequent culture negative) [**3-4**]  + VRE on screening rectal swab [**3-17**]  R neck wound swab positive for VRE  Imaging: [**2130-1-30**]: CT Sinus: IMPRESSION: 1) Left nasal cavity lesion with mixed attenuation, as described above.
2) Persistent and increased interstitial and alveolar opacities bilaterally.
3) New and worsened SUV avidity involving a right spinal accessory lymph node, the pre-carinal lymph node, and two tiny para-vascular lymph nodes.
Interval development of an echogenic nonshadowing structure within the gallbaldder, which likely represents tumefactive sludge ball.
2) Interval iron overload within the liver and spleen, which may be related to prior.
He was started on flagyl as he was also reporting [**2-9**] loose stools per day and had been on antibiotics intermittently for the past 2 months.
He was started on a morphine PCA for pain control.
The patient was started on flagyl for question of c. difficile colitis and cefepime for empiric coverage of neutropenic fevers.
The next morning he was restarted on cefepime and vancomycin and his IVFs were increased.
He continued to be febrile so he was placed on caspofungin.
After starting the antibiotics and  solumedrol, the patient defervesced until HD #10.
developed a low-grade fever in the context of beginning treatment with campath.
The ID team was consulted and recommended altering the pt's antibiotic regimen to include ciprofloxacin, meropenem, ambisome, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
He was maintained on caspofungin.
Pt's antibiotics were weaned gradually, first the cipro, then the ambisome, and the vancomycin.
3. nasal T-cell/NK cell lymphoma - The patient continued to receive his daily radiation treatments while an inpatient.
A PET scan on HD 2 was concerning for a right cervical lymph node foci and 3 liver foci.
The patient received etoposide, cisplatin, solumedrol for a five day course of chemotherapy (hospital days 5 to 9).
He was started on a morphine PCA for increasing pain in the nasal area on the eighth hospital day.
Accordingly, the pt was treated with a course of etoposide, cisplatinum, solumedrol and cytoxan on hospital days 22 to 27.
The cisplatinum was discontinued after 2 days of treatment as the pt developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.6 (FE Na 5.5%, suggesting acute tubular necrosis).
As the pt continued to experience persistent fever, increasing LDH and lymphadenopathy, it was decided to pursue another treatment regimen.
Accordingly, on hospital day 25, the pt began treatment with zidovudine and interferon alfa 2B.
This chemotherapy resulted in further bone marrow suppression.
Due to the ensuing pancreatitis and elevated LFTs, concern was raised for dissemination of lyphoma.
On [**3-21**], a sternal bone marrow aspirate was performed, showing involvement with pt's NK/T cell lymphoma, as well as hemophagocytosis (hemophagocytic syndrome being a known complication of this pt's lymphoma).
4.  respiratory failure - Pt required ventilatory support for a large portion of his hospitalization.
There were several times when he became slightly hypotensive and was bolused with fluids and had some minor SOB.
He then developed SOB and tachypnea that required transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring, and CT showed a diffuse process that was unclear but felt most likely to be capillary leak syndrome.
5.  acute tubular necrosis - pt developed ATN in the setting of chemotherapeutic agents and hypoperfusion, and muddy brown casts were visualized in pt's urine sediment.
He then worsened acutely about 2 days after a dye load for a CT angio was given.
His lasix drip was discontinued at this point, as this has been shown to induce pancreatitis, and his TPN was stopped, as well.
An OJ tube was eventually placed for tube feedings, as he was deemed safe by GI to feed via OJ tube.
He tolerated the tube feeds well.
8.  hyperbilirubinemia - pt's bilirubin climbed during the course of his hospitalization.
9.  neck infection - At the site of an earlier lymph node biopsy on the right side of the patient's neck (which revealed involvement of the lymphoma), he developed swelling and tenderness about one week prior to the end of his hospitalization.
It began to spontaneously drain serosanguinous fluid, which was sent for culture and grew out VRE.
Pt was maintained on daptomcyin during this time.
10.  coagulopathy/DIC - Pt began to ooze from his line sites, as well as the site of surgical drainage of the above nidus of infection.
This was thought to be of multifactorial etiologies, including uremia, infection, prolonged ICU stay, metabolic abnormalities, and long-standing sedatives and morphine.
Pt requested to be kept comfortable near the end of his course, with a morphine drip added to help with sedation and pain relief.
He was placed on pressors, and required more pressor support over the next 48 hours.
Pt's family and the patient decided that given his grave prognosis in the setting of hemophagocytosis and evidence of lymphoma on bone marrow aspirate, that it would be reasonable to extubate the patient and withdraw pressors.
