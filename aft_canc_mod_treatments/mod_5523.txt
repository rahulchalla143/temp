CXR [**2136-7-19**]: Right side chest tube is seen with its tip approximately at posterior 6th rib but the side hole is located at the level of the intercostal space.
Minimal air is seen in the right subcutaneous region, likely following the recent chest tube placement.
A small gas bubble in the right soft tissues, at the site of the previous chest tube insertion, is also resolved.
# hemothorax: Post procedure Hct was 33 down from 39 prior to the RFA.
He was noted to have low UOP with concentrated urine, dry-appearing, and cool to the touch.
He recieved 3L NS with improvement in pressures to 100s and better UOP.
In the MICU, a chest tube was placed by thoracics on [**2136-7-19**].
Pt was on an octreotide gtt in the MICU at the request of liver.
On the floor, he was continued on octreotide subcutaneously for another 2d.

He was discharged on oxycodone 5mg po q6h prn for pain in addition to his home dose of tramadol 50mg po BID.
# cirrhosis: diuretics were held after patient developed hemothorax, but pt was continued on rifaximin, lactulose, and pantoprazole during admission.
He was also placed on levofloxacin for 5d for infection prophylaxis.
His home medication regimen included both omeprazole and pantoproazole, which was thought to be redundant, so pantoprazole was discontinued on discharge and pt was instructed to take only omeprazole 20mg po BID with plans to further discuss this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
He denied a history of afib or being treated for a heart condition, and an EKG taken at the time revealed multifocal atrial tachycardia, so no further work up or treatment was pursued.
