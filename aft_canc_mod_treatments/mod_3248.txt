He was initially diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with diltiazem and treated with BiPAP, his status worsened and he required intubation.
His hypoxia and acidemia gradually improved.
The patient initially in atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on a diltiazem drip with resolution of his RVR.
He was switched to po digoxin and converted to sinus rhythm.
He was started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin.
Bilateral LE ultrasounds were performed, to see if patient warranted consideration of IVC filter placement, but were negative for DVT.
An TTE was done on [**2180-1-28**] to check for heart strain and revealed: mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy LVEF: >55%.
He was switched from enoxaparin to weight based IV heparin drip.
He was bolused NS IV initially with a good response.
Over the course of the following 24 hours, he required pressor support, initially with phenylephrine, then with additionally vasopressin, and norepinephrine titrated to a MAP of 60.
He was started empirically on vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin.
Once a MAP of 60 could not be maintained with maximal doses of 3 pressors, dopamine was added.
the patient subsequently converted to atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates into the 150s and dopamine was stopped.
Given his persistent hypotension and respiratory failure, it was considered highly unlikely that the patient would survive this hospitalization with maximal medical treatment, and nearly impossible that he could return to his prior level of functionality if he did survive.
Per discussion with family, he was initially made DNR, and subsequently made comfort measures only.
He was extubated, and treatment was directed toward patient comfort.
