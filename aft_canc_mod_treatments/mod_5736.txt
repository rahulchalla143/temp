Suggestions for care: Penal wound cleanse with commercial wound cleanser spray and pat dry.
Cover with dry gauze and super absorbent dressing change [**Hospital1 **] and PRN do not allow the dressing to remain saturated.
Apply Critic Aid anti fungal ointment to peri wound skin and groin.
Does not need Accuzyme enzymatic debrider at this time, please d/c Accuzyme.
Midline wound: Cleanse with Wound cleanser then cover with Aquacel Ag to absorb drainage and decrease the bio burden in the wound.

Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to Urology service on [**2113-7-16**] with 3 days of fevers and a history of chronic prostate infections/abscesses s/p brachytherapy on [**11-10**] which was surgically drained on [**2113-7-7**] with a penrose drain left in place draining urine to an ostomy bag as well as a foley catheter.
The patient was begun on ceftriaxone 1g Qday first dosed in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], but remained febrile the evening of HD1.
On HD#2 ([**7-17**]) the pt's antibiotic regimen was switched to Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
An MRI done on [**7-17**] showed a right ischiorectal fossa abscess adjacent to the right prostate gland which was successfully drained on the same day under CT guidance and a pigtail drain was left in place.
On HD#5 ([**7-20**]) the patient underwent a cystectomy and prostatectomy  and an ilial conduit urinary diversion.
Vancomycin, gentamicin, and flagyl were continued perurology recs.
Pain control was maintained with IV morphine.
He was monitored during his ICU course with gentle re-orientation and transferred to the floor.
Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital1 **] Oncologist)was [**Hospital1 4221**] on [**7-27**]:  Patient is s/p splenectomy and therefore will have elevated WBC chronically.
He was placed on Broad Spectrum IV antibiotics including Meropenem, Daptomycin, and Zosyn for his worsening wounds while awaiting culture and sensitivities.
The Daptomycin was switched to Vancomycin on [**8-8**] due to rising creatinine and possible acute tubular necrosis from daptomycin use.
It resolved within a week with antibiotic treatment.
#GI: Patient was on TPN for several weeks in order to improve his nutrition(pre-albumin of 7) and wound healing.
He was followed closeely by nutrition who optimized his nutritional status with TPN caloric counting, adjusting carb/fat/protein ratio's daily based on Chem 10 results and adding zinc and vitamin C to daily regime.
No aspiration was seen and he was able to start PO's for Pleasure, and keep TPN for primary nutrition.
A PEG tube was an idea that nutrition originally suggested.
However, his appetite improved to the point where his caloric PO intake was sufficient to maintain his nutrition without requiring tube feeds.
TPN was stopped prior to discharge to the rehab facility.
The first wound a midline abdominal wound was due to failure of closure after surgical incision.
In addition to the antibiotic regimine described above, the wound nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and asked to follow this patient.
Both wounds were packed three times daily using Accuzyme and curlex AMD rolls, which aided in wound debridement and promoted growth of healthy tissue.
Plastic Surgery was also [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] regarding the penile wound, for possibility of placing a wound VAC.
They did not think he was a good candidate for a wound VAC given difficulty of placement and wound improvement without it.
See pertinent results section for wound care suggestions.
The Daptomycin was stopped and Vancomycin was started.
The central line was removed and a PICC line was placed on [**7-27**] under interventional radiology guidance for long term TPN.
