Admission Date:  [**2134-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14197**] Chief Complaint: High-grade sarcoma, left femur, status post fracture and intramedullary nailing with a locking nail, with extensive soft tissue mass with soft tissue seeding, status post preoperative chemotherapy and resection of presumed lung metastases and a brain metastasis.
Radical resection of entire left femur and soft tissue     extension, including internal fixation device.
We had planned a resection about 6 weeks ago, but because of a question of progression of her lung metastases, she underwent a thoracotomy.
She was now felt to be fit for resection of her femur.
It should also be noted that she had a DVT at the time of diagnosis and was treated initially with anticoagulation, but because of her brain metastasis and bleed, an umbrella was placed.
We had discussed extensively with her and her husband about local control and the option of attempting a resection versus a hip disarticulation.
We entertained resecting the vessels as well, but that would require the need for significant bolus anticoagulation and an even longer procedure, which we were not sure she could handle, and, therefore, we elected to attempt the resection and, if the vessels were involved, we would plan on a hip disarticulation.
59 yo F with metastatic chondroblastic sarcoma of left femur s/p intramedullary nail fixation and chemo, DVT on lovenox who was scheduled to have resection of her left femur by ortho today however complained of right eye blurred vision and found to have a new likely hemorrhagic brain metastasis.

The constellation of these findings raises the possibility of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, although an underlying intra-axial mass, representing metastatis, with associated hemorrhage cannot be excluded.

Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
