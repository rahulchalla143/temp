The patient's chest CT revealed enlarged prevascular lymph nodes measuring 1.4 cm, as well as extensive bullous emphysematous changes of the right lung, and several bullae of the left lower apex, as well as nodular opacity of the left lung apex which could represent a scar or malignant process, and slight thickening of the distal esophagus,  Multiple findings in the abdominal cuts which were previously described included porta caval and ................ lymphadenopathy, and bilateral adrenal gland masses.
General Surgery was consulted, and the patient was sent for excisional biopsy of the left neck lymphadenopathy which was performed without complication on [**4-8**], and was read as metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The patient and his wife underwent several prolonged and detailed discussions with Hematology/Oncology regarding the possible treatment modalities versus withdraw of care and Hospice, and ultimately chose at their request to be discharged home with Hospice care with the emphasis made on comfort in a palliative mode.
The patient also required intermittent transfusions to maintain his hematocrit within the desired range of greater than 30.
Please note that in discussion with Hematology/Oncology and the patient, the consensus opinion has been reached that no further treatment of DIC or anemia or blood loss is indicated at this time.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Please see page 1 for complete medication list at the time of discharge to include medications only for maintaining the patient's comfort.
