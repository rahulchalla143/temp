Admission Date:  [**2166-9-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-9-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2099-9-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old man with a history of metastatic gastric carcinoma who was recently started on hospice care and then presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department on [**2166-9-7**] with severe left hip pain and inability to ambulate.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and aspirin.
Fentanyl patch 50 micrograms transdermal q 72 hours.
Hydromorphone 4 mg po prn pain.
Pantoprazole 40 mg po q.d.
Metoclopramide 10 mg po prn nausea.
Warfarin 2 mg po q.h.s.
Diltiazem 60 mg po q.i.d.
Compazine 5 to 10 mg po q 6 hours prn.
Cosopt eye drops one drop to each eye q.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Although the patient had recently been initiated on hospice care, the decision was made for the patient to undergo a left hemiarthroplasty for repair of his left femoral neck fracture, given that this procedure would give the patient the best chance of early ambulation with full weight bearing.
Given his significant anemia on presentation to the [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was also transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells prior to the operative procedure.
Although this procedure was uncomplicated from an orthopedics point of view, while in the Operating Room the patient reportedly dropped his oxygen saturation to 75 to 80%.
A repeat chest x-ray done following the procedure demonstrated diffuse, patchy opacification of the right middle and lower lobes consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Given the appearance of this chest x-ray and the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he was deemed to be a poor candidate for weaning off of mechanical ventilation and was therefore transferred to the MICU for continued monitoring.
Respiratory failure:  As noted above the patient aspirated coffee ground emesis (likely gastric contents given his history of gastric cancer) during his left hemiarthroplasty and was therefore intubated for further airway protection.
He initially required frequent suctioning of coffee ground emesis, but he gradually required less and less suctioning following his successful extubation on [**2166-9-15**].
He was continued on his baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications (Fluticasone, Salmeterol, and Combivent inhalers).
He was also started on Clindamycin 600 mg intravenous q 8 hours following his orthopedic procedure for empiric coverage of his aspiration pneumonia.
This medication was changed to an oral formulation prior to his discharge from the hospital.
His gastric cancer was the presumed source of his coffee ground emesis.
Although his hematocrit was found to be 20 on admission he was subsequently transfused a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells throughout the admission and his hematocrit subsequently increased to 32.
He was continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg intravenous q 12 hours given his coffee ground emesis.
Left femoral neck fracture:  At the time of discharge the patient was postoperative day number four following a left hemiarthroplasty for his left femoral neck fracture.
He began working with physical therapy on [**9-15**], the physical therapist recommended inpatient rehabilitation with transition to home hospice care following discharge from the hospital.
Although the patient ideally would have been resumed on anticoagulative therapy with Warfarin following his orthopedic procedure, given that he was having continued coffee ground emesis presumably from his gastric cancer, the patient was not restarted on anticoagulative medications following his orthopedic procedure.
He was instead maintained on sequential compression devices of his bilateral lower extremities for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
At the time of discharge, however, the patient no longer had coffee ground emesis and he was therefore restarted on heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had a transient episode of hypotension while on a propofol drip while he was still intubated.
Although he had previously taken Diltiazem 60 mg po q.i.d.
for a history of hypertension the patient was not hypertensive during this admission and this medication was not restarted.
Plans were made to reinitiate this medication following his discharge from the hospital.
Neurological:  The patient continued to complain of abdominal pain as well as left hip and knee pain postoperatively.
His Fentanyl patch was therefore increased to 75 micrograms q 72 hours and the patient was initiated on intravenous morphine 1 to 2 mg q one hours prn as needed for pain.
FEN:  The patient was maintained on maintenance intravenous fluids throughout this hospitalization given his relatively poor po intake.
He was started on a clear liquid diet on the day prior to discharge, however, the patient did not have significant po intake during this hospitalization.
He was continued on Clindamycin as noted above.
DISCHARGE PLACEMENT:  The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation nursing facility for further physical therapy to increase his strength and gait mobility.
The plan was for subsequent discharge to home hospice following this rehabilitation stay.
Fentanyl patch 75 micrograms q 72 hours.
Fluticasone inhaler three puffs b.i.d.
Salmeterol inhaler two puffs b.i.d.
Clindamycin 300 mg po q.i.d.
Pantoprazole 40 mg po b.i.d.
Brimonidine drops to each eye q 8 hours.
Dorzolamide drops to each eye q.d.
Morphine sulfate 1 to 2 mg intravenous q one hour prn pain.
He was also given a telephone number for the [**Hospital **] Clinic to follow up with them as directed for further management of his left hemiarthroplasty following his left femoral neck fracture.
