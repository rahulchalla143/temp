ECG ([**5-27**]): Atrially paced rhythm and occasional intrinsic atrial activation with A-V conduction and A-V conduction delay.
Previously placed biliary stent was seen in the major papilla.
The stent was removed with a rat tooth forceps.
Post stent pull a sphincterotomy was seen.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon catheter 4.
A 60 mm by 10mm Covered biliary wall stent (Lot No [**Serial Number 78585**]) biliary stent was placed successfully across the distal biliary stricture with flow of pus and obstructed bile.
