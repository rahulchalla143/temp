She reportedly woke up at midnight with sharp sub-sternal 10/10 chest pain.
She was given ASA 325 mg and Morphine.
Her EKG showed STE in II, III, and avF, with deep depressions in I and aVL and v2, so she was started on Plavix and a heparin gtt and was sent to the cardiac cath lab.
In the cath lab, patient was found to have a proximally occluded RCA and underwent thrombectomy and BMS placement.
During the case, patient was hypotensive, suggestive of a RV infarct, and receieved atropine and dopamine for SBP 60/40.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for some DOE, which she attributes to chemotherapy, and the absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -  Locally advanced pancreatic cancer with radiologic evidence of metastases to lungs, on gemcitabine chemotherapy GERD s/p appendectomy s/p hysterectomy .
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old woman with h/o metatstatic pancreatic cancer who presented from home with chest pain consistent with inferior STEMI, now status post thrombectomy and BMS to proximal RCA.
# STEMI: Pt now s/p inferior/RV STEMI with some hemodynamic instability in cath lab, s/p thrombectomy and BMS to RCA.
She had some hemodynamic instability in the cath lab requiring dopamine and atropine, these were attributed to a vagal reperfusion response in the setting of stenting her RCA occlusion.
After PCI, she was continued on integrellin for 18 hours.
She was started on plavix and aspirin which she was instructed to continue taking daily until otherwise told by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was started on atorvastatin 80 mg which was switched to crestor 40 mg daily on discharge- lipid panel was checked (see below).
# PUMP: S/P inferior/RV STEMI with hemodynamic instability in cath lab requiring atropine and dopamine.
She was gradually started on metoprolol and lisinopril and had an echocardiogram (see above).
# HTN - Remained normotensive after her RV MI without any periods of hypotension.
Her home HCTZ was discontinued and she was started on lisinopril 5 mg daily.
Her metoprolol was downtitrated to 37.5 mg daily in the extended release formulation.
Was discharged on crestor 40 mg daily.
Is now s/p cycle 13 of gemcitabine on [**3-31**] with discussion of different regimens in the future pending response.
Likely secondary to pre-renal etiology in setting recent MI as it improved to baseline with fluid rehydration.
