During the initial transplantation the patient received large volumes of FFP and platelets and 3 units RBCs.
Also of note there was initially congestion in the liver which was relieved with side-to-side caval cavostomy in the infrahepatic location for additional venous outflow.
A Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed, with a Roux tube left in place.
The GDA was religated and the side-to-side cavostomy from during his original procedure did not have evidence of outflow obstruction.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18096**] catheter, TPA and heparin were all utilized to clear the clot.
There was some concern for elevated velocity in the main hepatic vein, and there was mild elevation in the LFTs, and bilirubin, however, without intervention, all values were down-trending daily and no further surgery was done.
The previously noted kinks in donor celiac artery less apparent and there was dimunitive but patent L hepatic artery, RHA is diminutive but patent and IVC and PV anastomosis are patent.
Cholangiogram obtained of the existing Roux done per pathway on POD 5 does not demonstrate the drain sitting within the roux limb.
The drain has been capped.
The patient received routine induction immunosuppression, and daily prograf levels and medication adjustments were made.
The patient was tolerating the cellcept, and prednisone taper was slightly accelerated and he was discharged to home on 15 mg prednisone.
The patient was placed on aspirin and plavix to maintain patency of the vasculature as these were arterial issues, although he was initially maintained on a heparin drip through POD 8.
Liver biopsies collected during both post operative surgeries showed no evidence of rejection, and no necrosis.
