He was originally fluid resuscitated given his low blood pressures and appearance of intravascular depletion, and when his Na did not respond to this he was switched to diureses after it was found that he was 10 lbs over his baseline weight.
His sodium improved to 121 at the time of transfer to the floor after being fluid restricted to 1.5L and given 40 IV lasix.
His diuresis was continued in the MICU until he could be transferred to the floor (notably, his mental status was at baseline when he was sent to the floor).
Given the suspicion of poor absorption from gut edema, the patient was switched to a PO dose of torsemide (40mg) equivalent to his former PO lasix dose (80mg).
Of note, multiple urine electrolyte studies were used to guide diuresis and the patient was never terribly sodium avid, even with extensive diuresis.
Given that the patient had no evidence of acute cardiac decompensation due to intrinsic disease, medication noncompliance, or dietary indiscretion, it was thought that this was largely due to the patient's intra-abdominal neoplasm.
#Leukocytosis- patient had elevated white blood cell count and was found to meet SIRS crieria so he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were stopped after transfer to the ICU, stabilization of vitals, and an unproductive search for source of infection.
#Diabetes- patient is on large doses of lantus at home 42U qhs, and his blood sugars while in the MICU were low without his home dose of glargine so he was continued on a sliding scale.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Hyponatremia: the patient was discharged with a prescription for a blood draw to be done on the following day to follow his sodium.
# Pancreatic mass: the work-up as described above will be faxed to Drs.
