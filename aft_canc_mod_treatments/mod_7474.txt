Evidently, the patient had been inadvertently taking Coumadin thinking that it was darvocet, which she was taking for low back pain.
Initial management included decadron to decrease brain edema, phenytoin to decrease the risk of seizure, mannitol to decrease intracranial pressure, and fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K to reverse the coagulation deficit.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks, neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head CTs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Multiple myeloma with light chain disease for approximately eight years treated with Thalidomide.
2) Secondary end-stage renal disease, now on hemodialysis three times per week.
3) Multiple thromboses of upper extremity AV graft, status post multiple thrombectomies.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has GI upset from demerol and percocet.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  1) Thalidomide 100 mg po qd, 2) ativan with hemodialysis 1 mg tid, 3) Premarin 0.3 mg po qd, 4) Synthroid 0.25 mg po qd, 5) Effexor 150 mg po qd, 6) Coumadin 2.5 mg po qd, 7) darvocet prn, 8) PhosLo 667 mg po tid.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 123, potassium 5.0, chloride 84, BUN 54, creatinine 6.2, glucose 136.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks, neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head CTs.
The subdural hematoma was treated conservatively with decadron to reduce brain edema, rapid correction of the INR with fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusion to increase the platelets and keep the level above 100,000, DDAVP to correct uremic platelet dysfunction.
Therefore, the patient was continued on phenytoin throughout the admission with modification of the dosing based on free phenytoin levels.
Therefore, the patient was intubated and placed on a propofol drip.
In addition, the patient had been maintained on intravenous fluids after admission to the neurological service.
After extubation, the patient was noted to have bulb stridor and wheezing.
The stridor was treated with racemic epinephrine, heliox, decadron, and a discontinuation of her ACE inhibitor.
The bronchospasm was responsive to albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
After that point, the patient's wheezing steadily improved and nebulizers were weaned.
The patient was started on low dose aspirin after consultation with the neurosurgical team.
Therefore, the patient was started on a 7-day course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone with plan for at least a 4-week course of ceftriaxone to cover for the possibility of endocarditis, especially considering the patient's valvular disease with mitral regurgitation.
The plan was to follow-up in two to three weeks with GI for colonoscopy and EGD.
The patient was continued on dialysis three times per week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, during her admission.
The patient was also started on calcium carbonate for decreased calcium levels and high phosphate levels.
8) ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is being maintained on levothyroxine.
In addition, due to the patient being maintained on dexamethasone, finger stick blood sugars were obtained daily, and the patient was on regular insulin sliding scale.
9) HEMATOLOGY:  As noted above, the patient's INR was rapidly corrected with fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K upon admission.
In addition, the patient's low platelet levels were corrected with platelet transfusion.
All anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents were initially held.
The patient's Thalidomide was discontinued for its procoagulant effects.
In addition, the patient was started on low dose aspirin after discovery of slightly increased troponin levels.
If that head CT showed no progression of the subdural hematoma or new bleed, then anticoagulation with Coumadin could be restarted two weeks later.
12) ACCESS:  The patient was given a central line during the stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Prior to discharge, the patient received a PICC line for administration of long-term ceftriaxone for streptococcal bovis bacteremia.
8) Epileptiform electroencephalogram activity.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Ceftriaxone 1 gm qd for 26 more days (total course of 4 weeks), 2) diltiazem 60 mg tid, 3) pantoprazole 40 mg qd, 4) aspirin 325 mg qd, 5) levothyroxine 25 mcg qd, 6) dexamethasone 2 mg qd for 2 weeks, to be continued until after repeat head CT in 2 weeks, at that point a neurologist should be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding tapering the dexamethasone, 7) phenytoin 150 mg q am, 200 mg q pm, 8) calcium carbonate 1,000 mg qd, 9) albuterol/ipratropium 103-18 mcg aerosol 1-2 puffs inhalation q 4-6 h prn shortness of breath or wheezing.
Any change (such as focal signs, increased somnolence) should prompt a repeat head CT to rule out repeat bleed or increased edema from nontolerance of dexamethasone tapering.
If this shows no repeat bleed and gastrointestinal work-up is negative, then two weeks later (four weeks from discharge), the patient can be started on anticoagulation again.
Gastrointestinal follow-up needs to be obtained for a colonoscopy and gastroduodenoscopy in approximately two weeks.
