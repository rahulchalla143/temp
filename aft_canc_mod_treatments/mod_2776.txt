HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the surgical service and on [**6-26**], underwent a neck exploration with biopsy of the central portion of the thyroid and tracheostomy for an obstructing goiter.
On the 31st, he underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for nutrition.
His extremities were completely demarcated at the mid thigh and given his degree of progressive renal failure/anuria, hypotension requiring pressors, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support and peripheral vascular disease with ischemia of both lower extremities that was going to require bilateral lower extremity amputations, his family deemed that they did not want to pursue any further aggressive treatment options and the patient was made comfort measures only.
