portal-biliary fistula, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis w/ likely Klatskin tumor    Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2152-4-3**]: PTC placement [**2152-4-3**]: Hepatic angiogram  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 48 year old Laotian man with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with a possible portal-biliary fistula, obstructive jaundice, and pancreatitis s/p ERCP with stent [**2152-3-31**] to evaluate likely Klatskin tumor.
This was concerning for a Klatskin tumor and, given the patient's obstructive biliary picture, he was taken for ERCP on [**2152-3-31**].
At this time his R and L ducts were dilated, a sphincterotomy was performed, and a 15cm 10Fr stent was placed in the R ductal system (the L was unable to be stented due to tight stricture).
He received 2U FFP and 1U PRBC prior to transfer, and he has been hemodynamically stable without tachycardia or hypotension.

A stent had been placed in the right biliary system but the left system remained obstructed at the time of transfer.
On [**4-3**] he underwent a hepatic angiogram which showed no evidence of arterial biliary fistula, but there is a small area of contrast pooling seen on portal venogram in segment VII adjacent to endoscopically placed biliary drain done the same day.
He also had successful embolization of segment VII  portal vein with Gelfoam and successful placement of external left biliary drain.
He was treated with one day of Unasyn and Flagyl and was then switched to PO Cipro for prophylaxis.
The PTC drain was opened to bag drainage and draining 100-200 cc daily.
Interventional radiology was to attempt a second PTC drain on [**4-5**] through the left side following stent removal by ERCP.
The patient, through the interpretive services and discussion with his family and the hepatobiliary team has decided to forego these procedures at this time.
He was noted to be hypertensive to the 160's systolic on the morning of [**4-6**] and he was given one dose of IV lopressor and then started on PO beta blockade.
