HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with multiple medical problems with the past medical history significant for gastric cancer status post resection with vagotomy, prostate cancer with likely bony metastasis, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, chronic anemia, questionable history of gastrointestinal bleeds with several esophagogastroduodenoscopies in the past showing Candidal esophagitis with nonbleeding fundal polyps, and dementia thought to be secondary to Alzheimer disease.
He was treated for his pneumonia with Levaquin and then changed to Azithromycin and sent to Core for rehabilitation on [**2147-10-4**].
While there, the patient had continued treatment of pneumonia and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**10-16**], which showed esophagitis with nonbleeding fundal polyp.
He had been started on TPN for unknown number of days, which was being given through a PIC line, and on [**10-28**], grew out MRSA from blood and E. coli from urine.
The patient was started on Cefepime on [**2147-10-30**].
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Fluconazole on [**2147-11-4**] at [**Hospital1 5042**].
He was given two units of packed red blood cells at that time with repeat hematocrit on [**11-8**], still at 19.
In the emergency department here, the patient's temperature was 100.7 rectally and he was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s; this responded to an IV fluid bolus.
A femoral triple-lumen was placed and NG-tube placement was attempted, but not successful.
Gastric cancer, status post resection with vagotomy.
Fluconazole 200 mg IV q.d., day #1 of admission.
Vancomycin 1-g IV q.d.
Cefepime 1-g IV b.i.d.
Bupropion 100 mg b.i.d.
Tylenol p.r.n.
IV lipids 20% at 16 cc per hour.
Calcitonin nasal spray.
Differential showed 93% neutrophils, 3% bands, 4% lymphs; PT 13.9; INR 1.3; PTT 37; albumin 1.6; sodium 153; potassium 3.5; chloride 122; bicarbonate 122; BUN 80 and creatinine 1.1; glucose 100; serum osmolality 328; calcium 7.2; magnesium 2.1; phosphorus 3.9; CK 42; troponin less than 0.3; ALT 27; AST 33; alkaline phosphatase 110; amylase 80; total bilirubin 0.4.
Blood cultures at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**11-24**], had gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, as well as yeast, growing two separate sets of blood cultures.
He was started on Vancomycin and Amphotericin B as well as Ceftazidime.
Therefore, his dose was held for two days and his renal function was watched closely.
The patient was started on AmBisome on [**2147-11-12**].
The Ceftazidime was discontinued on [**11-12**] as there was no evidence of gram-negative infection.
The patient was continued on AmBisome for his fungal infection, which was speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis.
The patient's Flagyl was discontinued on [**11-13**], as there was no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and repeated stool samples were negative for C. difficile.
Therefore, the duration of his treatment was extended to six weeks's total.
GI:  The patient was admitted with GI bleed with a decreased hematocrit and bright red blood per rectum, by report at [**Hospital1 5042**].
Until then, they felt that the GI bleeding should be treated conservatively with blood transfusions, as needed, as well as IV Protonix.
In addition, the patient has tested positive again for C. difficile on [**11-22**], and he has been restarted on Flagyl for this.
FEN:  The patient was very complicated regarding his nutritional status since admission and NG tube was attempted on admission, but unable to be placed, likely secondary to his poor anatomy, due to previous gastric resection.
So, the patient had no nutrition at all from [**2147-11-8**] until [**2147-11-20**].
The patient had been a very difficulty access problem, as he had several areas of cellulitis on his extremities.
So, PIC line placement was difficult.
A PIC line was finally placed on [**11-15**], but it was only able to be placed into the axillary vein as there was closed in the right subclavian vein, therefore, it could be used for antibiotics only and not for TPN.
The PIC line was only in place until [**11-19**], at which time the patient pulled out the PIC line himself.
Therefore, on [**11-20**], interventional radiology was consulted and a new triple lumen catheter was placed in the left IJ.
The patient was finally started on QuickMix TPN at that time.
He had received hypotonic fluids during his hospital stay, which improved his sodium down to a low of 143.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital stay after being hydration on admission for his presenting hypotension.
He did have one episode of CHF after receiving blood on [**2147-11-15**].
He was given a small amount of Lasix with good effect.
Morphine for this, but has really no recurrences and has not required Morphine since that time.
The creatinine was watched closely on admission, especially given the fact that he was to receive a huge dose of Amphotericin.
The creatinine had been steady from 1.2 to 1.5 being started being started on the AmBisome.
She repeatedly does activities, which the nursing staff has asked her not to do, including, transporting the patient herself, feeding the patient when asked not to, rubbing unauthorized medications on the patient's skin, namely honey and vodka, suctioning the patient so forcefully that he either has hemoptysis or vomits secondary to her inducing a gag reflex and attempting to suction the patient with a Foley catheter in his nose, which resulted in epistaxis.
However, during the hospital admission it was uncovered that the patient also had a son, [**Name (NI) 5045**].
A Lidoderm patch has been placed on the patient's neck q.d., which seems to have relieved his pain.
He does not tolerate physical therapy and they deemed him to be not a rehabilitation candidate at this time.
DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be evaluated for nursing home placement as he does not appear to be a candidate for acute rehabilitation at this time.
Metronidazole 500 mg IV q.8h.
Protonix 40 mg IV q.d.
Lidoderm 5% patch to the back of neck, q.d.
AmBisome 200 mg IV q twenty-four hours.
Heparin 5000 units .................... b.i.d.
Tylenol 650 mg p.o.4-6h.p.r.n.
