Admission Date:  [**2123-12-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress, fevers, sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-4**] -intubation -placement of left internal jugular central venous line -placement of right radial arterial line  [**12-5**] -placement of right femoral line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 64263**] is a 69 year old gentleman with CLL x10 years s/p 2 blast crises this year.
He was previously treated with Rituximab and Fludarabine several years ago but did not repeat this regimen due to anemia/thrombocytopenia.
3 wks prior to admission, and prednisone 60mg that was initiated 4-5 days ago.
CLL dx 10 yrs ago w/ 2 blast crises- previously treated with Rituximab and Fludarabine, most recently treated with 2.
Obstructive sleep apnea, on C-PAP 3.
[**2123-12-5**]:        11.5 462.6>---------< 46     95% lymphs        34.6  ABG: 7.13/ 45.7/ 64/ 16/ -14   Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o gentleman with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia s/p chemotherapy and recent use of prednisone, was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fevers of 104, sepsis and respiratory distress.
Given patient's immunocompromised state due to advanced cancer and prednisone use, infectious etiologies of fever are most likely.
Another possibility is aggressive transformation of his malignancy such as [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation which would be characterized by high fever, elevated LDH and association with previous fludarabine use.
He was given a cooling blanket and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin and zosyn) were initiated.
Patient was pan-cultured, and given IVF for hydration with 1 L NS boluses.
He developed increased work of breathing and went into atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 160s, refractory to low-dose diltiazem, so amiodarone drip was started.
Patient eventually went into sinus rhythm on amiodarone drip, but due to oxygen desaturations and increased work of breathing, decision was made to intubate.
He was given fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
A left internal jugular central line and right radial arterial line were placed emergently due to hypotension.
Vasopressin was initiated as a second pressor, but only had minimal effect on blood pressure.
Dopamine was initiated as a 3rd pressor due to systolic pressures in the 60s-70s.
Patient was given multiple fluid boluses over night with very little effect on blood pressure and urine output.
Blood cultures returned positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and patient's vancomycin was changed to linezolid as per ID recommendations, for better VRE coverage.
His zosyn was changed to meropenem for broad coverage and clindamycin was added due to its inhibitory effects on bacterial protein synthesis and therefore, action against endotoxins.
Patient continued to do poorly, and emergent femoral line was placed due to concern of inaccurate readings from right radial arterial line.
