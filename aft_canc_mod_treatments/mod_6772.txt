The surgical service was consulted and recommended a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube for drainage, and the tube was placed by interventional radiology on [**2103-2-17**] without complication.
She was started empirically on IV vacnomycin and zosyn while bile cultures were pending.
She was never intubated and remained hemodynamically stable, although she did not need all home hypertension medicines while in-house (she was kept on metoprolol, isosorbide dinitrate and amlodipine, HCTZ was held).
Lung exam revealed wheezes, and she was started on ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers with good response.
On [**2103-2-21**], vancomycin was discontinued; she defervesced and had improvement of her leukocytosis on zosyn (WBC from 25.2 on [**2-17**] to 6.6 on discharge).
Upon discharge, the cholecystostomy tube was left in place for ongoing drainage and will be left in place indefinitely until she has the out-patient surgery follow-up appointment.
She is also to remain on IV zosyn (with a PICC line in place) until she returns for surgical follow-up, at which point the antibiotics and tube may be discontinued pending clinical improvement.

She was not admitted on anticoagulation and was kept on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while in the hospital.
She was continued on olanzapine while in the hospital.
The need for HCTZ and increasing doses of current meds should be readdressed at her primay care follow-up appointment.
The risks and benefits of long-term anticoagulation should be readdressed in primary care follow-up.
No changes were made to her out-patient regimen at this time.
(5) The need for further zosyn treatment and cholecystostomy tube should be addressed at her sugical follow-up appointment, as well as need for surgical cholecystectomy.

You have been put on antibiotics through the vein for your gallbladder infection.
They will decide whether you need to remain on antibiotics and whether the tube can come out at that visit.
You have been started on a potassium supplement.
You have been on a supplement in the past and were restarted on this because your potassium levels were low in the hospital.
This is to follow-up on your low potassium levels and adrenal mass.
