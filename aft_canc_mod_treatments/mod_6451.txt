You were hospitalized because you were vomiting blood after your endoscopic ultrasound procedure.
Your blood levels stabilized after these transfusions.
In the ICU, the gastrointestinal doctors saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and performed an endoscopic grastroduodenscopy to look for active bleeding in your stomach - they found no active bleeding and no signs of old bleeding, which led them to believe that your blood loss was due to the endoscopic ultrasound procedure you had happened several hours before the bleeding started.
You will need to continue your antibiotics as prescribed by the gastrointestinal doctors.
We temporarily held some of your blood thinners and anti-hypertensive medications when you were losing blood, but we are restarting MOST - but not ALL - upon discharge.
Please take all of your other medications as previously prescribed.
