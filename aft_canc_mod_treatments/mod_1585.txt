#) Tracheostomy Replacement: on presentation patient initially had bleeding around his trach site, and his ET tube was found to be full of clots, in the ED, his tracheotomy tube replaced.
On HD 2, the tracheotomy tube migrated into the false passage and required a second procedure to secure the airway.
Which was complicated by a left pneumothorax seen on follow-up chest xray, and a chest tube was placed by the SICU team.
The chest tube was removed [**10-17**] with small residual apical pneumothorax, patient will need repeat chest x-ray in [**2-3**] days after discharge to make sure the pneumothorax has not worsened.
#) Nutrition: Continuous tube feeds were transitioned to bolus tube feeds and the patient appeared to tolerate well with low residuals.
#) Hypertension: overall his BP was well controlled but he was hypertensive in the morning, so he may need his medications split to morning and evening meds.

The Otolaryngology Surgeons and Interventional Pulmonology doctors helped replace your tracheostomy tube so that you should be able to breathe better.
Your tracheostomy tube was replaced with a longer tube to help prevent this from happening again in the future.
During the replacement of your tracheostomy, the procedure was complicated by a pneumothorax (left lung collapse) and you had a chest tube placed.
After the lung reinflated you were able to have the chest tube removed.
During your time in the hospital you completed your course of vancomycin for your prior pneumonia and PICC line was taken out.
