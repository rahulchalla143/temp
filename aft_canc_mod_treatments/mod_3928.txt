She was diagnosed with an ileus and NGT was placed to suction.
She was started on TPN during this time and has continued on this.
She has had continued decreased urine output that has not responded to .5-1 L boluses but has responded to IV lasix.
She has been markedly hypokalemic and has required aggressive repletion.

Surgical clips are seen in the gallbladder fossa consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
One measures 17 x 36 mm and the second one 12 mm in diameter.
A nasogastric tube lies in suitable position with its tip in the distal stomach.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in the urinary bladder.
She also has tumor in right humerus and should be moved carefully given high risk of pathologic fracture of right humerus.
She will receive radiation to her arms by rad onc as described below.
She was treated with anzimet and simethicone with some relief.
Her diet should be advanced as tolerated and TPN weaned as more po's are tolerated.
Diarrhea should be monitored and anti-motility agents held.
She was diuresed with lasix 20mg IV tid and showed significant improvement.
She was treated with RTC albuterol and atrovent nebs and improved clinically.
Volume status should be evaluated and maintenance dose of lasix 40mg po qd should be adjusted as needed.
She was given morphine and ativan but still was unable to tolerate the exam.
Subsequently, they tried to perform the planning/marking procedure to prepare her arms for radiation, however, she was unable to tolerate this procedure as well.
Her rad onc doctor decided it would be best to wait until she was more comfortable to proceed with further radiation.
She may need to be admitted after this for repeated rad onc treatments.
## HTN: BP's were originally slightly high and ACEi and beta blocker were restarted and BP's returned to good range.
With diuresis her BP's started to trend more on the lower side, and these meds were held.
She remained afebrile and foley was changed and pt remained asymptomatic.
##Hypokalemia: the pt developed diarrhea and required aggressive potassium regimen to keep her K level up.
Likely while she remains on lasix she will need some potassium replacement.
## FEN: the pt was started on TPN and has continued on this while she has not been able to take adequate po's.
