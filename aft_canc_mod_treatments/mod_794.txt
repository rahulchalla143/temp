HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old white female with recent new upper lobe mass in the left lung, liver masses, as well as spine metastases seen on the recent MRI.
The ultimate diagnosis of small cell lung cancer was made and the patient had been treated with cisplatin and etoposide.
In regards to the cervical spine, the study was limited since only sagittal T2 images could be obtained because of patient discomfort.
Further hematology/oncology workup included a bone marrow biopsy on [**2191-2-10**].
By immunohistochemistry, the cells were diffusely positive for pankeratin and exhibit extremely weak diffuse immunoreactivity for synaptophysin.
The remaining of the 10% of the space had positive cellularity of 80% with trilineage hematopoiesis and increased M:E ratio.
The cells were positive for cytokeratin, very rare tumor cells were positive for chromogranin.
Since diagnosis, the patient had received chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide.
During the hospital course, the patient had received blood cell transfusions with red blood cells.
She also had platelet transfusion for low platelets as well.
Her 02 saturations on [**2191-2-7**] had gone down to the mid 80s on room air which had improved to the low 90s on nasal cannula.
At this time, the patient was noted to have a temperature to 101.7 and had been started on a ten day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for the infiltrate and fever.
Otherwise, regarding the remainder of the patient's pulmonary course, she had undergone bronchoscopy on [**2191-2-9**].
Since then, the patient had been noted to have an increase in shortness of breath and increasing tachypnea with 02 saturations decreasing to the mid 80s on 6 liters which had improved on nonrebreather.
The patient's pulmonary status had improved during this hospital course and oxygen had been decreased as she had tolerated this.
There may have been a pulmonary edema; however, given that the patient spiked a fever at this time, the development of the pulmonary infiltrates had developed, she had been started on levofloxacin and clindamycin for a ten day course for treatment of a potential aspiration pneumonia.
She had been started on Valtrex for these lesions.
The patient had developed thrush in her mouth and had been started on fluconazole for the thrush.
After the patient had completed her treatment course with levofloxacin and clindamycin for the pneumonia, she developed a fever to 102.1 on [**2191-2-18**] in the evening.
For febrile neutropenia, she had been started on cefepime and Flagyl for coverage of febrile neutropenia.
