HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2110-5-30**], and taken directly to the operating room where a radical cystoprostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and neo-bladder creation was performed.
During the procedure, the patient had a 20French Foley catheter placed.
He also received two units of autologous red blood cells and one unit of packed red blood cells for an estimated blood loss of 1300cc.
The patient also had renal stent placed which postoperatively was confirmed in place by KUB.
The patient received three days of perioperative Cefazolin and Flagyl.
He also had an epidural in place and a nasogastric tube in place as well as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
The patient tolerated the procedure quite well and was sent to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight observation secondary to the large amount of fluid the patient received intraoperatively.
The patient was also seen by pulmonary and critical care medicine who indicated the patient may have been showing signs of sympathetic overactivity and recommended the beta blocker if hypertension developed.
Over the course of the first night, it was evident that the patient's baseline mental status deteriorated secondary to the surgery and the patient managed to pull his nasogastric tube, [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] tube, intravenous out as well as his Foley partially out.

He also received another unit of packed red blood cells secondary to anemia.

Haldol and narcotics were avoided as much as possible.
The sitter was discontinued and the patient appeared to tolerate the independence well without causing problems with his Foley catheter.
Periodically, the Foley catheter did have to be manipulated secondary to poor urine flow resulting in pelvic pain.

He will be required to have a Foley catheter in place for approximately another two weeks.
