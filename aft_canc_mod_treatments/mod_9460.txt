Would favor leaving his current foley catheter in place until he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1182**] as an outpatient.
Should he subsequently develop urinary retention, the foley may be placed back in at any time and left in until he follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1182**].
Please continue Proscar and Flomax on [**Hospital1 **] 4.
