Admission Date:  [**2122-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-3-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-3-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hemodynamic monitoring  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 80827**] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CHF, COPD on home O2, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] for further management of a newly diagnosed, 20 cm hepatic lesion, and also found to be dyspneic.
She was therefore given levofloxacin, solumedrol, and 1 unit of blood, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hepatology management, hemodynamic monitoring, and possible IR procedure for hemostasis.
The surgical service was also consulted were concerned about a PE given her dyspnea; they also felt that anticoagulation with heparin would be reasonable.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation ([**2121**]; briefly anticoagulated in [**2121**] but not currently) CHF COPD DM2 ([**2113**]) CVA ([**2-/2121**]) w/ left sided weakness (resolved) S/p cholecystectomy ([**2086**]) Uterine fibroid   Social History: She has a 75-100 pack year smoking history (~2 packs per day for 50 years) but quit smoking 15 years ago.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Overweight / Obese  Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL  Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic  Lymphatic: Cervical WNL, Supraclavicular WNL  Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal)  Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Not assessed)  Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Percussion: Resonant : ), (Breath Sounds: Diminished: )  Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, Obese  Extremities: Right: 1+, Left: 1+  Skin:  Warm  Neurologic: Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed, Very sedated and moving slowly, appears encephalopathic   Pertinent Results: cxr [**3-12**]: Bibasilar atelectasis, however, no evidence of CHF exacerbation.
Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure: Initially, multiple etiologies were considered including CHF exacerbation vs pneumonia/COPD exacerbation vs PE.
Despite the fact she had no wheezing suggesting worsening COPD and was afebrile, as she appeared quite ill she was initially treated for pneumonia/CHF exacerbation with furosemide for diuresis as well as levofloxacin.
On hospital day two, however, her respiratory status began to improve significantly with diuresis and further control of her atrial fibrillation (see below).
Initially there were some attempts to increase her to greater than 95 % and she received increasing O2 but this seemed to contribute to a depressed respiratory drive (attributed to her COPD and appearance of chronic CO2 retention) so this was stopped.
As of her second hospital day given negative LENIS, resolution of her chest pain, and improvement of her respiratory status to near her baseline the primary team felt comfortable not empirically treating for PE, and her respiratory status eventually returned to near baseline.
This improved with BiPAP as did her mental status.
She was discharged to rehab on her home dose of Lasix that may continue to be titrated.
A. fib with RVR: Was in SVT on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and ventricular rate slowed with metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 and diltiazem 10mg IV x 2.
Eventually, she was placed on a diltiazem drip for improved rate control which led to improvement in her chest discomfort and dyspnea.
Metoprolol and digoxin were also continued with good rate control.
The first night this improved with diuresis and rate control.
Hepatic hemangioma: Surgery and her primary team remained convinced this lesion was an incidental finding that had probably developed slowly.
No specific management was attempted though transplant surgery did follow her and recommended outpatient followup.
All medications were renally dosed.
Obstetrics and gynecology was consulted on the morning after admission and managed to find records indicating the patient was undergoing a significant post menopausal bleeding work-up at Brown.
