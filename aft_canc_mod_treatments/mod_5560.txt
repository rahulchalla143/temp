Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95893**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of severe CAD s/p multiple prior PCI, moderate aortic stenosis, daily angina, anemia due to chronic GI blood loss admitted with NSTEMI and hematocrit of 21. .
1) NSTEMI/severe CAD- He has significant CAD hx s/p numerous percutaneous interventions and stenting previously.
He was initially started on a nitroglycerin gtt and was transferred to the floor with persistant chest pain.
He was given metoprolol 5mg IV x1 which resolved his hypertension, tachycardia and chest pain.
Given the severity of his symptoms and his multiple prior PCI he was continued on his aspirin and plavix despite his GI blood loss.
Heparin was not started given the significant risk of worsening his blood loss.
Otherwise he was continued on maximal medical management of his NSTEMI/CAD including ASA, plavis, atorvastatin, metoprolol xl, isosorbide mononitrate.
He is not at this time considered to be candidate for additional PCI and stenting.
He has not had colonoscopy or endoscopy due to his tenuous cardiac status but he has had melena in the past making an upper GI source the likely cause of his continued blood loss.
He was initially treated with IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and was changed to po prior to discharge.
He was continued on aspirin and plavix despite the bleeding given his cardiac status.
In addition he received lasix prior to the episode for dyspnea and worsening pulmonary edema seen on CXR following transfusion.
He was given gently IV fluids and his blood transfusion were continued to total of 4 units.
His antihypertensive medications were restarted slowly and he was back on his full regimen prior to discharge with no recurrance of hypotension or melena.
Known modearte-to-severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2) and left ventricular hypertrophy.
He did have intermittent periods of dyspnea which were thought most likely to be due to intermittent flash pulmonary edema that seemed to be provoked by pain or anxiety and responded to low dose morphine 0.25mg x1 or NTG.
In addition, when hypertensive these episodes responded quickly to metoprolol 5mg IV x1.
He was not diuresed given poor oral intake during his admission and hypotension on admission following lasix administration for dyspnea.
His Metoprolol dose was increased to back to 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and he did not have any recurrance of Afib.
There was not evidence of urinary retention however foley placement was difficulty due to his BPH.
In addition, he had [**7-22**] penile pain following foley placement which improved with removing foley and morphine 0.25mg IV.
There was no growth on urine culture however he was treated with bactrim for 3 day course given that he had pyuria and bladder spasm.
