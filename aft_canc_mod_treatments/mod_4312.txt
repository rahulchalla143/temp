CXR [**2158-12-11**]: chest read in conjunction with CT scanning of the chest earlier in the day performed elsewhere: Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung conforms to the appearance on CT scanning earlier today, most likely pneumonia or extensive aspiration.
Bilateral DVT, involving the IVC and bilateral iliac/femoral veins.
PE/DVT:  She was initially admitted to the ICU for management of large PE/DVT, though there was no evidence of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain.
Patient was started on heparin gtt for anticoagulation and required high doses to become therapeutic.
She was bridged to coumadin after transfer to the general medicine floor and her heparin gtt was subsequently stopped on the day of discharge.
She was then switched to subQ lovenox prior to discharge (80mg [**Hospital1 **]) due to its possibly higher efficacy in the context of malignancy, and due to the fact that she promptly clotted when she presented with a subtherapeutic INR.
She will likely require indefinite anticoagulation.
She was not deemed to be a surgical candidate due to her extensive clot [**Last Name (LF) 8373**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a preliminary plan for neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical debulking was formulated, after obtaining tissue for confirmatory diagnosis via CT-guided biopsy.
Her INR will need to normalize before this procedure, so she was transitioned to lovenox for ease of reversal prior to procedures, and increased efficacy in malignancy.
She will be set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of heme/onc early next week and her biopsy and chemotherapy will be coordinated thereafter.
FEVER/CONSOLIDATION ON CT:  She was started on levaquin in the ICU on [**12-11**] for CXR evidence of RLL consolidation that was thought to be infection versus infarction.
Her levaquin was stopped on [**12-14**] as she was afebrile without leukocytosis.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 87969**],  You were transferred from LGH for treatment for clots in your legs and your lungs.
You'll start lovenox instead of coumadin to better prevent further clots, which were likely driven by this mass, as it increases risk of clotting.
STOP COUMADIN 2.
START LOVENOX 80mg injection, twice a day 3.
