He is on multiple medications for pain and for psychiatric stability and he is unclear about what or how much of any particular medication he is taking.
Altered Mental Status: Patient with known schizoaffective disorder though mental status on presenation was different from baseline according to patient, including inability to recall what and how frequently he had been taking medications.
Narcotic pain medications as well as anti-psychotics and benzodiazepines were held initially.
MS Contin 60 mg Q12 and Olanzapine 10 mg daily were restarted the morning of transfer to the medicie floor.
On the floor, Dilaudid 4 mg PO Q4H and Clonazepam was restarted.
Prior to discharge we changed his breakthrough pain medication from dilaudid to oxycodone to see if this improved his mental status.
Following discharge the hospice service is going to titrate his pain medications to achieve adequate pain control without too much sedation.
Metastatic Lung Cancer: Most recently Mr. [**Known lastname 105240**] was treated with palliative Navelbine.
Following discussions with his primary oncologist, the patient was aware that there are no further chemotherapy options.
During hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname 105240**] had persistent oxygen requirement and intermittently desaturated into the 80s and required a face mask.
The patient was diuresed with IV lasix and also was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime and aspiration pneumonia with flagyl.
The patient received symptomatic treatment with albuterol and atrovent nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen.
Patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin, but continued to spike fevers, so micafungin was added to the patient's regimen.
The neupogen and antibiotics were discontinued.
Pain: Home medications were held on arrival given AMS.
MS Contin was eventually restarted as per above though restarting Dialudid was deferred.
Baclofen and Neurontin were also held in setting of ARF/[**Doctor Last Name **] and AMS and were not restarted in the ICU.
The patient was intermittently sleepy when taking dilaudid but complained of constant [**10-4**] pain.
Neurontin was restarted but the patient was very sedated so the medication was stopped.
The patient was transitioned to oxycodone for break through pain as it may be less sedating for the patient.
The patient was discharged with prescriptions for both dilaudid and oxycodone.
Given concern for sepsis, blood cultures were performed, patient received vigorous intravenous fluids, and was started on Vancomycin given possible infiltrate seen on CXR and Cefepime given neutropenia.
Of note, patient completed a course of Levofloxacin on [**2133-12-5**].
Patient's hypotension gradually improved with systolics in the 110s on the day of transfer to the medicine service.
Renal failure improved with hydration and holding of NSAIDs.
Patient's creatinine remained at baseline for remainder of hospitalization.
Acute Liver Injury: On admission, AST was 3171, ALT was 1028, and LDH was 2945 without elevations in alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin.
Toxicology was consulted and was concerned for Tylenol overdose, though patient was certain he had been taking Oxycodone and had not been taking Percocet nor any Tylenol.
Patient received N-acetylcysteine until AST was < 1000 per Toxicology recommendations.
Bilirubin remained normal.
Elevated INR more likely result of Warfarin with Levofloxacin than coagulalopathy from acute liver disease.
Elevated INR: Patient was on Coumadin as an outpatient for history of PE.
INR 12 at an OSH where he received 2 units of FFP and Vitamin K 10 mg PO.
Coumadin was held until INR was 2.1 at which time the patient was started on his home-dose of Coumadin.
The patient remained on coumdain 2.5 mg daily for remaineder of hospitalization until three days prior to dishcarge when his INR was supratherapeutic.
At discharge coumadin was discontinued as patient was going home with hospice.
Patient treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime per above.
History of Schizoaffective Disorder: Patient was continued on Celexa initially but Zyprexa and Clonazepam were held given initial altered mental status.
There was concern that patient's initial presentation could have been medication overdose for suicide attempt.
