Pt received further eval for primary site including RUQ US, upper and lower endoscopy, and thin sliced CT abd/pelvis with no primary source of cancer identified.
Pain control has been managed with dilaudid (?
allergy to oxycodone) and [**Name (NI) 16859**] (pt started with session 1 of 5 on [**2129-10-5**]).
She also received aggressive pain regimen as well.
Pt had compression stockings (TEDS) and ace bandages placed to help with lower extremity edema  # Acute on Chronic Hyponatremia: low sodium has been a chronic issue for patient with baseline of approximately 130.
At first this was though most likely due to hypovolemia (as pt as NPO with bowel prep over [**2-25**] days) therefore pt was given aggressive IV fluids over one day and Na improved initially to 123 and then dropped again to 119.
There was most likely a component of SIADH and pt was fluid restricted and sent to MICU for treatment with hypertonic saline.
Pt spent two days in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for correction with hypertonic saline for level of 120 with MS changes.
She was discharged with a sodium level of 127 on sodium chloride tabs 1mg PO bid.
She will have blood drawn as an outpatient to check her sodium (in addition to post-chemotherapy CBC).
MICU Course: The patient was admitted to the MICU for administration of 3% saline at 25cc per hour based on renal recommendations.
The next morning after 15 hours of hypertonic saline infusion, her sodium rose to 128.
Hypertonic saline was discontinued and normal saline was initiated.
Sodium remained stable at 126 so saline was then stopped per renal recommendations.
This increase correlated to when pt received IV contrast for CT scan therefore CIN suspected.
# Atrial fibrillation s/p PPM [**6-/2129**] on pradaxa at home.
Pt continued home sotalol and pradaxa was held while in house as pt needed procedures for cancer workup.
