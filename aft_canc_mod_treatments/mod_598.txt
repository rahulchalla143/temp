# Malignant Effusion - The patient presented for outpatient therapeutic thoracocentesis [**7-12**] (done for worsening SOB) with removal of 2200 mL R sided fluid, followed by excruciating pain at thoracotomy site.
The dyspnea after her procedure was likely a result of reexpansion edema, which was reflected on her chest X-ray.
She was initially treated in the intensive care unit with oxygen therapy as well as IV Lasix and closely monitored.

Her respiratory distress rapidly improved with diuresis and she was soon back to baseline (requires home O2).
