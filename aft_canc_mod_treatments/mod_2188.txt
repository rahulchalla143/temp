He subsequently developed fever and petechial rash prior to receiving his chemotherapy without infectious cause identified.
He subsequently did well in the intervening weeks after chemotherapy and went through neutropenic phase without complication.
He was given levofloxacin empirically for possible pneumonia and his fever came down on [**10-2**].
Initial labs notable for leukocytosis of 22K with left shift, query G-CSF effect vs infection; acute renal failure with creatinine at 2.2 (baseline 1.1); and abnormal LFT's: SGOT 94, SGPT 201, alk phos 329, TB 1.6, direct bili 1.0, lipase 13.
He was therefore given a dose of ertapenem in the ER for potential biliary infection.
On arrival to the BMT unit he was feeling progressivly short of breath and requiring supplimental O2 (O2sat 94% on 4L).
His vital signs on arrival T [**Age over 90 **]F  HR 132 RR 26  BP 94/70.
He was given 500cc bolus of NS and transferred to the ICU.
He also received a dose of acetaminophen.

CHEST CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, evaluation is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration.
A right hilar lymph node is pathologically enlarged and measures 1.9 x 1.1 cm (2:31).
There are several prevascular and mediastinal/precarinal lymph nodes, none of which meet dcriteria for pathology by CT.
Note is made of periportal pathologic lymphadenopathy with lymph nodes measuring 1.6 cm, and 1.5 cm in short-axis dimensions respectively (2:66, 2:70).
There are multiple, non-pathologic retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes.
Please note, detailed evaluation of the intrathoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration.
Emphysematous cholecystitis is considered unlikely given the lack of shadowing/air seen within the wall as well as the lack of distention of the gallbladder.
Culture data has all shown NGTD, with Urine Legionella antigen negative, Mycoplasma pneumonia DNA not detected, and beta-glucan and galactomannan currently pending.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Azithromycin, and Flagyl.
His hypoxia greatly improved since his admission, with resolution of his dyspnea and tachypnea, and weaned off oxygen to room air.
He defervesced and remained afebrile >72hrs, so his antibiotic regimen was changed to Meropenem and Azithromycin.
A repeat portable CXR was non-diagnostic, and the patient completed his full course Azithromycin as an inpatient.
Hypoxia - The pt presented with a significant oxygen requirement, dyspnea, and tachypnea.
His SOB also improved with an ipratropium inhaler that had been started for mild wheezing.
His antibiotic regimen was completed as above.
h/o DVT - The patient had a history of DVT approx 4 weeks prior to this hospitalization, being treated with coumadin at home for anticoagulation.
He received Vitamin K, and his INR trended down to below 2.0 prior to restarting his coumadin.
He was discharged to home with a plan to restart his coumadin at 5mg daily for now, with daily INR checks and adjustments to be made to his coumadin dose.
He would be bridged to a therapeutic level with Lovenox as an outpatient.
This was treated with IV Lopressor, and the pt had a good response to this.
The cardiology team was involved, and recommended continuing on a low-dose beta-blocker such as Metoprolol 25mg.
The patient was started on Metoprolol 12.5 for ectopy noted on his telemetry, but he developed wheezing after this, so the medication was discontinued with relief of wheezing.
He was noted to have more episodes of symptomatic A-fib with RVR while on the floor, so he was started on a low-dose CCB with good control and no further events on telemetry.
This low-dose CCB was changed to a long-acting formulation prior to discharge.
The did however recommend further work-up of the gallbladder, including labwork and an MRCP.
He was continued on Protonix.
He was not on any medications suspected to cause thrombocytopenia, although he had recently been on Levofloxacin which may have contributed.
HITT was also considered given the diagnosis of a DVT 1 month prior that likely would have been treated with heparin.
Heparin-dependent antibodies were negative for HITT, with anti-platelet antibody pending, but the patient's platelet count was recovering prior to discharge, up to 178 from a nadir of 50. .
There was concern for lymphomatous involvement rather than infection.
His Flagyl was discontinued given the low likelihood of cholecystitis, and he was seen by GI and General Surgery, who recommended further work-up including a HIDA scan / MRCP.
Evaluation by Dermatology advised that the rash is most likely a drug reaction to Levaquin, and it was recommended that he use topical Clobetasol for treatment.
His creatinine improved to baseline with IVF hydration.
T-cell lymphoma - The patient was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma approx 4 weeks prior to his admission, and is now s/p first cycle of CHOP (D+26).

You were rehydrated with IV fluids and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Azithromycin, and Flagyl, and you continued to do well.
You were seen by Infectious Disease, who helped us adjust your antibiotics: you received a full 7-day course of Azithromycin, and you were kept on Meropenem until discharge, at which point you were changed to Ertapenem, which you will need to continue for 7 more days.
You developed multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, so you were evaluated by Cardiology and started on low-dose Cardizem (you developed wheezing on low-dose metoprolol, which was treated with an ipratropium inhaler).
