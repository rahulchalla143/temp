RADIOLOGY: CXR on admission: ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip below the inferior margin of the study.
Brief Hospital Course: In short, Mr [**Known lastname 40722**] is an 88M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder CA, prolonged hospitalization c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure, coag-negative Staphylococcal line infection.
He required increasing PEEP and FiO2, and despite this PaO2 hovered around 55-60.
Esophageal balloon was placed to guide PEEP.
Mechanical ventilation was continued and underlying infectious/inflammatory etiology treated as below.
Volume was removed initially through CVVH and subsequently through HD alternating with UF.
?s hx of repeat septic physiology after BCG treatment two times in a row is suggestive of either repeat seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction.
Previously, he was treated for presumed urosepsis given that enterococcus was growing in his urine during the [**2196-3-20**] hospitalization.
He was given blood and factor repletion as needed.
Given the possible component of enterococcal urosepsis, he was initially covered with Unasyn and levofloxacin for double gram negative coverage and for some anti-mycobacterial activity.
ID saw him and recommended starting treatment of mycobacteria with isoniazid and rifampin, with discontinuation of levofloxacin and changing Unasyn to Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage, which was also done.
Vancomycin was continued given the recent foreign body instrumentation.
He completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and Zosyn.
Steroids were also started for inflammatory component ("cytokine storm.).
He was on high-dose steroids for 10 days.
He was started on PCP prophylaxis while on steroids.
Renal was consulted and a line was placed for CVVH which was initiated.
He was briefly on an amiodarone gtt to control rate.
Hydralazine was started and uptitrated.
