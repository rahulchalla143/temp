At the level of the aortic arch, cross-sectional area decreases from 180 mm2 to approximately 90 mm2.
Improving multifocal consolidation and ground glass opacities, as compared to recent CTA [**2134-9-30**].
AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.
The ET tube is in satisfactory position.
A central venous line is seen with its tip in the mid SVC.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple transaxial images of the chest were obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast, utilizing the pulmonary embolism protocol.
FINDINGS: There is an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in place.
Several, prominent and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, some of which are partially calcified, measuring up to 10 mm in the short axis diameter (sequence 4, image #30), adjacent to the left pulmonary artery.
These findings are stable compared to prior studies and most likely represent the presence of prior granulomatous disease.
US INTR-OP 60 MINS  [**2134-9-29**] 7:36 AM  US INTR-OP 60 MINS  Reason: PANC MASS ,LAPAROSCOPIC DISTAL PANCREATECTOMY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with pancreatic abnormality REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy [**2134-9-29**] 9:30am CLINICAL INDICATION: A small hypervascular tumor of the distal pancreas seen on CT scan, for localization and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.
Laparoscopic ultrasound images of the pancreas were performed via a right upper quadrant port, using a curved array transducer at 7.5 MHz frequency.
The site of the tumor was localized visually and a surgical clip was placed for a reference, during mobilization for distal pancreatectomy.
The surrounding vasculature and particularly the relationship of the atrophic pancreatic body to the splenic vein was continually demonstrated during surgical mobilization.
CONCLUSION: Eight-mm tumor of the distal body of the pancreas with successful localization and laparoscopic resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as described.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
