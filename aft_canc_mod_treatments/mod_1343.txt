restart at discharge  The decision was made the morning of [**11-1**] an EVD for relief of the patient's high ICP and decompression via CSF draining.
She was transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] Operating Room for wound exploration and placement of EVD.
On [**12-6**] she was transferred back to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU so that she could receive daily radiation treatments.
On [**12-9**] it was determined that her radiation treatments were complete per her radiation oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13014**].
Her EVD site began leaking CSF on [**12-10**] and her drain was lowered to 10cm above the tragus.
A CT head was obtained and showed stable ventricular size and no subdural hematoma and her drain was lowered to 5cm above the tragus.
A purse-string suture was placed to prevent further drainage.
Her vancomycin was increased to 1250 [**Hospital1 **], and ther CSF cultures showed NGTD.
The decision was made to D/C her EVD on [**12-13**] in preparation for a VPS placement.
On [**12-14**], a lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF was sent for a final culture/gram stain.
On [**12-15**] she went to the OR for placement of a right sided Ommaya reservoir and a Left sided VP shunt.
She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the OR, and was trasnported to the PACU post-operatively.
She remained stable while there and a post-op CT of the head was routinely obtained which showed proper placement of the VP shunt catheter and Ommaya reservoir intracranially.
On [**12-16**] she remained stable, her foley catheter was removed, she was seen by palliative care, and Infectious disease advised a continuation of IV antibiotics until at least Sunday.
PT and OT also saw her and recommended that she should go to a rehab facility, but bacause the focus was more palliative in nature the plan was to work on sending her hoe.
SHe had a negative head CT.  Neurology was consulted and they recommended placing the patient on Keppra and Ativan for seizure.
On [**12-18**] the patient was improving neurologically, her foley was discontinued.
ID input was requested for discharge antibiotics and suggested placing on levaquin indefinitely.
On [**12-20**] the patient was again seen by palliative care and medication adjustments were made as needed.

Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
Please call if you need to change your appointment, or require additional directions.
