[**6-6**]: Central line catheter tip no growth .
[**2157-6-8**] CXR:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided PICC line with the tip malpositioned in the left subclavian vein extending distally towards the axillary vein.
PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 379**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12166**].
The left arm and pre-existing PICC lines were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
The lumen was flushed and the line was secured with skin with StatLock.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Pre-existing PICC line in the left arm was repositioned with the tip in the superior vena cava.
She had been started on neupogen as an outpatient after her chemotherapy.
Subsequently her line tip culture from [**5-25**] grew MRSA, and pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
She was treated with vancomycin, cipro, flagyl, and cefepime for 7 days.
Her fevers quickly resolved, her cell counts recovered to normal within 6 days, and all antibiotics were discontinued.
Her central line was pulled and she was restarted on vancomycin while speciation was pending, and the catheter tip with no growth.
New PICC line was placed and adjusted by Interventional Radiology on [**6-8**] in left arm was well-positioned and functioning.
She was started on a heparin drip with no bolus, and subsequently transitioned to lovenox 1.5mg/kg QD for discharge.
She was discharged on lovenox for a 14 day course (concern of anti-coagulation with low platelet count).
# Diarrhea: Ms [**Known lastname **] had had several weeks of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea ascribed to B symtoms prior to her chemotherapy, which had been treated with reglan and lomotil.
Given concern for possible c difficile colitis, reglan and lomotil were discontinued, she was made NPO, and started on TPN.
She did well on this regimen, and her symptoms completely resolved.
She was slowly started back on po intake, and was tolerating po intake without TPN before discharge, without diarrhea.
She was continued on supportive treatment for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which have been long-standing issues for her - attributed to B symptoms of her lymphoma.
Given her dilated colon, her lomotil was discontinued, and she was made NPO with TPN as discussed above.
She was no longer requiring transfusions at time of discharge.
She will continue to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further treatment planning.
After her chemo, while neutropenic, her skin condition, fragile at baseline, deteriorated with diffuse erythema, and areas of desquamation on her buttocks, back, and arms.
With this treatment, and the recovery of her cell counts, her skin improved greatly.
Her electrolytes were monitored and she was on repletion scales.
PPx: She was on protonix and heparin/lovenox .
