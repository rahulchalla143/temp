Pleurex catheter site mildly erythematous, tender to palpation, no fluctuance.
Successful pericardiocentesis, with drainage of 460 mL bloody drainage and resolution of pericardial effusion (drain left in place).
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 66 year old female with metastatic breast cancer and malignant pleural/pericardial effusions, admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit with atrial fibrillation and hypotension after pericardial drainage placement.
# Hypotension: Initially there was concern for septic shock, and patient received antibiotics and was placed on levophed.
A Swan catheter was placed, and it was found that her hemodynamic numbers more consistent with cardiogenic shock.
She was kept on levophed and Milrinone was started for improved cardiac output.
# Pericardial effusion: Patient had a pericardial drain placed for her malignant effusion.
She was taken to the OR on for a pericardial window, and her pericardial drain was pulled prior to discharge.
Patient was started on amiodarone and digoxin for rate control with good effect.
She remained in sinus rhythm for several days prior to discharge, and her digoxin was stopped.
She was continued on anticoagulation with coumadin.
* Patient will need INR checked weekly while on amiodarone and followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Creatine improved with Milrinone and Levophed, and remained stable once those were weaned.
She was formerly on carvedilol and lisinopril at home; which were held in the setting of hypotension, and not added back due to persistently borderline low blood pressure.
# HTN: Home medications held in setting of hypotension.
# Breast cancer: Patient had right sided chest tube placed, and this was pulled prior to discharge.
She received teaching on how to care for her left-sided pleurex catheter.
Her pain, mainly in a band-like distribution across her epigastric area, was treated with fentanyl and oral dilaudid.
Her tube feeds were given as tolerated due to nausea and vomiting.
