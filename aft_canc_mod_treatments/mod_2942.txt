The patient complained of feeling warm earlier today, and mild low back pain consistent with his history of kidney for percocet for the pain.
The patient was intubated for airway protection en route to the OSH by EMS.
The patient was given phosphenytoin 1500mg, Ativan 2mg, Pancuronium, zofran and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
His wife reports recent low back pain and perhaps fevers, but he did not take his temperature at home.
Motor- occasional fasciculation of left anterior quads.
<br> CXR [**2121-4-4**]: FINDINGS: Single portable supine chest radiograph is reviewed without comparison.
Endotracheal tube is in place, just below the thoracic inlet, 5.4 cm above the carina.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube tip seen just below the thoracic inlet, 5.4 cm above the carina.
<br> CXR [**2121-4-6**]: SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The nasogastric tube has been removed and Dobbhoff tube placed with tip terminating in similar location within the proximal stomach.
An endotracheal tube tip terminates 3 cm from the carina.
IMPRESSION: Standard Dobbhoff tube tip placement terminating over proximal stomach.
There are bilateral moderate, pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
The bladder is collapsed with a Foley in it.
Mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes and lymphocytes.
His blood pressure was controlled with a nicardipine gtt initially.
He was kept euglycemic with insulin sliding scale, and Tylenol was administered for any temperature greater than 100.4F.
Neurosurgery was consulted for possible EVD placement, but as there was no significant hydrocephalus and his 4th ventricle appeared patent, no drain was placed.
Despite his poor prognosis, his family wished to continue aggressive care.
Because no significant neurologic recovery was expected, a tracheostomy was performed at the end of his first week.
A percutaneous enterogastrostomy (PEG) was planned as well, but before this could be performed, he developed significant ascites.
At this point, the even poorer prognosis was discussed with the family, who still wanted to proceed with life-prolonging measures.
The day after this CT, he underwent paracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic measures.
Following the paracentesis, he became hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 70s; he was given albumin to restore intravascular volume.
Albumin needed to be given repeatedly over the next four days until his death to maintain blood pressure.
He received several units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and several doses of Vitamin K over the final 4 days of his life.
He was supported with the albumin in an effort to maintain intravascular volume.
