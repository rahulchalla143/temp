In order to relieve the compression, you required an operation called a laminectomy which you tolerated well.
Luckily, your kidney function returned to its baseline when this medication was stopped and replaced with vancomycin.
You will require a total of 4 weeks of treatment with vancomycin and for that reason, a more permanent IV called a PICC was placed before your discharge to the VA. You also developed a urinary tract infection which responded well to treatment with ciprofloxacin.
The following changes have been made to your home medications: - Your home carvedilol dose has been increased to 25mg twice daily - Your home lisinopril dose has been held for now and may be restarted at the discretion of the VA - Your home simvastatin was changed to Lipitor 80mg daily - You were started on Senna, docusate, and Miralax to help move your bowels - You will use Tylenol as needed for your pain  Please follow-up with all of your outpatient medical appointments listed below.
