BP well controlled on current regimen - Continue diltiazem and captopril - monitor BP and titrate prn .
TF's through NGT (failed video swallow again on [**2133-1-12**]) - continue aspiration precautions - patient has decline PEG placement x2 per notes in chart - will reevaluate patient's wishes once transferred to floor; would be best to place PEG when placing drainage so as to minimize procedures - replete lytes prn .
