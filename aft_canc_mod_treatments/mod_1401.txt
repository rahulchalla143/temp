**FINAL REPORT [**2145-1-14**]** Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2145-1-14**]): FUSOBACTERIUM NUCLEATUM.
Discogenic bone marrow changes are seen in the endplates ([**Last Name (un) 13425**] type II at C4/5 and C5/6; [**Last Name (un) 13425**] type I at C6/7).
Note is made of bilateral moderate atelectasis and trace pleural effusions.
A post-pyloric enteric tube is seen, with the tip at the junction of the third-fourth portions of the duodenum.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Rectal tube and Foley catheter are present, with a decompressed appearance to the bladder.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are seen, with a focal scoliosis with an S-shape in the lumbar spine, left convex at L3 and right convex at L4-5, with transitional vertebral body anatomy and slight anterolisthesis of L3 on L4.
Status post surgery from C3-T1 level.
No signs of hypoxic brain injury are identified on diffusion images.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2145-1-25**] 9:35 AM FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
There was penetration into the laryngeal vestibule with thin liquids but not nectar thick liquids.
IMPRESSION: Several episodes of penetration with thin liquids.
Brief Hospital Course: 63M with a history of ESLD, HCC, HCV, distant alcoholism, bipolar disorder compicated by SI, and medication non-compliance who was admitted on [**2144-12-6**] for gait unsteadiness, tremor, and falls.
He improved somewhat with lactulose and rifamixin.
Second, he was not taking his medications as ordered.
He ultimately underwent C3-7 laminectomy on [**2144-12-11**].
He was persistently delirius and was treated with high doses of haloperidol and subsequently developed what appeared to be NMS.
He was intubated and a large mucus plug was suctioned out of his lungs.
He was successfully re-warmed and EEG at that time was consistent with profound encephalopathy.
He was treated with a course of vancomycin and piparacillin/tazobactam.
He developed anuric renal failure which was treated with mitodrine, octreotide, albumin, and IVF and ultimately recovered to baseline renal function.
He had a prolonged intubation and is now s/p tracheostomy and successfully extubated.
He had hypernatremia which was treated with free water boluses in his tube feeds and IVF.
Finally, his encephalopathy was aggressively treated with lactulose, rifamixin, quetiapine, and sedation.
He is now weaned off sedation and stable on lactulose and rifamixin as well as quetiapine.
He remains on treatment for encephalopathy with both GI decontamination and neuroleptics.
He was restarted on scheduled lactulose and rifaximin was added.
The gait instability and tremor were felt to be possible manifestation of the encephalopathy but did not improve with treatment while his mental status did.
His mental status has cleared significantly with aggressive bowel regimen and discontinuation of home bupropion and lithium.
He is also s/p NMS from haloperidol given post-operatively earlier this admission.
He will continue lactulose 60 mL PO Q4H and titrate to >4BM daily + clear mental status, rifaximin 400 mg PO TID for bowel decontamination, and quetiapine fumarate 50 mg PO Q6H:PRN for agitation per psych as well as standing doses (see below).
His doses of quetiapine can be titrated down for over-sedation.
He will need ongoing nutrition consults.
Respiratory status: S/p prolonged intubatation now extubated with tracheostomy placed on [**2145-1-13**].
Doing well with cuff in place on FiO2 35%.
For now on standing albuterol and iptropium nebs Q6hrs with excellent effect.
Likely a combination of deconditioning from being bed-ridden for several weeks, upper motor deficits s/p cervical [**Date Range **] stenosis treated with laminectomy, and catabolic state.
He will require intensive PT to regain functioning.
On [**12-11**] patient underwent posterior cervical laminotomy C3 to T1 and posterior cervical instrumentation C3-T1, posterior cervical thoracic arthrodesis C3-T1, autograft and allograft augmentation for fusion.
undergone C3-T1 laminectomy, instrumentation and [**Month/Year (2) **] fusion on [**2144-12-11**] and was delerious post operatively w/ decompensation of hepatic encephalopathy.
continued to be unresponsive w/ low grade temperatures despite  marginal improvement w/ haldol (>40mg) and lactulose.
Haldol has been d/c [**12-17**] 1400 last dose.
Wellbutrin was also decreased and then DCed during the post operative course due to the persistent delerium.
Ultimately was started on Quetiapine Fumarate 100 mg PO QAM and 200 mg PO HS with good control of symptoms.
Will being evaluated for liver transplant as an outpatient.
Plan is to continue management of encephalopathy with lactulose and rifamixin.
A large mucous plug was suctioned from the ET tube, with subsequent restoration of perfusing rhythm and the patient was transfered to the medical ICU for further managment.
Early in the morning of [**1-8**] the patient became hypotensive, received several IV fluid boluses, and eventually required levophed to support his blood pressure.
# Respiratory/Ventilation: On transfer to the MICU the patient had a bronchoscopy  showing thick, yellow secretions concerning for infection, and was started vancomycin and zosyn for a 5 day course for hospital acquired pneumonia.
As the latter circumstance was felt to be unlikely to change the patient had a trachesotomy placement on [**1-13**].
On discharge from the MICU the patient was tolerating his trach collar very well with a passy-muir valve in place.
The patient had multiple episdoes of agitation and multiple medications were tried.
He received mitodrine, octreotide, and albumin for HRS.
# Fusobacterium bacteremia: One of two blood culturs drawn on [**1-7**] grew out Fusobacterium.
ID was consulted and the patient was treated with a 2 week course of penicillin G that ended on [**2145-1-21**].
Hypernatremia worsened again with acceleration of tube feeds and improved with increased free water boluses and holding of tube feeds due to the patient's inability to maintain an upright posture.
Rifaxamin was held when the patient was on vancomycin and zosyn and resumed when these medications were stopped.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hepatic encephalopathy (resolving), [**Month/Day (2) **] cord compression C3 to C7 status post laminectomies, lithium toxicity (resolved), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (resolved), left parotid mass .
An MRI of your brain and neck were done to determine whether the abnormalities in your gait an the tremors were due to problems with your brain or the [**Hospital1 **] cord.
You were found to have [**Hospital1 **] cord compression and underwent cervical spine laminectomy and [**Hospital1 **] fusion.
You should not take this medication ever again.
We treated your encephalopathy with high doses of lactulose, rifaximin, antibiotics and supportive treatment.
You were so sick that you needed to be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator).
Ultimately an artificial airway called a tracheostomy was placed in your neck to help you breathe.
We ultimately changed your lithium and bupropion with quetiapine (Seroquel).
Please take your medications as ordered.
