5) Multiple drains at the surgical site.
Pancreaticoduodenectomy, Whipple procedure (B-Z): 1.
2- NG tube in the esophagus and associated ulcerations 3- Blood in the stomach.
[**2102-5-18**] EGD: 1- No blood in the visualized portions of the upper GI tract 2- Erythema in the stomach compatible with gastritis 3- Nonbleeding ulcer in the stomach body (beneath the balloon of the PEG) 4- PEG tube in the stomach body 5- The endoscope was passed to the hub in the left limb and approximately 20-30 cm in the right limb.
6- Bilious fluids in stomach 7- Nonbleeding erosion in the one of the jejunal limbs (left side ?
efferent) 8- Gastric erosion (mild) at the anastomosis site  [**2102-5-19**] Colonoscopy: 1- There was no blood seen in the colon or ileum.
This could be an area that was transiently ischemic or inflammed with diverticular disease 4- Diverticulosis of the descending colon   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old gentleman who presented for a Whipple resection for an obstructing ampullary mass.
His post-operative course was extensive and complicated by significant post-operative bleeding requiring emergent laparotomy, ventillatory dependence requiring tracheostomy, tube-feeding requirements, and urinary tract infections with bacteremia.
The patient was admitted for elective Whipple resection on [**2102-4-18**].
He was transfused with blood and transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.
Emergent endoscopy was performed revealed blood in the stomach and ulceration in the anastamosis.
His transfusion requirements continued to increase and his abdomen became more distended and he was taken to the OR on [**2102-4-21**] for abdominal washout and control of bleeding from his anastamosis (please see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for full details).
A Swan-ganz catheter was placed for cardiovascular assessment and management.
On post-op day 2 (from his abdominal washout) he was off pressors and trophic tube feeds were started via his J-tube.
His Swan Ganz catheter was remoed on post-op day 3 and he was extubated.
He was re-intubated on post-op day 4 when he had copious secretions not improved with nebulizer treatments, and was kept on CPAP with pressure support.
His Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled with Diltiazem and aggressive diuresis was performed for post-operative fluid re-spacing.
A percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**2102-5-1**] for continued ventilatory dependence.
He was weaned off his vent on [**2102-5-3**] and tolerated trach mas breathing.
He had partial dehiscence around his abdominal wounds which required initiation of wet to dry dressing changes.
This was drained by interventional radiology on [**2102-5-10**] and a pigtail catheter was left in place; cultures from this fluid collection were negative.
The patient failed a bedside speech and swallow evaluation on [**2102-5-11**] and was continued on tube feeding.
On [**2102-5-14**] his J-G tube was noted to be broken at the external infusion port and the tube was removed and changed to a Foley catheter for tube feeding.
His trach was downsized to a #7 portex with a Passe-Muir valve on [**2102-5-16**] and a video swallow evaluation on [**2102-5-17**] was passed, with a regular diet started in addition to tube feeding.
He was transfused blood and serial hematocrits subsequently remained stable.
Colonoscopy and EGD evaluation revealed no obvious bleeding source.
Pan-cultures revealed no obvious source for the patient's WBC count but he was started on empiric treatment for presumed C-Diff colitis.
His tube feeds were restarted on [**2102-5-21**] and he was advanced to a regular diet with cycled tube feeds on [**2102-5-23**].
Infectious Disease consulation was obtained and he was started on Levoquin for treatment and follow-up urine cultures were negative and he remained afebrile.
His remaining JP drain was removed on [**2102-5-25**].
His Foley catheter was removed on [**2102-5-26**] and he was able to void without it.
Towards the end of [**Month (only) 116**], social services and case management were asked to assist with rehab placement.
Anti-coagulation for his chronic atrial fibrillation was not started given the chronicity and his recent severe episodes of post-op bleeding.
On [**6-5**] in the morning the patient was discharged home with physical therapy services in addition to visiting nursing services to manage his ongoing tube feeds.
