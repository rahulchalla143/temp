Past Medical History: pheochromocytoma dx [**7-17**] s/p R adrenalectomy [**11-16**] hypercholesterolemia hypertension  Social History: non-smoker, no alcohol use  Family History: no h/o ca  Physical Exam: NAD, AAOx3 PERRL FS, TM CTA B sinus tachy abd soft, nt, nd, nbs LLE- limited ROM secondary to pain, healing incision with staples, no drainage or erythema, normal sensation.
The patient was also immediately followed by the endocrine service and their recommendations were followed in regards to regulating her blood pressure through a high salt diet and volume expansion.
After obtaining clearance from the medical service the patient was brought to the operating room on hospital day number five for left proximal femur replacement by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] with excision of pathologic bone.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, however required monitoring in the unit due to her somewhat labile blood pressure and tachycardia and the potential for a hypertensive crisis from her pheochromocytoma as well as a 2L blood loss that required transfusion.
Per the endocrine service recommendations her cardura was held for these low pressures and her lotensin was stopped.
The patient also began to work with physical therapy on postoperative day four and was noted to be making progress with mobility but would likely require a stay in a rehabilitation facility.
She was given a CD with her X-rays, bone scan, and CT scan to be brought to her rad-onc appointment.
