CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
The etiology was thought to be related to his C. diff infection, which we managed with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl.
He was volume resuscitated and his BP improved along with antibiotic therapy.
He was treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
He was on neosynephrine for a few days and after multiple liter boluses, was weaned off, though his pressures remained in the high 80s-90s systolic.
Lactate was trended, reaching it's maximum at 2.5, then subsequently trending down to 2.2 prior to transfer to the floor.
Because of his initial septic picture, he was also started on IV vancomycin/cefepime in the setting of his neutropenia, but this was discontinued as the cultures were negative and there was a known source of infection.
Other causes of his hypotension were considered, such as cardiac tamponade and adrenal insufficiency.
Steroids were considered, but pt had a cortisol stimulation test on his previous admission that was normal, and there was concern for bowel perforation in a person with c.difficile colitis on steroids.
Pt continued on PO Vanc/IV Flagyl while on the floor and on discharge only PO Vancomycin to complete a two-week course from [**3-30**] - [**4-13**].
Cardioversion was not performed and patient has not been on anticoagulation in the past despite his history of DVTs secondary to past GI bleeds.
Oral diabetes medications were not restarted.
PE was considered but was less likely as he had  a filter placed less than 3 months ago.
This soon improved and despite intravenous fluid hydration, he maintained good oxygen saturations.
He was continued on supplementary O2.
