As we discussed with you and your family, we will not pursue any aggressive diagnosis, including further biopsies.
We will also not pursue chemotherapy or surgery at this time.
You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and we will set up a follow up appointment with one of our abdominal cancer doctors to discuss [**Name5 (PTitle) 691**] further questions you may have.
We have stopped your coumadin as the risk from bleeding is greater due to your cancer than the risk of stroke.
We have also decreased your blood pressure medications slightly as you did not require as much while you were in hospital.
You were initially treated with an IV antibiotic to treat both.
This was changed to an oral antibiotic that you will finish taking at home.
