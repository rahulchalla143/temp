Brief Hospital Course: 82F with MDS, Crohn's with multiple GI bleeds, CAD s/p NSTEMI, CKD, breast CA, with worsening respiratory status over past several months of unclear etiology, admitted for altered mental status and dyspnea within 3 days of discharge for same presentation.
She was started on BiPAP overnight.
The patient was discontinued from cefepime and started on a two week course of vancomycin (Day 1 [**2194-9-1**]) for a susptected line infection.
The line was not removed due to poor access.
The patient's mental status returned to baseline after antibiotics and a decrease in her VBG CO2.
This caused acute hypoxia, which was treated with nasal canula oxygen and BIPAP on the floor.
Due to receiving BIPAP on the floor, she was transferred back to the ICU.
During her ICU course, her hypercarbia generally resolved on nightly BIPAP and NC throughout the day at 2-4L.
Giving 2.5 mg Zyprexa was found to be beneficial in improving pt compliance with BIPAP at night.
On [**9-8**], the pt was transferred back to the floor and remained stable on nightly BIPAP and 1.5L NC during the day.
The patient was discharged with instructions to complete her 2-wk course of vancomycin (concluding [**2194-9-15**]), as well as nightly BIPAP 13/5 and NC during the day as needed.
The patient was slightly dyspneic at baseline on presentation.
She was placed on CPAP at night (on the patient's home settings) and nasal canula during the day.
As described above, the pt's hypercarbia resolved on nightly BIPAP and NC during the day.
The patient was diuresed with lasix and her home dose of lopressor was started (although the patient was not taking this medication).
The lopressor was later stopped due to patient and family refusal.
Throughout the pt's hospitalization, the pt had episodes of hyperkalemia noted on AM labs that responded well to po Lasix and po Kayexalate.
He will interpret these results and provide guidance as to usage of Kayexalate, for which the patient was given a prescription on discharge.
She was also continued on her steroid [**Last Name (STitle) 15123**].
We continued her epo and folic acit.
She is not on ASA due to a history of recent GI bleeds.
The patient was restarted on her low dose beta blocker, which was later discontinued due to patient request.
The patient was continued on her home trimacinolone cream.
Continued on protonix .
