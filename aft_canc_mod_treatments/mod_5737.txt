Predominantly macrophages, neutrophils, and polymorphous lymphocytes, consistent with reactive inflammatory infiltrate (See Note).
Note: Please refer to the corresponding cell block specimen S11-[**Pager number 95303**]H for further characterization and the results of immunohistochemistry studies.
Flow cytometry ([**8-10**]): FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 103.
They do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD5 or CD10.
For example, a paratracheal node measuring 9 mm (4:96) was 10 mm in [**2117-7-5**] and 6 mm in [**2114-10-6**].
Multiple small mediastinal nodes measure up to 6 mm, not meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Increased bilateral consolidations, greater on the left and consistent with atelectasis which extends along the aortic contour and corresponds to findings on chest radiograph.
Right central line tip is in the lower SVC.
TECHNIQUE: Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
Brief Hospital Course: 80-year-old male with hairy cell leukemia in remission, prostate cancer s/p cystoprostatectomy with ileal stoma, recently s/p cholecystectomy and parastomal hernia repair presents with persistent fever.
# Fevers: DDX UTI, PNA, wound infection, pyoderma, leukemia recurrence, vasculitis.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] records, the patient was initially treated for a UTI but following multiple cultures and treatment modalities his UA cleared.
Pyoderma gangrenosum could cause fever, but was improving on steroid treatment.
CT scan revealed multifocal infiltrates, treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible pneumonia.
Following completion of antibiotic courses for both pneumonia and urinary tract infection, the fevers continued.
He was therefore started on Cyclosporine starting [**8-13**].
Given patient had not been improving on vanc/zosyn, antibiotic coverage changed to linezolid/meropenem.
Given desire to minimize immunosuppresssion, prednisone and cyclosporine tapers initiated.
CMV and fungal studies were negative, but a C.diff PCR was positive despite multiple negative toxin tests and the patient treated with PO vancomycin.
Patient had been afebrile for 5 days prior to discharge and had been transitioned off of IV antibiotics.
# UTI:  patient was initially treated for a UTI as source for his persistant fevers and UA cleared.
Patient was sent to the ICU with respiratory failure and concern for sepsis and was therefore treated for these pathogens.
Patient was started on 2 week course of Linezolid and Fluconazole to end on [**9-11**].
Patient was treated with a 5 day course of acyclovir with improvement in the lesion.
Patient was then switched to PO vancomycin as had little change in his stooling frequency.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: On [**8-27**], patient triggered on the floor for tachycardia, tachypnea and marked nursing concern.
His oxygen was quickly weaned from NRB to NC to room air.
Repeat CXR showed minimal improvement, and has patient had not been improving on vanc/zosyn for possible HCAP, antibiotics changed to linezolid/meropenem.
Meropenem was discontinued after several days without fever and patient continued to be stable on linezolid alone.
As the patient had recently been febrile with chills, his fever was treated with Tylenol and he was given IVF.
Metoprolol IV was given with some effect, as his HR slowed to 120-140 and BP rose to 90s/50s.
Further fluid boluses were given to support volume status.
He was transferred to the ICU for conversion with diltiazem and/or cardioversion.
In the MICU, he was loaded with amiodarone and subsequently converted to sinus rhythm, which was maintained with PO amiodarone 300 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was transferred back to the floor and his rhythm and rate well-controlled with metoprolol for the remainder of his stay.
Surgery and Wound Care followed the patient during his stay, and a wound vac was placed to facilitate healing.
This was removed as the wound healed, and wet-to-dry dressings used.
# Hypertension: Continued metoprolol 50 mg daily, ASA 81mg daily, was also started on lisinopril 5 mg daily prior to discharge for persistantly elevated BPs to the 160s.
He was on prednisone 20 mg on transfer.
His prednisone was increased and cyclosporine started for immune suppression.
Rheumatology recommended tapering of prednisone over several weeks.
He was felt to have a low solute from his ileal conduit and poor PO intake.
# Depression:  Continued Effexor 75mg daily despite starting on linezolid as patient was clinically stable and on low dose of effexor and difficulty in tapering this medicaiton.
Patient should be actively monitored for any signs of fever, extreme hypertension, tachycardia, significantly altered mental status as possible signs of serotonin syndrome.
# Hypothyroidism:  Continued levothyroxine 25 mcg daily.
# Glaucoma:  Continued Xalatan drops 1 drop OS daily.
# Ileal conduit:  Continued 1300 mg sodium bicarb twice daily, later increased to TID.
Iron supplements could be considered on discharge.

You were initially treated with prednisone and cyclosporine for pyoderma of the lung, but upon review of your old biopsies by our pulmonologists and pathologists this was felt not to be the cause of your fevers.
You started to taper off of your immune suppressants, and were treated with antibiotics and antifungals for a UTI as well as a presumed pneumonia.
You also received treatment for a c. diff infection of your colon.
You were transitioned to oral antibiotics and sent to a rehab facility to regain your strength.
