Either way, the recommendations were to proceed to the Operating Room for an anterior exenteration.

She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2180-6-9**] where she underwent anterior exenteration with ileal loop urinary diversion.
She had a vaginal pack in place along with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, two nephroureteral stents, bilateral nephrostomy tubes which were present preoperatively, a pulmonary arterial line, an arterial line, an nasogastric tube and peripheral intravenous lines.
In the Intensive Care Unit she did quite well and she was kept on Ancef and Flagyl antibiotics for 72 hours.
Her pain was controlled with intermittent Morphine pulses and she remained intubated for two days postoperatively.
Her bilateral nephrostomy tubes were left to gravity and were draining urine.
She received aggressive chest physiotherapy and continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint.
She was still kept without eating with an nasogastric tube in place.
She was on Zantac prophylaxis.
Her vaginal packing was removed on postoperative day #2.
At this point her right internal jugular catheter was changed to a triple lumen with a port saved for parenteral nutrition should she need it.
She continued to receive intravenous fluids and was not eating as she had not passed gas yet.
On postoperative day #6 the patient underwent bilateral antegrade nephrostograms and she was found to have prompt drainage from the right kidney through the dilated right ureter into her ileal loop.
The left side, which is her better-functioning kidney did drain but at a slower rate when compared to the right side.
With this knowledge and the nephrostograms, both percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were clamped on postoperative day #6.
The patient developed no pain in the upcoming 12 hours, and on postoperative day #7, the right nephrostomy tube was removed.
The left nephrostomy tube remained capped and the patient was tolerating this quite well.
The decision was made to leave this tube in place as this is her healthier kidney and providing most of her renal function.
By postoperative day #8 her rehabilitation bed was ready at [**Hospital1 **] Facility in [**Location (un) 246**] and she was transferred to rehabilitation in stable condition.
The morning of postoperative day #8 her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed as it was draining small amounts of fluid and the creatinine from this fluid revealed it was consistent with peritoneal fluid and not urine.
Her left flank nephrostomy tube is capped and the site is clean, dry and intact.
Her previous [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site is covered with a dressing and intact.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  All of her preoperative medications without change as well as stoma supplies.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient's midline abdominal staples can be removed on postoperative day #14 and Steri-Strips applied.
When the patient was transferred here from her rehabilitation facility she was receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition.
There may be need for this in the future if she does not continue to improve with her oral intake.
Genitourinary - The patient's left nephrostomy tube should remain capped at all times.
Should the patient develop left flank pain or have minimal output from her loop for an extended period of time, the left nephrostomy could be placed back to gravity drainage but we would like to keep this capped in an effort to have it removed at the postoperative visit.
The patient's ileal loop urostomy appliance was changed on [**2180-6-16**] and extensive instructions have been left in her chart for additional changes on her Page 2 summary completed by the enterostomal therapy nurse.
Follow up - The patient should follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**] in two weeks time for possible left nephrostomy tube removal in the office.
