Admission Date:  [**2176-2-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Penicillins / Latex / Red Dye / Darvon / Percodan / Aspirin / Aspartame / Fentanyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: 10% blasts on routine differential  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ommaya Placement with Intrathecal Chemotherapy  Cycle 1 of hyperCVAD  Right femeral a-line Right central line   History of Present Illness: 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL status post allogeneic transplant with subsequent disease recurrence status post DLI with subsequent achievement of a complete remission p/w several non-spicific pain-related complaints and dizziness and 10% blasts on peripheral smear.
She was treated with standard dose chemotherapy and had a good response.
She completed induction and consolidation chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission.
She underwent reinduction and achieved once again a complete remission.
She received induction chemotherapy once again and achieved remission.
[**Known firstname **] then underwent a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning in [**2169-11-29**].
Her posttransplant course was complicated by the development of a sore throat and question of low level EBV infection.
Since her relapse in [**8-/2171**], [**Known firstname **] received treatment with hyper-CVAD in [**9-/2171**] and a donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2171-11-5**].
She had persistent pain in the perirectal area with incontinence and was found to have CNS involvement of the cauda equina and received radiation therapy to her lower spine in 02/[**2171**].
She then received another cycle of hyper-CVAD in [**1-/2172**] following the completion of her radiation therapy.
She also received two doses of intrathecal methotrexate on [**2172-2-25**] and [**2172-3-19**].
Unfortunately, by the end of [**2-/2172**], she was noted for decreasing counts and was admitted with concern for relapsed disease, which was confirmed on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.
Because of her debilitated state, [**Known firstname **] was not given any further treatment and she was sent home with increased support and to follow up with her local oncologist with a concern that her disease would relapse or progress further.
She has required no further treatment, but has had many chronic complications.
The feeling was that she developed issues with anal stricture after her cauda equina syndrome and radiation therapy along with a neurogenic rectum that did not empty fully.
After approximately two years of significant stress with her bowel regimen and attempts at anal dilatation, she underwent a diverting sigmoid colostomy in [**11/2173**] under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
She also has had issues of chronic hip pain due to osteonecrosis of the hip and she is status post left hip replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ALL, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, h/o paroxysmal supraventricular tachucardia and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, h/o of laryngeal spasm, irritable bowel syndrome w colostomy placed for chronic constipation,avascular necrosis of the hips in the left shoulder and s/p left hip replacement, left upper extremity clot, Sjogren's, Shingles (Spring [**2174**]), systolic CHF (EF in the 30s per patient)  Social History: Mrs. [**Known lastname 11513**] lives alone in her own home.
She has a personal home care assistant that helps with her cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene.
Family History: [**Name (NI) 1094**] mother died [**2172-3-7**] of lung cancer with brain mets at 80y/o.

Myeloperoxidase stains only approximately 20% of the cells.
Diffuse leptomeningeal and cauda equina root enhancement, in this setting strongly suspicious for leptomeningeal involvement by the patient's known ALL.
CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS.
************   Brief Hospital Course: 60 YO F with recurrent ALL status-post non-myeloablative allogeneic matched transplant from an unrelated donor in [**11/2169**] with relapse treated w chemo and DLI in [**8-/2171**] and 03/[**2171**].
She also received a cycle of HyperCVAD.
She received part A as well as dexamethasone on D11-14 but vincristine was not given on D11 due to poor ostomy output and concern for further ileus.
Peripheral blood smears showed resolution of peripheral blasts after 1-2 days of systemic chemotherapy.
Her course was complicated by mucositis, poorly healing aphthous ulcers and poor po intake secondary to pain, which complicated healing and cause electrolyte abnormalities requiring significant repletion.
She was changed from oral pain medication to a low dose morphine PCA with good effect.
She was also started on TPN for nutrition and her electrolytes abnormalities resolved.
The patient became quite hypervolemic during hyperCVAD part A and required aggressive diuresis.
Her home captopril was switched to lisinopril.
An attempt was made to start the patient on a low dose beta-blocker as well but she developed an episode of fluid-responsive hypotension most likely due to the addition of multiple anti-hypertensive medications so beta-blockade could not be initiated.
She was intermittently able to tolerate low dose lisinopril and lasix 20mg PO with maintenance of euvolemia, they were occasionally held in setting of low blood pressures.
Patient was maintained on home dose levothyroxine which she intermittently agreed to take.
The patient was encouraged to continue to take her medications in order to prevent symptomatic hypothyroidism.
Her Omaya port was tapped and she was found to have infection in her CSF which later speciated as VRE.
Her antibiotics were changed to linezolid and vancomycin for improved CSF penetration.
5mg IV metoprolol were given without change in rate; the metoprolol was repeated x 1, again with no change in rate.
Given her tenuous clinical status, respiratory alkalosis, and tachypnea, 15mg diltiazem was given x 1 with resulting improvement in her rate to the 70's.
There was difficulty obtaining [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] on the non-invasive blood pressure [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] phenylephrine was initiated to bring up the blood pressure.
Given the difficulty in obtaining an accurate blood pressure, several ([**6-5**]) attempts were made to place a radial arterial line to obtain arterial blood pressure.
1mg atropine was given, followed by 1mg epinephrine.
The theory behind her cardiac arrest is calcium channel blocker poisoning from diltiazem given in the setting of hypocalcemia and alkalemia; thus she regained her pulse after admininstering calcium chloride.
She was given 2 amps of calcium chloride after return of circulation and 4 grams of calcium gluconate.
She was given 5mg glucagon for possible beta blocker toxicity and to increase cyclic AMP in the setting of calcium channel toxicity.
Several physicians attempted to place an arterial line after the code without success.
Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration, although linezolid will cause BM suppression.
Gentamicin for synergy initially, later stopped.
Meropenem was discontinued given low suspicion for gram negative process.
# HYPOTENSION: Patient had an episode of SBP 80s, did not respond to 750 cc bolus so far.
[**Last Name (un) **] stim did not show evidence of adrenal insufficiency and infectious work-up was negative.
# ALL:  Neupogen was continued initially and thought o be responsible for her bump in WBC.
She is also s/p intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission.
Per BMT, will need further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
She has been afebrile since her evacuation procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.
Would also be concerned that linezolid could be contributing, since this was recently started, although this drug is much less likely to cause rash.
Nodal agents were avoided and electrolytes repleted with particular attention to calcium.
She was able to maintain adequate O2 saturation on a non-rebreather but was working hard and looked to likely be tiring.
She required dobutamine and norepinephrine support for possible cardiogenic shock.
Pt diuresed and eventually weaned off mechanical ventilation.
Speech and swallow evaluation recommended dysphagic diet, 1:1 observation.
A medication effect from rarely (<1%) micafungin or atovaquone (7-10%) is also possible.
She received hypertonic saline w correction of Na to 125.
# VRE infection w CNS involvement, s/p Omaya removal: ID continued to follow her, linezolid was continued.
# ANEMIA: received 2pRBCs w lasix in between to transfuse to Hct > 25.
Temporarily on amiodarone drip, but became bradycardic, so stopped.
Treated temporarily w abx for possible septic infxn, but discontinued as no evidence of active infection.
Did continue linezolid for prior VRE bacteremia.
Initial ABG 7.26/12/86/6 and written for ativan prn for anxiety.
Pt transferred for acute respiratory failure (s/p intubation on [**5-6**]), thought to be [**1-1**] shock - cardiogenic vs septic vs combination.
Elevated lactate to 14 on transfer [**1-1**] hypoperfusion from shock, though ddx included linezolid side effect vs nutritional (thiamine deficiency), so linezolid switched to daptomycin and thiamine administered.
Continued broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem x 7 days ([**5-6**] - [**2176-5-12**]), daptomycin x 7days ([**5-7**] -[**2176-5-13**]), ciprofloxacin (5 days total), atovaqone, acyclovir.
Diuresed as tolerated by blood pressure with lasix 40mg IV x 1 daily (required one dose albumin for support).
She was transitioned to tube feeds.
Patient intubated and immediately required initiation of pressors.
Patient given stress dose steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics, started and quickly maxed out on 3 pressors,  bedside TTE revealed no significant pericardial effusion, and pt given several amps of HCO3.
Stat aline was placed in sterile conditions in R femoral and ABG obtained revealed 7.05/33/34/10 with lactate 8.5.
Medications on Admission: ativan 1mg q6 PO prn captopril 6.25 po BID synthroid 100mcg daily oxycodone 5-10mg QID prn benadryl topical ointment for pruritis artificial tears  Discharge Medications: n/a  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Expired  Primary: Recurrent Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with CNS involvement Cardiopulmonary Arrest  Secondary: Acute on Chronic Systolic Anthracycline-Induced Congestive Heart Failure Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Expired.
