For confirmation of stent positioning, a repeat limited CT of the upper abdomen immediately following the administration of water soluble oral contrast could be considered.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, also larger in size.
Esophageal stent appears to have migrated proximally.
This may be gastric cavity but given the findings of recent CT may also be erosion of stent into mass in lesser sac.
Impression: Proximal migration of stent Large volume of fluid and debris noted in stent Distal end may have eroded into observed mass  [**6-26**] CT non-contrast Abdomen:   1.
He was started on a PPI IV BID and continued on telemetry.

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT:  Patient with swollen, cold right upper extremity in the setting of PICC line placement.
Likely marked third spacing from decreased PO intake, poor synthetic function, and low intravascular oncotic pressure, given albumin levels ranging from 2.1-2.8. .
PAIN CONTROL:  Patient had been taking home oxycontin and oxycodone.
Palliative care was consulted for recommendations on the patient's analgesic regimen and the patient did well on oxycontin 10 mg Q12 and oxycodone 5 mg PO Q4 hrs PRN.
