INDICATION: Post op day 7 after transduodenal ampullectomy and cholecystectomy with fevers and hypotension, assess for abscess or leak.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed through the administration of Gastrografin oral contrast and Optiray intravenous contrast.
A nasogastric tube terminates in the antrum of the stomach.
A surgical drain is seen in the right upper quadrant.
Skin staples are seen across the anterior abdomen, and there is mild subcutaneous soft tissue stranding.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder, and there is nondependent air in the bladder lumen.
Postoperative appearance in the right upper quadrant with foci of pneumoperitoneum, small amount of ascites, pneumobilia, and nonspecific fat stranding.

HISTORY: 72-year-old male s/p transduodenal ampullary resection with elevated while blood count and fever and fluid collection around the liver  PROCEDURE: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.
Preprocedure timeout was called to confirm the identity of the patient and the procedure to be performed.
Lidocaine 1% was used for local anesthesia.
Moderate sedation was provided, by a nurse, by administering divided doses of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed, throughout the total intraservice time of 20 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
Under direct ultrasound guidance with freehand technique, a suitable spot in the right upper quadrant was chosen and after administration of lidocaine, an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was placed into the perihepatic fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided placement of drainage catheter in the perihepatic fluid collection.

INDICATION: 72-year-old man postoperative day 16, status post transit duodenal ampullectomy for ampullary mass, also cholecystectomy with fevers and leukocytosis on antibiotics.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast.
Within the abdomen, there has been interval placement of a pigtail drainage catheter within the lateral perihepatic collection, and there is less fluid and air within this collection.
Interval placement of a percutaneous pigtail catheter within the previously identified fluid- and air-containing collection lateral to the right lobe of the liver.
Do not leave drain un  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man w/p Whipple, CCY on [**6-3**] for a bleeding ampulary mass.
Do not leave drain unless puss.
PROCEDURE:  Pre-procedure written consent and confirmation of patient identity and nature of procedure performed.
Following usual aseptic technique, local and intravenous analgesia using a right posterior intercostal approach, a 10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] multipurpose pigtail catheter was inserted into this fluid collection.
Initial aspiration yielded 10-15 cc of serous fluid samples, of which have been sent for microbiological culture, Gram stain, and amylase.
CT-GUIDED MANIPULATION OF EXISTING PIGTAIL CATHETER  The non-contrast CT scan confirms the existing pigtail catheter in good position along the lateral aspect of the right lobe of the liver.
Successful placement of 10-French pigtail catheter into the loculated right posterior perihepatic fluid collection,  2.
The existing multipurpose pigtail catheter line was flushed and aspirated and remains in good position along the lateral aspect of the right lobe of liver.
Minimal (less than 1.6 cm) rim of fluid at that level.
Left subclavian central venous catheter remains in unchanged position.
A pigtail catheter is present within the right pleural effusion.
