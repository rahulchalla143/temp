Admission Date:  [**2110-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-11-19**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Head bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation NG tube placement  History of Present Illness: 87 year-old man with a history of afib on coumadin, old stroke, HTN, rectal cancer transferred from [**Hospital3 7569**] with left posterior parietal bleed.
Pt was given 2U FFP and 10mg vitamin K sc.
He was also given 4mg ativan  for agitation, loaded with 1gm dilantin, and started on labetalol gtt for blood pressure control, though BP remained elevated in 180s-200.
As labetalol was titrated, pt with increased wheezing so labetalol was stopped and pt started on nicardipine instead.
Additionally, he received lasix 40 IV x1 for increased crackles after getting the FFP.
He was admitted to the ICU for BP control and somnolence.
Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin 2.
BPH s/p ablation 4.
Rectal CA, dx'd [**2110**], s/p chemo/XRT but no resection.
Unable to formally assess strength given mental status, but moves all 4 limbs spontaneously and with good strength.
Head CT [**11-3**]: resolving area of hemorrhage; possible ectatic basilar tip  MRI of brain (w/ susceptibility) [**2110-10-30**]:  This study is severely limited by motion artifact.

Started seizure prophylaxis w/ dilantin - this was continued for one month, then, with no seizure activity during that time.
He also had dysarthria, inattentiveness, and confusion (orientation to time and place) and sensory deficits to gross touch on R side.
He has had slow improvement in his attentiveness and orientation, but son reports that after TIA in [**1-29**], pt was similarly confused and had generalized weakness - he could not walk or swallow.
Son does not recall which region of the brain was affected but pt had reported R hand pin and needles sensation at that time.
His carotid duplex and TTE did not show embolic source; he was started on coumadin in [**1-29**] for ?emboli from his paroxysmal Afib.
He was started on thiamine and folate for ?confabulation attributable to alcohol-induced dementia although he and his family deny any alcohol history.
The issue of re-starting coumadin was addressed, and although the risk for embolic stroke from his PAF remains elevated, the possibility of another ICH on coumadin was more concerning.
He was given ativan, and dilantin loaded, with a post-load level in the range of 14 and with a level of 7.0 the following morning, corrected to 11.4 by albumin, prior to maintenance dosing of dilantin 100 mg tid.
He was continued on dilantin and had no recurrence of activity suspicious for seizures.
He was given labetolol to control his BP, but was d/c'd for subsequent wheezing.
He was transferred to the ICU on nicardipine drip which helped to decrease his BP to the 130s - 140s.
He was switched to lisinopril and metoprolol (pt was on lisinopril and atenolol prior to admission), and his BP dropped down to high 90s.
RESP: CXR initially showed mild pulmonary edema; was intubated for ?agitation and somnolence on [**10-14**].
?LLL infiltrate, was started on Levofloxacin [**10-15**] and completed a 7 day course.
After transfer to step-down, notable for multiple episodes of apnea while sleeping ([**3-6**] minute intervals lasting approx 15 seconds each).
A repeat chest xray performed later that night for vomiting tube feeds showed some resolution of the former left lower lobe opacity, which was now being called "atelectasis."
However, the patient's symptoms suggested new pneumonia, and he was started on Levaquin and Flagyl (initially Vancomycin, which was discontinued after two doses) to target gram negative and anaerobic pathogens.
This was monitored clinically and pulse-ox was checked frequently and was in the mid-to high nineties.
FEN/GI: Pt was somnolent; therefore, NG tube placed for enteral feeds, which was well-tolerated.
NG tubes were repeatedly inserted and pulled by the patient during moments of confusion or discomfort.
His family discussed feeding options and decided to pursue PEG tube placement.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and GI recommended daily dressing changes, binding wound so the patient does not remove the tube, and starting feeds on [**11-15**]; feeds were started, and he tolerated the feeds well and free water flushes.
On [**11-17**] he vomited his tube feeds once, but did well when they were restarted at a low dose.
ID: Pt was started on Levaquin [**10-15**] - [**10-21**] for question of aspiration pneumonia - now resolved.
Additionally, urine grew proteus mirabilis resistant to Levaquin and antibiotics were changed to Trimethoprim [**10-21**] by the ICU team.
He received 2 doses of ceftriaxone prior to his last U/A on [**11-3**] which showed resolution of his UTI.
He continues to have >50 WBC which may reflect chronic inflammation from XRT and TUNA for rectal CA and BPH, respectively.
Once again on [**11-17**] he had a low grade temperature and cough; cxr suggested pneumonia and he was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl for aspiration risk and lower suspicion resistant nosocomial pneumonia.
We suggest that if tube feeds are held for any reason, his midline (access) should be used for gentle hydration.
However, he was continued on both coumadin and aspirin for PAF and stroke prevention.
On admission, he was given FFP and vitamin K for full reversal to INR 1.3 on [**10-13**].
Coumadin was not restarted at the time of discharge, because of the intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage.
