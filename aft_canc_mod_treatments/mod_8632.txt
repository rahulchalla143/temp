Admission Date:  [**2131-8-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-5**]   Service:  MICU-[**Location (un) 2452**] team  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8026**] was a pleasant 80-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hypogammaglobinemia, and liver and brain metastases with unknown primary, who was initially admitted with a brain metastatic bleed and resulting seizure disorder.
He was once admitted to the MICU from [**8-16**] to [**8-17**] for acute respiratory distress which was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia and he was started on BIPAP and then weaned to face mask.
We were unable to treat him due to his metastatic bleed in his brain, so he was given aspirin and Lopressor.
His aspiration pneumonia was treated with Zosyn, vancomycin, and Flagyl.
He went to the floor on [**8-17**] and was started on hemodialysis.
However, the next day, he developed peripheral eosinophilia and urine eosinophilia which was thought to be secondary to his Zosyn and, so, he was changed to levofloxacin for one dose.
He also had his Quinton catheter pulled out which he was using for his hemodialysis on [**8-19**] because an AV fistula was formed and there was a big left groin hematoma with a drop in blood pressure.
He also had a likely aspiration event on [**8-20**] with possible sepsis and the blood loss in his groin hematoma caused him to become hypotensive.
He was sent to the MICU and he was started on BIPAP, but intubated on [**8-20**] for airway protection.
He was continued on levofloxacin, Flagyl, and vancomycin for the presumed line sepsis and the aspiration pneumonia.
He was being covered with vancomycin, Bactrim, and Ceptaz, but it was believed that his eosinophilia was secondary to his multiple drug interactions, and the patient also developed a drug rash in his axillary area which was also thought to be secondary to drug reaction.
Allergy and Immunology were consulted who recommended that all his antibiotics be stopped and the patient was started on tobramycin.
The patient was also receiving hemodialysis three times a week.
At that time, a very detailed family meeting was held between the attending, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8516**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], social worker, and the daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname 8026**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 8026**], who was actively involved in his care.
During the family meeting, it was decided that the patient will be made comfort measures only.
He will remain trached and we are going to continue some of his medications at this time and his tube feed and try to make him as comfortable as possible.
On [**2131-9-4**], it was decided that we could start slowly weaning off his medications, except for medications that would keep him comfortable.
All of his medications, including Lopressor, aspirin, and other medications he was on, were all discharged and the patient was kept on an Ativan drip, Fentanyl drip, and his valproic acid to prevent him from developing any seizures.
The patient's tube feeds were still continued, but they were decreased from 60 cc per hour to 10 cc per hour.
On [**2131-9-5**], in the morning, it was decided that we could slowly start weaning off his trach and moving to pressure support of 5, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 21%, in a BIPAP mode and continue his tube feeds at 10 cc per hour and titrate up the Fentanyl and the Ativan as needed to make him more comfortable.
In addition, we can add a morphine drip and titrate that up, as well, as needed for comfort level.
