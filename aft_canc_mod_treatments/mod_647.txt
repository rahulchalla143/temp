The patient was placed on intravenous proton pump inhibitor and made nothing by mouth.
Partial parenteral nutrition was started on [**8-31**].
A left brachial vein PICC line was placed on [**9-1**], with initiation of total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was evaluated by Surgery for gastric outlet obstruction.
It was felt that the NJ tube would be the least invasive, and the fact that the patient may respond to chemotherapy, negating the need for a permanent G or J feeding tube.
Stenting the gastric outlet obstruction was not an option, as the tumor would be reduced with chemotherapy, freeing the stent and passing it further downstream, where it could not be retrieved and could potentially cause another obstruction.
Again NJ tube was placed on [**9-5**], and the patient was transferred to the Oncology service for chemotherapy.
His medications at home are aspirin, atenolol, Glipizide, Lisinopril, Metformin, Ranitidine.
He is a pleasant male, bagged with NJ tube taped in place, comfortable, in no acute distress.
His left PICC line with Tegaderm was intact, clean and dry, no erythema, warmth or tenderness, no signs of infection.
On the Oncology service, the patient received Rituxan on [**9-6**] and CHOP on [**9-7**], and received additional three days of prednisone.
His hospital course on the Oncology service was significant for hyperglycemia on the prednisone, and total parenteral nutrition, as well as a deep venous thrombosis in the left axillar vein.
The patient was started on tube feeds, eventually tolerated the tube feeds well.
Total parenteral nutrition was discontinued, with some improvement in his serum glucose.
He was also started back on his Metformin and Glipizide.
For his deep venous thrombosis, the PICC line was removed, and he was started on heparin and Coumadin, to be titrated to therapeutic levels.
He was discharged on Compazine, Protonix intravenously every 12 hours, Tylenol as needed, Metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Glipizide 2.5 mg once daily, as well as Coumadin 5 mg once daily.
The plan was to discontinue the heparin once the INR was around 2.5, with the heparin therapy in the meantime.
