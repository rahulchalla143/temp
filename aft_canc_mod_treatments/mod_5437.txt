On [**10-2**] he underwent Bilateral suboccipital craniotomy for resection of tumor using a stereotactic computer assisted volumetric intracranial procedure and a right sided frontal EVD placement.
The procedure was approximately 17 hours long and there were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively he went to the surgical intensive care unit on steroids, an EVD drain at 10cm above trageus.
He was in the ICU for 5 days with a right frontal EVD on a steroid taper and Mannitol Q 6 hours and an exam of awaking briskly to voice following commands.

Post-operatively he awoke and followed commands briskly his steroid were increased and Mannitol continued with extra doses for osmolarities less than 300.
Over the next few days his exam waxed and waned sometimes thought to be associated with ventricular drain output, at one point the EVD stopped working for nearly 24 hours then began to work again, he continued on Q6 hour Mannitol.
Attempts were made to wean his ventriculostomy drain despite raising to high levels he would continue to drain large amount of CSF.
