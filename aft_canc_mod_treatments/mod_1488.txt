DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post orthotopic liver transplant.
Status post exploratory laparotomy with repair of fascial wound dehiscence.
Status post liver biopsy.
Portal vein thrombosis/stenosis--status post thrombolysis and stenting.
Insertion of nasojejunal feeding tube via endoscopic guidance.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old male, with a history of end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas, who had been awaiting a liver transplant and had actually been admitted to the hospital towards the end of [**Month (only) **] for elective orthotopic liver transplantation, but unfortunately secondary to an inappropriate donor, Mr. [**Known lastname 17391**] liver transplantation was cancelled.
Notably, the patient had a heavy history of alcohol use and polysubstance abuse including IV drug abuse, but he had been free of these for at least 14 years.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, and on the evening of the [**12-6**] he underwent an orthotopic cadaveric liver transplantation using the piggyback technique.
The portal vein was anastomosed to the portal vein with a common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis, and a celiac duct patch into the donor branch patch anastomosis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there was no note of intraoperative complication.
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for ventilatory support and intensive monitoring.
NEUROLOGIC:  Neurologically, the patient's pain was    controlled with a variety of combinations of intravenous    and oral narcotics.
His chronic low back pain continued    to be an issue throughout his hospitalization, but prior    to his discharge we were able to sustain him on a regimen    of methadone 5 mg po bid, in addition to 5 mg of oxycodone    q 6 h as needed for breakthrough pain on top of his    Neurontin he had been taking.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient was supported with a ventilator    in the initial postoperative period from which he was able    to wean successfully without complication.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's cardiovascular status was    tenuous in the initial postoperative period requiring some    vasopressor support with Neo-Synephrine, but after    adequate volume resuscitation in the immediate    perioperative period, we were able to wean off    vasopressors, and the patient was able to maintain an    adequate blood pressure with peripheral perfusion pressure    without any sort of pharmacologic support.
We were able    to restart the patient's beta blockade for    cardioprotection and management of his hypertension, and    he tolerated his Lopressor doses well without any    complication.
The patient tolerated this    procedure well, and after successful stenting and balloon    dilatation via angiography, the patient's liver function    tests improved and stabilized.
His wound was subsequently cared    for with a combination of wet-to-dry dressing changes and    placement of a wound VAC.
He was initially given TPN until return    of bowel function, and subsequent to that time, as it was    felt the patient could not take in adequate oral intake    without supplementation to sustain himself, postpyloric    feeding tubes were placed, and he was started on    supplemental enteral nutrition via tube feeds, which he    continued up until one day prior to the end of his    hospitalization.
These tube feeds were administered, as    noted, through a postpyloric feeding tube.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's main infectious disease    issues included a left lower lobe pneumonia, for which he    was treated appropriately with broad-spectrum antibiotics    including Zosyn.
Regarding patient's immunosuppression, after the standard initial postoperative course, he was maintained on cyclosporin and CellCept, along with oral doses of prednisone.
His cyclosporin levels had been stabilized on a dose of 150 mg of cyclosporin [**Hospital1 **], along with CellCept 1 gram po bid, and 15 mg of prednisone once daily.
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal, with a pulse in the 60s, a blood pressure in the 110s, satting 95 percent on room air, with blood sugars between the 70s and 130s.
Bactrim single strength 1 tab po once daily.
CellCept 1,000 mg po bid.
Guaifenesin 5-10 cc po q 4-6 h prn.
Prednisone 15 mg po once daily.
Albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments.
Lansoprazole 30 mg po once daily.
Colace 100 mg 1 po bid.
Aspirin 81 mg po once daily.
15.Oxycodone 5 mg po q 4-6 h prn pain.
19.Cyclosporin dose to be adjusted based on levels (150 mg po q 12 h at the time of discharge).
20.Glargine insulin 20 units q at bedtime with an insulin sliding scale.
