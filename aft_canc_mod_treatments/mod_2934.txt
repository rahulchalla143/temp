Admission Date:  [**2116-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-9-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Here for allogeneic transplant for refractory multiple myeloma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line placement and removal chemotherapy with cytoxan and busulfan allogeneic bome marrow transplant PICC line placement VATS/pleurodeisis  History of Present Illness: 39 yo male with multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2114**] He was initially treated with Decadron alone and then began treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone, which was started in 09/[**2114**].
He also underwent radiation therapy to the sacral area in 11/[**2114**].
His course was complicated by a DVT and PE at the time of his diagnosis, and he was on anticoagulation particularly while receiving thalidomide and Decadron.
He was noted for a very good response to his treatment with a repeat bone marrow biopsy in [**2115-3-19**] showing 5% plasma cells as well as marked improvement in his lesion in the sacral area.
He received a cycle of DVD chemotherapy on [**2115-4-25**].
Following this therapy, he had increasing pain with increasing IgG levels and SPEP with a poor response to therapy, he was switched to treatment with Velcade and Decadron.
A repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed CD138 staining of plasma cells for approximately 10% of the cellularity.
He then received high-dose Cytoxan on [**2115-7-25**] in preparation for stem cell mobilization with his stem cell collections completed during the week of [**2115-8-5**].
He then was admitted on [**2115-8-23**] for high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by stem cell transplant.
His IgG level had decreased to 1314 following his transplant.
He received radiation therapy to this area.
Also in this setting, his IgG level had now increased to almost 4 g.  He underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy by his local oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59071**], which revealed extensive relapsed disease with plasma cell myeloma accounting for 80-90% of the core biopsy specimen.
As a result of this, it was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 40270**] required more systemic therapy in addition to continuing the radiation therapy to the groin area, he was started Velcade with Decadron [**2116-3-2**].
He had been requiring increasing platelet transfusion support prior to beginning Velcade as well as during the course of Velcade with a platelet count less than 20,000 as well as red blood cell transfusion support, his IgG level had increased to 7 g with his SPEP now representing 50% or 4900 mg/dL of the total protein.
He was started on more aggressive chemotherapy with D-PACE on [**2116-3-4**].
Within one week, he was noted for an increase of his IgG to over 6 g.  As he clearly had an agressive refractory myeloma, he is being admitted for with a myeloablative transplant with cytoxan and busulfan conditioning.
Recent pneumonia treated with a 14-day course of Levofloxacin in 02/[**2116**].
[**6-2**] Line placement 1: Successful placement of a 7-French triple lumen central line through the left internal jugular vein with the tip in the superior vena cava.
[**6-2**] Line Placement 2: Successful placement of a 29 cm cuff-to-tip 10 French double- lumen tunneled [**Doctor Last Name 3075**] catheter with the tip in the superior vena cava.
[**6-8**] Transfusion reaction investigation: Mr [**Known lastname 40270**] had diffuse trunk and arm pain, tachycardia, mild hypertension and difficulty breathing while undergoing a transfusion of compatible red cells.
At this time we do not recommend changes in transfusion practice in this patient except careful monitoring during future transfusions.
Right pleural tube still in place, but there is no pneumothorax or appreciable right pleural effusion.
Tip of the left PIC catheter projects over the SVC.
5.There is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart.
[**7-4**] DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 40270**] has a clinically significant red cell alloantibody, anti-S. S is a member of the MNS blood group system.
In the future he should receive S negative red cells for transfusion.
[**7-20**] MRI of C-spine and T-spine: CONCLUSION: T11 vertebral body collapse, unchanged since [**3-22**], [**2116**].
Improved aeration of the right lung since the prior CT, although the entire right lung remains involved with heterogeneous consolidations.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 40270**] was admitted for a MUD allogeneic BMT with Cytoxan and Busulfan conditioning.
He had one suspected transfusion reaction to pRBCs, and an investigation was performed.
He was started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and then Caspofungin was added.
He was diuresed with some decrease in effusion size, although left sided effusion was still large.
They attempted thoracentesis on left, but were unable to drain any fluid despite being able to visualize fluid on ultrasound.
Thoracentesis was performed on the right side and very small amount of fluid was drained.
Pain responded to iv morphine.
Thoracics was contact[**Name (NI) **] and placed a chest tube on [**6-18**] on the right which drained bloody fluid.
Patient was feeling much better after the chest tube was placed.
His LFTs started trending down and chest tube output was decreasing.
Chest tube was removed by Thoracics surgery on [**6-22**].
He continued to have serosanguinous drainage from chest tube site while he was neutropenic, but this stopped when his blood counts started rising.
In the afternoon he underwent a sharp decline in mental status, becoming confused and then increasingly somnolent.
He was given 125mg Solumedrol and 1U plts/1U blood were transfused.
He was intubated on floor for airway protection and transferred back to the ICU.
His vent settings were titrated as needed to maintain normal pCO2.
His acyclovir was held and his CSA dose was decreased to prevent further nephrotoxicity.
Fever & neutropenia: While in the ICU, the patient was continued on Vancomycin and  Meropenem given his prior MRSA bacteremia and neutropenic fever.
His Caspofungin was initially changed to Ambisome but given his rise in creatinine, he was switched back to Caspofungin and then back to Ambisome once his Bili and AST/ALT began to rise.
Two thansthoracic echocardiograms were performed looking for valvular vegetations but none seen.
Peripheral neuropathy: He was usually on Neurontin and B6, but these were held for high dose chemotherapy given unknown durg-drug interactions with high dose chemotherapy.
FEN: He was on a neutropenic, cardiac diet, with prn repletion of electrolytes and IVF per protocol.
TPN was started on [**2116-6-27**] given poor po intake, low albumin.
FULL CODE  *** Of note, he has a bactrim allergy, so he will need to have pentamidine as PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Medications on Admission: Lexapro has been dicontinued Neurontin 400 mg t.i.d.
B6 vitamin 50 mg daily MS Contin 15 mg b.i.d.
MSIR 15 to 30 mg q.4-6h.
Protonix 40 mg daily acyclovir 400 mg t.i.d.
