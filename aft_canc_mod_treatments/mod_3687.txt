dx'd [**2-13**] s/p extrapleural pneumonectomy, resection of his diaphragm, resection of the pericardium, and reconstruction with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex graft, and lymph node dissection [**5-14**] and chemo (Cisplantin/Alimta)1 wk ago.
CT surgery saw pt for window & are suggesting pericariocentesis, feel likely post-op rather than malignant.
Pericardiocentesis was performed and 320-350 cc of thin red fluid was withdrawn.
No hemodynamic evidence of cardiac tamponade was observed CO6.69, CI 3.61, PCWmean 4, RAmean 6, PA 13/10 mean 12, RV 30/5, SVC 71%, Ao 98%.
Pt tolerated the procedure well.
--hypercholesterolemia --GERD --diverticulosis --s/p bilateral knee surgery  Social History: Pt was a shipyard worker and had exposure to asbestos.

(Right lung and pleura, pneumonectomy and pleural resection) (B-AC): 1)  Diffuse malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid type (papillary pattern).
3)  Bronchial and vascular resection margins are free of tumor.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade [**2165-8-8**] CXR: Patient s/p right pneumonectomy with large amount of fluid occupying the right hemithorax.
2) S/P right pneumonectomy with right hydropneumothorax.
