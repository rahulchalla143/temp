She was continued on IV flagyl for her CDiff colitis, which was thought to be a possible source of her bleeding.
After initial discharge from the MICU, there was a question of possible anticoagulation in this patient because of concern for HIT.
A repeat MRI was performed which showed an interval increase in embolic phenomenom as well as a subacute on chronic hemorrhage.
In addition, there are many confounding factors for this finding, including consecutive infections and polypharmacy (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin).
For these reasons, the heme service did not believe that she had HIT and thus argatroban was not indicated.
She is being treated with a 6 week course of Vancomycin.
[**Name (NI) **] son relayed that his mother would not want any further treatment including both chemo or radiation.
