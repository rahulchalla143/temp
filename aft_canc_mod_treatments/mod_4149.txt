The right middle lobe consolidation, 3:30 and the subpleural areas of consolidation in the lingula has slightly increased in the interim, thus might represent areas of atelectasis, although infectious process cannot be excluded as well as malignancy given a short-term dating back only to [**4-18**], [**2149**].
They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19, along with CD5 (dim, variable) and HLA-DR.  [**Last Name (STitle) 20282**] do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD10, FMC-7, CD23 or CD138.
In the absence of a mass lesion, a repeat pleural fluid analysis with cell block preparation for additional immunohistochemical workup may be contributory.
Recommend correlation with endoscopy and biopsy at the fundus.
Note: The lymphocytes are polymorphic and appear similar to   the patient's prior pleural fluid specimen C09-[**Numeric Identifier 61972**].
See also corresponding studies performed on   prior pleural fluids (S09-[**Numeric Identifier 61973**] and S09-[**Numeric Identifier 37469**].)
Initially pt was requiring 5-6 L NC to maintain sats in the mid 90s.
Patient underwent thoracentesis and removal of approximately 1400 ml of serous appearing fluid, final cytology with malignant cells, likely lymphoma.
She underwent another subsequent therapeutic thoracentesis prior to her discharge.
He diastolic heart failure was treated with rate control and diuresis.
It was felt the pt had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, or primary effusion lymphoma.
The oncology team was consulted and steps were taken to try to delineate what kind of lymphoma the patient had to determine prognosis and treatment options.
MRI abdomen commented on gastric fundus thickening, concerning for MALT lymphoma.
She was given periodic diuresis as needed.
Following a thoracentesis she reverted back to NSR.
She was evaluated by cardiology/EP and a pacemaker was placed on [**2150-5-14**].
Following pacemaker placement she again went into RVR and this time dropped her pressures to the 70's-90's systolic.
Lopressor was initially held during amiodarone load and then restarted at 12.5 mg TID and titrated to 25 mg po TID prior to discharge.
She was transitioned to oral amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week and then 200 mg daily x 1 week.
She is chronically anticoagulated on coumadin at home.
This was held during part of her stay for invasive procedures.
On discharge, given her history of TIA/stroke, we recommend IV heparin gtt (previously theraputic on 800 units/hr) while awaiting possible repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2150-5-25**].
After that procedure, coumadin can be re-initiated at her previous dosing, which is 3 mg qhs on MWF and 2 mg on STThSunday.
# Tachy-Brady Syndrome: As noted above, patient developed significant sinus pauses requiring pacemaker placement.
She received 4 doses of Vancomycin for prophylaxis.
# Acute on Chronic kidney failure: Initial creatinine was elevated at 2.3, with baseline of 1.7-1.9.
# Hypertension: Patient was continued on home regimen of amlodipine and metoprolol.
Her HCTZ and calcium supplements were stopped.
Pt was given pamidronate 30 mg IV x1 on [**5-11**].
She will need her calcium levels monitored and may require periodic pamidronate.
Discussed with [**Month/Year (2) 1106**], and this is NOT an acute aortic dissection, but rather just a chronic finding from choleterol plaques.
# Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease: Continued atorvastatin and aspirin 325mg daily.
She was continued on Neurontin for neuropathic pain.
She was discharged to the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU for IV heparin and pulmonary rehab.
