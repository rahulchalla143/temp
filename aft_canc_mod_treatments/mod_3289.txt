Admission Date:  [**2171-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-1-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: Hematochezia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy x 2 ([**2171-1-2**] and [**2171-1-4**]) EGD ([**2171-1-2**]) Angiogram   History of Present Illness: 85 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia, MCA CVA in [**1-/2170**], and two past GI bleeds (most recent was hematochezia during hospitalization for CVA) admitted from nursing home after passing approximately half a cup of blood from her rectum.
Pt was started on IV protonix [**Hospital1 **].
At that time, she was transfused 1 unit of PRBC and the pt was transferred to the MICU.
Multiple non-bleeding diverticula were seen in the sigmoid colon.
S/P cholecystectomy 7.
---- Colonoscopy [**2171-1-4**]:Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon.
The plan was to check q6h Hcts and to keep her NPO other than Golytely bowel prep overnight for colonoscopy in the morning.
She received a unit of PRBCs and was lightheaded, so she had a tagged RBC scan which did not show source of bleeding.
Per surgery team, most surgeons have a cut-off for rate of bleeding before performing colectomy for this problem.
It remained this way for a day as we were holding her BP meds in case she bled again.
It was not quite back into a normal range, with SBPs of 140, and her Lasix should be restarted at some point to hopefully bring her pressure back to normal if needed.
Her statin was continued throughout.
3.Psych:We continued her celexa and xanax initially.
Her doxepin was also continued as family stated that this helped her anxiety/confusion in the past.
She was sent out on the doses of these meds that she came in on.
6.Renal: Creatinine at 1.1 on admit.
She has been seeing neurologists for this and has been trying different medication regimens.
In addition, she will make appointments to follow-up with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], GI, and neuro to make sure she has all options available in the future and that she stays connected within the system should she require treatment in the future.
She was sent on 2 months of iron to replace iron stores lost by GI bleeding, as well as B12 and folate.
