He was discharged on home treatment with IV ampicillin + PO Flagyl.
Interventional Pulmonology and Cardio-Thoracic Surgery consults were obtained, the collection was deemed too small for percutaneous drainage and, in-light of the patient's clinical improvement and stable condition, a conservative approach was advocated with continued Abx treatment and follow-up CT 2 weeks post discharge.
# Ear infection - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had drainage of Pus from his ear which resolved with systemic antibiotics.
Later otoscopic exams revealed bilateral Otitis Media W/ Effusion which was attributed to his intubation and supine posture.

He was treated with IVF with subsequent normalization of renal functions and good urine output.
