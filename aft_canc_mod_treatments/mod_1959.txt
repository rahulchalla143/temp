She was admitted and treated for CAP w/ timentin.
Her pain was hard to control and required toradol and morphine.
She was found to have bl pleural effusion, and thoracic sx performed thoracentesis of the effusions.
A CT of the neck was done for her neck swelling (per patient) and incidentally showed 2x1cm mass at base of tongue.
Her hospital course was further complicated by persistent leukocytosis, low grade fevers, tachycardia, with occasional episodes of [**1-11**] run of VT. From OSH records it is unclear when abx regimen was switched but patient was started on levo/ceftriaxone.
Cardiology was consulted and echo was done that showed trivial pericardial effusion, tele sig for sinus tach, and so patient was started on metoprolol.
Plan was to possible retap or thoracoscopic drainage and pleurodesis by thoracic surgery, but patient requested to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Prior to transfer her VS at OSH were notable for Tmax 100.6, HR 130s SBP 180s, 95% RA.
She continues to feel short of breath at times, and uses supplemental oxygen for relief.
