Per patient report, his blood sugars have been "harder to control lately", despite compliance w insulin 70/30 regimen and diet; reports feeling well, denies fevers, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria.
Past Medical History: - CHF (EF 25%) - Severe CAD s/p CABG in [**2196**] and PCI in [**2199**] - LV thrombus on coumadin - Diabetes - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - CKD (Baseline Cr = 2.6) - VF arrest [**2196**] s/p ICD placement - s/p bilateral SFA stenting - s/p L common femoral to below-knee popliteal artery bypass with non-reversed right saphenous vein   Social History: Lives with wife, immigrated from Caribbean approximately 40 years ago.
CXR PA and LAT ([**2204-10-9**]) In comparison with study of [**10-8**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with previous CABG procedure and elevated right hemidiaphragm.
Punctate calcification in the cardiac apex is likely related to known LV thrombosis.
There is moderate-to-severe multivessel coronary arterial calcification as well as aortic valve calcification.
BONE WINDOW: The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact wires.
Severe anemia, coronary arterial disease, LV thrombosis, and papillary muscle calcification.
ABDOMEN: Nasogastric tube is seen, the tip is oriented in the stomach.
A hyperdense lesion that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst but cannot be fully characterized in the absence of IV contrast is seen in the inferior pole of the right kidney with no gross change from previous examination.
PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within the urinary bladder.
Foley catheter is seen within the urinary bladder.
While imaging is limited by acoustic window, findings are consistent a cyst probably containing some internal debris and a single thin septation.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with complicated cardiac history including CAD s/p CABG ([**2196**]), DES to RCA and protected OMCA ostium in [**2199**] and sCHF with EF 35-40% who p/w lethargy, melena, and hyperglycemia thought to have GI bleed complicated course including hemoperitoneum managed medically w/ bowel rest and decompression, as well as acute on chronic renal failure and UTI/ bacteremia .
# Microcytic Anemia - Pt a/w Hct 21 (most recent prior values 34-38), guaiac pos brown stool; despite patients history of significant CAD, patient asymptomatic on presentation; guaiac pos stool in setting of microcytic anemia was concerning for GI loss especially in patient on coumadin, ASA, plavix; It was unclear if this would be lower or upper GI source.
He was also started on IV protonix 40mg daily for concern of possible upper GI bleed.
As the EGD did showed gastritis he was transitioned to PO Protonix 40 daily which was continued at the time of discharge.
His post colonoscopy course was complicated by hemoperitoneum requiring admission to the MICU with transfer to the SICU as described below.
In total the patient received 10 units of PRBCS and 2 units of PRBCs.
# Hemoperitoneum:  As above the pt was admitted to the Medical ICU on [**9-26**] for medical management of bowel perforation versus hemorrhage after colonoscopy.
He received a total of 10 units of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP over this hospitalization.
He was not felt to be a good operative candidate for surgical intervention therefore he was managed with bowel rest and gastric decompression.
# Supratherapeutic INR - on coumadin for LV thrombus, but w INR 4.7 on admission, uncertain etiology.
The coumadin was held and INR gradually drifted down to 1.0.
However, it began to trend upward again while on the floor and vitamin K was given PO due to the patients high risk for bleeding.
Repeat TTE showed no LV therefore coumadin was not restarted.
The patient was maintained on sliding scale insulin with addition of home 70/30 as oral intake increased.
This was increased from 25 to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] for better blood pressure and rate control His diuretics were initially continued but were eventually held in the setting of increasing creatinine.
However his home lasix was resumed prior to discharge.
His home spironolactone was not restarted.
Patient was instructed to discuss restarting his medication with his PCP.
It was initally trending downward on transfer to the floor however then increased to 3.0.
The patient was noted to have increasing suprapubic abdominal pain and placement of a foley drained 500 mL of urine suggesting a post renal etiology to the increased creatinine.
He was continued on home Hydralazine, carvediol was increased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], lasix and spironolactone.
However, diuretics were eventually held in the setting of rising creatinine.
As below lasix was restarted prior to discharge but spironolactone was not.
There was a concern for bacterial translocation from the gut and the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with linezolid and zosyn.
The patients WBC trended downward and antibiotics were discontinued as no source of infection was identified.
He was initially started on broad spectrum gram negative/anaerobic coverage with cefepime and flagyl and then transitioned to PO cipro flagyl to complete a 2 week course from his first negative culture on [**2204-10-10**].
Patient was having increasing suprapubic pain as well as urinary incontinence so a foley was placed and drained 500 mL of urine.
Post foley void trials were attempted on 2 occasions unsuccessfully.
Patient was started on tamsulosin and discharged with a foley in place to f/u with [**Date Range **] as an outpatient regarding discontinuing the foley.
Sodium trended downward and fluids were discontinued as the patient increased his oral fluid intake.
# CAD - The patient was continued on  atorvastatin and carvedilol, aspirin and plavix were held in the setting of an acute bleed.
Prior to discharge he was restarted on aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and carvediolol at an increased dose as above.
His plavix was not restarted at the time of discharge.
# h/o LV Thrombus - The patient's coumadin was initially held for supratherapeutic INR.
Repeat TTE showed no evidence of thrombus therefore coumadin was not restarted.
#HLD: Patient was continued on home atorvastatin for most of his admission and at the time of discharge.
