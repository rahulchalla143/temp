He saw his gastroenterologist and was told to complete a course of ciprofloxacin and flaygl.
PO vancomycin was started for this rather than flagyl, based on renal recommendations.
CXRs cleared over the course of antibiotic therapy, and the patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course.
He continued to experience dyspnea, with worsening hypoxia, sating 70s on room air, requiring a non-rebreather to maintain sats in the 90s.
A d-dimer was negative, though it was performed while the patient was already started on empiric anticoagulation with heparin for presumed PE, and a V/Q scan was indeterminate.
The heparin was stopped after the negative d-dimer.
The patient is requesting transfer for continued management of hypoxia.
Was treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisone.
-Baseline Cr 3.1 #.
Status post right inguinal hernia #.
CXR: [**2181-2-5**]:  limited exam, LLL infiltrate [**2181-2-7**]:  partial clearing of LLL infiltrate, small bilateral pleural effusions [**2181-2-11**]:  no acute cardiopulm process [**2181-2-14**]:  no acute cardiopulm process [**2181-2-15**]:  no acute cardiopulm process [**2181-2-18**]:  new RUL airspace disease, minimal LUL airspace disease, these findings consistent with pneumonia, lung bases are clear .
Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies for the patient's hypoxia were thought to include pneumonia, PE, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and leukostasis.
He was empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn, and though he had a negative D-dimer and V/Q scan at [**Hospital3 3583**] an ECHO and LENIs were attained and demonstrated no evidence of right heart strain or DVT.
He was also started on hydroxyurea to prevent leukostasis, though the heme/onc service thought that this was unlikely to be the etiology for his hypoxia and CXR infiltrates.
He was no longer on oxygen about 6 days prior to discharge, and pulmonary felt that it was okay to proceed on [**2181-3-5**].
Steroids were discontinued and hydrea was started with improvement in his white count to 30 at discharge.
He was also continued on po flagyl for C. diff.
C. diff:  Diagnosed four days after starting antibiotics at [**Hospital3 3583**] and treated with po vancomycin per renal reccs by their consult service because of his renal insufficiency.
Multiple approaches to treatment were discussed with hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, and surgical experts.

The patient did not tolerate an anal pap smear secondary to pain.
Has not previously received chemotherapy for this, but started on hydroxyurea for leukocytosis as described above.
Incidentally, the etiology of the patient's CMML may be related to her history of cyclophosphamide for membranous nephropathy.
A bone marrow was performed at [**Hospital3 **] and showed 19% blasts, close to the 20% cut off for conversion to AML.
He will be discharged on hydrea 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
