Left  axillobifemoral  bypass  graft  using 6 mm ringed     polytetrafluoroethylene.
History of Present Illness: The  patient  is  a 68 year old male with end stage    lung cancer   who   has   undergone   a   previous axillobifemoral bypass graft for lung ischemia.
He presented with  an occlusion  several  months  ago  but could not have surgery  due  to  his  chemotherapy regimen.
After  intravenous  heparin therapy and repeat angiogram,  he was  taken to the Operating Room.
Past Medical History: Past medical history is significant for lung cancer that is metastatic to the neck and hilum that is being treated with chemotherapy and is being monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] from The Cancer Center of [**Location (un) 86**].
Also past medical history is significant for pancytopenia with anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia  He also has a history of pericardial infusion with approximately 1200 cc of bloody fluid removed from the pericardial sac in [**Month (only) 1096**] without recurrence.
Past surgical history is significant for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, exploratory laparotomy for cancer, and questionable partial colectomy for diverticulitis.
BP (mm Hg): 70/40 HR (bpm): 113 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2163-7-14**] at 03:21 Test: TTE(Focused views) Doppler: No Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2003W275-0:0 Test Location: West Echo Lab Technical Quality: Suboptimal   INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows.
No atrial collapse is seen (pericardial effusion/mass smaller around the right atrium).
[**2163-7-13**]  INDICATION FOR CONSULT: INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION REACTION  INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT: Investigation of transfusion reaction  CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old man, s/p left axillobifemoral bypass for bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
The transfusion was stopped after about 200 ml of RBC was transfused.
The Swan-Ganz catheter is again noted, with tip in the right main pulmonary artery.
The patient is status post right axillary-bifemoral bypass which is now occluded as seen by duplex ultrasound.
RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs.
Brief Hospital Course: pt admitted [**2163-7-7**] for acute rle ischemia  Heparin started stat  [**2163-7-7**]  Pt underwent a:  1.
Left  axillobifemoral  bypass  graft  using 6 mm ringed polytetrafluoroethylene.
He was sedated on a variety of drips for blood presssure control.
Mr [**Known lastname **] then underwent a second procedure for his ischemic limb.
During the procedure it was thought that  there was nothing technically that could be  fixed,  this  was  either  related to spasm of the distal vessels from chronic ischemia and the pressors, or related to thrombus  in  the distal vessels.
Plan was to continue to resuscitate the patient, and get the patient off pressors and hopefully this would solve the problem.
Also  of note, since there was concern about a white platelet plug, decision was  made to stop all heparin and switch the patient eventually to Hirudin.
[**2165-7-10**] - [**2165-7-11**]  Pt was weaned of pressors for blood pressure control.
Hirudin was dc'd.
Pt medication was changed back to heparin.
There was a low threshold for reintubation (bi-pap).
His heparin was increased to 1000 units hr.
[**2165-7-13**]  PA catheter changed to triple lumen.
Pt started on esnolol to decrease his HR.
Pt developed PEA - ACLS protocol was initiated.
Right chest tube placed.
Medications on Admission: dexamethasone 4 mg qd deltasone 20 mg qod  Discharge Medications: Pt deceased  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: n/a  Discharge Condition: n/a  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: n/a   Completed by:[**2165-8-13**
