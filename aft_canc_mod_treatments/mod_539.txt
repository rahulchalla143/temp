At [**Hospital6 33**], he was started on ceftriaxone and azithro which was switched to Vancomycin, Gent, Ampicillin, Azithro after ID was consulted.
Patient does not know what medications he takes at home, and has pill bottles of truvada and zerit.
Troponin 0.08, CK negative.

Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS - 96.6F  HR 67  145/70  16  100%/2L 205lbs Gen: awake, alert, NAD HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, OP clear, no evidence of thrush, small area of erythema under tongue Neck: supple, no LAD, JVP 9cm CV: regular, S1, mech S2, soft systolic murmur Pulm: Crackles bilaterally [**2-6**] way up with exp wheeze Abd: (+) BS, distended, firm, mild, diffuse TTP, no rebound or guarding Ext: WWP, 2+ LE edema b/l, 1+ DP pulse b/l skin: no rash  Pertinent Results: TEE ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2137-4-26**]: The left atrium is dilated.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
CT TORSO [**2137-4-27**]: TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are obtained with the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], 130 cc of Optiray.
CHEST: The patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy.
The patient is post mitral valve replacement.
LIVER ultrasound with dopplers [**2137-4-27**]: 1.
COLONOSCOPY [**2137-5-17**]:  Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and mech mitral valve [**2131**], HIV+ CD4 50, DM2, transferred from outside hospital with CHF, Enterococcal endocarditis, and ascites.
Sensitivities from the outside hospital indicated sensitive to PCN and vancomycin, with high resistance to Gentamicin and streptomycin.
ID was consulted for further management and recommended changing to ampicillin and ceftriaxone, based on sensitivities done at [**Hospital1 18**].
The first day of these medications is [**4-29**], and he is to continue these medications for 8-12 weeks as directed by infectious disease, with whom he will follow up.
Of note, OSH TTE showed possible aortic (and not mitral) vegetation which was not seen on TEE here.
He was started on PPI iv bid.
This lesion was reclipped, and it was decided to hold his heparin and coumadin to achieve a period of 24 hours completely off anticoagulation to see if this lesion would clot.
Heparin was restarted on the evening of [**6-3**] and his hematocrit was stable >31 after a day.
He should be started on Warfarin starting tonight at 5mg but of note, he required high doses to be therapeutic in the past (9mg).
He will start back on Warfarin on the evening of [**6-4**] at 5mg and recheck PT/INR daily and trend up to therapeutic before discontinuing Heparin.
He should continue on protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] until instructed otherwise.
Given his persistent anemia, he was started on erythropoetin 8,000 units per week as well as iron.
4) CHF: Echo at the outside hospital revealed EF 45-50%, which is likely underestimated in the setting of mitral regurgitation.
He was diuresed aggressively initially, and ultimately restarted on PO lasix 80 mg daily, which maintained an even fluid balance.
He should continue lasix, however dose should be increased if he is consistently gaining weight.
He was also continued on lisinopril 5 mg daily for afterload reduction, spironolactone 50 mg daily, and metoprolol XL 75 mg daily.
He was already on ceftriaxone for his endocarditis, and cultures were without growth, making an infectious etiology unlikely.
He tolerated these without any difficulty, without any creatinine elevations.
He will continue on lasix 80 mg daily, spironolactone 50 mg daily.
He had an effusion that was tapped, revealing calcium pyrophosphate crystals consistent with pseudogout (no evidence of septic arthritis).
If this pain recurrs could use colchicine 0.6 mg daily (decreased dose for renal failure).
He was continued on coumadin for anticoagulation, with heparin drip while subtherapeutic (he always needs to be anticoagulated with heparin bridge while INR < 2.5 given structural AF in the setting of mitral regurgitation and high risk of embolus).
7) Mechanical mitral valve:  His INR subtherapeutic for the majority of the hospitalization and his coumadin was held at various times for procedures.
CD4 count 50 at outside hospital.
Bactrim DS was started for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis will be considered as an outpatient (once acid fast cultures from peritoneal fluid are known to be negative).
9) DM:  Continued insulin sliding scale and monitored finger sticks.
It is unclear if the patient is on a medical regimen as an outpatient for this.
Meformin is contraindicated given his creatinine, and thiazolidenediones are difficult in the setting of CHF (fluid retention).
For now, continue insulin sliding scale.
11) Access:  He had a PICC placed on [**5-1**], confirmed in good position by CXR and in working order.
Patient states he was taking coumadin, he also had bottles of truvada and zerit on admission to OSH.
You will be at rehab in order to received your IV antibiotics for another 4-6 weeks or so - the duration of the course will be determined by your infectious disease doctors.
