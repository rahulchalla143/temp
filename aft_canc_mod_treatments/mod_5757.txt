Jejunal metastasis times two - status post laparoscopic resection.
He was started on chemotherapy for this and recently complained of abdominal pain to his physician.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2122-7-21**] and on that same day underwent laparoscopic resection of two small bowel presumably metastatic tumors.
The patient's postoperative pain was initially controlled with Dilaudid PCA.
The patient again had complaints of severe pain with inadequate relief on postoperative day two, although his PCA had been increased in dosage, therefore an acute pain service consultation was obtained and their recommendations were taken into account and they recommended an epidural for pain relief given the patient having a history of metastatic cancer and in order to avoid a postoperative ileus.
His coag times were drawn and he was ordered for serial hematocrits and an nasogastric tube was to be placed.
This was discussed with the attending physician and it was determined that an nasogastric tube could be held on until the patient absolutely needed one if the patient refused.
Subsequently the patient did have the house staff member paged and requested an nasogastric tube to be placed.
During attempts of placement of this tube the patient again had another episode of about 400 cc of coffee ground emesis and continued to retch at each attempt.
It was determined after discussion with anesthesia that these attempts might be easier after placement of the epidural catheter.
The patient was taken for placement of an epidural catheter to the patient preoperative holding area.
He underwent placement of this catheter without notable complications.
After the catheter was placed and the anesthesiologist attempted to place the nasogastric tube with the use of Lidocaine jelly for intranasal anesthetic.
The patient had some difficulty with this and again began to have symptoms of Lidocaine toxicity with brief episodes of desaturation, which were later controlled with oxygen and bag mask breathing.
At this point an nasogastric tube was able to be placed and the patient was lavaged with 3 liters until a clear return was obtained.
He was transfused with 2 units of blood given his hematocrit had dropped to 27 at this time.
He had only been given a few doses of Toradol prior to this.
He remained NPO with an nasogastric tube suction.
Notably he did obtain excellent pain control with his epidural.
It was noted that the patient may have aspirated during the course of his episodes of Lidocaine toxicity in the preop holding area during placement of his nasogastric tube, therefore he was empirically started on Levofloxacin for possible aspiration pneumonia.
By postoperative day seven the patient was ready for transfer back to the floor as he had been afebrile and was having some improved pain control and was not having episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Notably throughout this time the patient had no relief of pain, although he had been tried on a morphine PCA, Dilaudid PCA, Demerol PCA, po Percocet, po Vicodin and intravenous Toradol.
His primary care physician [**Name9 (PRE) **] that he receive Vicodin, Percocet and a Fentanyl patch.
The patient's epidural was pulled on postoperative day eight after receiving 2 units of fresh frozen platelets, because the patient's INR remained at 1.6.
This patient's sputum cultures taken showed contamination with oropharyngeal flora.
Essentially the summary course for this patient is that the patient is the patient did well after laparoscopic resection of two small bowel metastases from his primary stage four lung cancer.
Postoperatively likely suffered a gastrointestinal bleed, which probably started sometime even before surgery possibly secondary from stress from surgery in addition to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
This gastrointestinal bleed was complicated by an episode of desaturation during attempted placement of an nasogastric tube after placement of an epidural catheter for poorly controlled pain, which likely had a chronic and acute component.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for management of his upper gastrointestinal bleed, which stabilized after the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient also had a question of aspiration pneumonia after placement of the nasogastric tube for which he was given antibiotics empirically, but for which no final sputum culture was definitive.
The patient was discharged on the following pain medications as per his primary care physician.
Vicodin 5/500 mg take one to two tablets po every four to six hours, dispensed 100.
Percocet 5/325 mg take one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours dispensed 100.
Fentanyl 25 mcg per patch t.d.
He was also given a Pectin cream.
Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
Bisacodyl 10 mg suppositories.
Protonix 40 mg po b.i.d.
Levaquin 500 mg po q.d.
Metoprolol 50 mg take one half tablet (25 mg t.i.d.).
