CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel obstruction secondary to diffuse abdominal metastases and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection on [**9-23**].
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-30**] for further management of the right upper lobe obstructing mass.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO HOSPITAL ADMISSION:  Prednisone 20 mg po q day started by the patient's primary care physician for shortness of breath.
Lung cancer:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital following small bowel resection for further management of the right upper lobe obstructing tumor.
The patient was initially admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service.
On [**10-1**] interventional pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy with placement of the right upper lobe stent.
A chest tube was also placed into the right chest wall for evacuation of the right pleural effusion.
On [**10-4**] the chest tube was removed following resolution of the pleural effusion.
Zosyn had also been started at the outside hospital for postoperative fever and the patient was continued on Zosyn intravenously.
He was eventually switched to Flagyl and Levofloxacin po and received a total of 18 days of antibiotics.
It was believed that the continued fevers on antibiotics was possibly due to either tumor fever or a drug reaction to the antibiotics.
Following stent placement and chest tube removal the patient continued to have intermittent shortness of breath and worsening cough and he was taken by interventional pulmonary for a repeat bronchoscopy on [**10-12**] for removal of mucous plug.
Following this repeat bronch the patient symptomatically felt better, but continued to require oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters.
On [**10-8**] he received his infusion of Photofrin followed by light treatment on [**10-12**] and finally a bronchoscopy to clean out necrotic tissue on [**10-13**].
The patient tolerated this procedure well without any complications.
Throughout the hospital course the patient was continued on aggressive chest CT, incentive spirometry, Albuterol nebulizers, Atrovent nebulizers and cough syrup.
A physical therapy consult was obtained and they determined that he would require outpatient chest physical therapy as well as home oxygen therapy.
He was continued on Zosyn intravenously initially in his hospital course and was eventually switched to po antibiotics when the patient was tolerating po well.
He was started on Flagyl and Levofloxacin to complete the total 18 day antibiotic course.
Anemia studies were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease, although the patient was already on iron supplements.
A repeat hematocrit confirmed this decrease and the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
He was discharged on his iron supplements.
Methemoglobinemia:  On [**10-11**] while receiving his light treatment the patient's O2 sats dropped to 54%.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation following the procedure.
His sister will be living with him and he will be receiving chest physical therapy as an outpatient.
