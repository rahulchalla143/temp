There is thrombosis of the right CSA stent seen on series 3, image 225, unchanged.
[**Name2 (NI) **]-containing ventral abdominal hernias are noted on series 401B, image 36 and image 41.
Complex septation and lobulation of this fusiform aneurysm is again noted with gross stability.
Additional incidental findings as detailed above with stability from prior exam.
The enteric tube is seen projecting in location likely consistent with the body of the stomach.
Note is made of coronary arterial calcification.
Multiple foci of [**Month/Day/Year **]-containing anterior abdominal hernias are seen.
GI BLEEDING STUDY [**2122-5-3**]: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.
Dynamic blood pool images show bleeding at 5 minutes in the left lower quadrant, with blood accumulating slowly for approximately 20 minutes before bleeding ceased.
Once stable, she was hemodynamically stable on the floor, however she continued to bleed requiring intermittent transfusion to keep her Hct above 25.
She continued to have melanotic, guiac positive stools, with subsequent hematochezia.
During this time she continued to require transfusions at a rate of about 1 unit per day.
The capsule subsequently lodged in the terminal ileum and remained there for several days, but eventually passed as evidenced on serial KUBs.
Given her persistent GI bleeding, decison was made to re-prep for colonoscopy on [**5-1**] which showed no colonic lesions, but consistent pooling of blood in the cecum from likely small bowel bleed.
IR was reconsulted who felt embolization would be risky given her expanding AAA and history of repair per IR.
She remained NPO throughout the majority of her course on PPN for nutrition.
She was seen by the vascular service who deferred repair given her comorbidities.
Per the IR team, this also preculdes her from embolization procedure for her GI bleed .
Her diuresis was held for majority of admission but restarted on [**4-29**] in the setting of LE edema (home dose of 40mg daily).
# CAD:  Held Imdur and lisinopril in setting of hypovolemia.
Lasix initially held, then restarted given LE edema.
# Follow up/transitional [**Hospital 30412**] transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further endoscopic workup -Note that imdur, lasix, and lisinopril were being held in-house and should be readdressed.
