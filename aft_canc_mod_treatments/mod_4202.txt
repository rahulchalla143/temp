There was moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation increased from prior studies, but biliary stent position was unchanged.
She was empirically started on Vancomycin/Zosyn given concern for ascending cholangitis in the setting of leukocytosis and elevated LFTs.

Interval resolution of geographic hyper-enhancement in segment II reflecting resolved cholangitis.
Interval increase in now moderate degree of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Biliary drain appears appropriately positioned.
Status post open cholecystectomy and liver biopsy.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old female with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting with cholangitis, likely due to displacement of previous biliary stent, complicated by sepsis and GNR bacteremia with marked improvement with replacement of biliary stent and antibiotic therapy.
She was treated initially with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin that was narrowed to just piperacillin-tazobactam once blood cultures returned with gram negative rod bacteremia.
She had replacement of her stent on [**7-6**] with rapid improvement in her bilirubin and resolution of most of her pain.
Surveillance cultures remain negative and on the day of discharge she was transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin with plans to complete a total of 14 days of antibiotics with day 1 being [**7-7**] (the day after stent replacement).
Of note, the patient did have a significant leukocytosis that remained after her procedure but given her overall improvement and the disappearance of bands this was thought likely due to leukemoid reaction.
2) Sepsis:  She presented with septic shock due to cholangitis and gram negative bacteremia but pressures normalized with fluids and antibiotics.
5) DMII, uncontrolled, with complication: She kept on insulin sliding scale in the hospital.
She will restart her [**Hospital1 **] NPH insulin at discharge.
9) Code Status: Code Status was DNR/DNI  Transitional Issues: -The patient will follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-3**] days to recheck WBC count and see how she is doing -The patient has follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in surgery -The patient will follow up with oncology on the [**Hospital3 **] -The patient will cancel previous appointment with ERCP given this was for follow up from temporary stent with possible replacement as stent was replaced during this procedure   Medications on Admission: Levothyroxine 125 mcg Tablet PO QD Lithium carbonate 300 mg PO QHS Diovan HCT 80mg-12.5mg qd Humulin 24 u qAM, 32 qPM Dorzol/timolol 2-0.05%OP PID Lumigan Calcium carbonate-Vitamin D3 600 Ca-400U D   Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

This was likely due to the stent previously placed to keep these ducts open becoming displaced.
You had a new stent put into place and received antibiotics with improvement in your symptoms.
Your medications have been changed.
You have been started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for an additional 12 days after discharge.
Please continue your other medications as previously prescribed.
