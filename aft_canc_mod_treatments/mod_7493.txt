In the ED they found that you had lost a lot of blood and required a blood transfusion and you were monitored in the intensive care unit.
We would recommend that you limit any your alcohol intake and continue the medications below.
After you were transferred to the regular medical floor you had a fever and we were concerned that you could have an infection in the fluid in your abdomen, so we performed a paracentesis (take the fluid amount out).
The source of your fever is likely your sinuses, and we will send you out on an antibiotic pill to cover you for both the sinus infection as well as preventing infections after having the GI bleed.
