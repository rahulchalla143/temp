Per report, pt uses bipap at night and was noted to have decreased breath sounds on the L.side.
Pt was most recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] and discharged on levoquin for CAP.
At rehab, abx were broadened to vanco and cefepime and course was completed yesterday per pt's daughter.
access-PIV and PICC Given respiratory distress, hypoxia to 74% on RA, 91% on 6L, pt was trialed on bipap (with no response) and was intubated.
Per [**Name (NI) **], pt on "several liters of o2" at baseline, on bipap at night and intermittently during the day.
Given CT findings, of LLL collapse with occlusion of L.main stem bronchus, and possible LUL PNA, IP was made aware of pt.
Pt also reported vague upper abdominal pain and was given vanco and zosyn.
She was treated at OSH with levaquin, and trasferred to rehab, where she was ultimately started on vancomycin/cefepime by report, but continued to worsen with regard to her respiratory status, prompting referral to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to be acutely hypoxic (74%RA), and intubated in the ED for "airway proteection"  CT CHEST revealed LLL atalectasis with occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus.
Her lasix dose was decreased from 120 qam; 80 qpm to 120mg qam given rising creatinine.
She was otherwise continued on a steroid taper (30mg qdaily -> 20 mg po qdaily starting [**2-24**], at baseline is maintained on 10mg po qdaily per daughter).
She is being called out to the medical service after having been transitioned to heparin gtt (on coumadin for afib, h/o PE), in anticipation of pulmonary stent later this week.
Past Medical History: trachobronchomalacia-was scheduled for stent in 1 week.
Family History: Her family history is notable for a daughter with asthma and father who died of emphysema related working in the coal mines  Physical Exam: HR 105, BP 135/71, RR 19 sat 95% on FI02 50%, PSV 8 PEEP 5, PHYSICAL EXAM GENERAL: NAD, intubated, sedated, head nods to questions.
Refer to respiratory viral culture for further information.
Bronchoscopy may be helpful for further evaluation and should be considered.
Recommend further evaluation with a renal ultrasound on a non-urgent basis.
No aortic Final Report CHEST RADIOGRAPH  [**2192-3-3**] CXR: INDICATION: COPD, abdominal pain, evaluation for air under the diaphragm.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT helical acquisition was performed from the diaphragm to the pubic symphysis following the uneventful administration of oral contrast.
Slight compression deformities are seen at T8 and T11 vertebral bodies.
The left PICC line tip can be seen to the level of the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.

Course: 66 year old woman with past medical history significant for COPD on home 02, OSA, TBM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, h.o PE, PNA who presents with hypoxia.
Additionally, she completed a course of antibiotics for health care associated pneumonia (HCAP) with vancomycin/cefepime at [**Hospital1 **].
Upon arrival to the ICU, she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn for resistant HCAP.
Bronchial washing cultures showed now growth, however were felt limited by ongoing antibiotic therapy.
Respiratory viral antigen was significant for positive parainfluenza, however this was not felt to require therapy per pulmonary team.
As below, she was taken for tracheal stent placement on [**2192-2-29**].
she was diuresed aggressively as below, until her creatinine rose, and she was felt dry.
her nebulizer regimen was increasd to q3hrs and with mucomyst therapy (to maintain stent patency).
she was given aggressive chest physiotherapy.
she was started on morphine liquid per palliative care service for symptoms of subjective dyspnea, which worked well but was initially associated with itching.
she was therefore switched to oral dilaudid on [**3-9**], however this did not improve her symptoms, she she resumed oral morphine with good effect.
morphine was also beneficial for intermittent symptoms of abdominal pain as noted below.
per the palliative care service, given her prognosis, morphine should be titrated up as needed to treat subjective symptoms of dyspnea.
at the time time of discharge, vital signs were 97.5  [**Numeric Identifier 52791**]  110  20  90%1L (with typical range of 1-3L, she was on 4L home O2 prior to admission) with finger stick 116.  she was otherwise continued on her regimen of theophyline, with increase in nebulizer therapy to Q3HRS per pulmonary recommendation.
she will continue aggressive nebulizer therapy, chest physiotherapy, and diuresis as below.
should her symptoms worsen, she expressed the desire to consider repeat hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia, including intubation for respiratory failure.
# tracheobronchomalacia - Patient has severe disease and was scheduled for IP stent the week after admission.
As above she underwent succesful tracheal stent placement on [**2192-2-29**].
Mildly blood sputum was noted after the procedure which was felt to local trauma, and therapeutic heparin / coumadin.
she was discharged to rehab, with instructions to continue albuterol/xopenex nebulizer therapy Q3HRS, especially with mucuomyst and mucinex therapy to promote stent patency.
she should also continue aggressive chest physiotherapy.
as above, she was evaluated by the thoracic surgery service but not felt to be a candidate for distal airway intervention at this time, but may follow-up with the thoracics surgery clinic as needed as an outpatient.
Patient was continued on home inhalers and theophylline.
She had been on steroid taper at [**Hospital1 **], and was at 30 mg prednisone daily on admission.
she was otherwise continued on her home regimen of theophyline, fexofenadine, monteleukast, albuterol, xopenex, spiriva, and atrovent inhalers.
# history of pulmonary embolism: Patient is on coumadin at home in the setting of remote PE in [**2190**], with subsequent L UE DVT (though felt to be catheter related, pt and family elected to continue lifelong anticoagulation).
Pt was transitioned from coumadin to heparin for stent placement, then resumed coumadin, with INR= 4.2 on discharge, thus her daily regimen (decreased to 2mg qdaily), was held, and should be resumed at rehab once her INR is less than 3.0. .
# diastolic congestive heart failure - pt's dose of lasix held as below.
she was continued on rate control with diltiazem.
# chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinine ~2, up to 2.6 in ICU, thus lasix was held, with improvement to 1.9 on [**3-3**], at which time she was restarted on lasix 80mg po qdaily, then titrated up to home reigmen 120mg po qam; 80mg po qpm.
given ongoing dyspnea, and volume overload on clinical exam, diuresis was increased to 120mg po qam with prn iv lasix 80mg iv given once daily starting [**3-6**], with resultant negative fluid balance of -500cc to 1L on [**2-25**], and [**3-8**].
She should have strict daily weights, and should resume her usual regimen of lasix within 2-3 days, if her creatinine remains stable.
HR remained 100-120, thus she was continued on her usual regimen as above.
she was continued on her home regimen of iron repletion.
# leukocytosis - WBC noted to be rising [**2-27**], unclear if [**2-28**] pneumonia or steroids, peak of 16 on [**2192-3-3**] but pulmonary status continued to improve as above, with tapering of steroid dose as above.
her leukocytosis resolved without further intervention, and was down to 8 on day of discharge.
Given leukocytosis, repeat UA sent which showed yeast again, and elevated WBCs (691 on [**3-9**]), as well as persistant RBCs.
Given significant leukocytosis, and persistant funguria (>100K grown on [**3-11**] Urine Cx), with ongoing urinary retention, pt was started on 2 week course of fluconazole on [**3-13**].
# abdominal pain / urinary retention - pt with intermittent episodes of abdominal discomfort with typically resolved completely with bowel movements.
however, she was then noted to have 1L in bladder [**3-6**] in the setting of a voiding trial after foley catheter had been removed.
foley catheter replaced, with improvement in abodminal pain.
second attempt was made to discontinue foley and attempt voiding trial on [**3-9**], which was again unsucessful, as pt had 350cc on post-void residual.
pt will be discharged with foley catheter in place x 7 days, then should attempt third voiding trial.
she should have intermittent straight cath performed Q6HRs, and if >200cc in bladder, she should continue with ISC and have follow-up appointment with urology.
An appointment was made for her given the presence of hematuria (which may have been secondary to coagulopathy, and foley placement), and smoking history, however this may be cancelled should these symptoms resolve.
# coagulopathy - INR elevated to 4.2 on discharge, coumadin dose of 2mg po qdaily was therefore discontinued.
given that she is being started on fluconazole, her INR should be followed daily, and coumadin restarted on therapeutic (2.0-3.0).
Her settings for BiPaP were: Nasal CPAP w/PSV (BIPAP) Inspiratory pressure: 8 cm/h2o Expiratory pressure: 5 cm/h2o to maintain SpO2 to >88 and <92 .
# DM2 - pt covered with sliding scale insulin throughout her course, on [**3-11**], pt noted to have lower finger sticks (60-90), down to 50s overnight, pt asymptomatic, but eating poorly.
finger sticks improved with oral glucose, and she was started on D5NS, which was subsequently discontinued.
her lantus dose was decreased from 44U QHS to 25U QHS, given her poor oral intake and now reduced oral steroid dose.
she will need close follow-up of her finger sticks daily, with adjustment of her insulin regimen as needed.
# HTN, benign - continued home regimen diltiazem, amlodipine.
# hypothyroid - continued on home regimen of synthroid.
# depression - continued on citalopram.
her insulin regimen was adjusted as above given her poor oral intake, felt largely [**2-28**] lack of appetitite.
# ACESS - L UE midline was placed [**2-27**].
this should be discontinued within 3 days of arrival at rehab unless she continues to have an indication for midline access.
