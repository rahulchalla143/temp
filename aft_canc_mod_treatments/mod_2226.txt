Since discharge, the patient had been reasonably well, however, over the week prior to admission he developed onset of pleuritic right sided anterior chest pain associated with exertional dyspnea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion status post drainage with pigtail catheter in [**2118-6-3**] with negative rheumatologic malignant and infectious work-up.
Bilateral pleural effusion status post pigtail drainage of the right with negative work-up as well for rheumatologic infectious disease and malignancy, bilateral pulmonary emboli diagnosed in [**2118-6-3**], treated with Heparin initially and currently anticoagulated on Coumadin, history of heterozygosity for factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12843**] mutation.
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 8 mg q day, Tylenol 650 mg prn.
On [**2118-8-9**] the patient was taken to the operating room by cardiothoracic surgery for pericardial window.
At the time of surgery, transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and showed abnormality in the right atrium consistent with perforation with overlying clots and fluid loculated on pericardial effusion.
At this time plans were suspended for pericardial window with plans for medial sternotomy in [**1-4**] days for repair of right atrial abnormality.
He was taken to the operating room again on [**2118-8-11**] where the patient underwent median sternotomy with exploration of his cardiac anatomy.
At the time of surgery multiple tumor nodules were noted within the pericardium and eroding into the right atrium.
The right atrium was closed and pericardial partial stripping was performed.
The patient was transferred in stable condition from the OR to the cardiac surgery Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated for 24 hours.
His postoperative course was complicated by significant blood loss requiring a number of blood transfusions to maintain a hematocrit between 25 and 30.
His chest tubes and mediastinal tubes were removed without complication on postoperative day #3.
On postoperative day #4 anticoagulation for history of bilateral pulmonary emboli was reinitiated with IV unfractionated Heparin without a bolus.
Cardiothoracic surgery inserted 32 French chest tube at the bedside without complication.
Drainage of 2 liters of bloody fluid was yielded.
Patient's anticoagulation was stopped and reversed with Protamine at that time.
The patient obtained hemodynamic stability and his chest tubes were discontinued without complications on postoperative day #7.
Follow-up CAT scan revealed abnormality consistent with tumor and postoperative changes along the right cardiac border with bilateral atelectasis.
The patient was placed briefly on Vancomycin and Ceftaz but after pan CT revealed no evidence of fluid collection or infectious etiology, these antibiotics were discontinued.
Heme:  The patient's anticoagulation was initially restarted but after re-complication with hemopneumothorax, was discontinued and not restarted.
The risks and benefits of anticoagulation were weighed.
The patient required several blood transfusions, platelet transfusions, FFP and cryoprecipitates during his surgery and occasionally after to maintain hematocrit between 25-30.
He was transitioned to OxyContin with Percocet for breakthrough and was discharged on 30 mg q a.m., 20 mg of OxyContin q p.m. and Percocet for breakthrough.
He required intermittent electrolytes repletion during his hospitalization.
Plans were made for chemotherapy as an outpatient vs transfer back to the United Kingdom for treatment there.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2118-9-2**] for arrangement of his chemotherapy at a time when he is fully healed from his cardiothoracic surgery.
Social Work:  The patient was seen extensively by social work and case management during this hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  OxyContin 30 mg q a.m., 20 mg q p.m., Percocet 5/325 1-2 tablets po q 4-6 hours prn for breakthrough pain, Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], Zantac 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Bacitracin topically to affected areas tid.
