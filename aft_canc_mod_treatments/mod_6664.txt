Total laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy.
Tracheoesophageal puncture.
This was a T3 N2B M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil which was treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation.
Given her prior radiation therapy and the unwillingness of the radiation oncologist to give her primary definitive radiation as the treatment, the only option was for a total laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy.
Past Medical History: GERD osteoporosis tonsil cancer T3N2 treated [**2121**] - tonsilectomy and neck dissection.
Stoma with red-rubber catheter at TEP site.

She tolerated the procedures well and without complication.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
When tube feeds were started through the red-rubber catheter she was started on crushed dilauded tabs with good effect.
Pulmonary: The patient emerged from the operating room with a new laryngectomy stoma.
She was managed with q1-2 hour suctioning of her secretions and was noted to have several brief desaturations to the mid-80s while in the ICU - extending her stay there for close stoma care and frequent suctioning.
Humidified O2 was placed over her stoma site at all times and mucus crusting removed as needed.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids and then started on tube feeds through the red-rubber catheter through her TEP site on POD 4.
The tube was repositioned on POD5 and CXR confirmed its position.
She continued on continuous tube feeds without problem per nutrition recommendations.
Her IV fluids were discontinued on POD 6, her input and output were continuously monitored.
She did not experience any leak and was discharged on mechanical soft diet with TF supplementation 3x/day.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV clindamycin following the procedure.
On POD 8 a swab of her stoma site was taken which grew 2+ MSSA resistant to clindamycin.
She was switched to ancef at that time.
Throughout her stay she was afebrile, her temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
This in combination with the necessary care of her feeding tube, and administration of the feeds, warranted a stay at a rehab facility.
