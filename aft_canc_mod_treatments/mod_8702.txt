IVIg was held and the decsion was made to admit the patient for further evaluation.
Including EBUS with transbronchial needle aspiration, right cervical lymph node biopsy, BMBx, renal Bx, and VATS with lung biopsy, limited thoracotomy and mediastinal lymph node biopsy.
Of note, she was initially admitted to the MICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and fever in the PACU status post rigid bronchoscopy for mediastinal LN biopsy She had previously been evaluated at [**Hospital1 2177**] for these complaints prior to transferring her care to [**Hospital1 18**].
Ultimately, patient was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged EBV viremia, possibly resulting in her abnormal LFTs, nephrotic syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.

[**2160-12-2**] CT CHEST IMPRESSION:  As compared to the previous examination from [**2160-11-10**], there is evidence of diffuse fibrotic lung parenchymal pattern with bronchiectasis and spectral distortion as main morphological components.
[**2160-11-27**] CHEST X-RAY: FINDINGS:  Patient's clinical condition required examination in sitting position using AP frontal and left lateral views.
There is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates as can be identified on this portable chest examination.
Newly apparent thickening at the base of the cecum, not present on the prior study; this may be associated with debris but could be secondary to an inflammatory process such as CMV colitis or even potentially a further site of potential lymphoma.
Right Port-A-Cath, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
Although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not seen on the current study but does course below the diaphragm.
No large pneumothorax is seen although the positioning of the patient is not indicated and the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax would be diminished if acquired using supine technique.
Right supraclavicular catheter tip is in the right atrium as before.
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
[**2160-10-23**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
[**2160-10-22**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The endotracheal tube is 1 cm above the carina.
Retracting the tube by approximately 2 cm is recommended.
Unchanged course of the right internal jugular vein catheter and the nasogastric tube.
Right central catheter tip projects in the right atrium.
Thus a paracentesis was not performed.
Though atypical none of the large cells resemble [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells or variants.
The background liver exhibits mixed micro and macrovesicular steatosis, ballooning degeneration, apoptotic hepatocytes, and centrilobular congestion.
Neither the morphology nor the phenotype justifies a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.
As in previous biopsies the findings in the current biopsy are felt to represent an EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorder in the setting of persistent EBV viremia and in the background of an IgA deficiency/CVID phenotype.
Assessment is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast however the appearances raise the possibilty of an infiltrative process or infection.
New pigtail catheter with tip at the right lung base.
chain suture is seen suggesting prior biopsy.
[**2160-10-9**] Radiology DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMI:  study is non-diagnostic for DVT given habitus of legs  [**12-4**] CK 16 MB 3 Trop < 0.01 Protein/Creatinine ratio:  14-> 3.5 -> 5.1 ([**11-17**]) -> 4.7 ([**12-4**])   [**2160-12-2**] CT CHEST - synopsis:  diffuse lung fibrosis, bronchiectasis, evidence of fluid overload, unchanged R pleural effusion, minimal new left pleural effusion  IMPRESSION:  As compared to the previous examination from [**2160-11-10**], there is evidence of diffuse fibrotic lung parenchymal pattern with bronchiectasis and spectral distortion as main morphological components.
Pulmonary drained 1.2L of bloody fluid from the chest and placed a chest tube x2 days.
Her acute decompensation was thought to be due to reaccumulation of known R pleural effusion since repeat CT showed no change in effusion size compared to the [**10-9**] study which was done prior to drainage of 1L pleural fluid via thoracentesis.
After discussion with IP, repeat thoracentesis was held because patient's respiratory status had improved and she was at risk of bleeding from her coagulopathy.
She was started on vancomycin and meropenem for HCAP coverage and completed a 8 day course.
Diuresis was a challenge given the patient's renal function.
She was restarted on vanc and [**Last Name (un) 2830**], but abx were discontinued after 48 hours of blood cultures with no growth.
Also started on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
CVVH was stopped the [**11-4**] (patient's weight has decreased from 109 Kg to 77kg) with plan to obtain tunneled line and start HD.
She received HD on [**11-2**].
Vancomycin and cefepime were started for presumed PNA, although CXR and CT chest showed no evidence of new PNA.
She was started on treatment doses of Tamiflu (75 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
She was switched to PO levoquin, and was sent home to finish a course of levoquin and tamiflu.
She has obstructive lung disease, interstitial fibrosis from bleomycin toxicity, bronchiectasis, and recurrent large right-sided pleural effusion.
Per ID recs, was treated with Micafungin from [**Date range (1) 102513**].
A CMV titer was found to be positive to 17,600 on [**2160-10-18**] and the patient was started on ganciclovir.
There was also question of possible severe depression given her prolonged hospital course and deterioration.
On the bone marrow transplant service, as her respiratory status improved, and as she completed treatment for EBV, CMV, presumptive fungemia, her mental status improved as well.
Started sertraline [**11-13**], stopped [**11-28**] as her mental status improved.
Renal advised lasix 60 mg IV BID and Metolazone 10 mg PO BID.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was started on a lasix drip and eventually metolazone was added.
In consultation with renal, heme onc and ID, she was started in IV methylprednisolone (d1 = [**10-23**]) for nephrotic syndrome and liver inflammation.
Patient's proteinuria improved on Rituximab and prednisone.
Her steroids were changed to prednisone 80 mg daily (day 1 of steroids [**10-23**]), then tapered to 40 mg PO daily by discharge.
# EBV, CMV viremia:  Completed a course of Ganciclovir and received several doses of Rituximab.
Her elevated ferritin (7091, previously >10,000 in [**8-7**]), transaminitis with possible hepatic infiltrate on abdominal MRI, cytopenia in two cell lines and altered mental status are also concerning for this diagnosis.
Bone marrow bx from [**8-9**] showed increased macrophages with ingestion of cells and debris, as well as an increased cytotoxic T cell infiltrate with concurrent markedly elevated ferritin level.
She was placed on aspiration precautions and started on a PPI.
# Coagulopathy: Patient had a pan-elevation in her coagualation studies.
# C. diff: Patient was treated with po vancomycin (day 1 was [**Date range (3) 102514**]) with resolution of her diarrhea.
CT abdomen on [**10-30**] with possible recurrence, surgery was been consulted for biopsy, but would have to be a laparotomy which they do not recommend at this time.
G6PD study was normal.
Because of the elevated MCV count and RDW, there was suspicion for nutritional deficiency, so we started her on a multivitamin.
# Hypertension / tachycardia:  She was started on diltiazem for tachycardia and hypertension with likely diastolic congestive heart failure.
