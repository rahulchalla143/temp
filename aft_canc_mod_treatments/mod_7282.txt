She had been followed for decreasing cognitive decline.
Pertinent Results:    RADIOLOGY  Final Report  [**Numeric Identifier 82379**] EXT CAROTID BILAT  [**2136-8-14**] 7:55 AM  Reason: angio w/embolization for bifrontal planum sphenoidale mening Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman with bifrontal planum sphenoidale meningioma.
Additionally possible use of embolization coils if needed was discussed.
The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed on the biplane table in the supine position.
Prior to the start of the procedure, a timeout was performed to verify the patient's identity using two patient identifiers and the procedure to be performed.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single-wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate with aseptic precautions.
Over the wire, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed and connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units and 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip.
Through the sheath, a 4 French Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to the continuous saline infusion (with heparin mixture: 1000 units of heparin and 1000 cc saline).
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from these locations.
After review of the study, the catheter and the sheath were withdrawn and pressure was applied on the groin until hemostasis was achieved.
The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post-procedure related complications.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], attending interventional neuroradiologist, was present and performed the procedure.
