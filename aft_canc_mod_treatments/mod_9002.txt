Admission Date:  [**2187-10-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-1-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: seizures (shaking, loss of consciousness)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: #) Intubation for status epilepticus [**2187-10-2**] #) Thoracentesis [**2187-10-15**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 52213**] is a 54 yo W with h/o metastatic brain cancer with brain mets s/p resection and whole brain radiation, as well as leptomeningeal spread, and history of status epilepticus who presents with multiple seizures.
During that admission, the seizures resolved with Dilantin and she was later transitioned to Keppra.
She also had an LP positive for malignant cells, and received intrathecal cytarabine, complicated by chemical meningitis with mental status changes.
She thereafter continued systemic cisplatin, and received intrathecal thiotepa on [**8-20**] and [**9-21**].
She was intubated after the 5th seizure for airway protection and started on propofol.
She received steroids at OSH, and Ativan (4 mg total), fosphenytoin 1500 mg at [**Hospital1 18**].
Past Medical History: Triple Negative Breast Cancer - s/p Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide therapy from [**Month (only) 205**] to [**2186-9-10**]; s/p taxol therapy from [**Month (only) **] to [**2186-11-10**].
Recently on capecitabine therapy but stopped due to it not working.
Brain mets discovered on MRI in [**2187-3-13**] - underwent whole brain cranial irradiation in [**2187-3-13**].
An orogastric tube distal port is seen within the stomach.
Right-sided PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
An Ommaya catheter is seen terminating within the left lateral ventricle near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Contour abnormalities at the level of the aortic arch and the aortopulmonary window suggest the presence of extensive lymphadenopathy.

Pt received a thoracentesis and the fluid was bloody.
On [**2187-10-19**] she triggered with SBP 170s, and repeat CXR showed interval increase in pleural effusions, with evidence of volume overload.
She responded well to IV lasix.
She continued to breathe spontaneously with good oxygenation and minimal evidence of respiratory distress, although she appeared to make grimaces that responded well to pain relief (see below).
It appeared that no further interventions could be made.
She was intubated for airway protection and fosphenytoin was added to her regimen of Levetiracetam.
She was successfully extubated on [**2187-10-6**] and was continued on IV Keppra and IV fosphenytoin.
She was started on dexamethasone.
Per her neurooncologist, she could not be offered further interventions for these metastases.
#) Metastatic Breast Cancer / Goals of care - She had an Ommaya reservoir placed in [**8-/2187**] for salvage chemotherapy as her breast cancer had been refractory to prior treatments.
Nonetheless, a repeat MRI Head with and without contrast revealed interval progression of disease despite her intrathecal chemotherapy.
She was treated with dexamethasone 6mg Q4 for her resultant cerebral edema.
Her glucose levels were also followed and she was placed on insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia due to corticosteroid use.
She received periodic one-time doses of IV lasix, which would temporarily improve her urine output.
#) Nutrition: Given her mental status and concern for aspiration, a Dobhoff tube was placed but she was able to demonstrate adequate and safe PO intake and it was pulled on [**2187-9-11**].
She was hydrated with D51/2 NS continuous.
Her family desired PEG tube placement for nutrition, but on further consideration decided to proceed with Dobhoff tube placement instead.
On [**2187-10-19**] after the trigger event, she was deemed unstable to proceed with Dobhoff placement, and received TPN thereafter for parenteral nutrition.
A few days during hospital course she received one-time doses of IV morphine when she appeared to be grimacing in pain, which was received with good effect.
Pt received IV metoprolol throughout hospital course, requiring one-time doses of hydralazine occasionally for SBP>170.
She received pain control as above.
Neurology service thought this could have been due to heparin prophylaxis, but HIT antibody panel was negative.
She was on fondaparinaux SC for prophylaxis until transfer to Medicine, where this was discontinued and she was placed on pneumoboots instead (given low platelet count).
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3877**] thought this was due to marrow failure, as her counts should have responded by this time after cisplatin therapy.
We therefore discontinued her antibiotics on [**2187-10-17**].
Both the dermatologist and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3877**] felt there were no further interventions that could be made.
She was continued on famotidine daily.
