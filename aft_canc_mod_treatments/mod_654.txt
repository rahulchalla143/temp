Hemodynamically stable but has evidence of right heart strain on ECG; troponin negative.
Started on heparin drip.
Patient maintained O2 sats >90% on supplemental oxygen.
Plan to bridge to warfarin, preferred over enoxaparin given possibly worsening renal function s/p surgery and IV contrast.
Maintained on pain meds per urology service.
# Anemia: Low-normal MCV with significant hct drop 36 -> 31 in setting of recently starting heparin gtt and surgery on highly vascular organ.
Did receive IV contrast for chest imaging (CTA), at risk for CIN.
# Hypertension: BP stable.
AV nodal blocking agents were avoided to avoid masking tachycardic response to worsening hypoxia or bleed.
# COPD: Not on home oxygen or inhaled therapy.
On POD1 her chest tube was removed without difficulty and she was monitored for pain control and her diet was restricted.
Her post-operative course was complicated by hypoxia due to bilateral pulmonary embolisms for which she was initially started on a heparin drip and then transitioned to coumadin.
Her course was managed by the intensive care unit and medicine service as described in OMR and consult notes.
Ultimately she was discharged in stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics.
