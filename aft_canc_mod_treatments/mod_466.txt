The patient was admitted for IV fungal therapy.
As instructed, he stopped the medication on [**7-31**] but has remained bed ridden for the past 5 days.
He has not been able to take anything of solid nature including routine medications.
ROS is negative for jaundice, pruritis, scleral icterus, abdominal pain, constitutional symptoms, fatigue, nausea or vomiting.
Cytology revealed "atypical" cells and a pigtail biliary stent was successfully placed over the stricture.
The tumor cells were positive for keratin cocktail, CK7, MOC31, and CEA (focally,) and PAX-2, and negative for HepPar1, CK20, S-100, vimentin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and RCC.
Because the patient was uninterested in repeat TACE, systemic therapy was initiated using Nexavar on [**2189-5-5**] in the setting of protocol 09-326 but was taken off of it on [**2189-7-22**] due to disease progression.
Groin: Severely excoriated scrotum and serous drainage on the patient's underwear.
Discharge is maloderous  Pertinent Results: [**2189-8-5**] 03:50PM BLOOD WBC-1.6* RBC-5.06# Hgb-16.4# Hct-47.2# MCV-93 MCH-32.4* MCHC-34.7 RDW-13.4 Plt Ct-29* [**2189-8-5**] 03:50PM BLOOD PT-22.5* PTT-33.4 INR(PT)-2.1* [**2189-8-5**] 03:50PM BLOOD ALT-29 AST-38 AlkPhos-121 TotBili-4.2* [**2189-8-5**] 03:50PM BLOOD AFP-4776* [**2189-8-13**] 05:02AM BLOOD WBC-0.6* RBC-3.00* Hgb-9.9* Hct-29.6* MCV-99* MCH-33.0* MCHC-33.5 RDW-14.5 Plt Ct-10*  [**8-8**] CXR: NG tube tip is most likely in the fourth portion of the duodenum.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3321**] is a 61-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma status post transarterial chemoembolization [**2188-9-12**] and repeat on [**2188-11-11**] for residual disease.
Patient was given Gelclair along with magic mouthwash, as well as general oral care.
Morphine was given for pain.
The patient had not eaten for several days on admission, so nutrition was consulted and TPN was begun on [**8-7**] for proper nutrition.
On transfer to the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] NGtube was placed to allow for PO medications.
Acyclovir as well as IV antifungal treatment were instituted empirically out of concern for viral and fungal etiologies.
The axillary culture grew out sparse MSSA, most likely a skin colonizer, but given the patient's neutropenic status, and the plan to continue neutropenic antibiotic coverage, this was of little clinical significance.
IV antifungal and antiHSV treatment was instituted during admission as described above.
This was  believed to be secondary to the patient's xeloda therapy, and of uncertain future duration.
He was put on neutropenic precautions and started on on vancomycin, ceftazidime, fluconazole and acyclovir for infection prevention on [**8-5**].
Fluconazole was later discontinued for micafungin, and ceftazidime discontinued for cefepime.
ID was consulted on [**8-7**], and recommended discontinuing micafungin for fluconazole.
Neupogen was started as well and maintained at 480 mg qdaily.
Vancomycin was stopped on [**8-12**].
He was continued on cefepime, fluconazole, acyclovir, flagyl, with the plan to discontinue acyclovir after a 10 day course, discontinue flagyl after a 10 day course, and defer to the oncology service as to when to discontinue cefepime and fluconazole.
His platelet levels trended down over the hospitalization, and on [**8-13**] he received a unit of platelets for a count of 10 (goal >10).
Given patient's mental status he had been unable to take his lactulose, so an NG tube was placed immediately and his lactulose was aggressively titrated up.
A RUQ ultrasound was attempted to evaluate for portal vein thrombus, but given the patient's large body habitus, the liver and its vasculature could not be visualized.
The patient's mental status resolved to near-baseline and he was transferred to the floors.
#Sepsis and Hepatic Failure: Several days following his transfer to the floors, the patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in the setting of hypotension to 79/45 (from baseline of SBP in the 90s), and several episodes of desaturation to the mid-80s while on the oncology floor.
His abx coverage was broadened to include vanco and zosyn in addition to cefepime and metronidazole.
The family opted to make him comfort measures only.
