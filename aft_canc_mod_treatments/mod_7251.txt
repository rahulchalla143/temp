She was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl over concern of cholangitis.
Her INR was over 8, and she was given 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. Blood and urine cultures were drawn prior to administration of antibiotics.
Her vitals at that time were: temperature of 101.4 rectal, stable blood pressure (never hypotensive, lowest 120/40) 160/70, RR 24, Sat 98% on NRB.
Her laboratories were notable for a transaminitis AST >ALT, lactate 2.4, INR 7.7.
Of note, patient had recent admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for polymicrobial sepsis in setting of biliary stent obstruction due to tumor.
Past Medical History: Biliary obstruction/malignant stricture s/p ERCP X 2 and 2 metal stents--last placed in [**9-12**].

Pt was initially empirically treated linezolid, ceftriaxone and flagyl given prior h/o VRE and resistent bacteria, and transitioned to only high dose ceftriaxone once blood cultures grew Klebsiella.
She was also treated with IVF boluses via PICC and did not require a CVL or pressors.
The biliary surgery and ERCP team followed along during her stay.
She recieved several doses of Vitamin K and FFP to reverse her INR for ERCP and was NOT restarted on anticoagulation post procedure, out of concern for needing future procedures.
Benefits and downsides of anticoagulation can be discussed with pt's PCP given ongoing goals of care.
[**Name (NI) 20472**] Pt's home home glyburide was held and pt was monitored and treated with a sliding scale of insulin.
This was not restarted after her procedures due to generally good blood sugar control; however, this can be restarted when necessary at rehab depending on her blood sugars.
Coronary artery disease: Patient's last echo was in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2169**], which demonstrated an EF of >55%, normal systolic function, mild MR. She was continued on her home statin, while her home anti-hypertensives were initially held in the setting of concern of hypotension while septic.
Her metoprolol was started after her BP recovered.
Atrial fibrillation: Pt supratherpeutic on coumadin on arrival.
Metoprolol was restarted and titrated up to 50mg tid given episodes of afib with RVR in the ICU.
Digoxin was not restarted.
HTN: held home BP regimen on admission.
Metoprolol was added back as above and lisinopril and HCTZ were added and titrated up after she became hypertensive on the floor.
Parkinsons: continued Sinimet and Pramipexole  #.
The speech and swallow team discussed the possibility of a feeding tube with the patient and family in order to be able to provide adequate nutrition, but she and her husband were adamantly against this, as quality of life and being able to have the comfort of eating food were deemed to be more important; thus, speech and swallow recommended nectar thick liquids and pureed solids per her husband's request.
