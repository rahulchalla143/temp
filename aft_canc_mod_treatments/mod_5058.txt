When he received this blood transfusion he began to have respiratory compromise and he was started on BiPAP in the ICU and he was dialysed and 3L offluid was removed.
This resolved his respiratory symptoms and he subsequently was able to oxygenate without supplemental oxygen.
He did have evidence of a possible continued pneumonia on a CXR and he was continued on IV antibiotics while in the hospital.
Because of previous findings on blood work indicating a possible myelodysplastic disorder of some type we discussed the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy.
However, on mulitple occasions MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 68078**] refused to have this procedure done.
He was dischrged home on a 10 days course of oral antibiotics.
