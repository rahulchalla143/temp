Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where she underwent a right thoracoscopy and right thoracotomy with wedge resection of the right upper lobe.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
She had an epidural catheter placed for pain control which was minimally effective.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she was able to use her incentive spirometer and her pain was controlled with a Bupivacaine epidural and a Dilaudid PCA.
Unfortunately her epidural fell out and her pain medication was changed to Oxycodone.
She was placed on a 100% non rebreather and her saturations came up to 90%.
Following transfer to the SICU she underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy.
She remained in the ICU for a few additional days for vigorous pulmonary toilet including nebulizers, mucolytics, chest PT and incentive spirometry.
She was also placed on a 7 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Her chest tube was removed after the serosanguinous drainage tapered off and her thoracotomy incision was healing.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to require oxygen and would desaturate off of it with exertion.
Although she is small and slight in stature she is able to tolerate a fair amount of narcotics and still has some discomfort but she also took Percocet prior to admission for multiple arthritic aches and pains.
She takes prn Lorazapam at home and has continued on that but this morning Valium 5 mg was given additionally and was effective.
Replacing the Lorazapam with Valium may be an option of needed.
Her antibiotics will end on [**2127-1-16**].
