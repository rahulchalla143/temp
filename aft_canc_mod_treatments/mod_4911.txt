Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ==================================== Mr. [**Known lastname 88299**] is an 86 year old male with multiple medical issues including previously treated follicular lymphoma, paraesophageal hernia, diastolic CHF, afib, COPD who was admitted to OSH on [**2117-6-6**] with weakness and falls, during workup at [**Hospital1 18**] found to have new diagnosis of metastatic cancer likely from the lung.
Oncology gave a 6-month prognosis and recommended that pt would not be a good candidate for treatment as he is too weak, did not tolerate chemotherapy in the past, and biopsy would not be helpful as treatment would not change despite the type of cancer.
NG tube was inserted, but pt pulled it out in the MICU and refused to have it replaced.
Sucralfate and PPI were given to treat upper GI bleed.
Aspirin was discontinued.
Pt was recently undergoing evaluation by Thoracic Surgery for repair of a large paraesophageal hernia - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was peripherally involved in goals of care discussions and decided not to operate in light of patient's current clinical status and risk of possibly reducing the patient's quality of life post-operatively and inability to wean off the ventilator.
- Continue PPI and sucralfate for comfort - Standing tylenol and fentanyl patch for pain control.
Hydromorphone PRN for breakthrough pain.
- Anti-emetics as needed for comfort (promethazine and zofran)  # Dyspnea in setting of aspiration pneumonitis: Complicated by untreated COPD, hiatal hernia, and pulmonary mass causing pulmonary compression from mass effect.
In the MICU there was concern for HCAP, for which he was treated with IV vancomycin and cefepime for 8 days.
- Continue Oxygen as needed for comfort  # Weakness and Falls: His recent weakness and falls are most likely multifactorial.
No further interventions were done since hypercalcemia did not appear to be symptomatic.
We treated him with chlorpromazine 5 mg PO TID, which improved his hiccups.
- Continue chlorpromazine to reduce hiccups for comfort.
# Anemia: His hematocrit was roughly stable 25-30 without receiving any transfusions during this admission.
- Standing tylenol and fentanyl patch for pain control.
Hydromorphone PRN for breakthrough pain.
Sodium restriction was eased as consistent with goals of care.
He is not currently on anticoagulation, and is likely not a good candidate given his recent falls, poor functional capacity, and goals of care.
Aspirin was discontinued in setting of GI bleed.
Telemetry was discontinued as consistent with goals of care but patient was in sinus rhythm prior to that.
- His metoprolol was stopped since not contributing to comfort.
If patient is having symptomatic palpitations, could consider restarting metoprolol in the future.
His metoprolol was stopped since not contributing to hs comfort.
# Hypothyroidism: We continued his home Levothyroxine 50 mcg PO DAILY.
