2 PIV and a RIJ CVL were placed, and she received 2L IVF, 5 mg IV vitamin K, 1 unit PRBC, 1 unit FFP, and 40 mg IV protonix.
A CTAP demonstrated a 3 mm right mid-ureteral stone with dilation of the proximal ureter but no hydronephrosis.
GI, urology, and general surgery were consulted, and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Imaging/results: GI bleeding study: [**6-3**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
Note is made of non-visualization of the kidneys and bladder, uncertain etiology.
Non-visualization of kidneys and bladder could relate to chronic renal failure.
C-scope: [**6-2**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon.
Got Vit K and ffp to reverse INR and many units of blood (see below).
Underwent EGD/C-scope [**6-2**] unrevealing of source (C-scope required two preps.
Her CT scan showed b/l iliac aneurysm, she has known vascular disease and is followed as outpt, she can f/u with vascular on nonurgent basis.
She should have f/u with PCP shortly after [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/c to review medications (polypharmacy) and hospital course.
Many medications have been held or changed: coumadin stopped as no clear indicaiton.
ASA and pentoxyfilline held on d/c but can be resume 1 week after discharge if Hgb is stable.
Lisinopril can be titrated for better BP control as outpt.
Trazadone, oxycodone, flexeril all stopped given pt has not required them entire time here and unclear indication.
s/p 3U ffp/Vit K. On [**6-2**] EGD with nonbleeding polyps, c-scope with diverticulsosis but no bleeding identified, though blood seen in ascending colon.
- Creat 1.9 for couple days, near baseline - encourage PO fluids .
Have decreased metoprolol from 75mg TID to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] (on toprol 200-->100) given bradycardia.
Back on lisinopril 5mg (note creat stable and K has been low), if BP remains elevated, would increase lisinopril to 10mg as outpt .
-encourage water -tylenol, neurontin -pt does not want oxycodone .
- Flomax 0.5 mg po daily x14 days, started [**5-30**]-->[**6-14**] - resumed oxybutinin 5mg TID (on ER 5mg qd) .
PVD: Holding ASA and pentoxyfilline in setting of GIB, will likely hold on discharge with plan to resume if no further GIB on repeat HCT in 1 week.
DVT: Uncertain associated factors, but from chart review appears to have occurred prior to [**2195**].
- Have discussed risks/benefits of ongoing coumadin therapy with daughter (HCP), esp in setting of possible parox Afib (none documented here, per report only, but may be mis-diagnosed given artifact with tremor).
Psych: Continue current regimen of risperdone, effexor, abilify.
- Continue sinemet .
Chronic pain/arthritis/headaches:  on neurontin 300mg tid, cont home doses.
flexeril and oxycodone held, has not requested so will likely not resume on d/c given polypharmacy.
