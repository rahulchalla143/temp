After transfer back to the floor, she was maintained on telemetry with a few, asymptomatic recurrences of her AVNRT.
She was started on chemotherapy (vincristine, Daunorubicin, MTX, L-asparaginase, Prednisone), and had a negative reaction to L-asp, including fever, chills, abdominal pain and severe nausea, which was poorly controlled with compazine, anzemet, and zyprexa.
