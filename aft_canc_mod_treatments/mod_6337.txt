The etiology of this hypoxemia was thought to be secondary to pneumonia (see below), PE, graft versus host disease, leukemic infiltration or transfusion related acute lung injury.
Gradual improvement while on stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics pointed towards leukemic infiltration, GVHD or pneumonia as the cause.
As pt denied chest pain, did not clinically have a DVT, and improved with the above interventions, PE was seen as less likely.
Anticoagulation was never begun in this patient given his thrombocytopenia.
On exam the patient continued to have wheezes and he was treated symptomatically with [**Date Range 1988**] nebulizers and supplemental oxygen.
Within the first 24h sats improved to 94%/6L xNC with frequent duonebs.
O2 sats were >90% on high-flow oxygen by facemask.
O discharge from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient remained on a high-flow oxygen by facemask until time of death.
Pt was without PNA on imaging but persistent hypoxia and cough in this chronically immunosuppresed patient led to agressive antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia and pneumonia prophylaxis.
Also received a course of acyclovir and pentaminidine nebulizer as HSV and PCP prophylaxis, respectively.
He did have positive beta-glucan and galactomannan labs but these were difficult to interpret as pt was on zosyn at the time, which can make these labs falsely positive.
CXR was concernign for aspiration, and the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened to include meorpenem.
Antibiotic therapy for C diff was started prophylactically.
Given presentation with large-volume liquid stools and cultures negative for shigella, campylobacter, yersinia, and c diff toxin, he was started on stress-dose solumedrol 60mg [**Hospital1 **], made NPO and TPN was initiated for bowel rest.
Loperamide and opium tincture were startedv for symptomatic control.
He was on allupurinol, hydroxyurea and ursodiol during his first ICU stay but these were held per [**Hospital Unit Name 3242**] recommendations upon his second ICU admission.
A urine sediment also showed crystals on the urine which were concerning given that the patient was on acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis.
His creatinine gradually rose to 3.8, with no improvement despite fluid resuscitation and TPN.
Renal consult service followed and determined not to pursue dialysis given overall clinical picture, thrombocytopenia, and family preference.
He was started on oral diltiazem 30mg QID; rate was eventually controlled on low-dose metoprolol.
For episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, he patient intermittently received IV diltiazem or metoprolol.
#Neutropenia: On neutropenic precautions for absolute neutropenia on admission but developed only low-grade temperatures.
Antibiotics as above.
And given recent history of cdiff and copious diarrhea, PO vancomycin and IV flagyl started as empiric therapy for severe C diff and continued after stool cultures negative x3.
Prophylaxis with acyclovir and fluconazole continued; fluconazole later switched to Micafungin.
They recommended adding on Tobramycin for ESBL coverage to the patient's antibiotic regimen.
Tobramycin was never added in part due to the patient's acute renal failure and his clinical picture: he did not develop fever.
He received three platelet transfusions (on [**8-16**] and [**8-26**] and [**9-2**]).
He received two PRBC transfusions ([**8-13**], [**8-27**]).
Family (brother and mother) changed pt's code status from Full Code to DNR/DNI on [**2176-9-1**] in context of worsening unexplained hypoxia on broad-spectrum antibiotics, poor mental status, and worsening leukemia prognosis.
