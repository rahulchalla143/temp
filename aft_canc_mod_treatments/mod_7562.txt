One of his brothers passed of brain cancer at age 15.
Microbiology: Beta glucan [**4-12**]- 93 pg/ml Beta glucan [**4-15**]- 142 pg/ml Beta glucan [**4-20**]- 67 pg/ml .
Galactomannan [**4-12**]- 0.1 .

Red blood cells are reduced in number, normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including occasional macroovalocytes and spherocytes seen.
In the remaining cellularity, scant trilineage hematopoiesis is noted including occasional dyspoietic erythroids.
Imaging: CXR [**4-7**]- Right PIC line passes as far as the low SVC.
The nasal septum is deviated slightly to the left.
MRI right leg [**4-14**]- No significant interval change in the appearance of the bilateral calves, including the right anterior knee skin lesion.
There were shorter episodes after midnight, but the record changed to that of an encephalopathy at about 5:30 in the morning.
Right PICC courses along the expected location of the superior vena cava with tip likely in the region of the cavoatrial junction.
Acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 year old man with a history of Ph+ ALL s/p chemotherapy (DVA, Gleevec) and s/p MUD myeloablative allo-BMT [**2132-7-9**] c/b GVHD of the liver, CMV viremia, R leg mucor infection treated with ambisome/micafungin, PICC line thrombus and CKD presenting with worsening pancytopenia, found to have ALL recurrence.
Patient was made comfort measures only following 1 month of admission complicated by multiple medical issues (detailed below) and expired during admission.
# ALL: s/p hyperCVAD and imatinib, s/p MUD allogeneic SCT, admitted with relapse as above.
Patient has had complicated course with GVHD, CMV viremia and mucor infection.
Patient was started on dasatinib 100mg po daily to target BCR-ABL translocation.
In addition, given headaches for several weeks and recent seizures, LP was repeated with infusion of intrathecal araC, and dexamethasone 4mg po BID.
Given the severity of disease relapse in conjunction with multiple medical issues below, the patient's family transitioned him to comfort measures only.
Underlying cause of seizures was not clear.
Patient became less responsive, and per neuro-oncology, he was titrated up on keppra, with addition of lacosamide and eventually valproic acid.
Patient was somnolent for several more days, and anti-epileptics were titrated off, leaving valproic acid 750mg QID at therapeutic level (80-100).
The patient was seen by gastroenterology, but did not undergo upper endoscopsy, as decided through a goals-of-care discussion with the family.
He was also continued on a PPI drip for gastritis or stress ulcer.
He began spiking high fevers, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
The patient was made comfort measures only during the course of his pneumonia, and antibiotics were discontinued.
TPN was continued until the patient was made comfort measures only.
Saw general surgery as outpatient one week prior to admission who felt that debridement of eschars would increase risk of osteomyelitis.
Patient was continued on ambisome and micafungin during admission.
On prednisone and budesonide.
Prednisone was changed to methylprednisolone while patient not taking orals, and budesonide held.
Patient was continued on ambisome during this admission, and with fluid resuscitation, creatinine improved.
Where possible, nephrotoxic medication was avoided.
Likely related to mycobacterium kansaii which has been cultured from sputum repeatedly, but not treated due to significant hepatotoxicity associated with RIPE regimen + ambisome.
Plan was to transition patient off of ambisome once able to take PO so that he could be treated with the RIPE regimen, but patient was transitioned to comfort measures only.
On admission, the patient was off of metoprolol secondary to orthostatic hypotension, then restarted early in this admission.
Patient was given 5mg IV lopressor as needed for prolonged sinus tachycardia.
Late in his admission the patient had many episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with lopressor 5mg IV q6 hours.
