She reported doing well until [**Month (only) 404**] of '[**64**] when she developed dyspnea on exertion, was unable to climb a flight of stairs, or walk up an incline without dyspnea.
The patient was evaluated and had a positive exercise ETT MIBI, went for catheterization on [**2164-5-30**] with left main 50% ostial lesion, left circumflex 60-70% lesion, RCA with fractured stenosis 80%, 80% ostial lesion, 1+ MR, EF 46%.
She reported an uneventful operative course except for difficulty with hallucinations after anesthesia and she had left arm and shoulder tingling.
The last time she had taken Lasix was [**2164-8-9**].
She was started on oxygen and Lasix with some improvement, and EKG at that time showed new onset AFib.
She was rate controlled with Cardizem and Lopressor.
The Cardizem and Lopressor were titrated up and the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm on the [**8-14**].
Due to the echocardiogram findings of a pericardial effusion, Heparin drip which had been started on admission was discontinued, and diuresis was held.
She was transferred to the CCU for close observation and pericardial drain placement.
In general, she was a thin white female sitting upright in a chair on O2 nasal cannula breathing was labored at time.

CCU COURSE:  A pericardial drain was placed 250 cc of blood were drained initially.
The pericardial pressure was 20 mm Hg upon entering and three after the drain was placed.
After the drain was placed, shortness of breath and cough resolved, and the patient was given 30 mg of IV Lasix and she could lay flat at 30 degrees and rest without shortness of breath.
The drain was placed on [**8-17**].
Prior to the pericardial drainage, the patient was anxious and went into rapid AFib with rates of 140-160, 5 mg of IV Lopressor were given x2.
Diltiazem drip was started at 5 mg and her heart rate came down to 100, however, her systolic blood pressure fell to 80, so the diltiazem drip was held, a 250 cc bolus was given, and the patient's systolic blood pressure increased appropriately, and the diltiazem drip was restarted.
On the 3rd, the patient was started on a Heparin drip.
Her diltiazem drip was changed to Cardizem p.o.
as she had spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm and her pericardial output from the drain had started to decrease.
The pericardial drain was pulled without complications.
The patient could now lie more comfortably, and her medicine regimen was continued.
It was decided that the patient would benefit from amiodarone therapy, so pulmonary function tests were ordered, which the results were FVC was 54% of predicted, her FEV1 was 60% of predicted.
Her total lung capacity was 71% of predicted.
Despite the pulmonary function tests findings, it was felt that it would worthwhile to start the patient on amiodarone and have her follow up one month later to do repeat pulmonary function tests when she would likely be able to get better effort.
EP was consulted, and they felt that the amiodarone load should be continued and the beta blocker should be increased to a goal resting heart rate of 60 as tolerated by her blood pressure and bradycardia.
On the 6th, the patient was started on Coumadin.
She was to continue taking all medications as instructed.
