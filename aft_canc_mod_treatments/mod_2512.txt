He went to his primary care physician and was given Milk of Magnesia laxative which worked well.
He was given levofloxacin and Flagyl times five days.
After five days of the levofloxacin and Flagyl he began vomiting.
His antibiotics were then changed again, and he had an abdominal CT which showed a duodenal mass, and the patient was admitted.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications on admission were Levaquin 500 p.o.
and Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
(but both were discontinued after five days), and he was also started on Avalox two days prior to admission.
ABDOMINAL MASS:  The patient received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to try to obtain a biopsy specimen; however, he was too tall for the colonoscope that they used, and no adequate specimen was obtained.
Oncology and Surgery were both consulted on this patient, and it was felt that treatment of the mass and cancer most likely could not be offered except for palliative care and relief of the partial small-bowel obstruction caused by the mass.
The lesions did appear cystic in nature, and it was recommended that he receive CT and magnetic resonance imaging followup after surgery for these lesions.
He was then started on total parenteral nutrition therapy after a peripherally inserted central catheter line was inserted.
After removal of the peripherally inserted central catheter line, the patient was maintained on intravenous fluid hydration.
He will be transferred to Surgery for surgical relief of his partial small-bowel obstruction.
His peripherally inserted central catheter line was pulled, and the culture tip also grew out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was started on vancomycin after initial treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics before his cultures came back.
He was continued on vancomycin throughout his hospital stay, and the dose was increased from 1 to 1250 g q.12h.
He will need a total of six weeks of vancomycin therapy.
He then had next surveillance cultures drawn two days after this (on [**7-20**]), and those have not grown back Staphylococcus to date (on [**7-21**])  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] began having diarrhea a few days after starting on the vancomycin intravenous therapy for his methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
This diarrhea was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin, and he was started on intravenous Flagyl because of his likely inability to have effective p.o.
Flagyl therapy with his partial small-bowel obstruction.
The patient received a Vascular Surgery consultation, and they recommended that he be anticoagulated because of his superior mesenteric vein clot.
He was started on a heparin drip with the intention of putting him on Coumadin anticoagulation postoperatively, after his likely gastrojejunostomy for relief of his partial small-bowel obstruction.
The patient also had a superficial thrombophlebitis of his left antecubital vein where his peripherally inserted central catheter line had been.
This was treated with warm compresses and did not bother the patient; he was completely asymptomatic.
He had no evidence of deep venous thrombosis of his left arm with no edema or swelling, and he was already on heparin anticoagulation for his superior mesenteric vein clot.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] received a blood transfusion on [**7-21**] of one unit.
It was thought that this was most likely due to malnutrition because he has not eaten and had to be taken off his total parenteral nutrition because of his peripherally inserted central catheter line infection.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient received a brief therapy with total parenteral nutrition before his peripherally inserted central catheter line became a source of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
He was then maintained on aggressive intravenous fluid maintenance with D-5 half normal saline and 20 mEq of potassium added.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will likely be transfused to the Surgery Service (after his surveillance blood cultures grow back negative) for a likely gastrojejunostomy surgery to relieve his partial small-bowel obstruction.
