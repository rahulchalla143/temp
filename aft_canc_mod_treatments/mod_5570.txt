CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 7:57 PM IMPRESSION: Right hemidiaphragm elevation with opacification posteriorly suggesting extensive adjacent lung atelectasis, though cannot exclude developing infectious process.
If findings do not resolve on subsequent radiography, evaluation with chest CT could be considered, preferably with intravenous contrast if possible.
A tiny segment of anterior tibial artery opacifies at its origin.
Three-vessel runoff in the right leg is observed with anterior tibial artery opacification terminating mid calf.
Parenchymal opacities in the left lung are similar to mildly worsened.
A left internal jugular vein catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
[**2135-2-19**] Portable Abdomen FINDINGS: The nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach, then loops upon itself before the tip goes further distally, presumably in the antral region.
The tip of the tube projects over the sacroiliac joint.
[**2135-2-20**] Porable CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the previous study, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip only about 1.5 cm above the carina.
Intestinal tube extends well into the stomach.
Left IJ catheter tip is unchanged.
Baseline artifact in leads V4-V6.
The nasogastric tube has been removed.
A left internal jugular vein catheter remains in situ.
Comparison is limited by patient rotation on current imaging.
Takosubo cardiomyopathy pattern was  noted on initial ultrasound raising  the possibilty for catecolamine surge and acute LV dysfunction.
She experienced respiratory distress during this time  and required intubation for 24 hours.
Cardiology recommended starting and ACE-I and she was started on captopril while in the medical intensive care unit.
She was given fluid and initially placed on an insulin drip with close monitoring of her blood sugars.
She was transitioned to an insulin sliding scale and glargine with recommendations from [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes.
After her antrectomy she was started on tube feedings and her blood sugars were still controlled with sliding scale insulin.
She was re-evaluated by [**Last Name (un) **] clinicians and recommendations made for elimination of sliding scale and maintainence of daily glargine.
The urine specimen did grow out citrobacter and she completed a week course ceftriaxone which was completed on [**2135-2-19**].
She was placed on a heparin drip and daily aspirin.
She was taken to the operating room  by vascular surgery on [**2135-2-15**] where they did a take down and thrombectomy of left external iliac and profunda.
Passive range of motion exercises were performed while in the intensive care unit.
At this time, she was started on coumadin, aspirin, and a heparin drip.
The acute care service was consulted and she was taken to the operating room on HD #7 for an antrectomy and billroth II.
Surgical pain was controlled with intravenous analgesia with conversion to oral agents.
Tube feedings were started on  on POD 1 via [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube but were discontinued on POD 2 after the patient pulled out the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube.
She had return of bowel function and her diet was advanced to a regular diet.
After repair of the duodenal ulcer, coumadin was resumed on [**2-24**] with close monitoring of her INR.
Because of her history of limb ishemia, she was started on lovenox with a bridge to coumadin to attain an INR >2.0.
At a time she was diet controlled with only nightly Lantus but with improved/increased PO intake she was placed back on a gentle insulin sliding scale.

You were also placed on a blood thinner called coumadin.
It is very important that you take your insulin as prescribed.
While they were performing a cardiac catheterization you had some difficulty breathing and you were briefly intubated (a breathing tube was placed) for a day and the tube was then removed.
We started you on a medication called captopril, please take this as prescribed.
