Brief Hospital Course: 80yo F with h/o NHL s/p XRT to lung with left main bronchus narrowing s/o stent and recent admission for PNA treated with azithro now re-admitted in respiratory failure.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology of this as patient's CXR did not initially overloaded or with any focal infiltrate, she was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She also underwent LENI's and a CTA torso that were both negative for thrombus.
During her stay she underwent a bronchoscopy for further evaluation of her airways and samples for culture.
CT scans were negative for ischemia and she was treatedly broadly with vancomycin and cefepime.
Over her hospital course at first she was able to be weaned down from her initial pressor requirement, then the day it was decided that her care was not to be escalated her hypotension worsened and she needed to be increased to three pressors.
This decline was presumed to be due to an aggressive malignancy, however given her poor clinical status and uncertain diagnosis the only treatment offered was high dose steroids, which did help her overall clinical picture.
