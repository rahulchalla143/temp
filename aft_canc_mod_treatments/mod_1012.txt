Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE: Given his hypotension and septic picture, the patient was admitted to the ICU for further management.
At the time of transfer, he was on peripheral pressors.
Given his positive UA, he was started on vancomycin/zosyn as broad coverage for suspected urosepsis.
Weaning of peripheral pressors was attempted overnight but was unsuccessful.
On the following morning, when the patient remained on pressors and after his goals of care had been confirmed with his family, a central venous catheter was placed.
His pressors were weaned off.
After that, his antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and then oral Cefpodoxime.
He should complete a 14 day course of antibiotics to cover for urosepsis which is due to end on [**2176-7-19**].
He would like to return to the hospital for reversible causes of illness but would not want aggressive measures to prolong suffering.
FOLLOW-UP: Antibiotics are Cefpodoxime, to finish on [**2176-7-19**] for a total 14 day course.
