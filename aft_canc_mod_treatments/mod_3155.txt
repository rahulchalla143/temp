If the patient has not undergone recent instrumentation to account for air within the collecting system, emphysematous pyelitis should be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: Pleasant 66 yo female with MMP, hx of kidney liver failure, presented intially to the hospital with recurrent multi-drug resistant UTI, was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status and hypoxemia, electively intubated for LP and CT studies found to have gas pockets in her transplanted kidney.
Urine cultures here did not grow any bacteria but did grow [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and she was started on Micafungin.
She will be treated with a three week course of meropenem and micafungin.
She will follow up with ID and urology for further management of her recurrent UTIs.
She received IV lasix with improvement in her respiratory status.
While she was continuing to spike fevers and had altered mental status she was briefly started on vancomycin in addition to the meropenem for possible aspiration PNA.
She was also electively intubated to obtain head chest and abdominal CT. Sputum cultures were negative and the Vancomycin was stopped.
With improvement in her volume status she no longer needed oxygen during the day and only needed oxygen at night as she refuses her CPAP for sleep apnea.
Volume status can be tenuous and she was discharged on torsemide 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
Close attention should be paid to volume status and diuretics increased as necessary.
Her diuretics were held though she later developed pulmonary edema.
She was then diuresed with IV lasix.
Her creatinine rose again during the diuresis but later returned to 1 which was actually below her recent baseline.
On admission she had been taking haldol, seroquel, aripiprazole, venlafaxine, and ativan as well as dilaudid for her hip pain.
Haldol was continued but the rest of the medications were held per psychiatry recs.
She also underwent an LP and head CT which were normal.
With treatment of her UTI, holding her  psychotropic medications and resolution of hypoxia her mental status returned to her baseline and her tremor resolved.
She was restarted on her venlafaxine and ativan PRN but other medications were not restarted on discharge.
# Hx kidney/liver transplant: Her tacrolimus was increased to 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and prednisone was continued unchanged(7.5mg [**Hospital1 **]) throughout this admission.
Her MMF was stopped and was not restarted on discharge.
Bactrim was continued.
She was taking dilaudid for pain when she was admitted but this was held in the setting of AMS.
She was later changed to oxycodone as needed, which provided adequate pain control without mental status changes.
She was continued on lovenox for DVT/PE prevention.
# Diabetes: continued insulin sliding scale, glargine decreased to 15 unitsd QHS.
has known h/o chronic thrombus in LUE, s/p fistula in RUE so not usable for access.
LUE was accessed for IR-guided PICC which was successfully placed.
# HTN: Briefly held her amlodipine and torsemide though these were restarted later.
she was persisitently hypertensive in the morning and her amlodipine was increased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge.
# HLD: Cont atorvastatin .
# Gout: Colchicine and allopurinol were held in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
Her allopurinol was restarted but her colchine was discontinued at discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #Antibiotics: She will need a total of three weeks of meropenem and micafungin.
#Recurrent UTIs: She has previously been on fosfomycin for prophylaxis but still developed this infection.
#Hip fracture: Duration of Lovenox must be determined per orthopedics that performed hip repair.
#Diabetes: Glargine may need to be increased if FSG persistently >180.
Her amlodipine was increased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] the day prior to discharge if she is persistently hypertensive she may need medication changes as directed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Please monitor blood sugars and titrate glargine insulin as needed to maintain FSG 140-180. .
Please continue IV meropenem and micafungin through [**2156-3-12**], last dose to be given that day then remove PICC line.
