Admission Date:  [**2158-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-6-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilaudid / Codeine / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5301**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 55 F with complicated medical history who has been transferred from Rehab/[**Hospital3 417**] for dyspnea, acute on chronic renal failure, volume overload, and fungemia.
She under went a colectomy with iliostomy at that time.
Post op had respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation and eventual tracheostomy.
She was discharged to [**Location (un) 4368**] [**Hospital 21079**] rehab on [**2158-6-1**] after ~30 day hospitalization on TPN via CVL with tube feeds started.
The plan was to advance tube feeds and wean TPN.
On [**2158-6-17**], she was still on TPN at rehab and spiked a temperature up to 103 and blood cultures were positive for yeast ([**Female First Name (un) **] albicans by telephone report but not documented in transfer records).
There she was initially given voriconazole and her central line replaced.
She was then switched to fluconazole and finally to caspofungin today.
She was also treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate for unclear reasons.
During her hospitalization, she also had a "troponin leak" without EKG changes thought to be demand ischemia by their cardiology consultants.
Her hospitalization was also complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (s/p transplant in [**2143**]).
Attempts at diuresis with Lasix 400 mg IV were unsuccesful.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her fungemia, renal failure and repiratory distress.
Immediately prior to discharge or in the ambulance she was started on a nitro dip for again unclear reasons.
Past Medical History: PMH: -Mesenteric ischmia requiring coloectomy [**2158-4-24**] -Respiratory failure requiring trach [**4-/2158**] -CRI s/p transplant in [**2143**] (followed by Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Last Name (un) **], transplant followed  by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15473**] -b/l Breast Cancer s/p lumpectomy/XRT and Chemo 199 (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] -PVD s/p L BKA (followed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 21080**]) - [**6-/2147**], fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] '[**48**] with [**Doctor Last Name **]-DP bypass, -MI X2 s/p CABG times 2 -hypercholesterolemia -DM1 with retinopathy/neuropathy/nephropathy -left eye prosthesis -bilateral breast cancer -chronic anemia -gout   Social History: lives with husband (a math professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
Patient was initially started on PO fluconazole from 6.30.06-7.13.06.
Patient was converted to IV caspofungin on [**2158-7-6**] until [**2158-7-12**].
The evening before transfer to the floor, the patient's HD cath was removed as a possible site for infection.
ID further recommended the PICC line to be replaced which was to be done with HD catheter placement.
## Renal Failure: Patient was admitted to MICU initally  and received hemodialysis which greatly improved mental status.
Patient underwent hemodialysis three times which greatly improved fluid overload and shortness of breath.
The renal service was closely following the patient and recommended placement of an HD catheter in preparation for hemodialysis based on her worsening renal function and fluid status.
She was given boluses and started on NS at 50cc/hr per renal.
She was started on Bicitra 30 mL TID for acidosis.
Allopurinol was decreased to q48h from q24 based on the renal function.
## s/p renal transplant: Pt is normally on prednisone, tacrolimus, and azathioprine for immunosuppression.
Patient was continued on steroids but tacrolimus and azathioprine were temporarily discontinued during this admission secondary to fungemia.
Patient was eventually restarted on tacrolimus once she demonstrated improved control of her infection.
Tacrolimus and prednisone was continued while the patient was on the floor.
Patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin initially for concern of gram negatives and MRSA, which was noted on OSH blood culture.
Cefepime was discontinued since there was no obvious target and vancomycin was maintained for MRSA.
Vancomycin was then discontinued given negative blood cultures and concern for vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Thoracentesis demonstrated a transudate effusion.
Patient received antibiotic treatment with PO fluconazole and IV caspofungin.
She was given nebulizers as indicated.
Her fluid status was closely monitored as she was getting an increasing fluid load for hypercalcemia treatment.
She was treated with calcitonin and pamidronate, given lasix and fluids with some response.
Patient's sodium resolved with hemodialysis and was stable during admission.
She initially was started on an insulin drip and her insulin regimen was adjusted with help from [**Last Name (un) **].
No other transfusions were given, and th pt may require outpt colonoscopy.
Thrombocytopenia was thought to have developed secondary to vancomycin and platelets increased after discontinuing vancomycin.
Patient was treated with linezolid.
She again grew out many bacteria on a urine culture and was treated with ciprofloxacin and fluconazole (last day of cipro [**2158-9-23**], last day of fluconazole [**2158-9-18**]) .
Patient was maintained on home meds of ASA, BB, and isosorbide dinitrate.
## HTN: Patient's blood pressures have been occasionally elevated and hydralazine was increased to 15mg PO qid to assess for improved BP control.
Patient was otherwise maintained on home doses of Clonidine, Metoprolol, and Isosorbide without other problems.
Ativan and ambien were discontinued secondary to increased somnolence with these meds.
There was no clear source, with possiblities being septic (LLL opacity and 4+ MRSA in sputum, though no fever or WBC), adrenal insufficiency (started empirically on stress dose steroids), or cardiogenic.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that this was not acute ischemia, and that the decrement in function was likely overstated; it was felt that her prior study had been of sub-optimal quality and that probably had not been a significant interval change in LV-EF, and that this low EF was probably a mix of a baseline ischemic cardiomyopathy with a superimposed toxic/infectious cardiomyopathy.
Over the next few days, she continued with treatment of her VAP and was diuresed during CVVH.
She tolerated this well and was able to be weaned off pressure support and onto a trach mask without difficulty.
She was treated for ten days with vancomycin and ceftazidime for a hospital acquired pneumonia.
Her stress dose steroids were tapered after three days of full dose, over the course of the following week.
She was started on CVVHD to relieve her gross volume overload.
With the combined effect of these interventions, her bp slowly climbed over the week, and she eventually became hypertensive with bp's in the 140-160's.
She was bolused 500cc of NS and a phenylephrine drip was started.
She receieved a 24` IV amiodarone load with reversion to sinus rhythm and was then switched over to oral amiodarone.
Being treated for urine bacterial and fungal infections.
Unlikely to be from new-onset psyichiatric disease.
Continue ciprofloxacin until [**9-23**].
Continue fluconazole until [**9-18**].
Now in sinus rhythm after being treated with amiodarone.
She was continued on metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control and amiodarone 200 for rhythm control.
Continued metoprolol 50 PO bid, aspirin 81 PO qd .
## Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Total body volume overloaded given sacral edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
## End stage renal disease s/p transplant: Needed HD and CVVH in unit.
Now being evaluated daily for HD requirement.
Has required intermittent nebs for wheeziness.
Received pamidronate 30 mg IV x2 with some normalization of calcium.
