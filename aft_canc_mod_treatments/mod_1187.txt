Admission Date:  [**2162-5-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2162-6-8**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 203**] Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post nephrectomy and Intensive Care Unit stay, transfer for cardiac catheterization  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 89-year-old female who is status post a nephrectomy on [**2162-5-24**] for renal cell carcinoma.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course after nephrectomy was complicated by an episode of unstable angina while on the surgical floor with increased troponin to 7.3.
The patient was subsequently transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit in the setting of anticoagulation with heparin, aspirin and Plavix over the unstable angina episode.
The patient experienced a retroperitoneal bleed requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells as transfusion, as well as reversal of anticoagulation.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**] with left internal mammary artery to LAD, saphenous vein graft to PDA, saphenous vein graft to OM, status post myocardial infarction in [**2161-10-19**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the saphenous vein graft and RCA.
Saphenous vein graft to OM was totally occluded.
The patient was apparently placed on Coumadin for the cerebrovascular accident.
Breast cancer status post right mastectomy in [**2147**].
Status post total knee replacement 5.
Status post carpal tunnel release  TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: 1.
Lipitor 10 mg po qd 2.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd 3.
Colace 100 [**Hospital1 **] 4.
Senna 1 tablet po qd 5.
Sublingual nitroglycerin prn 6.
Protonix 40 mg intravenous [**Hospital1 **] 7.
Lopressor 100 mg tid 8.
Reglan 10 mg po qd 9.
Simethicone 80 mg po tid 10.
Norvasc 10 mg po qd  ALLERGIES:  MORPHINE SULFATE, THE PATIENT GETS HYPOTENSIVE AND EXPERIENCES NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
O2 saturation was 91% on room air.
Saphenous vein bypass graft #1 to segment #3 was normal.
The patient had a patent stent in the saphenous vein graft to RCA.
No intervention was done after cardiac catheterization.
The patient was hydrated prior to cardiac catheterization, as well as given Mucomyst to prevent nephrotoxicity.
After cardiac catheterization, the patient was given intravenous fluids as well.
Subsequently, intravenous fluids were discontinued and patient was diuresed with Lasix with an improvement in her oxygen requirement.
For the patient's hypertension, hydralazine was started instead of an ACE inhibitor, given the fact that she had recently had a dye load, as well as one kidney removed, as well as diuresis.
The hydralazine was titrated up to initially 100 qid.
Subsequently, once the patient's creatinine stabilized an ACE inhibitor was started and hydralazine was in the process of being titrated down.
The patient was previously on Coumadin prior to admission for this history of a cerebrovascular accident, however given the fact that the patient had recently had a retroperitoneal bleed while being on anticoagulants, it was felt that the risk/benefit ratio would favor holding the Coumadin.
The patient was continued on antiplatelet agents such as aspirin for coronary artery disease.
RENAL:  The patient's creatinine after nephrectomy had almost doubled.
Given this, it was felt that an ACE inhibitor would be beneficial for the patient and was initiated on the day prior to discharge.
The dose of the Zestril should be titrated up as blood pressure, potassium and creatinine tolerate and the hydralazine should be titrated down.
