She was extubated in the OR, then brought to the ICU for initial monitoring, with epidural, JP, right Chest tube and NGT, and was kept NPO, with IV fluids.
On POD 7 she developed copious, foul-smelling respiratory secretions, as well as air output into her JP drain with respiration and coughing.
Her cough worsened and she required increased nasal cannula oxygen.
Her WBC count rose to 13 and her antibiotics were broadened to vanc, zosyn, and diflucan.
She was taken to the OR for EGD and bronchoscopy, which revealed a large fistula between her trachea and her gastric conduit, as well as necrosis of the proximal 5-6cm of her conduit.
On POD 8 she remained intubated and sedated.
After discussion of the high morbidity associated with any further operations and the prognosis and quality of life after surgery, her family elected to make her comfort measures only.
