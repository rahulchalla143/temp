Admission Date:  [**2116-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-8-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-3-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Metastatic Melanoma requiring IL-2 therapy Persistent acidemia, AG acidosis & ARF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Central line placement [**2116-8-7**] - Central line placement [**2116-8-8**] - CVVH dialysis beginning [**2116-8-8**]  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 60 yo man with history of metastatic melanoma (primary in foot, known mets in pelvis, liver, lungs who initially presented on [**2116-8-3**] to biologics service for IL-2 therapy.
Today, pt received his 13th out of 14 doses of IL-2 therapy at 5pm.
During the day, he had been noted to have persistent acidemia (low HCO3) and had been treated with total of 5 amps bicarb throughout the day without much improvement of his HCO3.
He was intubated for airway protection, initially started on levophed gtt for pressure support.
Cardioversion was attempted but was unsuccessful.
He was therefore switched from levophed to neosynephrine and was bolused amiodarone and started on amio gtt.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Melanoma S/p Appy Migraine   Social History: - Married with 3 children - He is a retired truck driver and lives in [**Location 74394**].
Physical Exam: Vitals - T , HR 190, BP 73/37, RR 36, O2 99% on NRB -> AC/FiO2 1.0/TV 500/RR30/PEEP 5 Gen - awake, alert, able to answer questions, visibly tachypnic with use of abdominal muscles HEENT - scleral icterus Lungs - slight wheezing at bases, otherwise CTA b/l CVS - tachycardic, irregular Abd - soft, use of abdominal muscles with breathing, no noted tenderness to palpation; tympanic in upper region Ext - [**1-14**]+ LE edema b/l Neuro - A+O initially, became more lethargic Skin - cool extremities, flushed appearance to limbs   Pertinent Results: [**2116-8-8**] CXR - prelim read low lung volumes, ?
# Respiratory Failure:  Patient was initially intubated for work of breathing/tachypnea, resp distress.
Presentation was more consistent with an ARDS picture, given bilateral pulm infiltrates as well as PaO2/FiO2 < 200, or IL-2 therapy adverse event as this can cause a capillary leak syndrome.
The patient was continued on AC ventilation following ARDSnet protocol--> increase PEEP 12 to 15, decrease VT 600 to 550, wean oxygen as able.
An esophageal balloon was used to measure pleural pressures to aid in target CVP assessment.
The patient was maintained on CVVH to help with acid/base disorder with pt.
IL-2 therapy was held.
# Atrial Fibrillation: No known history of CAD; the patient had afib on admission to ICU but converted to NSR after shocks x2 & amiodarone IVP x1; o/n, converted back to Afib, requiring cardioversion as well as amiodarone without success.
Hypotensive, thus requiring levophed, neosynephrine & vasopressin.
Amiodarone infusion was not used because of hypotension as well as liver failure.
The patient was hypothermic and hypotensive, requiring 3 vasopressors with SBP still 90's; hypotension was thought to be a side effect of IL-2 therapy, unsure if it was related to IL-2 toxicity.
The patient was started on IV solumedrol, which was changed to standing hydrocortisone for treatment of IL-2 related adverse effects.
Antibiotic therapy for broad spectrum coverage was continued throughout admission.
Medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxins were avoided.
# Severe Acidemia/AG-Acidosis:  The patient had severe lactic acidosis in the setting of hypotension SBP 60's on arrival to ICU & occasionally overnights, also with triple vasopressor use-vasoconstriction, ?abd compartment syndrome (however CT scan does not support this), shock or ischemic liver were also included in the differential.
The patient was taken off IL-2 and was receiving thiamine and steroids.
As mentioned above, the patient was started on CVVH to correct acid/base abnormality.
Coagulopathy and LFTs were monitored, and a hepatology consult was obtained for further management.
Initiated steroids to reverse effects of IL-2 currently.
No melanoma treatment for now.
The patient was maintained on PPI and pneumoboots for prophylaxis (no SC hep b/c plt low).
During the admission a high-dose insulin drip was started up to 23 units/hr for FS up to 600s; however, the patient became hypoglycemic with FS (60s).
There was a concern for hypoglycemia in the setting of liver failure and possibly retained insulin given renal failure.
CPR was attempted with chest compressions for approximately 25 minutes without a return of pulse; the code was terminated because of persistent asystole with the time of death at 9:25pm on [**8-10**].
