Findings could relate to a global hypoxic/ischemic event with secondary diffuse infarction.
...................   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 30y/o M with HIV presents with fulminant hepatic failure after tylenol overdose.
Pt remained intubated and paralytics were removed but the patient was unable to remain synchronized with the ventilator so these were restarted.
Maintained on low tidal volume strategy with HOB elevated.
Pt had borderline acceptable oxygenation and ventilation and required high levels of PEEP and FIO2 to maintain O2 sats.
Ceftazidime for poss Pseudomonal ear infx as below, azithromycin, and vancomycin for empiric coverage of pneumonia given bilateral opacities were started.
The patient was DNR and a family discussion was had with mother and partner where it was decided to removed endotracheal tube in setting of poor prognosis.
He was pronounced dead at 0030 on [**2133-9-29**]  #  Fulminant hepatic failure - Likely cause was tylenol hepatotoxicity.
HAART could also have contribution, as efavirenz can cause transaminitis, and Combivir can cause hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia.
Liver team was involved who recommended FFP PRN and Vit K daily.
Liver transplant team was contact[**Name (NI) **] but the patient was not deemed a candidate d/t HIV status.
Supportive treatment was maintained but the patient continued to decline and developed increased intracranial pressure as above.
[**Hospital1 **] IV PPI given, 2 large bore IV's, typed and crossed.
