The left kidney measures 11.9 cm.
Bladder measures 11.3 x 7.7 x 7.5 cm and contains a large heterogeneous mass with internal vascularity consistent with tumor.
A Foley balloon is identified within the bladder.
Attempts were made to fill the bladder with saline to better evaluate the mass; however, patient could not tolerate more than 5 cc.
[**2196-12-21**] CT abdomen and pelvis Study is compared with outside ([**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital) _____ CT, dated [**12-15**], as well as interval renal [**Name (NI) 75758**], dated [**2196-12-19**].
Evaluation of the urinary tract, in particular, the bladder, is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast material.
Since the previous studies, bilateral nephrostomy tubes have been placed, with pigtail loops in both renal pelves, draining externally and the previously-demonstrated hydronephrosis is no longer seen; there is persistent right more than left hydroureter, incompletely characterized.
There is relatively slight perinephric soft tissue stranding, unchanged, and no significant air is identified in the upper urinary tract, though there is a small pocket of air in the left posterior pararenal space, likely related to the recent tube placement.
There is marked _____ cardiomegaly with multi-chamber enlargement.
Dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker in situ, with apparently intact leads.
There is also some interlobular septal thickening with patchy ground-glass opacity, as well as prominence of the more-anterior vessels, all consistent with underlying CHF.
Destructive process involving the right L5 vertebral body, extending into and largely replacing the cortex and right posterior elements _____ a large soft tissue component, displacing the thecal sac to the left, and deforming it.
Status post interval placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes with external drainage, and virtual complete resolution of hydronephrosis.
Extensive destructive lesion involving right lateral aspect of the L5 vertebral body and its posterior elements, with large epidural soft tissue component thecal sac in exiting right L5 nerve root.
Multi-chamber cardiomegaly with dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker, and evidence of CHF with bilateral pleural effusions and passive atelectasis.
After re-evaluation of his obstruction, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies were placed with very rapid resolution of his ARF to a serum creatinine at his baseline.
Urology has recommended permanently leaving percutaneous nephrostomies and bladder catheter in place.
He was instructed to follow up with his long term Urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 75759**] within one month, as his urinary catheters will likely need to be changed under cystoscopic guidance.
Subsequently, a rigid cystoscopy was performed by Urology which demonstrated fibrinous material in the urethra and large fibrinous mass adherent to the bladder wall, consistent with old clot material.
Continuous bladder irrigation was started to help clear the mass.
Initial gram stains and studies demonstrated gram positive and gram negative bacteria and antibiotics were continued, and later tailored based on sensitivities.
He was rate controlled with a titration of metoprolol tartrate, later converted to metoprolol succinate, and diltiazem.
During his invasive studies, warfarin anticoagulation was held, with the plan to resume later; at the time of discharge this was being resumed at 10 mg daily with a heparin bridge, to be completed at the rehabilitation hospital.
The patient developed a 30% drop in his platelets upon transfer, after significant exposure to heparin during dialysis and for DVT prophylaxis.
Preliminary heparin dependent antibodies were positive, and confirmation serotonin release studies were negative.
Heparin was later used as a bridge when initiating warfarin anticoagulation, without recurrence of thrombocytopenia.
The patient was restarted on warfarin anticoagulation with a goal INR [**2-13**], and covered with unfractionated heparin infusion on a weight based protocol with PTT monitoring.
The patient was started on an initial fluroquinolone regimen and then changed to meropenem, before finally settling on imipenem regimen.
A PICC catheter was placed, and the patient is to complete a total 4 weeks of imipenem therapy.
Attributed to mult stool softeners as well as charcoal given for enterovesicular fistula evaluation (twice).
