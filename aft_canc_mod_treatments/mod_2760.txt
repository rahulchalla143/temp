He has received multiple blood transfusions at [**Hospital1 18**] during this admission with no previously reported reactions.
On [**2116-2-11**] at 2215, following premedication with tylenol, Mr. [**Known lastname 14558**] was transfused approximately 170 ml of compatible leukoreduced packed red blood cells.
The transfusion was stopped at 2330, after his  temperature rose to 101.2.
Laboratory Data: Patient ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh positive Red Cell Product (21KQ[**Pager number 58759**]) ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh positve Post-transfusion serum: yellow, DAT negative  Transfusion History: Previous non-reactive red cell transfusions: 7 Previous non-reactive platelet transfusions: 4 Transfusion restriction met: Yes  DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 14558**] experienced a mild temperature increase of 1.4 degrees F after receiving 170 ml of a leukoreduced compatible red cell.
Given that leukoreduction significantly decreases the incidence of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, the patient's fever is likely secondary to his underlying illness.
However, a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction cannot be completely ruled out.
