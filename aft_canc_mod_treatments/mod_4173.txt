He also had CT which showed acute calculous cholecystitis and is s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy.
He grew pan sensitive E Coli from his blood cultures and his bile grew Ecoli, serratia, clostridium perfringens and bacterioides fragilis.
He was treated with cipro and flagyl and will follow up with surgery with plan for cholecystectomy.
# cholecystits with ecoli bacteremia he will continue cipro flagyl until surgery.
percutaneous drain capped on [**6-1**] at 8am.
**  # hyperbilirubinemia abscence of biliary dilation or obstruction and size of gallstone fits with Mirizzi syndrome.

# h/o Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral DVTs Patient was on coumadin and with IVC filter.
After endoscopy, we elected to restart anticoagulation with lovenox as will be going to surgery but felt to be high risk for embolism as sedentary and with wegeners.

consider lasix over HCTZ if need to resume diuretics 6. was on 50 mcg of synthroid.

increase as needed 8. prednisone 40 continued and slow taper by 5mg [**Last Name (un) **] 5 days intiated on discharge 9. irbesartan held.
