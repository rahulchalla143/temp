He had adequate reserve to tolerate resection and was surprisingly asymptomatic regarding the tumor, which was clearly adherent if not invading the chest wall.
We recommended left lower lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection and he agreed to proceed.

HISTORY: Left lower lobectomy and chest wall repair, left upper lobe wedge resection.
Chest tube discontinued.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-30**]: Left posterior air and fluid collection in the region of chest wall resection has increased in size, predominantly in the anteroposterior dimension from roughly 31 to 39 mm in diameter, still between 10.5 and 12 cm in length, and now contains a large component of fluid.
Transvenous pacer lead in standard position.
Various consistencies of barium were administered under videofluoroscopy.
Pharyngeal contraction was symmetric.
Mild penetration with sips of thin liquids was observed with spillover, but throat clearing was effective.
A moderate amount of silent aspiration was observed with multiple sips of thin liquids, related to spillover, and cough was not effective at clearance.
With smaller boluses of thin liquids via straw, only trace penetration was observed.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aspiration with larger boluses of thin liquids, with only penetration into the vestibules seen at smaller boluses.
He demonstrated aspiration and penetration with thin liquids during the examination, however, small bolus sizes were effective at preventing aspiration when pt was focused on the swallowing task.
In consideration of pt's left vocal cord paresis, it is very likely that this is the cause of his poor valve closure and thus compromising his airway protection with larger boluses.
Therefore, based on this examination, it is recommended that pt continue with a regular PO diet with thin liquids while taking small sips of thin liquids and NO STRAWS.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. recommend that pt continue on regular PO diet with thin liquids and PO meds 2. pt should take small sips of thin liquids 3.
Pt should not use straws  Pathology Examination SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: LIPOMA, LATERAL CHEST WALL MARGIN, NEW LATERAL CHEST WALL MARGIN, LEFT LOWER LOBE AND CHEST WALL, L10 LYMPH NODE, L11 LYMPH NODE  Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed by [**2123-8-25**] [**2123-8-26**] [**2123-8-30**] DR.
