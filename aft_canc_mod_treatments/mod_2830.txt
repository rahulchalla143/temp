Study Date of [**2130-6-11**]  11:29:32 PM ECG Regular narrow complex tachycardia - mechanism uncertain - consider AV nodal reentry Left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 60 y/o man with PMH significant for mesothelioma transferred from OSH for management of hemothorax who was intubated for respiratory failure  #respiratory failure - likely from combination of progressive right sided hemothorax, progreessive lung cancer and right sided atelextasis, diffuse ground glass in lungs(CHF vs pneumonia) - tried diuresis with no improvement in respiratory status, likely not CHF - The patient was treated empirically for pneumonnia with Cefepime/Vanco/Flagyl.
- As the patient did not improve despite intubation and antibiotics, palliative care was consulted and the patient ultimately passed away from respiratory failure.
#right sided hemothhorax s/p thoracentesis by IP - CT chest to assess size of hemothorax post tap:complete atelectasis RML and RLL from hemothorax, ground glass opacity in LLL - Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt the patient was not a candidate for pleurodesis.
#Mesothelioma(sarcomatoid type)-diagnosed [**4-8**] with recurrent right pleural effusion, underwent bronchoscopy, VATS and decortication iwth residula pleural thickening.
Planned to be referred to [**Company 2860**] for chemo vs additional surgery as outpatient.
#AVNRT: Occured likely related to hypoxia prior intubation .
