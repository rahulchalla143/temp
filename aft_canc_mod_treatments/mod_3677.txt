Admission Date:  [**2199-7-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Carbapenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension s/p cardiac arrest   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Rigid bronchoscopy with argon therapy 2.
Endotracheal Intubation 3.
History of Present Illness:  72 y/o female with h/o NSCLC s/p radiation, PE s/p IVC filter, DM, htn, COPD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-7-24**] for persistent hemoptysis.
She was also found to have PEs and was started on anticoagulation.
However, then developed hemoptysis and anticoagulation was stopped which was followed by IVC filter placement.
OR course was otherwise uncomplicated except for a brief episode of hypotension treated with phenylephrine, attributed to propofol.
Patient then received a final round of argon therapy.
CPR was initiated and patient received atropine and epinephrine boluses.
A femoral CVL was placed along with an a-line.
Patient was treated with epinephrine gtt and levophed gtt with improvement in his BPs.
She was noted to be in Afib at that time and was given 150 mg of amiodarone with conversion to sinus rhythm but also further drop in her blood pressures requiring increase in her epinephrine gtt.
She was then transferred to the ICU for further managment.
Past Medical History: # NSCLC (LUL) - dx'ed by biopsy - complicated by hemoptysis # Type 2 DM # h/o PE s/p IVC filter # HTN # hypercholesteremia # COPD # s/p tonsillectomy # s/p cholecystectomy .
ET tube in place NECK: Supple, No LAD.
OP Report: Bronchoscopy [**2199-7-25**] Surgeon:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 42548**] ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 74204**] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.
INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 74205**] has been recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer s/p X-RT and presents with massive hemoptysis, worsening over the last 1 day, from an outside hospital.
The procedure is being performed for airway evaluation and control of hemoptysis.
She was placed supine on the operating table and general anesthesia was initiated.
She was intubated without difficulty with a 12.2/13.2 rigid bronchoscope.
Jet ventilation was initiated.
Using a flexible bronchoscope, an argon plasma coagulation probe was advanced into the left upper lobe and coagulation was performed x3.
While repeat APC was being performed, the patient developed acute ST segments on the EKG monitoring and the procedure was discontinued.
She remained intubated with the rigid bronchoscope while the cardiac status was stabilized.
The rigid bronchoscope was removed and she was easily intubated over a Cook catheter with an endotracheal tube #7.
Using the flexible bronchoscope, the endotracheal tube was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus to isolate the left lung.
The patient also received epinephrine and norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2199-7-26**] HISTORY:  72-year-old woman status post air embolus in aorta and status post cardiac arrest, now with decreased mental status.
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without the administration of IV contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 72 y/o female with h/o NSCLC s/p radiation, PE s/p IVC filter, DM, htn, COPD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-7-24**] for persistent hemoptysis now s/p rigid bronchoscopy and argon laser anticoagulation complicated by air embolus STEMI, and cardiac arrest.
LV function reportedly severely depressed intraoperatively but with some improvement following resuscitation and resolution of air on coronaries.
After her IR embolization procedure, Levophed was weaned off.
PCWP and CVP both dropped so the patient was given IVF boluses and levophed was increased.
She responded well to these measures.
broad spectrum antibiotic treatment begun - Tx with Levo, vanc, flagyl - treat air embolus with high flow supplemental O2 to maximize air diffusion through pulmonary vasculature - Cardiology consulted, no treatment given source of STEMI was air emoboli.
- minimize PEEP if possible to allow for air diffusion out of blood - hold antiplatelet agents and other anticoagulation given recent hemoptysis and air embolus presumed as etiology - levophed and fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and SBP > 140.
- hold anticoagulation as above - transfuse for goal Hct>30 - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension - Cardiac enzymes elevated but are trending down - serial EKGs .
Pt underwent IR embolization procedure on the night of [**7-25**] for LUL bleeding, pt tolerated procedure well.
- maintain ET tube at 23 at lip.
# PE: patient w/ h/o PE now s/p IVC filter.
Did not tolerated anticoagulation in past secondary to hemoptysis.
- levofloxacin day #[**2201-12-24**] days - Vanc, flagyl .
# NSCLC: s/p radiation therapy.
On oral regimen as outpatient.
- oral meds held - insulin gtt for BGs>150 .
- albuterol and atrovent MDIs - prednisone burst as written per IP .
# HTN: BP meds held in the setting of hypotension and pressor dependence.
# ACCESS: Radial a-line, Swanz Ganz catheter in Left subclavian .
