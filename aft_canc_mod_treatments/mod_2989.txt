There has been interval placement of right-sided IJ line, with its tip in the inferior SVC.
Clinical correlation is recommended as this could represent an infectious colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71 yo male, h/o metastatic adenocarcinoma of the GE junction, s/p irinotecan/carboplatin, now on experimental chemotherapeutic regimen, admitted with hypotension (?sepsis), currently stable, being treated for ?pneumonia and poor PO intake.
Hypotension: Initially, sepsis by protocol was instituted in the setting of increased lactate, hypotension, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and an elevated white count.
The patient was hypotensive in the ED which respondeed to fluid boluses.
His lactate continue to be low, his pressure increased with fluid boluses and his Levophed was weaned to off.
GIven his nasal conjestion, cough, and weakness, he was placed on precautions and evaluated for influenza which was negative.
Vancomycin, azithromycin, and cefepime was stopped and the Levofloxacin was contined for strep pneumo coverage that had previously been documented via bronch.
He completed his Levaquin on [**2174-1-26**].
The levofloxacin was continued until [**2174-1-24**] for empiric pneumonia coverage (and given history of strep pneumo on bronch recently).
He was continued on IVF for poor PO intake (was hemodynamically/had adequate SBP's).
He was maintained on telemetry with no significant events.
Preliminary results from the tilt were equivocal and after discussions w/ oncology, it was decided to start patient on florinef 0.1 mg po bid, with some objective decrease in the degree of his orthostatis.
Midodrine was added as well.
Plan for pt to go to rehab for further stabilization w/ neuro and autonomic f/u.
Chemotherpy has been held for a few weeks given his degreee of weight loss and lethargy (currently on ?experimental bevacizumab and doxetaxol; His irinotecan/carboplatin was stopped in [**10-25**] secondary to disease progression).
As above, oncology felt neither his disease nor chemotherapeutic regimen could account for his level of anorexia.
Nutrition was consulted, and IVF were continued as needed for poor PO intake.
Psych had suggested remeron for improved appetite but oncology recommended on holding on further medications at this time.
Dispo: It was felt that an acute rehabilitation facility was more appropriate than returning home given pt's poor PO intake, debilitation, and generalized wekaness.
