Patient was initially on cipro/flagyl given instability, which was discontinued on transfer to the floor.
Patient's foley catheter was removed and he was started on ciprofloxacin as he had pan-sensitive e.coli in the past.
Antibiotics were broadened to treat health-care acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
Patient continued to spike fevers, therefore it was felt that he was likely aspirating given RLL consolidations which rapidly resolved, consistent with pneumonitis.
He was changed to a pureed solid/nectar thick liquid diet and tolerated this well.
# Thrombocytopenia: On admission, as above, patient's CBC was significantly hemoconcentrated and showed platelets of 100, dropping to 60s following volume resuscitation.
Patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, followed by hematology as an outpatient, which has been attributed to chronic illness and potentially medication effect.
HIT antibody was positive, and patient was started on argatroban drip.
Argatroban was discontinued in light of new information, and patient was placed on fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis, however given decreased renal function this was stopped and patient was placed on mechanical DVT prophylaxis.
If it returns negative for HIT, the patient can safely receive heparin agents in the future.

# HIstory of seizure: Recent admission for witnessed seizure at rehab, placed on keppra and pyridoxine.
Outpatient neurologist reiterated the importance of continue anti-seizure medications, and felt that other options might be more sedating.
