Admission Date:  [**2193-2-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-3-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol / Aspirin / Dilaudid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Lung mass.
MRI of his brain showing no significant change from his post-stroke MRI per report.
His R hand weakness progressed and he was sent from rehab back to the OSH where he again had a MRI of his C-spine which showed interval progression of the compression fracture with retropulsion of the posterior fragment into the upper thoracic cord.
Additionally, a soft tissue mass anterior to the vertebral body brought up the possibility of metastatic disease.
He was started on steroids and  sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
Incidentally, he was restarted on CTX/gentamycin at the OSH per family report because he developed fevers but they denied any other infectious symptoms at this time including SOB, cough, dysuria, or abdominal pain.
His thoracic vertebral fracture was thought to be stable and he was fitted for a brace.
Prostate CA s/p XRT and since treated w/ lupron and zoladex 3.
DM2 5. s/p Nephrectomy ~'[**82**] 6.
Physical Exam: (on admission) 99.3, 126/69, 88, 20, 98%RA Gen: WNWD Elderly [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] sitting up in chair w/ neck brace in place HEENT: MMM, O/P clear, EOMI, PERRLA CV: RRR, 3/6 SEM at the apex Lungs: Decreased breath sounds on the L Abd: S/NT/ND, +BS, -HSM Ext: No peripheral edema Neuro: Decreased strength on R side w/ worst strength in grip, intact sensation to light touch bilaterally, AAO to person and year but not date or location, 0/3 recall immediately and w/ prompting, thought 5 quarters in $1.75, intact heel-to-shin on L but impaired on R, able to name watch/pen and describe what they are used for Skin: No rashes  (on discharge) 99.1, 130/70, 74, 18, 95% on 2L NC Gen: chronically ill appearing male in soft neck collar in place HEENT: OP clear, EOMI, MMM CV: RRR, 3/6 SEM apex radiating to axilla, heard across precordium Resp: sporadic ronchi, decreased breath sounds left Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds Ext: No edema, able to move UE/LE bilaterally   Pertinent Results: At the time of callout from the MICU ([**2193-3-2**]): .
Degenerative changes within the cervical spine result in areas of spinal canal stenosis, as described above.
There is left pleural effusion and ill-defined mass in left lower lobe, which is better evaluated on prior CT scans.
He was fitted for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] brace which he wore at all times.
In an effort to free the patient from the brace and improve his pain, he underwent interventional radiology-vertebroplasty.
LLL mass: likely primary lung cancer, however, no definitive tissue pathology was obtained despite several attempts including transbronchial biopsy.
Oncology consulted who thought patient was not a chemotherapy candidate given his solitary kidney and poor performance status.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a prolonged course given his inability to clear secretions effectively.
He was continued on antibiotics at discharge.
He was diltiazem refractory and ultimately responded to IV Metoprolol.
He was maintained on Metoprolol orally during the hospitalization.
He received a course of Amiodarone and coverted to sinus rhythm.
Hypoxia: the patient was intermittently hypoxic during the initial period of his hospitalization from the large LLL mass, post obstructive pneumonia/mucus plugging, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and intermittent volume overload.
He would have a tendency to desaturate overnight, but would respond to increased oxygen and diuresis if overloaded.
At discharge, the patient had a much improved requirement  of 2 liters by nasal cannula.
Prostate cancer: prior history, on Zoladex as outpatient.
Diabetes: home regimen of metformin and glipizide held in the hospital, placed on sliding scale.
Uncontrolled sugars in the setting of steroids for pain control.
He was on several regimens during the hospitalization, but was ultimately discharged on Methadone 0.5 mg q8 am and q2 pm.
He was also maintained on Ritalin for improved mood and energy during the day.
He was also pulsed with Decadron with improvement in his mood, but not pain.
Glaucoma: continued home Latanoprost .
Hypertension: well controlled initially on home regimen, but became difficult to control in the setting of steroids.
At discharge, he was stable in 130s/70s on Lisinopril and Metoprolol.
Ultimately it was decided not to pursue aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures and the patient was discharged to hospice care.
