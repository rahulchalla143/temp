PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Minimally invasive total esophagectomy via thoracoscopy and laparoscopy.
He has previously undergone laparoscopy and laparoscopic jejunostomy.
He presents now for definitive surgical therapy.
PREPARATION:  In the operating room, the patient underwent general endotracheal anesthetic via a double-lumen tube.
Intravenous antibiotics were given and appropriate lines were placed.
A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.
The chest was prepared with Betadine solution and draped in the usual fashion.
Two #5 trocars were placed well posteriorly.
A Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus and placed up in the thoracic inlet for easy identification from the neck incision.
We then worked inferiorly from this area and were able to encircle the esophagus with a Penrose drain to facilitate our dissection.
The Penrose drain was then left in the thorax very close to the diaphragm in order to facilitate dissection of the hiatus from below.
A #28 chest tube was placed.
The chest tube was hooked up to wall suction.
The jejunostomy tube was temporarily removed in order to maintain sterility while the abdomen was prepared in the standard sterile fashion after the patient was placed in lithotomy position.
Trocar placement: Open technique was used to access the peritoneal cavity and to control the incision used for thelaparoscopic jejunostomy which was approximately 14 cm below the xiphoid.
A #5 trocar was placed laterally on the left, and #12 dilating ports were placed superiorly on the left and the midclavicular line on the right and laterally on the right.
The esophagus was then identified along with a Penrose drain to facilitate its identification after the dissection of the left gastric artery.
We then divided the stomach and made a long gastric tube based on the right gastroepiploic artery using the Endo [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler with a thick load.
We then opened the neck using a collar incision.
The Penrose drain was pulled up and we were very satisfied that the esophagus had been nicely dissected and that were high enough to almost the level of the cricoid.
I should mention that just prior to this, we did complete our hiatus dissection, completely freeing the fundus and esophagus from the hiatus and pulling the Penrose drain down to the mediastinum.
We then fashioned an anastomosis using a side-to-side technique making holes in the esophagus and a stomach graft well below where the end of it was.
The nasogastric tube was then switched to the stomach and extra amounts of esophagus and stomach were then divided with another application of the [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler.
The neck was closed with 3-0 Vicryl placed to the deeper layers and staples for the skin.
We then attempted to replace the jejunostomy which had only been out for several hours, and I found it difficult to do so and it did not slide in easily which was extremely surprising.
The plan is for a tube study and potentially a tube replacement under fluoroscopic guidance with contrast following the surgical procedure.
The patient was then extubated and sent to the surgical intensive care unit in satisfactory condition, after tolerating the procedure well.
DRAINS:  One #28 chest tube to the chest, 1 [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain to the neck.
COMPLICATIONS:  Inability to replace jejunostomy tube.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-8-17**] 10:53 PM  Reason: ccvl pulled back  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with esophageal CA s/p esophagectomy REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ccvl pulled back CLINICAL INDICATION: Central line pulled back.
FINDINGS: There is a right internal jugular catheter with distal tip projecting over the distal SVC.
NG tube is visualized with distal tip over the proximal fundus, recommend advancement.
A right-sided chest tube again seen with tip projecting over the lateral right mediastinum.
Surgical staples again seen over the left neck region.
Surgical staples again seen over the upper abdomen.

case discussed with dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] PROCEDURE: Exchange of percutaneous jejunostomy tube.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 58-year-old man status post laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy with dysfunctional jejunostomy tube.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Utilizing usual aseptic precautions, the patient's jejunostomy tube was accessed.
Contrast was instilled by way of the jejunostomy tube outlining the distal segment of the tube within the jejunum.
Subsequently, the J- tube was removed over the guide wire leaving the guide wire in situ.
A new, Ultrathane Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**] 35 cm long x 12 French jejunostomy tube was delivered over the wire.
Subsequent to satisfactory positioning, the catheter was sutured to the skin using a single retention suture of 2-0 silk.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.
ANESTHESIA: 1% Xylocaine, 5 cc local infiltration at the skin entry site.
IMPRESSION: Status post over the wire exchange of jejunostomy tube replacement with Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**] 35 cm x 12 French jejunostomy tube.

The patient is status post esophagectomy and pull-through.
Surgical subcutaneous clips still seen overlying the left apical mediastinal area.
During the latest interval, the right-sided chest tube and the right internal jugular approach central venous line have been removed.
No new pulmonary abnormalities after removal of tubes and line.
Brief Hospital Course: There were no intra-operative complications and he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit with a foley catheter, right sided chest tube, nasogastric tube, jejunostomy feeding tube, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drainage tube.
Post-operatively he was managed by the general surgical team and thoracic surgery team.
He required intravenous fluid bolussing for low urine output and mild hypotension; a Levophed drip was also started which he was weaned off successfully.
He was started on beta-blockade at this time.
His desaturation improved with aggressive pulmonary toileting.
On POD 4 his jejunostomy tube was noted to be leaking when his tube feeds were started, it was found to be mal-positioned under fluoroscopy and was re-positioned in Interventional Radiology without difficulty.
On POD 4 he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, he remained afebrile and was oxygenating well on nasal cannula.
His chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate left sided pleural effusion with atelectasis, no pneumothorax; the thoracic service maintained the chest tube to wall suction.
On POD 5 he had +flatus, +bowel movement and a swallow study which demonstrated no leak from the surgery; his nasogastric tube was removed and his diet was advanced which he tolerated.
On POD 7 his abdominal incision was noted to be reddened without drainage, he was started on Kefzol which he will continue for five days.
At the time of discharge his pain was well controlled with oxycodone elixir, he remained afebrile and was tolerating both a clear liquid diet and tube feeds.
He received diet counseling from the nutrition department regarding his diet and will continue tube feeds at home.
He will follow-up in one to two weeks with the general surgery and thoracic surgery clinics.
