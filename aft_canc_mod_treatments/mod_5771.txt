Therefore he underwent enteroscopy on [**2188-2-15**], which demonstrated polyps in the stomach, body and fundus as well as blood in the duodenum and proximal jejunum.
He underwent additional studies including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and duodenoscopy on [**2188-2-19**], which demonstrated angiectasias in the second part of the duodenum, which was treated with thermal therapy.
Again thermal therapy was applied.
Thermal therapy was also applied to angiectasias in the second part of the duodenum.
Gastrointestinal lavage demonstrated 2 liters of normal saline with dark red material that was not fully cleared.
The patient therefore was taken to the Interventional Radiology Suite where he underwent angiography and embolization of the gastroduodenal and left gastric artery.
This embolization was performed after a heparin tissue plasminogen activator challenge did not result in any bleeding.
Basically the patient was afforded with serial transfusions to keep his hematocrit appropriate above 30 in light of his history of coronary artery disease.
His previous medications of Atenolol, Hydrochlorothiazide and Isordil will not be continued as an outpatient.
Tachycardia improved after volume resuscitation.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**] will be responsible for following up on the patient's hematocrit values and ordering transfusions as necessary.
