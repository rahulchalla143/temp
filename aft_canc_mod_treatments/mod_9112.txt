ENCEPHALOPATHY:  Multiple possible explanations for encephalopathy were pursued; first of all for a question of dehydration the patient was given intravenous fluids.
The patient was also given a bowel regimen to help bowel movement which the patient did on the day after admission.
The patient's encephalopathy and gait disturbance seemed most likely consistent with irradiation somnolence syndrome, especially given his terminal status for his Boron neutron capture therapy.
As possible treatment for encephalopathy and gait disturbance, the patient was started on Sinemet.
The patient was also started on Ritalin on [**9-17**] and the patient was continued on Sinemet for the duration of his admission.
The Ritalin was increased from 5 mg twice a day to 10 mg twice a day on [**9-21**] with little improvement in his alertness.
The patient was continued on heparin and then transitioned to warfarin for long-term anti-coagulation for pulmonary embolism.
After three days of warfarin 5 mg q. day and three days of warfarin 2.5 mg p.o.
q. day, the patient's INR was 2.9 on the morning of [**9-29**] and patient was continued on warfarin 2.5 mg q. day.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had increased serum glucose while on dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day; this was treated with NPH insulin in the morning and at bed time and a Regular insulin sliding scale based on fingerstick glucoses four times a day at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and at bed time.
At discharge, the patient was receiving 30 units NPH q. a.m.; 20 units NPH q. p.m., as well as a sliding scale coverage.
ANEMIA:  The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit from 37 to 30 while on heparin therapy.
The patient's hematocrit was subsequently increased to 36.
HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient also experienced a drop in platelets from 162 to 95.
The patient was found to be heparin antibody positive.
The patient was continued on heparin and the platelet count increased during this therapy and was above 200 at discharge.
SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
The patient was subtherapeutic on phenytoin 200 mg twice a day and this dose was increased to 300 mg twice a day on [**9-28**].
The patient received 300 mg of phenytoin p.o.
two times on [**9-29**] in an attempt to make his level therapeutic and will be continued on phenytoin 300 mg twice a day.
HYPERTENSION:  The patient's blood pressure was well controlled on Losartan 100 mg p.o.
The patient will be transferred to the airport with a right midline intravenous in place as well as a peripheral intravenous.
Protonix 40 mg once a day.
Colace 100 mg twice a day.
Nystatin Oral suspension 5 mg four times a day.
Sinemet 0.5 tablets twice a day.
Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o.
Bisacodyl 10 mg p.o., p.r.
Losartan 100 mg q. day.
Ritalin 10 mg twice a day.
Dexamethasone 8 mg p.o.
NPH insulin 30 units in the morning and 20 units in the evening per Regular insulin sliding scale.
Dilantin 300 mg twice a day.
Warfarin 2.5 mg q. h.s.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
