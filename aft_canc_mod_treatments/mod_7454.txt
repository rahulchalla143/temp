Cirrhotic liver with a large mass residing along the inferior right hepatic lobe, most likely representing hepatoma, although not fully characterized on non-contrast imaging.
Common hepatic arteriogram demonstrated right and left hepatic arterial branches, GDA and cystic arteries.
Gelfoam embolization was performed in these territories to near stasis.
Hospital course was notable for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU and eventual stabilization of bleeding after transfusion of 6 units of packed red cells and CT-guided gel foam embolization of hepatic artery branches.
Patient underwent cyberknife treatment here at [**Hospital1 18**] approximately 1 year ago & had been receiving sorafenib until recently when it was discontinued because of intractable nausea and vomiting.
In the setting of his acute HCC bleed (see below) and lack of remaining therapeutic options, palliative care discussions were held w/patient and family.
IR and transplant surgery were both consulted to consider interventional options for hemostasis.
Pain acutely worsened on [**2-18**], prompting additional 2 unit PRBC transfusion (for 6U total) and CT-guided embolization of 3 branches of his hepatic artery feeding his R hepatic lobe (where the offending HCC lesion was located).
#HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY Pt has hx hypertension but outpatient antihypertensive regimen unclear - had been previously prescribed labetolol, hydralazine and amlodipine but only script filled within past 5 months was amlodipine.
Stabilized w/SBPs ranging 140-160 with PO labetolol and hydralazine (thought to be home meds at the time).
Blood pressures were ultimately better controlled after achieving better control of pain and nausea and hydralazine was successfully weaned and labetolol dose decreased after pt started on home amlodipine 10 mg QD plus PRN ativan.
Required IV zofran, phenergan and ativan (plus aggressive bowel regimen).
Transitioned to SL/PO antiemetics prior to discharge, as pt will continue to require these meds on hospice at home.
Discharged with bowel medications to prevent further constipation while taking opiates for pain.
# GOUT Pt has history of gout previously treated with short-course PO prednisone.
Rheumatology consulted but did not perform joint aspiration or intra-articular steroid injection because patient refused given severity of other medical problems.
Lasix, aspirin, and valsartan were held in the setting of his bleed.
Later determined that pt was only taking ASA at home so lasix and valsartan were not restarted.
This was held on admission and started on a HISS in-house, with minimal insulin requirements.
Discharged on glyburide 5 mg QD.
Patient discharged with home hospice 2.
Control nausea/vomiting symptoms.
