Became hypotensive and had grossly positive UA in in setting of uretheral dilation for stricture and self-catheterization.
Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
Received IVF's and blood transfusion with recovery of blood pressure.
Switched off vancomycin after GS showed no gram positive organism.
Culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and switched to ciprofloxacin to complete 15 day course.
Foley was placed on admission.
Upon arrival to the floor, foley was removed with plan to bladder scan periodically and straigh cath as needed.
Patient did not tolerate plan as he complained of continuous 'leaking' with continued burning sensation.
After speaking with urology, chronic foley was placed until patient follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.
