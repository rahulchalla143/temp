He was given Morphine 2.5mg IV with improvement in his pain; he also received 2L IVF, Zofran and Clindamycin for ?
He also received 2L IVF for hypercalcemia.
He received 15 mg IV diltiazem and his blood pressure dropped to systolic BP of 80.
He was started on diltiazem gtt and transferred to ICU.
His shoulder and neck pain are well controlled as long as he does not move.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] has had multiple conversations with several pulmonary and oncology providers in the last several years recommending tissue biopsy and bone marrow biopsy; but he refused on multiple occasions.
Noted to have LAD in [**2172**]; at that time Heme-Onc was concerned for primary lung cancer versus a potential lymphoma, less likely melanoma, and recommended a bone marrow biopsy and a surgical biopsy, both of which Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] declined.
The patient has refused biopsy and therefore is not eligible for any potential treatments for this presumed malignancy  Past Medical History: melanoma excised from his right thumb removed in [**2172**], no pathology report COPD Bullous skin disease followed by Dermatology HTN CVA s/p R CEA  Social History: Lives alone.

There is the possibility of internal aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 79 year-old gentleman with history of melanoma, presumptive squamous cell lung cancer with CXRay revealing enlargening cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents, and known osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions in the T-spine most likely from metastases presenting with pain, malaise, and falls at home, transferred to ICU for a. fib with RVR which resolved with amiodarone.
All three factors likely resulted in his AMS, with resolution after decrease of his fentanyl patch, treatment and resolution of his hypercalcemia, and discontinuation of his home blood pressure medications.
In ER was started on diltiazem gtt but became hypotensive so was admitted to the MICU and started on an Amiodarone gtt with a loading dose.
Given the patient's goals of care and falls at home, anticoagulation was not pursued.
The patient may continue his aspirin 325 mg.  # Hypotension: Patient initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension (and Afib with RVR) which seemed to have developed in the setting of starting a Diltiazem drip.
Responded to IVF but reocurred later with amiodarone drip.
Did not require pressors during ICU stay.
His blood pressures were within normal limits throughout his stay off the multi-drug hypertension regimen he was on at home.
Initiating medications for htn should be discussed with the patient.
# Pain: Patient with increasing pain of his shoulders and neck, receiving increasing doses of fentanyl patches without adequate relief.
Started on standing tylenol and contact[**Name (NI) **] PCPs office who confirmed home fentanyl patch had recently been uptitrated to 50mcg/hr Q72hrs.
RN at PCPs office said that patient had increasing issues with confusion and falls on this higher dose and they were concerned that it was too much narcotic for him.
In MICU pt placed on fentanyl patch at 25mcg/hr and given PRN oxycodone for breakthrough.
Given the patient's desire to avoid confusion and his adverse reaction to higher doses of fentanyl beyond his current dose of 25 mcg/hr, the patient was placed on standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch.
He should also be given ibuprofen 200-400 mg Q4-6h prn for pain before being given oxycodone as his renal function tolerates.
Notably, the patient's focus is on having clear mentation over pain control, so care should be taken before administering the low dose opiates.
The patient has past sputum cytology with highly atypical squamous cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma which in setting of appearence on imaging and hypercalcemia is most consistent with lung cancer.
Pt was given NS for this with improvement.
The patient was given pamidronate 60 mg on [**6-7**] with improvement in calcium, 9.9 on discharge.
Pamidronate can be repeated as needed at least a week after initial dose.
Subsequent diuresis was held with improvement of his creatinine to 1.3 at discharge.
Thus, if diuresis is initiated for his swelling, it should be done carefully and gingerly with close eye on renal function.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Patient with 2+ swelling of lower extremities.
The patient was tried on two doses of IV lasix with improvement in volume status but worsened renal function.
#Hypertension, benign: Patient with history of poorly controlled hypertension on six anti-hypertensives.
Pt with excellent blood pressure control despite all medications being discontinued.
He does not wish to take any htn meds and wants to keep his medical list simple.
Continued on homoe spiriva  #CVA s/p R CEA: Continue aspirin and lipitor  #Code Status: DNR/DNI - emphasis on quality of life and limiting procedures.

This resolved with decrease of fentanyl dose back to your previous dose and improvement of your calcium with a drug called a bisphosphonate.
This improved with medications and resolved and did not occur again.
