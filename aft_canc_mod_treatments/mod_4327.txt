MRI HEAD [**4-3**]: FINDINGS: Given differences in technique, there has been no significant interval change in size of the large 7.5 x 5.2 x 5.2 cm right hemispheric mass resulting in severe mass effect with approximately 13 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
There is near-complete effacement of the right lateral ventricle with dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
Additional findings in the posterior left temporal lobe are of unclear significance, though more likely represent a small volume of blood products rather than an additional enhancing lesion as detailed above.
Expected post-operative changes after partial resection of right frontal and temporal lobe mass, including fluid and gas within the resection bed as well as pneumocephalus.
There is marked mass effect and continued subfalcine herniation.
Evolution of a right MCA territorial infarct, posterior to the resection cavity.
