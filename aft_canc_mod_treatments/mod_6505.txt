Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 80151**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2195-12-1**] for Right thoracotomy, right lower lobe sleeve lobectomy, anastomosis of right middle lobe bronchus to bronchus intermedius, intercostal muscle flap, therapeutic bronchoscopy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
On [**2195-12-3**] he developed large amounts of subcutaneous emphysema.
His chest tube was discontinued on [**2195-12-9**], but he continued to have persistent airleak out of the posterior chest tube.
He developed afib with RVR on [**2195-12-10**], treated with IV lopressor and eventually diltiazem gtt.
On [**2195-12-11**] he had bronchoscopy for worsened airleak and subcutaneous emphysema, revealing an anastomotic leak at 2oclock position.
His atrial fibrillation stopped after amiodarone drip and oral dosing.
This was sealed with fibrin glue.
On [**2195-12-20**] he went to the OR for Flexible bronchoscopy, instillation of surgical plug (Surgisis collagen matrix), instillation of fibrin glue, and stent placement (Ultraflex covered 30 x 14 mm) from the right mainstem bronchus to the right upper lobe bronchus.
He recovered on the floor, then on [**2195-12-24**] required another trip to the OR for re-do thoracotomy, lysis of adhesions, closure of bronchopleural fistula and reinforcement of closure withpericardium, thymic fat pad and intercostal muscle.
Latest cultures were all negative and antibiotics stopped [**2195-12-24**].
He developed cdif which flagyl was started [**2195-12-25**] and clinically he improved.
He did have another 12 hour incident of atrial fibrillation on [**2195-12-27**] which resolved after amiodarone IV loading.
After discussion with cardiology, it was determined his [**Country **] score was low enough that he would be fine with just aspirin 325mg, amiodarone taper and outpatient follow up with cardiology.
He was cleared for regular diet and thin liquids by speech and swallow, but with crushed pills.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] deemed the patient stable for discharge home with home PT as recommended by PT.
His right thoractomy site was intact and sutures removed [**2195-12-29**] with steristrips placed for reinforcement on day of discharge.
