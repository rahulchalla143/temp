We found that you had a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas, which had blocked your gallbladder and led to cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts).
# We performed a cholecystostomy, where we placed a tube through your skin and into the gallbladder to open and drain it.
You still have the tube on your left side.
# Because we found that your kidneys were failing, we placed a temporary hemodialysis catheter, which we later changed to a permanent hemodialysis catheter, so that we could start you on hemodialysis.
# We performed several sessions of hemodialysis for you.
We also started you on antibiotics for your gallbladder infection (cholecystitis) and the urinary tract infection that you developed while you were here.
You completed this course of antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam).
The dermatologist took a punch biopsy of this mole, and we set up an appointment to have your sutures removed and to follow up on the pathology.
We prescribed mupirocin ointment and instructed you to follow up with your primary care doctor.
We have started some new medications for you, and changed some medications: .
# For constipation: --Take lactulose 30ml twice daily as needed for constipation.
# For pain: --Take gabapentin 200mg by mouth after hemodialysis.
# For your hypertension:  Because you are receiving hemodialysis, you do not need to take furosemide or diltiazem anymore for your hypertension.
This dermatology office has the pathology results of your skin biopsy.
