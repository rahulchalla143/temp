HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection one year ago, inferior vena cava thrombosis secondary to his carcinoma who was initially admitted to the Orthopedic Service of [**Hospital1 69**] for surgical evaluation of his T10 lytic lesion and mild to moderate cord compression.
The patient was started on Decadron for his mild to moderate cord compression and went to the Operating Room after his Coumadin was reversed with fresh frozen plasma for attempted tumor debulking and vertebral stabilization procedures.
This procedure was complicated by a large hemorrhage of up to 20 units of packed red blood cells and no tumor debulking was done at this time because of the large bleeding, however, a T8 to T10 fusion was performed.
The patient then spent some time in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on clindamycin postoperatively and had an MRI guided embolization procedure of the T10 intercostal artery to attempt a reduction in blood loss for future planned surgeries and spinal stabilization.
The patient returned to the Operating Room on [**3-2**] and underwent a T9-10 laminectomy and T7 to T12 fusion with allograft and local autograft complicated by five unit blood loss.
He was then transferred to the Medicine Service for evaluation and management of his diarrhea.
Hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection in [**2185-2-21**].
Caudate lobectomy was performed.
Chronic pleural effusion status post pleurodesis in [**2185-5-23**].
History of DIC status post caudate lobectomy.
ALLERGIES:  Oxacillin which causes a rash.
Hydralazine 10 mg IV q.
Nadolol 80 mg p.o.
Famotidine 20 mg p.o.
Levoxyl 100 mg p.o.
Topamax 75 mg p.o.
This is a 38-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection one year ago, inferior vena cava thrombosis, who was admitted with T10 lytic lesion with mild to moderate spinal cord compression by soft tissue mass status post spinal column stabilization by Orthopedic Surgery complicated by large blood loss transferred to the Medicine Service for management of profuse watery diarrhea.
Diarrhea:  The patient's diarrhea occurred two days postoperatively in the setting of him receiving clindamycin postoperatively.
The patient, however, was still maintained on Flagyl 500 IV t.i.d.
The patient had a rectal tube placed for decompression and close monitoring of his diarrhea volume as well as an NG tube placed to decompress his concomitant ileus.
The patient was started on octreotide 100 mg subcu t.i.d.
He is currently being continued on his octreotide 100 subcu t.i.d.
T10 lesion/spinal cord compression:  The patient was admitted initially for management of his spinal cord compression from T10 soft tissue mass.
Because of the initial large blood loss in his surgery, a resection of the mass could not be performed on his initial surgery and his spinal column was fused and reinforced with metal rods.
The patient underwent radiation therapy times one of his mass at T10.
He was then restarted on steroids which had been stopped postoperatively.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
The patient is currently being continued on steroids and it is anticipated he will undergo resuming his radiation therapy to the T10 spine on [**3-23**] which is Thursday.
This is about ten days after his latest surgery to allow for wound healing.
He was given NG tube decompression for a week.
As his NG tube output diminished from over one liter a day to about 300 cc per day the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-16**].
It was thought that his ileus was secondary to postoperative state, cord compression, narcotic analgesics and immobility.
He was encouraged to get out of bed to chair with the help of Physical Therapy at least once a day, to decrease his narcotic analgesic at this time.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Because of his large secretory diarrhea, Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] has had large potassium and magnesium losses in his stool.
He, therefore, was on large volume potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus repletion while his diarrhea continued.
Nutrition:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] was placed on TPN after being NPO for six days while having his diarrhea and ileus.
His anticoagulation is currently being held at this time secondary to his large blood losses during surgery and hematoma that is seen on the latest CT scan.
Pleural effusions:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] has a history of developing pleural effusions status post his liver resection one year ago.
The patient is status post pleurodesis at that time.
He is continued at this time on intravenous Lopressor and intravenous hydralazine as he cannot take p.o.'s.
He will be restarting his radiation therapy in one week's time on [**3-23**] as per [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41224**], Radiation Oncology Fellow.
A question of whether he will be eligible for palliative chemotherapy in the future and this will be deferred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Urinary tract infection:  The patient developed a urinary tract infection with Klebsiella oxytoca and E. coli in the setting of a Foley catheter.
The Foley catheter was changed and he was started on a seven day course of Levaquin.
Hematologic:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] had large volume blood loss of 20 units during his initial surgeries and had transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets as well.
He has a history of thrombocytopenia in the setting of some mild portal hypertension status post his caudate liver resection.
Prophylaxis:  Currently instituting subcu heparin, V-boots and patient out of bed with Physical Therapy to chair with frequent turning, H2 blocker while on steroids.
He will likely need outpatient XRT and for follow up with Radiation Oncology, Oncology, Orthopedics and Liver Service.
