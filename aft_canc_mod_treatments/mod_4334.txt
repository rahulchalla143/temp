She was admitted here from [**Date range (1) 85266**] for constipation, thought to be due to chronic narcotic use (fentanyl patches, dilaudid pca, tramadol, and oxycodone in recent past) for her multiple myeloma pain.
She was started on an aggressive bowel regimen and oral naloxone.
She received Zofran for nausea.
An NG tube was placed with 700cc of bilious output.
A CT was done, and she was started on heparin gtt for a R common femoral vein DVT.
Diagnosed approximately one and a half years ago, and has been treated with velcade/bortezomib and dexamethasone.
She has significant pain and is on chronic narcotics.

Large destructive lesion in the left humeral head extending into the diaphysis of the humerus as well as large external soft tissue component as described above.
#Nausea and Vomiting: The abdominal CT revealed no mechanical obstruction; her ileus was presumed to be due to the high dose of narcotics she was on for her bone pain.
When she ultimately transitioned to standing tylenol for her pain, her PO remained poor.
A double lumen PICC was placed on [**9-4**] and TPN was started.
TPN will continue and should be adjusted based on daily chem 10s by nutrition.
She was started on heparin gtt.
Her lovenox was held on [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] out of concern for a LGIB (?
#Pain Control: On admission she had a 100mcg/hr fentanyl patch on her arm dated [**2134-8-17**].
In an attempt to decrease her potential for narcotic-related ileus, the patch was not replaced; she was placed on oxycodone for pain.
A 50mcg/hr fentanyl patch was placed.
However, her ileus persisted, and she was transitioned to standing tylenol with ultram for breakthrough (which she had been on before) with good response.
Her fentanyl patch and oxycodone were again discontinued; she was left on standing tylenol.
Ultram was written for breakthrough pain, but she did not require it.
Rad-onc and heme-onc were consulted for palliative radiation and chemotherapy, in an effort to wean her off pain meds.
It was felt that she currently is not a good candidate for more aggressive chemotherapy given her clinical status and ongoing medical issues.
The plan on discharge was to continue TPN to improve the patients nutritional status/strength and the family would like time to see how she progresses and get ongoing further treatment options.
#Hypertension: On admission her BP was 122/64 and she was continued on her home medications of metoprolol, amlodipine and lasix.
Her lasix and amlodipine was held on [**8-21**] after a BP of 99/38 and poor PO intake.
Her metoprolol was continued given her a.fibb and the dose was adjusted to keep her BP stable and HR under control.
#[**Month/Year (2) 2320**]: She was hypoglycemic on the floor initially, requiring dextrose 50% and glucagon per hypoglycemia protocol.
She was subsequently started on Lantus 6U qhs with ISS.
Because she was on lovenox and noted to have dark maroon stools, it was suspected that she had a LGIB.
Subsequently noted to have ecchymotic perianal tissue, described as 2 small open areas at 3 and 7 o'clock, also 0.2 cm pink ulcer on large external hemorrhoid.
Recommended gentle foam cleaner and dry patting.
Dermatology was consulted, and recommended nystatin and zinc oxide for suspected contact vs irritant dermatitis.
Her metoprolol was increased to 25mg TID.
She was given IVF and her metoprolol was increased to 37.5mg TID.
An echo showed moderate LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%), increased LV filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), and no evidence of R ventricular strain or wall motion abnormalities.
Rate control was obtained with metoprolol 12.5mg PO QID.
Cardiology was consulted, recommended medical management.
ASA and statin were started, as she was already on lovenox and metoprolol at the time.
The ASA and lovenox were held on [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] out of concern for a LGIB (?
Lisinopril was started given low EF.
Pt was not taking in much PO; and given diffuse anasarca trial of Lasix was done (20mg IV on [**9-6**]) which she responded to well.
She should continue to get Lasix as needed.
A foley was placed (rather than having to repeatedly straight cath her given her periurethral lesion), and she had adequate UOP following IVF.

Your Metoprolol was changed to help control the heart rate.
You were seen by the cardiology team and started on new medications to help manage this.
You were also not eating very well during your hospitalization and the decision was made with your family to begin nutrition through an IV, called TPN.
You will continue TPN until you get your strength back and your nausea improves enough for you to eat by mouth.
