The patient was initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics including amp, cipro, flagyl which were eventually D/C given no evidence for infectious etiology of hypotension.
Per MICU team, discussion with Onc attending revealed that patient was likely not a candidate for further treatment at this time.
He was covered with antibiotics in the Micu, but did not exhibit infection.
On the floor the patient remained normotensive and eventally a low dose beta-blocker was added given his recent NSTEMI which he tolerated well.
Patient would likely ultimately benefit from addition of an ACE inhibitor as pressures allow.
Per cardiology, the patient was medically managed with ASA, Plavix, and statin without plan for acute intervention given the [**Hospital 228**] medical comorbidities.
Given his hypotension and bleed a beta-blocker and heparin drip were held.
However, multiple co-morbidities may defer further evaluation or invasive procedures regardless.
Patient is currently on Toprol XL with normal heart rates.
Patient was not initiated on anti-coagulation given Hct drop, and hypotension earlier this admission.
Consideration towards initiation of anti-coagulation should be performed as an outpatient after acute illness resolved with consideration towards embolic risk as well as malignancy and recent bleeding event, although this likely occurred in the setting of surgical procedure.
