CXR: showed signiifcant pulmonary edema, placed on BiPAP for respiratory status with good relief and increase in saturation to 100%.
Pt was tried on dopamine but developed chest pain and ishemic EKG changes (ST depressions) so was transitioned to phenylephrine at [**Location (un) 620**] ED.
There was discussion of intubation but was not initiated secondary to concern for further BP drop and improvement with BiPap.
He was given cefepime and flagyl in the ED.
A central line was placed and levophed was continued.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p RCA stent placement (at VA), followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5858**] - transfusion dependent MDS dignosed in [**2144**], gets 2 u RBCs every week, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10919**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] - Hyperlipidemia - Gout - HTN - dCHF (EF of 55%)   Social History: - Patient is retired, used to run the electronic department at [**University/College **] Coop.

Catheter of an accessed right chest wall port terminates in the right ventricl   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male with transfusion dependant MDS, severe AS and dCHF per echo in [**2145**], CAD s/p PCA X 2 in [**2139**] who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, as well as two episodes of chest pain, found to be in septic shock with MSSA bacteremia.
He was subsequently transitioned to a levophed gtt and given Vanc, Cefepime, Levaquin and flagyl given his immunocompromised state.
His antibiotics were narrowed to Nafcillin (initially) and levaquin (covering for pneumonia).
He had a PICC line placed on [**2-20**] for long term antibiotics.
Will need repeat TTE at end of course of therapy per ID recommendations (to be arranged by ID).
He will also need repeat blood cultures following his antibiotic course prior to replacing his port ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] RN).
Nafcillin was stopped on [**2-20**] due to concern of thrombocytopenia, and he was instead discharged on cefazolin 2gm q8hr to complete a 4 week course.
He was trialed on metoprolol and esmolol gtt, but both caused profound hypotension and bradycardia and were therefore discontinued.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended not treating his atrial fibrillation given his hemodynamic stablility and in the setting of acute illness.
He was not considered to be a candiate for anticoagulation given his severe MDS.
His aspirin was continued and a beta blocker was restarted.
We restarted lasix 40 mg po on transfer to medical floor and at times gave him additional PO/IV lasix for goal net negative 1L per day.
At that time, please reassess and if appears euvolemic consider down-titrating dose to 40mg daily (home dose prior to hospitalization) and may consider uptitrating as well if still volume overloaded.
Creatinine and lytes should be checked regularly and lasix dose adjusted accordingly.
He reports that this has been a long-standing issue and takes nitroglycerin PRN at home.
He was also given one unit of PRBCs on [**2-21**] and one unit on prior to discharge on [**2-22**].
Wound care recommendations are: Irrigate ulcer with wound cleanser set to stream and pat dry No Sting barrier wipe to periwound tissue, allow to dry fill wound with aquacel ag rope followed by dry gauze secure with Medipore H soft cloth tape change daily.
Due to MDS, patient often bleeds with each dressing change and will need direct pressure to be applied after dressing change.
He may also need his dressing to be changed more frequently than daily if it becomes saturated.
