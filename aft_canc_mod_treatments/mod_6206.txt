No intervention was performed - continued biliary diversion using the existing 8Fr PTBD.
Patient had prior hemihepatectomy in [**2167**] for metastatic ocular melanoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 46F with metastatic ocular melanoma recently treated with ipilimumab presenting for evaluation of a soft tissue mass in the right lung base associated with fatigue and chills.
Recent hospitalization at [**Hospital 63985**] Medical Center in [**State 1727**] for fevers and GIB [**Date range (1) 81838**], treated with IV antibiotics and red cell transfusions.
She was treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin at an outside hospital from [**Date range (3) 81838**] with resolution of fevers.
Vancomycin and levofloxacin were restarted and blood/urine/sputum/stool cultures were ordered.
She had IR quided drainage on [**9-11**] w 30 cc pus removed.
She then had a chest tube placement with washout by thoracic surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2171-9-13**].
She produced significant bilious output from this chest tube over the proceeding days.
Ultimately, she [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] placement of a percutaneous transhepatic catheter (PTC) into her biliary tree.
This intervention significantly reduced the volume of output via the chest tube and improved her cough as well.
Her chest tube will be slowly withdrawn over a series of visits with the thoracic surgery department.
A CT prior to departure demonstrated partial resolution of her biliary-pleural fluid collection.
Antibiotic recommendations for this infected fluid collection were tailored according to ID recommendations.
She was initially treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, and micafungin.
Vancomycin was later discontinued and she was discharged on vancomycing, ceftazidime, and metronidazole.
The duration of treatment with these agents remains unclear and will likely continue while her sub-pleural collection continues to drain via the existing chest tube.
This was most likely secondary to her peri-septic state, and completely improved following fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
C.diff colitis was ruled out with PCR assay.
ASA and Plavix were discontinued.
Her anti-diarrheal agents were optimized as below, with some improvement.
Her albumin improved throughout her hospitalization as her nutrition improved and fluid overload was corrected.
Patient's prior hospitalization in [**State 1727**] due to upper GI bleed is suspicious for autoimmune colitis secondary to ipilumumab toxicity.
Her biliary-pleural fistula is potentially related to metastatic melanoma, but insufficient tissue was able to biopsied during her IR procedures.
She received ocular prednisolone throughout her stay.
Final decisions on whether to resume this regimen will be made after this acute process resolves.

You had a chest tube placed to drain this collection from your lung, and then had a drain placed into your liver to drain the bile.
You also received intravenous antibiotics for this collection, as it proved to be infected.
You will continue these antibiotics via your PICC line.
You will need to follow-up with the hepatobiliary surgery team for management of your biliary drain (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
You will need to follow-up with the infectious disease clinic for management of your antibiotics (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7443**].
Finally, you will need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for management of your chemotherapy.
Upon discharge, please call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 20641**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13016**] or present to your local ER if you experience any of the following: fever, chills, chest pain, worsening cough productive of bile, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, worsening diarrhea, bloody or dark colored bowel movements, increasing extremity swelling, or any other symptoms that concern you.
Once discharged, you should have the chest tube flushed once per day with 20ml of normal saline.
Record the output of your biliary drain (PTC) daily.
Please take all medications only as prescribed.
