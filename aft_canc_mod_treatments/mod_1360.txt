However, after aggressive fluid resuscitation the pt developped significant respiratory distress.
Given persistent O2 requirement, CTA checked on [**7-26**] which demonstrated no PE, but "diffuse predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia; the differential diagnosis would include pulmonary edema from ARDS," and moderate b/l effusions.
Pt was started on levofloxacin for empirical coverage on [**7-27**].
Pt triggered on the floor for resp rate>30 & sats down to low 80s, she was started on a NRB and sats came up to high 80s.
CXR showed evidence of new pulm edema, pt was given lasix 20 mg iv x3 and had good urine out-put though repeat cxr showed worsened edema.
Pt had significant difficulty weaning and was eventually started on high dose steroids for treatment of possible BOOP/ARDS or eosinophilic pna.
Pt did well on the floor, her PO intake improved and TPN was discontinued.
Her abd pain was well controlled with PO pain medications and was not limiting intake.
Pt was followed by pulmonology and they recommended a four week steroid taper as well as follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] in [**Hospital **] clinic.
Pt was discharged in stable condition with plan of VNA services to help with home pain medications.
Insulin regimen was d/c'd per PCP recommendations and pt will be followed closely in the next few weeks by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**].
