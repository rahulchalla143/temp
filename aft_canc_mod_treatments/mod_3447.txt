Note is also made of a stent running from the common duct down, presumably towards the duodenum.
During this course, she was treated with xeloda in an attempt to gain control over her malignancy, improve comfort and to reduce ascites.
# Abdominal distension: Repeated re-accumulation of ascitic fluid due to portal hypertension and peritoneal studding.
She received a peritoneal drain port for symptomatic care.
Leukonostoc species and [**Female First Name (un) **] was cultured in ascitic fluid.
She was initially treated with linezolid and caspofungin, then azithromycin and fluconazole per ID.
Drainage of ascitic fluid resulted in large fluid shifts and resuccitation with IVF --> interstitial space edema.
# BLE EVT, PE: She presented initially with BLE DVT, bilateral moderate clot burden PE.
She had long course of vancomycin PO and no recent positive stool.
Cdiff toxin A neg x 3 and toxin B negative.
The diarrhea may have been partially a result of her chemotherapy.
She was given stool bulking agents for symptomatic care.
# Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: Before admission, she had undergone only one cycle of palliative chemotherapy because of her multiple complications.
She was started on capecitabine 1500mg PO BID in an attempt at palliative care and prolongation of her life for time with her family.
Her clinical state deteriorated despite treatment as above.
