Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 85 yo female with coronary artery disease status post PCI, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, breast cancer status post radical mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade status post pericardiocentesis left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
#Bilateral pleural effusion (left>right): The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a recurrence of her left sided pleural effusion leading to complete left lung collapse and hypoxemia, requiring intubation.
Thoracic surgery inserted a chest tube on the left and a pigtail catheter on the right which both drained serosanginous fluid.
The chest tube on the right was eventually pulled after it stopped draining.
The insertion of the chest tube on the left was complicated by a pneumothorax, so another chest tube was inserted on the left with a pigtail catheter.
The pigtail catheter eventually stopped draining and it was subsequently pulled.
A talc pleurodiesis was performed and the patient's pain was controlled with Dilaudid at first and then oxycodone thereafter.
Her chest tubes were removed and a chest xray confirmed full expansion of the left lung with an unchanged pleural effusion.
Diamox was added to the lasix regimen and her bicarbonate remained level.
While in the ICU, the patient was started on prednisone for a post-viral serositis.
The prednisone was eventually discontinued after 5 days because the post-viral serositis was unlikely in this context.
Her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids boluses.
She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin/zosyn to cover hospital acquired pneumonia and the patient improved.
On [**11-11**], she was transfused two units of blood and tolerated it well.
With continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for BP management, the patient developed acute renal failure again.
Her diuresis was held and lisinopril discontinued.
#Urinary tract infection: The patient presented with a urinary tract infection and was treated with vanco/zosyn as detailed above.
She then developed yeast in her urine and her foley was removed.
Two days after her Foley was removed, she had a leukocytosis without fever or dysruia.
Treatment with Cipro was initiated and her leukocytosis trended downwards.
# Anxiety and Depression- Continue trazodone and ativan as needed.
The patient was noted to be anxious during the hospitalization and would consider further therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as an outpatient.
#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On admission, the patient was on amiodarone, metoprolol and coumadin.
Since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia (not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry) throughout hospitalization, it was felt the risks of Coumadin outweighed the benefits, therefore, she will not continue on Coumadin.
She will continue to take aspirin, metoprolol and amiodarone for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
#H/O hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia that has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone release.
She had a PICC line during the last hospitalization.
# Osteoporosis: Continue Vitamin D/Calcium .
