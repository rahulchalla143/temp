Brief Hospital Course: 54F with multiple myeloma s/p cytoxan, revlimid, velcade, decadron admitted for febrile neutropenia.
She was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
She was treated w/ vanc/cefepime, acyclovir and voriconazole.
Eventually antibiotics were discontinued and she remained afebrile.
It was originally thought that there may have been a pre-renal component due to reduced PO intake following chemotherapy.
She was given IVF hydration with limited improvement in her creatinine.
She was discharged with outpatient HD scheduled at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center at 11am on Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule.
She also underwent high dose cyclophosphamide followed by 3 doses of Velcade, although the fourth dose was held due to thrombocytopenia.
She then developed respiratory distress thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload with probable cardiac component (EF 40%, though this was poor quality on echo).
She was diuresed aggresively (with metolazone and lasix).
She was treated initially w/ clinda and primaquine for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this was d/c'd as CXR and O2 status showed interval improvement with diuresis.
She also started HD [**2-13**] which was felt to improve her mentation.
Patient was started on metoprolol but this was discontinued due to low blood pressures.
Pancytopenia: She required multiple units of platelets and PRBCs during this admission.
