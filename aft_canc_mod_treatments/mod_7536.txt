New small consolidation at right lung base may represent pneumonic consolidation or, in the setting of airway secretions, aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year-old M with high-grade cardiac lymphoma (left atrial mass), currently receiving treatment (cycle 4,day 15) with R-[**Hospital1 **] who presented from home with low-grade fevers and progressive dyspnea.
Given the possible RLL infiltrate on his chest CTA, he was initially empirically covered with IV vancomycin and zosyn for a possible PNA.
However, these antibiotics were discontinued the following morning as the RRVS came back positive for parainfluenza type 3 and the patient remained afebrile overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without a significant leukocytosis.
He was continued with supportive treatment for parainfluenza and continued on his home inhaler regimen given his history of COPD.
The patient also ruled in for a cardiac event (see below) with a decrease in his EF, which may have also contributed to his sensation of dyspnea; however, his films were not impressive for pulmonary edema.
# Positive Cardiac Biomarkers: On admission, pt with troponin to 0.23, CK 123, MB 16, and MBI 13.0.
He was started on a high dose statin, beta-blocker, full dose aspirin and heparin gtt.
Heparin gtt was continued mostly secondary to pt's akinetic distal LV rather than out of concern for ACS.
Cardiology also recommended anti-coagulation with coumadin for several weeks while the pt's EF recovers; however, this will need to be further discussed with the pt's primary oncology team.
Prior to discharge, he was started on toprol 200mg daily, simvastatin 80m g daily, and ASA 81mg daily.
# Cardiac lymphoma:  The patient appears to have had an excellent response to therapy to date, with a decline in his LDH and shrinkage of his cardiac mass on cardiac MRI.
He will be due for his 5th cycle of [**Hospital1 **] next week, and his ability to receive his chemotherapy safely will be determined by his recover from his present illness.
