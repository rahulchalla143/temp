However, late that evening, the pt was too weak to lift herself off of the toilet and fell into the tub.
Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
H/O paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- This was found when pt went to OSH for elective laminectomy on [**2128-8-24**].
At that time, pt was treated with amioadarone, sotalol, and cardioversion.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt is s/p a non Q wave MI in 09/[**2127**].
H/O acute mitral valve staph aureus endocarditis in the setting of a line sepsis during [**8-/2128**] hospital course.
Pt also had posterior annular abscess s/p debridement and patch.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia in [**9-/2128**] 8.

H/O GI bleed secondary to an AVM and/or portal hypertensive gastropathy as seen on EGD and colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in 01/[**2128**].
HEENT- NC AT.
A sepsis code was called, and she was evaluated and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further BP management.
Blood pressure- Initially, patient received dopamine, continous normal saline and pRBCs until BP stabilized.
She was weaned off pressors after three days and BP is well controlled.
She was empirically treated with levofloxacin, flagyl, ceftazidine and vancomycin.
These were all discontinued and she was started on Imipenem/cilastin on [**2-21**].
Her hematocrit was followed serially and eventually stabilized, at which point Coumadin was restarted in setting of heparin induced thrombocytopenia and [**Hospital3 9642**] mitral valve replacement.
Due to her history of St. Jude's valve, atrial fibrillation, and also a history of HIT, decision was made to start renally dosed Lepirudin while coumadin was held and INR was reversed.
Lepirudin was chosen over argatroban because of her underlying liver disease.
INR was lowered to 1.4 using vitamin K, and pt underwent successful ERCP and sphincterotomy with extraction of sludge on [**2-14**] after holding Lepirudin since midnight.
Lepirudin was re-started 6 hr post-ERCP after discussing the risk of post-procedure bleed and valve thrombosis with the ERCP fellow and a hematology fellow.
Patient was started on ampicillin since the admission and will complete a 14 day course for enteroccal bacteremia.
Diarrhea diminished over stay, was given oral Vancomycin emperically for C Diff, toxin A neg X 4, Toxin B sent, pending on [**3-4**] - will continue oral vanco emperically until this negative.
[**Hospital3 9642**] mitral valve- Pt is normally anticoagulated on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
As stated above, pt was bridged with Lepirudin peri-ERCP and Coumadin was re-started until therapeutic.
Depression- She was continued on citalopram.
