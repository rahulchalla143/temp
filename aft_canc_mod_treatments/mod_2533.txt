While awaiting this study, he received the following infusions: 6L NS IV, 4 units pRBCs, 1 units FFP, and 10mg vitamin K in order to reverse an INR of 2.4.
Due to a prior history of a transfusion reaction, he was pre -treated with diphenhydramine and transfused at a slower rate.
# Bradycardia/Syncope- His EKGs were initially concerning for a high-degree AV block, but review of the EKGs with the Cardiology service revealed atrial flutter with variable conduction (usually 3:1) as well as known PR prolongation.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: INR was supratherapeutic in setting of coumadin at presentation .Patient appears to have slow atrial flutter, per EP, and does not require EP intervention at this time.
Reversed with FFP and 10 vitamin K for EGD.
Being followed by PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 108**] with MRI and surgical referral.
# Diabetes: On metformin, saxaglipitin and Januvia at Home.
He was given insulin sliding scale while in house.
