She was extubated in the OR and transferred to the ICU for management of her atrial fibrillation, which required diltiazem drip.
Her course is described below by system:  Neuro: Pain was initially controlled with narcotics, however the patient had an episode of confusion after given IV ativan.
All narcotics and benzodiazepines were stopped and her pain was managed with tylenol thereafter.
The patient was transferred to the floor on HD#9, and the next day was found to have hemi-neglect of her right side, as well as mental status changes.
Vascular neurology service evaluation concluded that the patient had likely developed a seizure given that she had been off of her carbamazepine during her admission, and recommending restarting this home medication.
Since re-initiating her anti-seizure medications, she has done well with no clinical neurologic changes to her baseline status.
She was bridged on twice daily lovenox while on 0.5mg of coumadin daily (home dose coumadin 1mg M,W,F; 1.5mg T,Th); her coagulation profile prior to discharge was as follows: PT: 16.2  PTT: 55.1  INR: 1.5  CV: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation that is difficult to control at baseline per her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 109326**], rate control was attempted for her with emsolol and amiodarone with minimal effect.
She was ultimately well rate controlled on a diltiazem drip and IV metoprolol.
Her diltiazem dose was titrated accordingly; she was stable on 60mg qid of diltiazem PO and metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge to rehab.
GI: Patient was kept NPO until gas and stool were expelled from her ostomy (POD#6).
GU: A foley catheter was initially placed for accurate output monitoring, but this was removed on HD #11.
Heme: The patient is on long-term coumadin given her history of PE and thrombin mutation.
She was anticoagulated with a heparin drip [**Hospital1 **] due to her history of PE and thrombin mutation.
She did not require any blood transfusion.
She was bridged from heparin drip to lovenox/coumadin with an INR of 1.5 upon discharge with a goal INR of [**2-12**].
ID: Patient was continued on perioperative cipro and flagyl for 24 hours.
She was afebrile throughout her stay and did not require antibiotics upon discharge.
Amlodipine 10 mg daily 2.
Carbamazepine 20o mg [**Hospital1 **] 3.
Lipitor 10 mg daily 4.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg daily 5.
Lisinopril 40 mg daily 6.
Metoprolol 150 mg daily 8.
Coumadin 1'  and 1 [**1-11**] Tues / [**Last Name (un) **] mg daily   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Small bowel obstruction  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a partial small bowel obstruction and initially underwent conservative management with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-gastric tube.
Despite this, however, your pain did not resolve, thus you underwent a small intestinal bypass and removal of an enterolith within your small intestine.
You have tolerated a regular diet while on oral pain medications, and your heart rate is controlled with oral diltiazem and metoprolol.
You were also resumed on your coumadin, but because your INR is not within a goal of [**2-12**] yet, you were bridged with a subcutaneous lovenox shots (twice daily), which you should take until your INR is at goal.
This was confirmed with both CT and MRI/MRA scans and was likely due to not receiving your carbamazepime (anti-epileptic) medication for several days.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2172**] home dose of clonazepam was not resumed secondary to concern that it may not have helped with sleep as originally prescribed and initially may have exacerbated your isolated seizure episode.
This incision can be left open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become irritated from clothing.
No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless instructed otherwise by your surgeon.
Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily.
