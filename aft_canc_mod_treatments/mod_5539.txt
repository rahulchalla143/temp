Past Medical History: Crohn's Disease, diagnosed in the 60's, s/p partial small bowel resection (20 cm), 20 years ago.
Hx of Herpes zoster, was on Neurontin until recently MVP Hx of infectious mononucleosis No cardiac history (last stress test < 1 year ago)  Social History: Quit smoking in [**2133**].
Markedly hypocellular bone marrow consistent with post-therapy myelo-ablation (see note) 2.
It resolved with sarna lotion and triamcinolone cream.
The decision was made to start high dose cytarabine on [**10-19**] because he had already been on tube feeds (for Crohn's) and would not want to take out the line and replace.
He tolerated HIDAC very well, and was started on GCSF to stimulate counts.
At discharge, the decision was made that he should readdress surgical options for Crohn's prior to receiving further chemotherapy.
He was placed on broad spectrum Abx and improved.
He was started on Vitamin K in his TPN with no improvement.
He was discharged from OSH on 20mg prednisone [**Hospital1 **] and upon admission to [**Hospital1 **], started a prednisone taper prior to chemotherapy.
On [**9-30**], he developed worsening abdominal pain and was started on high dose steroids with a rapid taper.
The bradycardia resolved following steroid taper.
He was then started on TPN and steroids ultimately at 10 mg QD.
It was felt that this could be prostatitis (given heterogenous appearance of prostate on CT) vs. prostate cancer, and he was started empirically on ciprofloxacin for prostatitis.
Discontinued lisinopril on [**10-7**] and not restarted at discharge as BP had been doing well without it.
