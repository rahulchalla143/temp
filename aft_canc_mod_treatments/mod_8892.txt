Admission Date:  [**2185-2-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-3-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-1-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, mitral valve replacement and was found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray in [**2184-4-27**].
During the initial part of the hospitalization the patient's Coumadin was discontinued.
After the procedure the patient did well until approximately 90 minutes later when she went into acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure.
Rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve replacement in [**2167**].
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Both oncology, radiation oncology and CT surgery were consulted for recommendations on treatment options.
Radiation oncology felt that the mass was too large to receive radiation for treatment, however the patient could receive radiation for palliative reasons, perhaps to improve compression on large airways which may improve her respiratory function.
Neither the oncology service nor the cardiac thoracic surgery service felt that there was any definitive treatment that could be done to significantly improve the patient's mortality.
She was continued on mechanical ventilation for her entire Intensive Care Unit stay until the last day.
She was also given inhalers for bronchodilation for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She did not require any other nodal agents for rate control.
The patient was maintained on anticoagulation for an artifical valve.
