The patient had a slow hematocrit drop over the next week requiring frequent blood transfusions.
She was treated with an octreotide drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible [**Last Name (un) **].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in [**6-15**] by biopsy, hepatitis C virus, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, hemorrhoids/rectal varices, portal hypertension, hypertension, diastolic CHF, CAD, status post MI times 2, diverticulosis, colonic angiodysplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, arthritis, gout, hyperlipidemia, status post cholecystectomy, status post melanoma resection [**2140**].
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, captopril, Lipitor, Protonix, Lasix 40 mg a day, nifedipine, and Darvocet.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Include propranolol 20 mg b.i.d., captopril 75 mg t.i.d., nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d., Imdur 30 mg q.d.
She was followed with serial hematocrits and underwent an endoscopy.
She was continued on an octreotide drip for 24 to 48 hours further and it was felt that she was not a candidate for TIPS at this time.
She was treated with beta- blockers and nitrates to reduce portal hypertension and had no further active bleeding throughout her stay.
She felt that although her hepatoma had slightly increased in size, she felt it was asymptomatic and her variceal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension, cirrhosis, as well as a history of coronary artery disease and flash pulmonary edema were much more significant medical problems that were negatively impacting her health and that these would greatly increased the likelihood of complications if any tumor-directed therapy was attempted.
It was felt that if she was stable for few weeks, then a consideration of radiofrequency ablation would be made.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Include variceal/portal hypertension, hypertensive bleed, hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertension.
Her major surgical procedure is an endoscopy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include propranolol 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d., nifedipine 20 mg p.o.
q.8h., lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., sucralfate 1 g p.o.
q.i.d., isosorbide mononitrate sustained release 60 mg q.d., Lasix 40 mg q.d., and Protonix 40 mg q.12h.
