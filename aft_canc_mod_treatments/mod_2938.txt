She has recently had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis seven months ago and suffered a postoperative pulmonary embolism from this.
This required anticoagulation for a six month period, which was just stopped one week prior to this operation after consultation with her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Furthermore, cytology from and endoscopic ultrasound showed mucin and suspicious cells for atypia.
Past Medical History: Pulmonary embolus Pancreatic Mass Diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection hypertension Hypercholesterolemia polymyalgia rheumatica osteoparthirtis back pain/radiculopathy s/p left breats biopsy C-section x2 Cholecystectomy  Social History: The patient lives alone, in an a bulding with elevators.
The patient uses a cane for ambulation.
Focal atrophy of adjacent pancreas, and dilation of pancreatic duct.
The patient had an uneventful operative procedure, with approximate blood loss of 500cc and the patient received 8400 cc of crystalloid resuscitaiton and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
She recieved stress steroids and received a rapid taper given her history of taking chronic steroids.
She had some uncontrolled hypertension that required a nitrogycerine drip postoperatively.
This was weaned and the patient recieved intermittend intravenous lopressor for blood pressure control.
Her urine output was marginal and her vital signs were unreliable as a predictor because she was under beta blockade.
Given these findings, we were concerned for a postoperative bleed especially given her steroid dependence.
She had an exploratory laparatomy and evacuatoin of a hematoma.
Her protonix was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing, she was given a lavage which became clear after 350 cc, and was transfused 2 units.
TPN was started given her poor nutritional status and the aforementioned events.
Her hematocrit dropped to 25 again on postoperative day [**9-10**], and she was transfused an additional 2 units of packed redblood cells.
She did have increased dark blood output from her NG tube opn this day, and given her ongoing upper GI bleed, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring on [**1-1**] (POD [**10-12**]).
It was decided not to scope the patient given the recent surgery and risk of damage to the anastamoses.
She was started on a protonix drip and serial hematocrits were monitored.
She remained hemodynamically stable and her output from her NG tube ceased.
The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on post op days 13/9.
She was given full liquids on post op day 14/10, and advanced to a regular diet and oral medications by post operative days 15/11.
