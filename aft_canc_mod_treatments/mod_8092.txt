Of note patient was treated for pneumonia with levaquin initially but was broadened to zosyn for better GNR coverage and discharged on Augmentin which he is still currently taking.
His course was also complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and continued hypoxia for which he was discharged on supplemental O2.
Patient was sent directly to Cath lab from ED where a pericardiocentesis was performed and 750cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed.
Patient given 30mg IV Ketorolac x1 on arrival to CCU.

# Pericardial Effusion: Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] remained hemodynamically stable in ED prior to pericardial drain without evidence of tamponade based on TTE, though pulses was initially 16.
Pericardial drain was left in place for roughly 48 hours.
Repeat TTE after removal of drain showed no further accumulation of pericardial fluid.
Gram Stain initially showed GPCs but lab later clarified that this may have been misread and may be debris; culture results negative to date, but patient had been on augmentin for pneumonia prior to pericardial fluid cultures, so 16S PCR was sent from pericardial fluid and is still pending.
With question of GPCs in pericardial fluid, he was started on Vancomycin to cover for potential MRSA; augmentin was switched to IV ceftriaxone to cover for strep pneumo.
# Pericarditis Pain was controlled initially with IV toradol and IV narcotics.
On discharge, he was given colchicine and oxycodone.
Had episode of RVR while on CT surgery service in setting of para-pneumonic effusion and pericardial effusion.
Patient was seen by Thoracic Surgery during this hospitalization who felt that he was stable and could follow up as an outpatient two weeks after discharge.
Metformin was not started on discharge because it can theoretically interact with levofloxacin to cause hypoglycemia, and patient has no glycometer at home yet.
PCP to start metformin as an outpatient.
# Hypertension: Chronic hypertension, initially held antihypertensives but restarted home meds on admission, amlodipine-benazapril.
Given albuterol nebs as needed.
