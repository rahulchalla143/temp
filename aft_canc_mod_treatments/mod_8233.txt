Her Keppra dose was increased to 100mg PO BID and she was discharged to follow-up without further increased seizure activity.
Anxiolytics could cause hypothermia, but less likely as patient has been on ativan for a long time without frequent episodes of hypothermia.
Patient was treated with bair hugger with improvement in her temperature, and eventually weaned off bair hugger with maintained temperature.
Cortisol was also within normal limits (PM random draw) but patient was started on overnight stress dose hydrocortisone for empiric coverage of hypoadrenalism with taper following thereafter.
Endocrinology felt that her steroids could be tapered down from the stress dosing given no obvious infectious source and rapid resolution of her hypothermia with active rewarming.
Patient was continued on home antiepileptic therapies including [**Age over 90 15741**], lamotrigine, levitiracetam, high dose progesterone, and Zonergan.
We titrated Keppra to 1000 PO BID given a witnessed grand mal seizure on [**2112-3-21**].
Secondary Hypoadrenalism: Patient is on maintenance dose of hydrocortisone at home, but it was initially unclear if her hypothermia represented acute adrenal insufficiency.
This is unlikely given absence of electrolyte abnormalities and normotension but patient was treated empirically with stress dose steroids for a day given her hypothermia and concern for hypoadrenalism.
Her steroids were tapered down to home dosing per Endocrine's recommendations.
Her hormonal insufficiencies were treated as above.
In addition, patient is on progesterone 100mg PO TID for seizure prophylaxis and her home medication was brought in by group home as the exact formulation was not available in the hospital.

You were given higher dose of steroids and work up for infection was done and did not show any obvious source.
While you were in the hospital, you had several seizures, likely related to your missing doses of medications while we were waiting for them to come in from your group home.
