Admission Date:  [**2150-7-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-7-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Febrile neutropenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bedside Laparotomy [**2150-7-31**]  History of Present Illness:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 62-year-old woman w/ biphenotypic leukemia s/p Hyper CVAD therapy,MEC, Clofarabine/ARA-C, Fludarabine/Busulfan/ATG and allogneic SCT day +84 c/b mucositis,previous febrile neutropenia, ARF, basilar vein infective thrombosis s/p basilic vein phlebectomy, ascending neuropathy, and coag negative staph bacteremia p/w fevers since the evening prior to presentation.
She was first seen for a pancytopenia in [**9-/2149**] and ultimately diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia in [**11-10**], now s/p allogenic stem cell transplant [**4-29**], now day 84 (on [**7-22**]).
Her posttransplant course was complicated by severe mucositis requiring TPN and PCA narcotics as well as coag-negative staph bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin from [**2150-5-9**] through [**2150-5-23**].
She was discharged on [**2150-6-16**] and was seen daily for IV fluids and electrolyte support.
Her last admission was on [**7-3**] for increasing weakness and numbness of her legs.
Her Tacrolimus and Dapsone were held on admission due to concern for contribution to neuropathy.
Pt was evaluated by neurology, who thought that her neuropathy could be due to the B12 but unlikely given rapid presentation.
Her symptoms stabilized with continued decreased sensation in her feet, legs, and chest up to her breast bilaterally.
Pt was ischarged to the apartments with follow-up with outpt PT, and to be using wheelchair at home.
She was treated with hyper-CVAD part A and B with unfortunately bone marrow biopsy remaining positive.
Her bone marrow continued to show up blasts, and she was treated by a cycle of clofarabine and ARC, resulting in an empty marrow without evidence of leukemia.
This cycle of treatment was complicated by high-grade VRE bacteremia and coag-negative staph bacteremia in the setting of neutropenia.
She was noted to have septic thrombophlebitis and required intubation and ICU support.
Blood cultures were positive until she underwent right basilic venectomy and two granulocyte transfusions.
After the clot was removed, cultures became negative, and she completed a four-week course of daptomycin in the setting of her sepsis.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] also developed ATN and ultimately anuric renal failure, became dialysis dependent, but after two to three weeks, began making urine and currently has a normal creatinine without the need for dialysis.
She had an unrelated donor, and she was admitted for ablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with busulfan/fludarabine conditioning on [**2150-4-23**] with day zero on [**2150-4-29**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 13290**] posttransplant course was complicated by severe mucositis requiring TPN and PCA narcotics as well as coag-negative staph bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin from [**2150-5-9**] through [**2150-5-23**].
She was discharged on [**2150-6-16**] and has been seen daily for IV fluids and electrolyte support.

She was started on empirical Vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole for neutropenic fevers.
CT negative for pathology  Prior to the result of blood cultures, the pt was switched from vancomycin to daptomycin on [**7-23**] for empiric VRE coverage given pt's history of severe VRE sepsis in the past.
ID was consulted and recommended dc'ing daptomycin an and restarting vancomycin for coag negative staph, as well as starting ganciclovir for potential benefits against EBV.
Additionally, immunosuppression was titrated down to allow her immune system to fight against the EBV infection.
Cefepime was replaced by ceftriaxone on [**7-25**] for gram negative coverage as p.aeuriginosa was not likely etiology of fevers.
was going into acute renal failure (ATN evidenced by granular casts in urine sediment), liver failure (transaminitis and bilirubin of >3).
At this point, her ganciclovir was dc'd due to renal toxicity, and her Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were replaced by daptomycin and meropenem for coverage of possible sepsis of unknown etiology.
In the ICU the patient remained febrile, hypotensive requiring multiple pressors, and she was intubated requiring a mechanical ventilator.
On [**2150-7-31**], the patient developed profound abdominal distention, severe acidosis, had peak airway pressures of 70, complete anuria and hypotension despite multiple vaso-active agents.
Surgery was consulted and, because the patient had indicated that she would favor any extreme effort to save her life, a bedside laparotomy was performed.
# Renal Failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8271**] has a history of recurrent ARF on previous admissions, requiring hemodialysis for 2-3 weeks after VRE/Coag neg staph sepsis in early [**Month (only) **].
Expendable nephrotoxic agents were discontinued or titrated down, including ganciclovir, vancomycin, and cyclosporin.
of leukemia s/p allogenic SCT: Pt was day +84 on admission.
She continued to be on cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, as well as prednisone and budenoside for potential GVHD due to symptoms of nausea several weeks prior to presentation.
CSA levels were titrated to be at 150-200, MMF was decreased to 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], budenoside was dc'd and prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily with goal of being off prednisone by 2nd week.
