He was started on a heparin gtt bridge with coumadin.
Heparin gtt was then noted to be infiltrated into left arm, resulting in swelling in left arm which improved with warm compresses.
Heparin gtt was switched to lovenox injections [**Hospital1 **] on [**2104-10-21**].
Oxygen saturation remained mid 90s on 6L nasal cannula initially; he was weaned to 5L by time of transfer to floor.
He remained on therapeutic lovenox till the morning of [**10-26**] as his INR was 2.0 on [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] it was 2.2 with a dose of 5mg coumadin.
He will be discharged on 5mg coumadin daily with planned anti-coagulation monitoring through his pcp's office.
Patient denied knowledge of HCV history but did recall being told that liver was damaged from alcohol.
INR was elevated to 1.5 prior to initiation of coumadin, albumin was normal.
Per OSH records, pt had longstanding history of thrombocytopenia with platelets in this range.
MRI of the liver was obtained to further evaluate that showed cirrhosis and hemangioma  #Pancreatic Tail Cyst: found incidentally on MRI of liver --recommended to have repeat MRCP in 1 year  #Incidentally found R adrenal nodule (7mm) found on MRI of liver --defer further workup to PCP as an outpatient  #Splenic infarct-Pt was found to have a small ASD vs. stretched PFO on echo.
Platelet count remained stable despite heparin products making HIT unlikely.
# COPD No interventions at this time.
# Tobacco use Pt received nicotine patch.
He was counseled regarding smoking cessation and would like to continue on nicotine patch as an outpatient.
Pt initially had random blood glucose of 235 and he was started on a sliding scale.
Transient hyperglycemia may have been [**2-13**] stress response from large PE; insulin was discontinued.
Discharge Medications: 1. home oxygen therapy 2L NC with ambulation to keep saturation above 88% indication: hypoxia below 88% with ambulation (low of 84 with activity) 2. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).
Disp:*30 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0* 4. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation three times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
