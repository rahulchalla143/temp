Median sternotomy wires and cardiomegaly is again seen and unchanged.
MRI OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter in a near-empty bladder.
The bladder wall is significantly thickened up to 15 mm, probably related to prior radiation treatments in conjunction with nondistention.
The patient will be brought back for a non-contrast urographic study pre- and post-Lasix administration.
[**1-3**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including cardiomegaly, post-sternotomy wires and post-CABG changes.
An indwelling Foley catheter is noted with an inflated balloon.
Echogenic debris measures with maximum cross-sectional dimension 5.0 x 1.4 x 2.0 cm (TRV x AP x CC), layering in the dependent position of the urinary bladder, compatible with blood clot.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o Russian M with PMHx of [**Age over 90 9197**] cancer with recent indwelling foley, stage IV CKD (baseline Cr 3.0) and chronic systolic CHF (LVEF 30%) who was admitted on [**12-26**] with anemia, hematuria and clot-related urinary retention.
He was initially admitted to the Urology Service for urinary clot retention and was taken to the operating room for cystoscopy, clot evacuation, and bladder fulguration.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post procedure due to urosepsis from Klebseilla UTI.
Pt had some recovery of renal function but developped recurrent hematuria requiring multiple blood transfusions.
During this prolonged admission, he required multiple urologic procedures for recurrent hematuria with obstructive clotting.
On [**1-8**], he was taken for cystoscopy which was complicated by an episode of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure thought due to procedural sedation.
While on the medicine floor, the continuous bladder irrigation was discontinued and his hematocrit stabilized at 25-27.
Foley was removed and he did had any acute issues with retention.
Urology recommended avoiding a foley unless pt develops severe pain or acute obstruction given his severe hematuria.
Specific issues: C diff: Pt was noted to have a rising leukocytosis and Cdiff toxin returned positive.
Symptoms were improving on po Flagyl and he was discharged with a prescription to complete another 10 days of flagyl at home.
He had been adequately diuresed for his acute systolic heart failure and was clinically euvolemic on lasix dose of 40mg twice daily.
Lisinopril was stopped and follow up labs will be drawn 4 days after discharge and forwarded to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Pt was hypervolemic after fluid rescucitation in the ICU and required diuresis with IV lasix.
He  was discharged on a new home dose of lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] which was confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Pt is now s/p cytoscopy and fulguration.
