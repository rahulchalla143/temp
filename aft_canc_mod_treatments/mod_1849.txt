Admission Date:  [**2128-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: Rectal bleed, change in MS, CHF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76 y/o male w/ h/o rheumatic heart dz s/p mechanical mvr/avr, afib (s/p VVI PPM); h.o CHF; s/p recent admit to [**Hospital1 18**] for 7 wks (work up for valve leakage included TTE, TEE, MRI showing 2+ MR perivalvular leakage; s/p cath x 2 with stenting of RCA and LAD; s/p VVI pacemaker for chronic afib and prolonged attempts of diuresis) who is being transferred from OSH today after admission for hemorrhoidal bleed s/p surgical I and D of thrombosed hemorrhoid on [**9-6**], followed by normal colonoscopy on [**9-8**].
Patient got Fentanyl and Versed during colonoscopy, since then all sedating meds were held but change in MS persisted.
of 2.3 from 1.8 (and K of 6) on admission therefore lisinopril and aldactone were held.
Patient was continued on Lasix and had serial rising BNPs from 723 on [**9-8**] to 1163 on [**9-11**].
On admission initial ABG 7.29/77/237 during Nebulizer treatment, next ABG 7.28/78/163, normal Lactate.
He was intubated and admitted to the CCU and extubated on [**2128-10-9**].
He was then placed on a heparin gtt, lasix gtt, dopamine gtt and nesiritide for diuresis.
After transferring back to the floor service, he failed to wean off the dopamine and nesiritide and was readmitted to the CCU on [**2128-10-20**].
He failed to tolerate an ACE and was restarted on dopamine which was then weaned off.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
PAF s/p VVI pacemaker 5.
of perirectal abscess s/p surgery  Social History: no hx of etoh or tobacco, lives at home alone, widower.
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant circulation with three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Prior RCA stents were widely patent.
Left ventriculography was deferred because of renal insufficiency and presence of aortic valve prosthesis.
These represent marked improvement since prior hemodynamic assessment in [**7-28**], although current study was performed with patient receiving intravenous dopamine and nesiritide.
Right internal jugular venous sheath was sutured in place.
Three vessel coronary artery disease, minimally changed from prior angiography.
Brief Hospital Course: # CHF - On admission we placed a right IJ triple lumen catheter for adequate access.
He was in decompensated CHF on exam and we started treatment with Natrecor, Lasix, and dopamine drips.
He was diuresed with these agents for several days with good output and weight loss.
He was converted to Lasix IV as a bridge to PO and then converted to PO lasix once adequately diuresed.
Dopamine and Niseritide stopped after changeed to Po lasix.
On one occastion whie on lasix gtt pt had creatitine bump to 2.2.
Pt was doing better from CHF stand point until he was transfused and again decompensated requiring Natrecor and Dopamine gtt.
Dopamine could not be weaned off since his BP would drop without Dopa.
Pt then underwent right and left heart cath to determine precise fluid status which showed PCWP of 12 and left cath showing 3 vessel dz.
Given his PCWP of 12 which is much better than we expected, it was thought that he was overdiuresed causing decline in BP.
He was transferred to CCU for brief period of time for tailored therapy where Natrecor and Dopamine gtt were weaned off and po Bumex and spironolactone were started for diuresis.
He did not tolerate Captoril in CCU because of drop in BP.
These medications were slowly titrated up.
He remained net even for few days but became slightly overloaded as he required multiple transfusion for his anemia.
However, since spironolactone had to be discontinued for hyperkalemia, Bumex was increased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was able to tolerate lisinopril 3.75 mg qd, Coreg 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Pt should have electrolytes checked periodically at rehab and, if renal function worsens, consider decreasing lisinopril dose.
We continued his ASA and plavix.
Pt was hypotensive during diuresis and was started on Dopa both for BP support and diuresis.
BP meds were held for BP less than 100.
Restarted Carvedilol after dopamine stopped and BP back up to baseline.
While he was in the hospital we continued his iron and folate therapy.
He received 2 transfusions during the hospital stay for HCT <28.
He was initially continued on Procrit 60,000u Qmonday.
Then he developed more brisk drop in Hct compared to before requiring almost transfusion 1-2x/week.
1)mechanical hemolysis  2)MDS  3)anemia of chronic illness (by Iron studies).
Per Hem recommendation, Epo was increased to 60,000 units/week (20,000 units qMWF) and he was getting IV iron for sometime.
His Hct was as low as 21 and required multiple transfusion to keep the Hct>30.
IV iron was held since pt was able to hold his Hct without it.
# Rhythm  - He has chronic afib s/p VVI pacer [**2128-8-12**].
# Mechanical valve -  Coumadin was initially held and he was maintained on a Heparin drip while he had to get central line placed for the CHF management.
Once his CHF issue had stabilized, his coumadin was restarted and titrated.
Pt's INR was therapeutic at Coumadin 13 mg qd.
Pt's INR should be checked periodically and warfarin adjusted as indicated.
# Change in mental status - Upon presentation from the OSH Mr. [**Known lastname 11215**] was disoriented and changed from his baseline.
He was started on Levo/Flagyl given history of colonoscopy and recent perirectal abscess.
All sedating meds were held given the history of recent sedation for colonoscopy immediately prior to change in MS.  His ABG indicated hypercarbia which could be causing his change in MS.  His oxygen was decreased and he was maintained at an O2 sat between 92-94%.
He was treated with nebulizers and steroids.
He was continued on these treatments and two days after admission his mental status resolved to baseline.
He was treated with q2hour nebs and solumedrol.
He was treated with Levo/Flagyl for a full course of 10 days during his hospital stay.
# Ileus - Upon initial evaluation he was seen to have enlarged bowel loops on abdominal x-ray.
There was no need for NG tube decompression since he was passing Flatus and having bowel sounds.
#  Prophylaxis/FEN - Throughout his stay he was maintained on Protonix and a heparin drip.
Heparin gtt was stopped when INR therapeutic.
