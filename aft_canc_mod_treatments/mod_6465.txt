Ultraflex 40 x 14 covered stent, left main stem, Silicone Y-stent placement.

[**10-18**] Flexible bronchoscopy, Therapeutic aspiration of secretions.
Placement of A-line, CVL R IJ  # TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA The patient was transferred intubated from [**Hospital 61603**] Hospital in NY on [**10-15**] for stent revision to a tracheo-esophageal fistula.
Left main bronchus stent was seen in place and was patent, although there was diffuse attenuation of the airways distal to the stent on the left, with moderate pleural effusions b/l.
THe patient tolerated the procedure well, although she remained with copious secretions, and so underwent stent revision on [**10-16**] and again on [**10-18**].
On [**10-17**] she was extubated, which she tolerated well although with need for frequent suctioning, chest PT, and required therapeutic bronchoscopy for secretions on [**10-18**].
She was also maintained on scheduled nebulizers and prednisone.
On [**10-22**] she had a follow up CXR that revealed: The stent, central venous access line, and abdominal drain are in unchanged position.
# VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA The BAL on [**10-18**] revealed MRSA > 100K, and so the patient was started on IV vancomycin for a total therapy duration of two weeks.
#PLEURAL EFFUSION On [**10-16**] the patient underwent thoracentesis given radiologic and clinic findings that was transudative in nature, with Glucose 214, LDH 170, and total protein of 2.5.
She was also started on lasix for diuresis.
# HYPERTENSION The patient's hypertension was eventually controlled through a combination of clonidine patch, enalapril, labetolol, and metoprolol.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient has a history of Atrial fibrillation and was initially placed on IV diltiazem and esmolol for rate control, which was then converted to PO meds via the PEG; however, her rate was not controlled until she was digoxin loaded on [**10-19**] and her rate slowed from AF in the 120s to the 80s.
She was then placed on her home dose of digoxin 0.125 mg/day, which controlled her rate throughout her stay.
She was then placed on therapeutic lovenox for the fibrillation and the thrombus, and given her history of a TIA, even though she is at a risk for falls.
# DYSPHAGIA The patient had a PEG tube placed by IR on [**10-16**] given that she was intubated for feeding.
She was started on tube feeds [**10-17**], which she tolerated, and she was kept NPO given that she aspirated during her [**10-21**] Barium swallow.
