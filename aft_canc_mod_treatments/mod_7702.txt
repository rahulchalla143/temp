He was previously very healthy until his presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 359**] when he was found to have bilateral SDH after a mechanical fall.
He had bilateral craniotomy on [**11-13**] and initially did well post-operatively, but then became hypoxic, tachycardic, febrile, tachypneic, and hypertensive with b/l pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.

A mid-cavitary gradient is identified.
They recommended treatment with anticoagulation, and he was started on ASA and coumadin.
He had tracheostomy placed on HD#5, although the neurology team felt that this respiratory failure was more related to his mental status and pneumonia than to his CVAs and was hopeful that as his toxic/metabolic encephalopathy improves he may ultimately be able to have the trach removed.
Given he had been intubated for several days prior to transfer, he was treated empirically for ventilator associated pneumonia with IV vancomycin/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.
