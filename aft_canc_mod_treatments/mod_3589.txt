The drains were sequentially pulled as the output decreased.
His Ileostomy was draining liquid stool.
We added Immodium and Opium tincture.
We initally placed an ostomy pouch over this to controll the output, as the output decreased, we packed this wound and change the dressing TIB to [**Hospital1 **].
He was doing well and awaiting rehab placement.
A repeat CT on [**9-30**] showed Decreased right subhepatic fluid collection with a pigtail catheter in place.
He went for IR drainage of the left fluid collection.
There was successful placement of a drainage catheter into the perisplenic fluid collection A few cc of fluid resembling old blood were aspirated from the catheter and sent for culture and stain.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The left sided drain was removed on [**2159-10-11**], the right sided drain remained in place as this still had some thick, tannish drainage.
We were able to remove this right drain on [**10-12**].

Due to a risng white count, he was restarted on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
He was started on Immodium and Opium ticture.
A J-tube was then placed on [**9-5**] and tube feedings were started slowly.
He was started on thin liquids and ground solids.
After additional drains were placed as mentioned above, he was NPO, tubefeedings were held and started on TPN.
Once we had better control on these collecitons, the TPN was weaned down and Tubefeedings were again restarted.
