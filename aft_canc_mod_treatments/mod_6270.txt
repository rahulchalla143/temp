He became hypotensive and he received 2 liters normal saline and was started on a dopamine gtt.
He subsequently developed multifocal atrial tachycardia and was started on a diltiazem drip and his pressor was switched to neosynephrine.
He also was started on propofol for sedation.
Initial ABG post intubation was 7.31/68.1/293 on 500 x 15, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5.
The diltiazem drip was discontinued and his heart rates were in the 70s with wandering atrial pacemaker.
