He maintained good oxygen saturations on 3L nasal cannula although continued to be fluid overloaded.
He had a gentle diuresis with IV Lasix.
Prone to drops in blood pressure with diuresis, resulting in small amount of fluid boluses.

Thoracic surgery followed patient post-op for management of pneumonia and pleural effusions.
Pigtail catheter inserted on Right side, drainage decreased over time.
Pigtail was removed once drainage subsided, and CXR revealed decrease in pleural effusion.

Albuterol nebs were held on occasion due to short runs of VTACH via Telemetry.
Tele status stabilizes once PO Valsartan started, and electrolytes stabilized once Lasix was discontinued.
