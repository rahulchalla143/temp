He also spiked to [**Age over 90 **]F, given tylenol with good response.
He was tachypneic, with increased work of breathing and started empirically on vanc/zosyn for HAP.
PE could not be ruled out with a CT chest as patient had elevated Cr (1.9) so he was started on a heparin drip.
He was given 10 units of insulin at rehab, and 10 more units in the ED with subsequent fingersticks in the 200s.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was on BIPAP, saturating 98% on minimal settings.

Hazy opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally is nonspecific, and could reflect an infectious or inflammatory process.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, for which he initially required supplemental oxygen with 15L nasal cannula and was later transitioned to BiPAP, for which he was admitted to the MICU.
However, he continued to be volume overloaded, and was diuresed with IV lasix with improvement in his symptoms.
Afterload reduction was achieved with diltiazem (initially via a diltiazem drip).
He was given standing atrovent nebulizers for a possible COPD exacerbation.
After transfer to the floor, the patient had an episode of hypertension, tachycardia and flash pulmonary edema and required IV lasix and his diltiazem was increased for further rate control and blood pressure control.
His diltiazem was restarted and titrated to achieve a heart rate of <100, as discussed below.
Furosemide was restarted at 20mg PO daily prior to discharge.
# A fib: He was started on a diltiazam drip and metorprolol IV to optimize rate control.
He was eventially weaned off of the diltiazam drip and transitioned to metoprolol 25mg po BID.
However, he did not tolerate this well, and IV diltiazem was required for rate control.
He was transitioned to PO diltiazem with IV pushes as necessary, before adequate rate control was obtained.
He was started on metronidazole and will be discharged on a 14 day course of this antibiotic.
He was given beta blockers and two doses of adenosine with subsequent conversion into atrial flutter with variable conduction.
# Hypertension: His hypertension was initially managed with nitroglycerin drip, which was eventenually weaned.
He was started on captopril while in the hospital for afterload reduction, and was stopped due to renal impairment.
He was restarted on half of his home dose of furosemide on the floor for diuresis and afterload reduction.
His blood pressure was well controlled on diltizazem and Lasix at discharge.
His kidney function was monitored during diuresis, and he required repletion of potassium and phosphate.
He received 20units total on the day of admission, which decreased his blood sugar to the 200s.
He was maintiained on an insulin sliding scale with no adverse effects.
At discharge, he was restarted on glipizide 2.5mg PO daily, with instructions for his family members to check his glucose before breakfast and after dinner daily until visiting his PCP.
Records from [**Hospital1 3278**] were obtained that confirmed that he had been ruled out for TB via broncioalveolar lavage and sputum culture.
# HTN/Renal Artery Stenosis s/p stent placemement:  Hypertension was managed with diltiazem.
He was discharged with diltiazem and Lasix, he did not require any other blood pressure agents.
#Transitions of care: - will need further titration of his diltiazem for rate control - continue to discuss the indication for anticoagulation givenhis atrial fibrillation - will continue a 14 day course of Flagyl as an outpatient - follow up on [**Hospital1 **] finger stick blood sugars and titrate oral hypoglycemics for further diabetes management - follow up on thyroid mass with possible biopsy, if within goals of care  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

We restarted you on your home diltiazem to get better control of your heart rate, and we gave you medications to control your blood pressure and remove the fluid from your lungs.
You were also started on an antibiotic for an infection of your colon, which you should take as prescribed.
It is important to NOT TAKE medications such as Imodium, loperamide or Lomotil during this time.
In addition, we changed your oral diabetes medication, and you will now take glipizide 2.5 miligrams every day.
