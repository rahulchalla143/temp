Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were added to the antiobiotic regimen, he was bolused with moderate hemodynamic improvement, but eventually transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU, he was given further fluid boluses and was transiently on a phenylephrine drip.
His urine culture grew out Klebsiella that was sensitive to levofloxacin, so vancomycin and ceftriaxone were stopped.
