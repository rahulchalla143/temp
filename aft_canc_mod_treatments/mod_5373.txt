ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year- old gentleman on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation who was a restrained driver involved in a motor vehicle collision at about 30-35 miles per hour.
The patient's hematocrit on presentation was 30, but this was felt to be hemo concentrated as after fluid resuscitation this had dropped to 24.
He was successfully resuscitated with crystalloid and in addition he was given vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells.
At the time of this repair, he also underwent insertion of an IVC filter as it was felt he would be immobile for some time and he had a relative contraindication to using heparin given the fact that he had a small splenic laceration.

He was to be discharged on the following medications: Colace 100 mg p.o.
p.r.n., regular insulin sliding scale, betamethasone dipropionate 0.05 ointment 1 application topically q.
[**5-8**] h. as needed for a rash, hydrocortisone 1% ointment 1 topical application q.i.d.
rash, metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Percocet 5/325 1-2 tabs every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, Pepcid 20 mg p.o.
The patient's Coumadin was being held given his recent bleeding, as was his aspirin.
