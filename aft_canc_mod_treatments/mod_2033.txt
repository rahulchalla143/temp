Pt was also recently discharged on [**2142-12-30**] after presenting with nausea, chills, tachypnea, hypoxia, and tachycardia after being given platelet transfusion and IVIG, thought to be CHF exacerbation (improved with diuresis).
He was admitted again on [**12-5**] for shortness of breath due to likely early signs of tamponade and had a pericardial drain placed (removed after 1 day with no signs of reaccumulation).
He has had a 3 lb weight loss over the past several days, a persistent [**Month/Day (4) **] (at times productive of light colored sputum) for several weeks, continued chronic diarrhea.

He underwent reduced intensity allo-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**] from his brother in [**2-16**] that was relatively uncomplicated, though he did have grade I skin and hepatic GVHD, and febrile neutropenia.
He received 1 dose of rituxan [**2142-12-8**] in lieu of campath.

Right IJ CVL tip in the right axillary vein.
He was bolused another 2 L NS overnight.
The pt was continued on cefepime and vancomycin given his febrile neutropenia and potential staph aureus in the blood.
He was continued on flagyl for empiric c diff treatment given his chronic diarrhea.
Voriconazole was continued  for resistant oral [**Female First Name (un) **] and aspergillosis seen on BAL in the past, and valacyclovir was continued for oral HSV treatment (the pt was on valacyclovir and voriconazole from his previous admission in [**11-19**]).
All of his BP meds were held initially in the setting of infection.
The effusion appeared exudative in nature given elevated LDH and protein ratios.
ID was consulted and felt that given his neutropenia, a chest tube would be risky.
However, thoracics felt that the pts empyema would not be adequately treated with abx alone.
Decision was made for chest tube placement, so on [**1-24**] a pigtail catheter was placed by IR.
He was started on IV linezolid and vanco was stopped.
His pigtail catheter drain eventually stopped draining, and repeat CT scan showed that it was in good place, and radiology evaluated it and it was working fine.
He underwent chest tube placement by IR on [**1-24**] as per above, with mild improvement in his breathing.
He also required Lasix 20 mg IV on both [**1-23**] and [**1-24**] for mild volume overload.
He was dosed with lasix if he was SOB and felt to be fluid overloaded.
The pt was placed on neutropenic precautions and neutropenic diet.
As per above, the pt was started on cefepime and  vanc.
Cefepime and vanc were changed to Linezolid and Voriconazole.
He was also discharged on Levofloxacin.
The pts tachycardia was likely due to a combination of infection/dehydration as well as underlying cardiomyopathy.
It was noted at some points that his HR would increase and BP would decrease, so his beta blockers were increased.
He was discharged on toprol xL 25 and lisinopril 10 for rate control and afterload reduction.
Per pt, he requires frequent PRBC transfusions and functions best at hct 26-27 at least.
Received 10 mg Vit K on [**1-24**] for INR 1.5.
He required infrequent transfusions while on the floor, and was always followed by lasix.
The pt was monitored regularly while receiving 2L NS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on the night of admission.
He was eventually started back on his ace inhibitor (captopril) and metoprolol, with lasix as needed.
THis improved the forward flow, and his HR actually decreased on this regimen.He was discharged on toprol xL 25 and lisinopril 10 for rate control and afterload reduction.
Imaging revealed only hemosiderin changes, and no heptosplenic candidiasis (on MRI).
He was given a dose of pamidronate, as well as kept on increased maintenance fluids and lasix, which helped to correct his calcium.
#HTN: As per above, the pt Lasix, ace, and BB were all held on admission, and eventually he was placed back on ace and bb.
#CLL: He received no more aggressive treatment for his resistant CLL.
He was continued on steroids (stress dose on D/C from unit) and tapered down to 10mg per day.
# F/E/N: Neutropenic diet, TPN started on floor, with feeding tube (NG) placed on [**2143-2-10**] for home care.
