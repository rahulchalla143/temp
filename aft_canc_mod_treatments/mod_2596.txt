Neuro:  Initial differential differential included toxic-metabolic vs seizure vs. stroke.
MRI: multilple embolic strokes (bilateral cerebellum and left thalamus).
Deferred anticoagulation with coumadin at this time given unclear source of any emboli and concern for bleeding risk especially as was on ASA and had significant lower GI bleed.
She was continued on a statin for secondary prevention.
GIBleed: while on asa for her stroke, she was found on the bathroom floor in pool of blood mixed with stool and could not obtain a blood pressure.
Code was called and after receiving fluids wide open, she was rusictated and transferred to the MICU for further evaluation.
Her EGD showed only signs of trauma from NGT placement, colonoscopy the following day only showed diverticuli and polyp at 40cm in descending colon which was not removed, but for which she will need follow colonoscopy for polypectomy in the future.
She was contnued on heparin and stools cleared up with no further signs of bleeding.
anticoagulation should be avoided in the future.
HTN: Antihypertensives were held given the question of an acute stroke her blood pressures remained stable off antihypertensive without signs of hypertension, and can be restarted as outpatient by PCP if needed.
Bilateral exudative effusions: she was intubated for airway protection b/c of agitation and noted to have bilateral effusions, which was tapped and consistent with an exudative source of unknown source.
The effusions were noted after being aggressively hydrated in setting of GI bleed and then diuresis and were eventually thought to be pseudo-exudative.
Although of note, she has had a positive PPD in the past for which she refused treatment because she felt she had received the BCG vaccine in the [**2099**]'s prior to 3 months she worked in a [**Hospital **] hospital [**Hospital1 **] as a nursing student and as her mother had had TB when she was a child.
AFB was added on the pleural fluid and was negative and induced sputums were sent to rule out active TB, but she did not have further cough with her current cough and respiratory symptoms and was ruled out for active TB.
She developed a diffuse truncal maculopapular rash thought secondary to levoquin so was switched to a three day course of bactrim.
The foley was removed and repeat clean cath UA was clean, culture negative except contamination, so antibiotics were discontinued.
However, they had concerns from a safety standpoint as patient was unable to turn off a faucet and was unable to come up with safety plans for hypothetical situations.
