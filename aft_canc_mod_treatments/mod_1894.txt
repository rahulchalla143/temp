Diffuse smooth septal thickening is most consistent with hydrostatic edema in the setting of effusions and anarsarca.
She was admitted to the ICU on a phenylephrine drip for hypotension that developed in the ED.
The patient was bolused 500cc NS and phenylephrine d/c'ed.
Art line was inserted for BP monitoring and was removed prior to transfer.
UA was suggestive of UTI so pt was started on Ciprofloxacin PO 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], urine cx showed E. coli so 3 day course of abx was completed.
In light of the pt's pauses on tele, cardiology c/s (EP) was called, and the pt was ultimately transferred to the EP service for pacemaker placement on [**2184-9-13**] (see below).
Evaluated by cardiology and a pacemaker was placed on [**2184-9-13**].
As per EP, she was started on an amiodarone load to be finished after discharge.
Briefly, she is to get 200 mg of Amiodarone TID x 7 days, and then 400 mg PO daily x 3 weeks, and finally 200 mg PO daily afterward.
Her Hct remained stable, and Ms. [**Known lastname **] was treated with pain medication.
We would recommend starting the pt on anticoagulation at a later date if it is deemed safe to do so by her Oncologist.
We continued her low dose BB at 12.5 mg PO BID of metoprolol tartrate.
Zyprexa was given PRN at night for agitation, and soft mitts were used for restraints for one instance of attempting to pull her lines.
# Follicular lymphoma: She just received a dose of R-CVP chemo prior to admission and was continued on her scheduled prednisone and zofran.
She was not neutropenic after her chemotherapy, but in the setting of her sick sinus syndrome and need for pacemaker placement, she was placed on neupogen in order to increase her counts and lower her infection risk.
# Anemia: Pt's Hct was noted to have dropped after the procedure and in light of the hematoma.
Multiple causes are possible, although most likely is a combination of chemotherapy (nadir when Hct was 22-23) as well as slight [**First Name (STitle) **] loss from the PPM placement and the hematoma.
