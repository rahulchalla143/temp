Admission Date:  [**2138-7-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-9-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Fever, diarrhea, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 26M with history of hypoplastic MDS s/p single cord transplant with post transplant course c/b mucormycosis, CMV infection, Cdiff, and VRE bacteremia with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a hypocellular marrow with cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13).
MDS course complicated by mucor infection with infiltration into base of the tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation of bleeding artery.
Patient was managed with a single cord transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG conditioning.
Recent course complicated by low grade temperature and +CMV viral load with proloinged admission for IV ganciclovir.
- C. difficile infection [**10/2136**] - pericoronitis s/p extraction 4 teeth [**2137-1-24**] - peri-rectal abscess s/p drainage [**2137-2-27**] - Hemochromatosis - Transaminitis (felt most likely multifactorial; contributions by medications and hemochromatosis) .
Pertinent Oncologic history (include past therapies, surgeries, etc): diagnosed with hypoplastic MDS in the fall of [**2136**]; transfusion dependent; mucor infection with infiltration into base of the tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation of bleeding artery; single cord allo [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG conditioning; CMV + CURRENT TREATMENT PLAN: allo assessment.
-lives with sister, brother-in-law, and their 2 children.
Red blood cells express expected levels of DAF (CD55) and MIRL (CD59).
The red blood cells do not show antigenic loss (patient has received blood transfusions).
KARYOTYPE ([**8-1**]: 46,XY[30])  Imaging: CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILIMPRESSION [**7-23**]:  Persistent opacities at the maxillary sinuses, ethmoidal, sphenoid and frontoethmoidal recesses as described above, with minimal improvement in the pattern of aeration, the attenuation in the paranasal sinuses is slightly heterogeneous, likely indicating inspissated secretions, the possibility of fungal colonization is also a consideration.
Brief Hospital Course: PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 26M with history of hypoplastic MDS s/p single cord transplant with post transplant course c/b mucormycosis, CMV infection, Cdiff, and VRE bacteremia with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals, recently discharged from hospital for PNA, now presenting with fevers and rigors in the setting of recent blood transfusion on [**2138-7-22**].
His fevers persisted despite antibiotics and the patient ultimately had a bone marrow biopsy that showed evidence of HLH.
He was started on HLH [**2130**] protocol, and unfortunately became lethargic and tachycardic with severe metabolic acidosis anc respiratory alkalosis in the setting of severe diarrhea.
He was started on levophed but was unable to maintain pressures even at doses of 0.45 mcg/kg/min.
# Lethargy: Transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**8-17**] due to new onset tachycardia, hypertension, and worsening metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis.
Because this would require intubation and would not significantly alter management in the acute setting, MRI was deferred and blood pressures were monitored in the setting of a presumed infarct, initially allowing for permissive hypertension with SBPs into the 180s.
As noted above, the patient progressively became hypotensive in the setting of a triple acid base disturbance, and eventually expired.
# Diarrhea: The patient initially had diarrhea in the setting of his antibiotics.
After developing nausea on [**8-17**] and having a bicarb of 12, he became unresponsive to IVF boluses as above.
The respiratory alkalosis was later attributed to a central process given the findings on head CT noted above.
He was started on dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporine prior to his passing.
It was thought that this could be a transfusion reaction to blood and platelet products that were received the day prior in clinic.
A transfusion reaction work up was initiated, and the patient was also started on empiric Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] in case infection was the underlying etiology.
He was also continued on his prophylaxis with dapsone, posaconazole, and valgancyclovir.
He was ultimately found to have HLH and was started on dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporine.
After starting the treatment, the patient defervesced, although meropenem was continued given persistent neutropenia.
# Hypoplastic MDS s/p single cord transplant: The patient was platelet and PRBC transfusion dependent.
He was transfused blood and platelets as needed to maintain Hgb <7, platelets <10.
He was started on 2.5 olanzapine and a scopalmine patch.
# Tachycardia/Cardiac: The patient was been intermittently tachycardic throughout the admission, likely in the setting of intermittent fevers, vomiting, and his degree of anemia.
