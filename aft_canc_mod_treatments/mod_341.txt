Admission Date:  [**2139-3-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-3-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old woman with restrictive lung disease and radiation fibrosis secondary to previous radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease in the [**2106**] and recurrent episodes and admissions for aspiration pneumonia.
She was most recently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service on [**2139-2-20**], for recurrent aspiration pneumonia and hypercarbia and consideration of decortication surgery on her right lung.
She has chronic difficulty with clearing her secretions, and she was given suction treatment repeatedly on the CT Service through her tracheostomy which was placed last summer for suctioning and intermittent ventilatory support as needed.
The secretions were purulent with 4+ PNS and were positive on culture with MRSA and Enterobacter which was sensitive to Meropenem and Gentamicin.
She was seen by the Infectious Disease Service and started on Vancomycin 1 g per day and also Meropenem.
She tolerated a trach mask by [**2-24**] and was transferred back to Cardiovascular Surgery on [**2-26**]; however, after that, she became progressively short of breath with worsening cough and increased secretions which were yellowish.
She also became more confused, and her little pCO2 rose to 92, so she was transferred back to the MICU on [**3-2**] for additional ventilatory support.
Although decortication procedure on the right lung, previously performed on the left in [**2139-6-7**], was considered, it was felt that the patient must first recover from this bout of aspiration pneumonia and be optimized in terms of her ventilatory support at a rehabilitation facility prior to this procedure.
Status post splenectomy in [**2110**].
Restrictive lung disease with mediastinal radiation fibrosis.
For two years she has been dependent on a minimum of 2 L oxygen by nasal cannula, but she frequently requires hospitalization for ventilatory support.
Status post decortication of her left lung in [**2138-6-7**].
Status post pericardectomy for restrictive pericarditis secondary to radiation therapy in the [**2116**].
Status post hysterectomy in [**2113**] for cervical cancer.
A video fluoroscopic swallowing study in [**2139-6-7**] revealed difficulty with thin liquids and aspiration risk.
She has been treated with Ceftazidime, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Clindamycin, and Metronidazole in the past.
Status post tracheostomy in the [**2139**].
Status post J-tube placement, which has been previously removed.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Meropenem 1 g IV q.8 hours, Vancomycin 1 g IV q.18 hours, Combivent [**1-8**] inhalations q.6 hours as needed, Levothyroxine 125 p.o.
q.d., Reglan 10 mg q.i.d., Risperidone 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Zolpidem 5 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o.
because of her PICC line begun during this admission, Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
?, heart rate 95, blood pressure 90/40, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on AC volume support with tidal volume 300, PEEP 5, FIO2 30%.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, WBC 15.3, hematocrit 30.0, platelet count 335; sodium 142, potassium 4.3, chloride 93, total CO2 43, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, glucose 130; magnesium 2.0, phosphate 2.3; arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.29, pCO2 92, O2 76 on 4 L nasal cannula; [**2-23**] TSH 4.3, [**3-1**] Vancomycin level 35.5.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray:  PICC line in place, status post sternotomy and left thoracotomy, interval worsening of bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities since [**2-26**] with bilateral pleural effusions.
Paramediastinal volume loss and radiation fibrosis with traction bronchiectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 54-year-old woman with chronic restrictive lung disease came to the MICU for ventilatory support in the setting of worsening hypercarbia and recent aspiration pneumonia.
Cardiovascular:  Her systolic blood pressure was declining from about 100 to the 70s during her hospitalization; however, she responded to increased fluid intake once her mental status improved and she began to take p.o.
She was kept on her standing dose of Lasix at 20 mg p.o.
during her hospital stay, and additional diuresis was not required.
She was also continued on Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Pulmonary:  She was initially placed on volume-assist control with a tidal volume of 300 at respiration 14 with PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 50%.
It was felt that given her chronic metabolic alkalosis with total CO2 of approximately 40 at baseline, that her mental status changes may have resulted from alkalemia, and the goal for her pCO2 was set for 60-70, which is likely her baseline.
On the second hospital day, her ventilatory support was changed to pressure support at 10 cm; however, the pressure support was increased to 15 because of tidal volumes below 200.
She did well on pressure support over night, and she can frequently tolerate face mask and ambulate during the day.
Unfortunately, it appears that at present she requires ventilatory support at least during the night; however, she may be able to tolerate periods without support during the day at a pulmonary rehabilitation facility.
Her Vancomycin trough was 15.4, so her dosage of Vancomycin was decreased to 1 g q.24 hours.
She is currently on day #10 of her Vancomycin and Meropenem for a recommended total course of 21 days.
She had a Foley catheter on the Cardiothoracic Service but not in the MICU.
The anemia is normocytic and borderline hypochromic.
She may required further Epogen therapy in the future.
She is treated with Sertraline and Risperidone.
Prophylaxis:  She was continued on her usual Prevacid and was started on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
on the Cardiothoracic Service to prevent clotting of her PICC line.
DISCHARGE PLAN:  It is recommended that the patient receive ventilatory support at night in a pulmonary rehabilitation facility.
Her pneumonia is resolving, and she is continuing on a course of Vancomycin and Meropenem IV via her PICC line for three weeks.
