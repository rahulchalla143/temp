Onc History: The patient originally presented in [**2140-8-14**] with headache, confusion, disorientation and visual changes.

He received six cycles of CPT-11 and cisplatin there.
He was then discontinued off his regimen because of increased creatinine.
In middle of [**2141-4-15**], he was started on oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
The oxaliplatin was discontinued in end of [**2141-5-16**] after two cycles of neuropathy.
He then had some evidence of progression of disease and then was changed to Taxol and carboplatin.
He underwent whole brain radiation at [**Hospital6 **], which was completed [**2142-2-16**].
PE was thought to be less likely despite the positive history of PE and malignancy, especially as the patient was on prophylaxtic lovenox at home.
Upon admission, the patient was started on empiric antibiotic course of vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP.
Tobramycin was added for double coverage after blood cx from the emergency department grew GNR, but was discontinued once sensitivities were back.
Additionally, the patient received albuterol and atrovent inhalers PRN, was gently diuresed with lasix, and was encouraged to ambulate/ use incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis.
Despite completing an 8 day course of vancomycin and a (14) day course of ceftazadime (switch from cefepime on day 10 of therapy due to new susceptibility report of GNR), the patient's respiratory status did not improve significantly.
At time of discharge from ICU the patient was stable on high flow oxygen with 60% FiO2 and 6LNC.
The patient was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for HAP.
This was discontinued after 2 days once antibiotic sensitivities returned.
On day 10, cefepime was switched to ceftazadime based on new antibiotic sensitivity profile from the patient's initial positive blood culture.
The patient was continued on chronic dose of prednisone as per neurooncologist due to symptoms of mild adrenal insuffieciency.
The patient has decided to receive palliative care at home following this hospitalization.
