His work-up ultimately included MRI of the head that revealed a right parietal mass, as well as a small contrast enhancing region in the left cerebellum consistent with metastasis.
The patient presents for a combined mediastinoscopy as well as a right craniotomy for tumor resection.
The mediastinoscopy will be separately dictated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He tolerated both procedures well and was trasferred to the floor where he was neurologically stable.
Routine post-op serum electrolyte check revealed that he was hyponatremic (Na 132) and was started on fluid restriction and salt tabs.
By the time of discharge, his Na was 133 without fluid restriction or salt taps.
The urology service was called and a foley was placed.
Per urology recommendation, the patient will go home with the Foley and a leg bag.
