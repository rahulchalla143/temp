We removed 250cc of serosanguinous fluid and left drain in place.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to CCU in stable condition.
Successful pericardiocentesis with removal of 250cc of fluid, sent for routine labs and cytology.
ECHO ([**2117-3-29**]): Pre-tap: Pericardicentesis catheter was confirmed to be in the pericardial space with injection of agitated saline (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
CXR ([**2117-3-29**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infiltrates on single portable chest view.
Immunophenotyping on Pericardial Fluid [**2117-3-30**] Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this pericardial fluid express immature antigens CD34, myeloid associated antigens CD13.
There are negative for lymphoid associated antigens CD19 (dim) TdT, CD10 (cALLa) negative, CD14, CD41, CD56 and CD64.
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: Acute myelogenous leukemia; correlate with concurrent bone marrow biopsy (S12-20349L).

The perivascular cells are atypical and contain large nuclei, conspicuous nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, dark chromatin and have eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Specimen is only screened for Cryptococcus species.

Patient started on hydroxyurea.
He was then initiated on daunorubicin and ara-C, he had an anaphylactic reaction about 15 minutes into the ara-C therapy, and a code blue was called, although no compressions or intubation were performed.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and stabilized with supportive care, including steroids, nebulizers, benadryl.
The patient was then transferred back to the floor and had decitabine therapy for 5 days, without significant decrease in blast count.
Allergy was consulted and recommended a protocol for desensitization to ara-C, but it was felt that the risks of this protocol outweighed the limited benefit.
He was then started on Mitoxantrone and Etoposide for one night.
A discussion with the family regarding the very limited expected benefit and likely harm of ongoing chemotherapy resulted in the decision to transfer to a more comfort-based approach, in which no more chemotherapy, the patient was made DNR/DNI but antibiotics were continued.
He was placed on a morphine gtt and expired shortly thereafter.
He was broadened with worsening clinical symptoms and chest x-rays to Vancomycin, Meropenem, Levofloxacin and Ambisome, but his clinical status continued to worsen despite these broad-spectrum antibiotics.
He was made CMO and antibiotics were d/c'ed.
# Neutropenic Fever: Mr [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, as discussed above in multifocal pna.
Opening pressure was 10, after drainage was negative.
The pericardial drain was left in for less than a day then removed.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and was transferred to the BMT service for further therapy of his AML.
He was already being covered with vancomycin at this time for neutropenic fever, as discussed elsewhere.
The patient received multiple platelet and PRBC transfusions.
He had acute worsening of his baseline shortness of breath likely secondary to bronchospasm after he received danorubicin and cytarabine (likely cytarabine as the causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**]).
CHRONIC CARE # HLD: restarted home atorvastatin 80 mg daily .
