Admission Date:  [**2179-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-11-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3513**] Chief Complaint: acute renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: hemodialysis PICC line placement Hemodialysis line placement-tunneled catheter to left subclavian Ultrasound guided renal biopsy   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 97626**] [**Known lastname 174**] is a 68-year-old female with known lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
She initially presented in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2177**] to the heme onc clinic with complaing of neck pain due to bulky lymphadenompathy and CT scan revealed extensive lymphadenopathy, more severe in the deep pelvis, but also involved her paraspinal regions, retroperitoneum, inguinal regions as well as porta hepatis.
She was currently thinking about whether or not she wants to have hemodialysis and/or chemotherapy for her lymphoma and is admitted at this time for further management.
This patient is a [**Doctor First Name **] scientist and had refused any treatment in the past; however, with support of her family she opted to commence chemotherapy and was admitted to the heme/onc service.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring because of high risk of TLS as she agreed to have chemotherapy initiated.
In the setting of her renal failure, hemodialysis was required during chemotherapy to clear tumor lysis toxins and preserve renal function during this time.
She received the CVP (cytoxan, vincristine, prednisone) regimen with daily hemodialysis without complication.
She was transferred to the medicine service for monitoring for tumor lysis and for continued hemodialysis until outpatient dialysis is arranged.

Discharge Labs: BLOOD WBC-3.0* RBC-2.80* Hgb-8.9* Hct-27.3* MCV-97 MCH-31.7 MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.6* Plt Ct-158 PT-16.7* PTT-30.3 INR(PT)-1.8 Fibrino-187 Glucose-90 UreaN-32* Creat-4.1* Na-133 K-3.7 Cl-99 HCO3-28 AnGap-10 Calcium-8.8 Phos-3.3 UricAcd-5.6  Brief Hospital Course: Acute Renal failure: The etiology of the acute renal failure is unclear but likely lymphomatous infiltration, urate nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, or acute tubular necrosis that may be reversible after dialysis and reduction of her tumor burden.
She decided to pursue treatment for her lymphoma, so a tunnelled dialysis catheter was placed in the interventional radiology suite, and she commenced hemodialysis on [**2-11**].
She was transferred to the ICU on [**2-12**] to undergo simultaneous chemotherapy (CVP; cytoxan, vincristine, prednisone) and daily hemodialysis.
On [**2178-2-13**], she was transferred to the medicine service to continue monitoring and continue dialysis, preparing for outpatient dialysis.
She finished her chemotherapy course and proceeded to get dialyzed on a M, W, F schedule with concomitant laboratory testing.
Tumor lysis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy laboratory testing were stabilized at discharge and will be monitored at hemodialysis.
She underwent bilateral upper extremity venous mapping to prepare for eventual AV fistula placement and will contine dialysis at an outpatient facility after discharge.
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: It is low grade but she has significant disease, including bulky cervical lymphadenopathy.
She did not desire treatment in the past but decided to proceed with therapy.
Allopurinol was started for tumor lysis syndrome.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2-12**] to begin chemotherapy coupled with hemodialysis and then to the medicine service [**2-14**] for continued monitoring and dialysis.
Platelets and hematocrit briefly decreased secondary to chemotherapy.
She received 1 unit of PRBCs [**2179-2-18**] with hct increase from 24.9 to 28.9.
She did not require cryoprecipitate, FFP, or platelet transfusion and had no acute bleeding.
She was started on nystatin sw/sw for thrush.
She will need CBC, chemistries, electrolytes, serum urate, and PT/PTT drawn at hemodialysis and results should be faxed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21962**].
Her next outpatient chemotherapy will be [**2179-3-5**].
She will continue hemodialysis every M, W, F. She was discharged to inpatient rehab for continued physical therapy.
She was tolerating an oral diet and bowel regimen for occasional constipation.
Verapamil and Atenolol were continued for rate control of atrial fibrillation.
Her hematocrit trended down slowly due to chemotherapy and increased appropriately after transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs (see above).
