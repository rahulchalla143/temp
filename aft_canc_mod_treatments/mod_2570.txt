Admission Date:  [**2105-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-3-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Right ventricular infarct  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra-aortic balloon pump  History of Present Illness: 62 yo M with K-ras WT moderately-differentiated mixed carcinoid/mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma metastatic to peritoneum with peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, iritecan and most recently C3D15 Cetuximab ([**2105-11-26**]), s/p colonic stent placement [**2105-12-7**] for malignant obstruction, also s/p LRD-Renal Xplant [**2080**], HCV, x-fer from [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital1 **] for management of large inferior wall STEMI with BMS to prox RCA, with revascularization resulting in TIMI-1 flow caused by cardiogenic shock.
Pt was hypotensive during procedure  requiring pressors due to large infarct of his right-dominant system, on Dopamine, Levo and Neo, with IABP in place and temporary pacer.
Per pt's wife, he had been complaining o intermittent abdominal pain for several days with recent [**Hospital1 2025**] admissions (discharged [**11-30**] and [**12-16**]) for management of colonic obstruction, first with NGT decompression, then with palliative stenting (on [**12-7**]).
Cath showed R-dominant system w/ 100% prox thrombotic occlusion in RCA and 90% culprit stenosis in proximal to mid vessel treated with single BMS.
As pt was progressively bradycardic thorughout procedure, temporary pacing wire was placed via R femoral vein.
After placement of BMS, pt went into runs of NSVT which broke spontaneously.
Pt was given amiodarone bolus and rhythm was stabilized.
Pt required intubation in CCU and 3 pressor support.
On arrival to CCU, pt was intubated but not sedated, unresponsive to commands or painful stimuli, had bilateral fixed blown pupils, mottled skin, and cold extremities.
Past Medical History: ONC HISTORY: pt underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis in [**2100-5-21**].
On [**2100-6-9**], he underwent right hemicolectomy and regional lymphadenectomy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] was treated with weekly adjuvant 5-FU and leucovorin from [**0-0-0**], but treatment was discontinued after five weeks because of diarrhea and an increase in his creatinine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Kidney transplant [**2080**] from living related donor, doing well.

CARDIOGENIC SHOCK- Etiology of cardiogenic shock is large RV infarct (proximal RCA) of a large R-dominant system, leading to hypotension that requires use of 3 vasopressors.
Pt intubated but not initially sedated; sedation would prove necessary later on.
The patient received atorvastatin, aspirin,and plavix.
Integrillin was run for 18 hours.
Serial ABGs were taken; bicarbonate was given and ventilator settings adjusted based on acidosis.
The patient's pressure was further supported by an intra-aortic balloon pump.
MUCINOUS APPENDICEAL ADENOCARCINOMA- mixed carcinoid/mucinous tumor metastatic to peritoneum, (peritoneal carcinomatosis) s/p FOLFOX, FOLFIRI and irinotecan/cetuximab (stopped for diarrhea and disease progression, respectively).
Per Heme/Onc fellow pt's disease has progressed beyond further chemotherapeutic options and likely focus will be on palliative efforts.
Pt has palliative colonic stent in place as recurrent obstruction not responding to NGT decompression.
Heme/Onc saw patient and family; no further heme/on treatment provided.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE- Chronic allograft nephropathy now complicated by multifactorial acute renal insufficiency, with recent chemotherapeutic regimen nephrotoxicity combined with decreased renal perfusion from hypotension [**3-17**] inferior wall MI and cardiogenic shock contributing to acute decompensation.
