Patient received dose-dense chemotherapy x4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient will have total mastectomy bilateral and immediate breast reconstruction on [**2176-8-5**].
The patient understood the 50% chance of salvage and the possibility of a vein graft in the event that the patient had suffered a venous occlusive problem that might further compromise her flap.
Her pain was controlled with a PCA and with a Sensorcaine pump.
Patient was slightly tachycardic; however, her IV fluids were continued and she settled out.
This was again very closely monitored and her heparin drip was turned off at this time in order to prevent any further blood loss.
The heparin drip had been on to prevent coagulation of the patient's free flaps.
However, when the patient sustained a substantial hematocrit drop, the heparin was discontinued.
Patient's JP drains remained to bulb suction and they were draining adequately.
