She received aggressive IV hydration and diuresis, electrolyte repletion of K, and pamidronate, calcitonin, and kept NPO.
On HD 4 she was taken to the operating room for R upper parathyroidectomy and R thyroid lobectomy; please see operative report for details.
The PTH decreased dramatically on intra-op sample and post-op calcium was 9.9.
The pt remained monitored in the SICU with frequent calcium checks and was provided low-dose po supplementation.
She was completely asymptomatic but was transferred back to the SICU for aggressive repletion and closer observation.
She was begun on a calcium drip, received significant PO and IVF one-time repletions, and calcium level returned to 9.5.
When this trended upwards, the calcium drip was discontinued and the calcium level stabilized.
She was returned to the regular floor on POD 4 with a PO-only regimen which was confirmed to be stable on serial calcium checks.
