The patient is status post median sternotomy.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt presented with profound acidosis [**2-18**] hypercarbic resp failure and was intubated, found to have influenza complicated by newly diagnosed COPD.
Pt was extubated after 5 days but required reintubation [**2-18**] recurrent hypercarbic resp failure in setting of significant valium administration and MS depression.
Second intubation course was prolonged due to depressed MS and likely delayed clearance of benzodiazpines.
Pulm status has been stable since extubation on standing nebs, guaifenesin & pulm toilet.
Pt will need to complete last three days of Prednisone taper, Albuterol & Atrovent nebs & Guaifenesin TID.
# Altered Mental Status: Pt was initially treated with valium due to possible DTs, then required re-intubation for hypercarbic resp failure.
Pt had a prolonged 2nd intubation due to sedation that responded to flumazenil (likely benzo induced MS changes).
Etiology of prolonged MS changes thought due to prolong intubation and ICU stay.
Per neuro surgery, it is very unlikely that osteohemangioma mass is contributing to MS.  Steroids could also be contributing to MS.
Please continue with aggressive rehab.
