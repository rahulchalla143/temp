POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2124-6-8**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2124-6-8**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2124-6-22**]):       YEAST.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 yo man with PMH significant for CML s/p allo SCT approximately 2 1/2 years ago and chronic GVHD on Cellcept/Prednisone, chronic RUQ pain, pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas in sputum, PE on Lovenox, multiple vertebral fractures, and chronic lower extremity edema with intermittent episodes of cellulitis presenting with a multilobar pneumonia and new sternal/vertebral fractures.
#Pneumonia: Pulmonary and ID were consulted to assist with a potential bronchoscopy and antibiotic management.
He was initially treated with Levaquin and ceftazidime until his initial sputum culture was positive for ESBL E. coli.
His antibiotics were then switched to meropenem.
240 cc NS instilled with 60 cc returned.
Post bronchoscopy pt desaturated to 80% requiring NRB with suctioning and nebs up to 96%.
SBP noted to be in the 200s given lopressor 5 mg IV x 1 and hydral 10 mg IV x 1 with SBP subsequently in the 140s.
Also given lasix 20 mg with ~ 1L urine output.
Pt was started on NVPPV which was followed by SBP to 70s.
He was given 500 cc fluids without improvement and was started on levophed 0.04 given concern regarding his fluid/respiratory status with further hydration.
Right arterial line also placed with subsequent SBP to 100s (higher than cuff pressures in the 90s).
He was being treated w/ Meropenem and Voriconazole at that time.
After his (+) B-glucan and since his clinical picture was worsening he underwent BAL to assess for fungal PNA which resulted in his respiratory failure on [**6-8**].
His antibiotic regimen was broadened at that time and included Vancomycin, Meropenem, Voriconazole and Tobramycin.
BAL cultures subsequently grew 2 strains of resistant pseudomonas, sensitive to Tobramycin and Zosyn, antibiotics were changed accordingly.
On [**6-19**] the patient was transferred to the floor on Tobramycin/Zosyn and completed his full course of antibiotics on [**6-24**].
It was recommended that he follow up with pulmonary as an outpatient for prophylactic inhaled tobramycin.
His functional status continued to improve with PT so that by the date of his discharge, he was able to walk >100 feet with a walker and clamshell torso support for his fractures.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt's repiratoty failure was felt to be secondary to components of bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
He tolerated non-invasives on the night of [**6-8**] but had to be intubated to AC on [**6-9**] because of respiratory failure with difficulty ventilating, increased work of breathing and rising PCO2.
The reason for failure was thought to be a combination of his COPD (needing PEEP), moderate to large amount of secretions because of his ongoing PNA and persistent pulmonary edema.
On [**6-15**] he was taken of non-invasives and continued to tolerate high flow O2 during the day, requiring BiPAP 11/5 only at night because of prolonged work of breathing causing him to tire and hypercapnia secondary to this.
#Pain control:  A CT scan performed on admission showed a new sternum fracture and several compression fractures from chronic steroid use.
He pain was controlled with fentanyl 300mcg q48 and morphine IR 45 mg q2 PRN.
His lyrica was also increased to 150mg QID.
His prn dosing of morphine IR was changed to 60mg q4h prn.
#Cellulitis:  He completed his previous course of linezolid for cellulitis during this hospitalization.
His Lovenox was held initially on admission due to profuse bleeding from his right leg ulcer.
He was continued on lovenox for the remainder of his admission, but at a dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **] which is lower than the normal treatment dose for DVTs due to his propensity .
# CML/Chronic GVHD:  We continued his home prednisone 10mg daily and Cellcept 500mg twice daily.
Pt has was on multiple prophylactic medications including acyclovir, bactrim and voriconazole.
Stress dose steroid were weaned to pt's regular dose of prednisone.
Cellcept was continued and budesonide re-started when patient was able to take PO.
His prophylaxis was continued throughout the remainder of his admission.
On [**6-28**], it was felt that his continued O2 requirement may have been due to GVHD of the lung, and he was pulsed with 40mg of prednisone for 2 days with a taper.
#Hypotension: On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was hypotensive, on levophed drip, in the setting of antihypertensives and diuresis following bronchoscopy.
Worsening infection, post-procedure increased inflammatory response and relative adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steroids, not started on stress dose pre-procedure) may have all contributed in the acute setting.
He was started on hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6h for stress presumed adrenal insuficiency.
He was succesfully weaned of the levo drip on [**6-10**].
After hypotension resolved and pt was weaned off pressors his BP started to rise steadily.
On [**6-13**] SBP was consistently in the 130-180s and metoprolol 25mg TID was started ([**11-19**] pt's reg dose), BP remained high and on [**6-14**] metoprolol was increased to 50mg TID.
He  remained afebrile w/ stable WBC and was started on Vancomycin for empiric treatment of MRSA cellulitis as recommended by ID.
# Transaminitis: Patient had AST, ALT, AP and LDH that were mildly elevated from previous measurements.
