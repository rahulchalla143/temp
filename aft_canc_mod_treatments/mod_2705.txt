The CT demonstrated two dominant and large pelvic masses, the right measuring 11.7 x 18.5 x 22.0 cm in size.
The pt underwent an EGD on HD#2 at which point an ulcerated, fungating and infiltrative mass w/ malignant appearance was noted in the stomach body and cardia.
The heme/onc service was also consulted regarding the pt's condition and, conjointly, the decision was made to take the pt to the OR for a debulking procedure both for symptomatic relief for the pt as well as to decrease her tumor burden for possible chemotherapy and ascertain more definitively the extent of peritoneal disease.
Also, it was felt that if the ovarian metastases were the only areas of extensive disease, then a gastrectomy performed in the near-future may be able to render the pt w/ no evidence of disease.
The pt did receive a large amount of IV fluids intraoperatively, and a CXR obtained in the PACU demonstrated moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
It was felt that the pt's O2 requirement was secondary to volume overload and she was given 10 mg of lasix in the PACU to help reverse this.
She was tolerating a full diet, her pain was well controlled w/ oral medications, and she was ambulating and voiding without difficulty on POD#3.
She has an appointment to follow-up with the hematology/oncology team on [**4-25**] at 9:30 am to discuss chemotherapy options.
