Improved on 5L NC and treated empirically with Lasix and Levofloxaicn.
She was given Vancomycin 1gm IV for possible pneumonia and was admitted to the MICU for possible thoracentesis and further management.

She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of ongoing hypoxia with oncology and interventional pulmonology following.
Interventional pulmonology placed a Pleurex drain (on left).
The drain put out an initial 2L, but then was non-productive for 36 hours and at the request of the family was removed for comfort of the patient.

There was clear confirmation from the family that the patient would not want to be in the hospital anymore, that she would not want the pleurex drain in, nor would she want blood draws, chemotherapy side effects, or anymore invasive investigations into the origin of her malignancy.
