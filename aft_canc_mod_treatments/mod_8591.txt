Admission Date:  [**2148-10-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-11-2**]   Service:  Surgery, Purple Team  ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Colon cancer, status post right colectomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old man who was found to have a cecal lesion during colonoscopy for anemia.
Given the lesion which was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the colon, he was scheduled for a right colectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
His cardiac history is significant for a myocardial infarction in [**2131**] for which he subsequently underwent bypass surgery.
He had a Holter monitor examination which revealed ventricular ectopy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, episodes of AV nodal Wenckebach for which he underwent an exercise echocardiogram which demonstrated that the patient could only exercise for two minutes and again had premature ventricular contractions, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and sinus bradycardia with Wenckebach.
Given all of this, it was felt that the patient had a sick sinus syndrome and AV nodal disease with significant chronotropic incompetence, for which he underwent Electrophysiology evaluation for pacemaker placement.
However, given the fact that he needed a colon resection in the near future, Electrophysiology did not want to place a pacemaker in him prior to the resection because of concerns related to infection with the pacemaker.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2141**] (saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal), status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stent.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  His medications on admission included Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., lisinopril 70 mg p.o.
q.d., Imdur 30 mg p.o.
q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was given a Fleets preparation kit the day prior to surgery and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**10-25**] for a colectomy.
On [**10-25**], the patient underwent a right colectomy for right colon cancer by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], assisted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed postoperatively in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring given concerns over his cardiac status, as well as the fact that intraoperatively the patient had bradycardia to the 30s.
He was also hypertensive requiring a nitroglycerin drip for control of his blood pressure.
Immediately postoperatively, he was on a nitroglycerin drip for control of his blood pressure.
until return of bowel function was noted with nasogastric tube decompression of his stomach.
Cardiology recommendations were for beta blockers and conversion to nitroglycerin paste from nitroglycerin, as well as the addition of aspirin and Accupril for control of his blood pressure.
Recommendations were also to maintain hematocrit above 30 and for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in the future.
By postoperative day four he was off of his nitroglycerin.
On postoperative day four his nasogastric tube was also removed, and by postoperative day five he was transferred to the floor.
