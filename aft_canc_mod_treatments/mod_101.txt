# Anorexia, Fatigue, nightsweats, mild DOE # Eosinophilia Given the subacute nature of her presentation and climbing eosinophilia, there was concern for the possibility of fungal lung infection.
Interventional Pulmonary was consulted, and pt underwent flexible bronchoscopy with biopsies and BAL for micro.
She tolerated the procedure well, but had a pneumothorax following the procedure.
A follow up repeat CXR was obtained, which showed an increase in the size of the pneumothorax, and therefore Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter to treat.
Her pneumothorax remained stable with the chest tube in place, and the chest tube was removed on the day of discharge.
# Lung CA - prior slow progressive adenoCA with now noted new, more aggressive squammous cell CA.
After d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he was concerned about possible leptomeningeal spread of malignancy given her constellation of symptoms, and he requested MRI head.
# Hypothyroidism - continued home dose synthroid in-house.
# HLP - continued home dose lovastatin .
# HTN - continued home BP regimen (metoprolol, enalpril, amlodipine).
