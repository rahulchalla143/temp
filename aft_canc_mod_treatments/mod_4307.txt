When discharged from the hospital, pain was well-controlled on oxycodone and acetominophen, he was tolerating a regular diet, and vital signs were stable.
Past Medical History: hepatocellular carcinoma, s/p right hepatectomy [**2138-11-7**], hepatitis B, benign prostatic hypertrophy, elevated PSA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, appendectomy  Social History: He is married with 2 children.
He has had blood transfusions 40 years ago.
gen: in distress due to pain, moaning HEENT: sclera icteric, EOMI, mucous membranes dry cardiac: RRR chest: CTAB abd: +BS, mildly distended, diffusely tender to light palpation with guarding throughout, maximal in LUQ, no rebound; incision C/D/I with steri-strips and sutures; no current fluid drainage from incision ext: warm, well-perfused, 2+ pitting edema   Pertinent Results: [**2138-11-25**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Technically successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of 650 cc of cloudy [**Location (un) 2452**]-yellow fluid from a perihepatic collection and placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] drainage catheter.
Status post right hepatectomy with large complex fluid collection in the post-surgical bed measuring up to 8.8 cm in size.
There was dark blood in the diverticulum as well as diffuse, surrounding erosions and scar c/w recent embolization.
Homogenous fluid collection in surgical bed of right hepatectomy decreased in size with no focal hypodensities of concern.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was evaluated in the ED on [**2138-11-25**] and started empirically on vancomycin and Zosyn.
Patient underwent ultrasound-guided drain placement with drainage of 650 cc of peritoneal fluid, which revealed [**Numeric Identifier 87932**] WBCs and rare ESBL E Coli, consistent with secondary peritonitis.
On [**11-28**] vancomycin was discontinued, while Zosyn was continued due to final culture results.
Consequently, a HIT panel was sent and Zosyn was changed to Meropenem due to its association with thrombocytopenia.
The HIT antibody was positive, pending serotonin release assay results, and [**Location (un) 2274**] Hematology was consulted, who recommended initiation of bivalrudin given association of HIT with thrombotic events.
In order to transition to oral anticoagulation warfarin was started at 2.5 mg on [**12-3**].
On [**12-5**] bivalrudin was discontinued in the morning.
INR was measured at 7.7 and rechecked at 10.5 and 9.4, and anticoagulation was held.
2u FFP were given with a decrease in INR to 2.5 and vitamin K was administered.
Patient was transferred to the ICU, where he received IVF and blood products and was started on a PPI drip.
He had an ulcerated diverticulum adjacent to the ampulla.
Therefore angiography was performed by IR, which involved embolizing the gastroduodenal artery and subsegmental branches of the right hepatic artery.
He was hemodynamically stable after the procedure with HCT of 33.
H pylori antibody was positive and, in view of ulceration, H pylori antibiotic treatment was initiated.
He was intubated for airway protection in the setting of bleeding and worsening confusion.
A central line was placed.
No bleeding was identified and no further emoblization was performed out of concern for duodenal necrosis.
On [**12-13**] patient had a repeat massive UGIB, which responded to blood products.
[**12-14**]: Patient continued to bleed from NGT and per rectum with labile BP despite high dose pressors and 3u pRBC and 4u FFP.
