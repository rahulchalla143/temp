HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent induction with Ara-C and idarubicin 7+3.
Follow-up marrow results done to show if there was appropriate recovery of the bone marrow were still pending, though clinical picture suggested that the normal cells have returned; though, the question as to whether there are additional leukemoid cells has not yet been determined.
The patient was to follow up in about one week's time to begin his consolidation chemotherapy which was to be done as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient received multiple platelet and blood transfusions as supportive treatment for his ablative process as associated with his chemotherapy.
The patient was treated first with linezolid and then switched to Synercid because the enterococcus was found to be sensitive to that antibiotic, and the concern about linezolid was that it had myelosuppressive effects.
The patient will undergo 14 days of therapy of Synercid, dating from the point at which he was found to have negative blood cultures on [**Month (only) 116**], so that he will have his last day of Synercid (as mentioned before of 600 mg intravenously q.8h.)
The patient was also treated with acyclovir 400 mg p.o.
He was covered empirically with other antibiotics as per protocol related to being neutropenic and then having an neutropenic fever until cultures were identified.
It should be noted that stool culture also showed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; however, his catheter tip remained negative.
He was maintained with prednisone and hydrocortisone throughout his admission.
For a time, he had received hydrocortisone 25 mg intravenously q.8h.
He was then converted to prednisone 10 mg p.o.
Then, before the surgery, 100 mg intravenously q.8h., down to 50 mg intravenously q.8h., and eventually back down to prednisone 5 mg q.a.m.
The patient was keep off of his Florinef until the day before discharge when he was started on 0.025 mg p.o.
He was also supplemented with potassium chloride for his consistent low potassium of 30 mEq of p.o.
Because he was unwilling or unable to take the potassium by mouth during the hospital stay, he was given potassium chloride as replacement fluids.
However, again, on discharge, he left with the prescription of potassium chloride 30 mEq p.o.
For nausea and vomiting, the patient was given Reglan and carafate which he said did not help him particularly.
He also was given Ativan 1 mg to 2 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**5-8**], for evaluation and planning for his next round of consolidation chemotherapy.
