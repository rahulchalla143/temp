Admission Date:  [**2187-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Newly diagnosed biliary ductal mass - noted to be consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, initially here for PTC placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2187-9-24**]:  Internal-external drain placement in the right anterior and left intrahepatic biliary system and external drain placement in the right posterior biliary system.
[**2187-10-1**]: Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal hematoma, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.
[**2187-10-5**]: Cholangiogram with internalization of R. posterior PTC   History of Present Illness: Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4727**] note, this is a 52 y/o woman who presented with painless jaundice and pruritus.
More distally, however, the proximal right anterior and left main portal veins were thought to be occluded with more distal reconstitution beyond the hilum.
The anterior right segment of the liver, especially segment VIII, are mildly atrophic with prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and attenuated in segment portal branches and associated increased compensatory arterial enhancement.
She was subsequently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] where she underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.
She had bleeding from a branch of the left hepatic artery after the PTC requiring embolization of a small branch of the left hepatic artery supplying the left lateral segment (segments II and III).
The rising bilirubin was thought to either be representative of absorption of the hematoma or compromised liver function post embolization or a combination.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Alert and oriented; no acute distress; obviously jaundiced HEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; scleral icterus present; no occular or nasal discharge; thyroid without enlargemement or masses CV: Regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, PTC catheters in R. abdomen capped and without leakage; incision along R. costal border clean and with steri strips in place - small amount of serous drainage from pin-point are [**2-12**] of the way along the incision from the R. with no fluid collection palpated and no fluctuance noted; no surrounding erythema; R. flank ecchymoses extendes to midline of back and resolving EXTREMITIES: No swelling or edema bilaterally   Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2187-9-23**] WBC-9.0 RBC-3.98* Hgb-12.3 Hct-36.8 MCV-93 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.4 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-199 PT-15.7* PTT-25.6 INR(PT)-1.4* Glucose-350* UreaN-7 Creat-0.4 Na-135 K-4.2 Cl-96 HCO3-27 AnGap-16 ALT-39 AST-44* AlkPhos-235* Amylase-520* TotBili-18.8* Lipase-905* Albumin-3.1* Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.1 Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old female admitted with jaundice, and status post ERCP demonstrating an intra-hepatic biliary mass concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
Initially her admissison was for placement of percutaneous biliary drains.
On [**2187-9-24**] she went for placement of the drains and she underwent successful placement of internal-external biliary drainage catheters in the right anterior and left hepatic ducts, and external drainage catheter in the right posterior intrahepatic biliary ducts.
The patient's post-procedure course was complicated by blood noted in her drains and transfer to the ICU for hemodynamic instability (Hct of 23.7) secondary to bleeding from a small branch of the L. hepatic artery (likely trangressed along the course of the L. PTBD catheter).
8 units of PRBCS were transfused as well as 3 units of FFP.
The bleeding vessel was localized on angiogram and successfully coil embolized by IR on [**2187-9-25**].
She was advanced to a regular diet on [**2187-9-29**] (day #4 post-placement of PTCs) and placed on a regimen of 40mg IV Lasix twice daily for lower extremity swelling/edema.
Intra-operatively ultrasound demonstrated the mass at the hilum with involvement of the right anterior and right posterior portal veins and with significant involvement of the left portal vein up to the bifurcation into the left lateral and left medial segment veins in the umbilical fissure.
Therefore the tumor was deemed unresectable as it was unlikely that her liver would tolerate a hepatic resection whether a right lobe or trisegmentectomy and no attempts at debulking were made.
She was started on a clear liquid diet which she tolerated well, and TPN.
20mg IV Lasix twice daily was begun to address her continued lower extremity edema.
The following day the patient continued to do well, was started on a regular diet, and began Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily prophylactically as her R. posterior PTC and L. hepatic PTC were noted to have decreased output (output from the R. anterior drain remained high)in addition to upward trending serum bilirubin levels (elevated to 20.3).
At the time the R. posterior biliary drain was noted to be displaced, and it was replaced with an 8-french internal-external biliary drain.
Following the procedure the patient did well, her serum bilirubin began trending down, and her R. posterior and L. biliary drains were capped on post-op days 6 and 7 (respectively).
TPN was discontinued on post-op day #4 as she was taking good PO, and the patient was able to ambulate independently.
Ursodiol 300mg PO TID was begun on post-op day 7 for her elevated bilirubin levels although through-out her hospital course the patient denied itching or other symptoms of hyperbilirubinemia.
At this point the patient was deemed stable for discharge to home, and her third PTC drain (R. anterior biliary drain) was capped.
She will follow-up as an outpatient for permenant metal abdominal stent placements at a future date.
