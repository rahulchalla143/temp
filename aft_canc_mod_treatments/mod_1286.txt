Admission Date:  [**2152-7-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-7-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Anesthesia IV Set-Clamp / Flagyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Rapid heartrate  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 36698**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old lady, with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and GI bleed (not currently anticoagulated), who was discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2152-7-14**] after admission for afib w/ RVR, attributed to a urinary tract infection, which converted in the ED after diltiazem, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics for her UTI, now readmitted with afib with RVR, with increasing oxygen requirement.
She had already started taking PO Bactrim, as prescribed by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after failure to improve, and was found to be in afib with RVR.
She was initially treated with fluid boluses (total 4L) to keep her SBP > 90, as well as diltiazem 10 mg IVP x2, diltiazem 30 mg and ceftriaxone.
Over the course of the admission, she was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and not started on another rate control medications given HR in the 60s after she converted.
She was continued on Bactrim through her admission and discharge home to continue treatment.
Per her daughter, she was doing well yesterday but did have a fever up to 101.3 last night, which responded to Tylenol x2.
Upon arrival to the ED, she received another 15 mg of IV dilt.
No lasix was given because of borderline SBP (upper 80s to 100s).
She was placed on a dilt gtt after ED resident spoke with cardiology fellow.
Due to volume overload and pulmonary edema apparent on physical exam, she was given furosemide 40 mg IV x1.
Additionally, given the question of pneumonia on her chest x-ray, she was started on empiric coverage for HCAP with cefepime/vancomycin/azithromycin.
ROS negative for history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Ms. [**Known lastname 36698**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yoF with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and GI bleed (not anticoagulated), who was discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2152-7-14**] after admission for afib w/ RVR, attributed to a urinary tract infection, which converted in the ED after diltiazem, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics for her UTI, readmitted with afib with RVR, with increasing oxygen requirement.
Active Issues: # Afib with RVR: Initially refractory to IV diltiazem, metoprolol, esmolol.
She received digoxin loading doses x3, amiodarone bolus (on amiodarone at home) and was started on IV amiodarone gtt.
She was evaluated by the EP service, who felt that digoxin may actually worsen her cardiac output due to her underlying diastolic dysfunction seen on TTE.
Digoxin was discontinued and she was started on propanolol PO with good rate control.
Cardioversion was planned but she spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm on [**7-20**].
Patient was transitioned to propranolol LA 60mg po BID and continued to maintain sinus rhythm with normal rate.
Amiodarone was decreased back to home dose of 100mg po daily.
She was started on coumadin, and INR on day of discharge was 2.3.
She was discharged on coumadin 2.5 mg. .
She had a high O2 requirement with non-rebreather mask for several days despite diuresis with lasix and antibiotics, which raised concern for possible underlying PE.
Could not obtain CT PE to confirm due to renal failure, so she was empirically started on IV heparin.
# Pneumonia: CXR on admission showed pulmonary edema with bilateral lower lobe opacities, and pneumonia could not be excluded.
Given her high O2 requirement and recent hospitalization, she was empirically treated with IV vancomycin/cefepime.
On HD#4 she was transitioned to PO levofloxacin.
# Anticoagulation: Pt had discontinued ASA and coumadin [**1-12**] GIB in [**Month (only) 958**].
She was started on IV heparin due to concern for PE.
After discussion with pt and family, anticoagulation was continued due to patient's prolonged period of atrial fibrillation.
# Hypertension: Home lisinopril and amlodipine were held due to starting propanolol for rate control.
Patient was restarted on lisinopril at 20mg po daily (home dose 40mg po daily) prior to discharge.
She should follow up with her primary care physician regarding need for restarting/increasing doses of these medications as an outpatient.
Attempted to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding restarting medication as an outpatient and follow-up.
