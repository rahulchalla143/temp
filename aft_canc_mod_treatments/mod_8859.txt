The Endocrinology advice regarding the elevated TSH was to repeat free T4 levels and TSH levels in four to six weeks and the addition of Thyroxin supplement which is 150 micrograms of Synthroid q. day was to be given when the patient is not receiving tube feeds and to be given alone rather than mixed with any other medication, especially calcium, as calcium impairs thyroxine absorption.
