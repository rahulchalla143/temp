#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21 most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of Neulasta use.
She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased ostomy output.
When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was discontinued.
We also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative.
She was continued on Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than 48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding to IVF boluses.
She refused central line placement in the ED and peripheral pressors were initiated.
She was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension.
She was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off pressors the night of admission to the ICU.
Her cuff and a-line pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line was discontinued.
Most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at home doses.
# Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.
