Admission Date:  [**2122-9-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2122-10-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-8-30**]       Sex:  F  Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer with bony metastases who presents to the Oncology Service as a transfer from surgery for initiation of chemotherapy.
She was initially scheduled for a VATS procedure on [**9-18**], but was admitted to an outside hospital on [**9-16**] with worsening shortness of breath and severe dysphagia and a temperature to 102.0.
She was started on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin at that time for a question of a post obstructive pneumonia and was subsequently transferred mediastinoscopy.
The patient was found to have dysarthric speech and to have dysphagia for solids and liquids as well as to have persistent right tongue deviation.
She has no complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or sweats.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM SURGERY:  Clindamycin 600 mg intravenous q 8 day number 8.
Cefuroxime 750 mg intravenous q 8 day number 8.
Remeron 7.5 mg po q.d., Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., MS Contin 15 mg po q.a.m., 30 mg po q.p.m., Heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d., BuSpar 5 mg po q 12 hours, Protonix 40 mg po q.d., Ativan 0.5 mg po q 12 hours, D5 half normal saline plus 20 milliequivalents of K-Ciel at 75 cc per hour intravenous fluids.
Percocet one to two tabs po q 3 to 4 hours prn.
Morphine sulfate 2 to 4 mg IM/subQ q 3 to 4 hours prn, Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn wheezing.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit 28.8, platelets 166, sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6, glucose 81, ionized calcium 1.32, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.1, INR 1.3, total bilirubin 0.8, AST 29, ALT 16, alkaline phosphatase 118, albumin 2.7, TSH 11.0, uric acid 3.2, ammonia of 50.
Significant interventions at [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital included transfusion of two units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 24%.
She underwent chemotherapy with etoposide from [**9-27**] to [**2122-9-29**] and carboplatin on [**2122-9-26**].
She also underwent whole brain x-ray therapy for presumed leptomeningeal disease as the source of her cranial nerve deficits causing dysphagia.
It was attributed to either medications, the patient's hypothyroidism, which was treated with Levoxyl and/or initial hypercalcemia, which was treated and corrected appropriately with Pamidronate.
The patient's medications were converted to intravenous or per duotube.
The patient was put on aspiration precautions.
A duotube was placed several days into the admission for purposes of nutrition.
Subsequent to that a PEG tube was placed for more long term nutritional needs.
The patient was treated with free water restriction as well as with demeclocycline.
Infectious disease:  The patient completed a fifteen day course of Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for bilateral pneumonia diagnosed at the outside hospital.
On [**2122-10-7**] approximately eight days after completing chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide, the patient spiked a fever to 100.1 while neutropenic.
She was started empirically on Ceftazidime and cultures were sent.
Post chemotherapy the patient required transfusion for a hematocrit of 23 on [**2122-10-7**].
Pulmonary:  The patient experienced an episode of acute respiratory failure with left lung collapse following PEG tube placement on [**2122-10-5**].
The patient did, however, have evidence of a persistent left lower lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
The patient will in the future require aggressive oropharyngeal suctioning, aspiration precautions as well as avoidance of all po medications until the dysphagia is resolved.
It remains unclear whether the patient will regain her ability to swallow and a trach tube may need to be entertained ultimately for assurance of adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
