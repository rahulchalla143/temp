A pleuracentesis was performed initially on presentation to the ED which demonstrated predominantly a bloody effusion (no cultures available).
The patient was supported with oxygen to maintain an O2 sat > 90%.
The patient had a number of plain films performed which demonstrated increased interstitial markings, likely representing edema vs. lymphangiectasia.
The cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who placed the pleurex catheter was contact[**Name (NI) **] to ensure the catheter was in good position and functioning properly.
Aggressive measures were not carried out and the patient was made comfortable with morphine per her request.
This was additonally in the setting of recent initiation of lasix and zaroxolyn for anasarca, which were held given the patient's hypotension.
The patient was given small boluses of fluid as needed, but aggressive IV hydration was avoided given the patient's gross anasarca.
This was thought likely to represent renal failure from a prerenal etiology and improved with volume resuscitation.
Given her rapid clinical deteriation throughout her admission, it was deemed that additional chemotherapy was not appropriate as toxicity would far outweigh any benefit.
