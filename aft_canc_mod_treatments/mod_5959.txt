EEG [**2158-2-7**]: ABNORMALITY #1: A [**3-16**] Hz slow and disorganized background rhythm was noted in the waking state, which increased by [**12-13**] Hz with external stimulation.
He was started on decadron and mannitol and transfused two more packs of platelets to reach goal plts>100k.
The mannitol was weaned off.
Given the edema, brain radiation was determined to be contraindicated at this time by discussions between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] (neuro-oncology) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (primary oncologist), though this may be possible in the future.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 27580**]) will need to be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the extended care facility to assist with chemotherapy treatment, which will likely be an oral mediation regimen dosed daily.
Hospital course was also notable for: 1. hypertension - treated with metoprolol and captopril for goal SBP<140 2. atrial tachycardia - also treated with metoprolol 3.
NSVT - improving with treatment of hypokalemia (see below) 4. hypokalemia - On transfer to the floor from the ICU, the patient was noted to have a drop in potassium over one day from 3.6 to 2.6.
They felt that the hypokalemia was likely due to urine losses from polyuria due to administration of mannitol and decadron.
He was started on standing repletion of K (40meq po bid), prn repletion of Mg (to >2), and the mannitol was discontinued.
SPEP was negatve; UPEP showed "MULTIPLE PROTEIN BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN PREDOMINATING", "TWO TRACE BANDS ARE SEEN WHICH STAIN WITH KAPPA BUT DO NOT STAIN WELL WITH FREE KAPPA.
6. pain control - pain was thought to be secondary to multiple hepatic metastases.
It improved with ultram but persisted.
MSContin was started on [**2-8**] and may need to be titrated upward for pain control.
He had poor po intake when left to himself; he needs feeding supervision to encourage po intake and has done well with the nurses and aides assisting.
