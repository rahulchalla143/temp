Past Medical History: - h/o cardiac arrest: asystolic ([**2128-3-20**]) - Respiratory failure, chronically ventilated after failure to wean following surgery at [**Hospital1 2177**] - Small subsegmental PE: tx'd w/ lovenox bridged to coumadin (held [**3-29**]) - h/o Pneumothorax: s/p chest tube [**Date range (1) 65044**] - h/o perforated sigmoid colon s/p resection and colostomy - h/o bacteremia [**3-19**] line infection and diverticulitis - h/o probable VAP ([**3-24**]): Sputum cx w/ acinetobacter [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to Gentamicin and MSSA; but since patient MRSA+ she was treated w/ vancomycin and gent - COPD (steroid dependent) - B12 deficiency - fractured right ankle [**2126**] - MRSA in nares - anxiety - depression - HTN - atrial fibrillation .
Apparently intubated for respiratory failure in setting EtOH withdrawal and DT's.
post-op she could not be weaned off the vent and underwent trach and PEG tube on [**2128-2-5**].
CXR: no CHF or infiltrate, trach tube appears in good position .
PERIPHERAL SMEAR/FLOW CYTOMETRY: immature cell forms; Flow cytometry on peripheral blood showed half lymphocytes are abnormal/lymphoma cells; final heme/path report pending.
This was thought likely to be related to anticoagulation received for PE which was started on recent hospital admission.
s/p drainage by surgery in ED (>200cc drained).
Hematocrit dropped during admission, requiring a total of 7units PRBC transfusions throughout entire admission.
On [**2128-4-1**], patient went to OR with vascular surgery s/p evacuation of hematoma and placement of JP drain.
Anticoagulation was continued to be held at the time discharge.
Removable IVC filter was placed in OR by vascular surgery on [**2128-4-1**].
She was continued on Gentamicin and vancomycin started on her last admission for her known VAP of acinetobacter and MSSA (although has h/o MRSA).
Antibiotics were discontinued after a 14 day course.
After further discussion with the family, they wish to make sure the patient is "comfortable," and do not wish to pursue aggressive treatments given her poor overall prognosis.
She was started on lovenox during her last admission with a bridge to coumadin.
Her anticoagulation was held on this admission given her RLE bleeding.
As mentioned above, an IVC filter was placed for further prophylaxis.
She is now off anticoagulation as above due to active bleeding.
#) FEN: She was continued on tube feeds during this admission.
