Spleen, total splenectomy ([**2105**] grams) (D-I, M-U) and  VI.
-Note 1: H&E sections of splenic tissue demonstrate marked red pulp congestion with extensive interstitial fibrosis.
Scattered histiocytes with ingested hematopoietic precursors (hemophagocytic histiocytes) are seen.
Some form focal granulomas, including an occasional large necrotizing one with palisading histiocytes (slide M).
Special stains for microorganisms (acid fast bacilli, fungal and parasite: AFB, GMS, and Giemsa) are negative with adequate controls.
By immunohistochemistry performed on block from splenic section H, LCA (CD45) highlights scattered lymphoid cells.
MPO highlights numerous granulocytes, while CD68 stains histiocytes.
By immunohistochemical staining performed on lymph node block S, a focal are of large atypical cells with markedly convoluted nuclei and prominent nucleoli are noted on CD20 immunostaining.
[**Doctor Last Name 10165**] reviewed Parts IV and V. Hempath note (for liver biopsy):  Diagnostic features of lymphoma are not seen.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation  Bone Marrow Biospy [**2130-4-21**]: ==============    DIAGNOSIS     ============  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MYELOID AND MEGAKARYOCYTIC HYPERPLASIA AND FREQUENT HEMOPHAGOCYTIC HISTIOCYTES HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROME).
Tubules show vacuolar change, as well as intralumenal necrotic debris and red blood cells; other signs of acute injury, including occasional single-cell necrosis are also seen.
Hepatosplenomegaly with heterogeneous signal and enhancement of both liver and spleen probably due to lymphoma.
Given the patient's multiple other medication allergies as well as development of rash immediately after administration of gadolinium, premedication for allergic reaction would be recommended should the patient again receive IV gadolinium.
Interval splenectomy with splenic vein clot.
Given he was neutropenic at the time he was admitted to the oncology service and treated with multiple broad spectrum antimicrobials including cefepime, aztreonam ([**Date range (1) 27094**]), vancomycin([**Date range (1) 22023**]), metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 82515**]), azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 82516**]), and voriconazole ([**Date range (1) 82517**]) and never had abatement of his fevers.
Therefore, the patient was started on a steroid taper and had a splenectomy as his splenomegaly was thought to be contributing to his persistent abdominal pain and intraoperative biopsies would help with diagnostic evaluation.
Therefore, he had a splenectomy on [**2130-4-11**].
Following splenectomy and while on steroid taper the patient did well and from [**Date range (1) 82518**] he was afebrile (antibiotics had been stopped on [**2130-4-14**]).
Unfortunately, on [**2130-4-17**] he once again had fevers and was restarted on broad spectrum antibiotics (aztreonam/vancomycin then levofloxacin).
2) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis:  A presumptive diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made on [**2130-4-21**] from bone marrow biopsies showing hemophagocytosis and splenectomy results as well as fulminant hepatic injury and the elevated ferritin.
The patient was started on high dose steroids and etoposide per protocol and after first doses, which were adjusted for hepatic and renal dysfunction, was put on twice weekly etoposide and a steroid taper.
He tolerated the steroid therapy and etoposide well.
Plan is to start cyclosporin per protocol as renal function improves.
Cr improved improved to 1.8 at the time of discharge with conservative management (primarily avoidance of nephrotoxins).
The patient did have some issues with hyperkalemia after developing renal failure but never any ECG changes and this resolved as renal function trended back toward normal and the patient was put on a low K diet.
Repeat urine protein/Cr measurement was improved.
The patient improved from both these incidents with minimal direct management and his oxygen requirements simply decreased to baseline each time.
As his hospitalization progressed and other etiologies of HLH were ruled out this was considered a possible precipitant of the HLH.
Further specific treatment for his Hodgkin's lymphoma will be pending treatment of his HLH.
In consultation with the pain management service in the context of his splenectomy he was on PCA, which was then transitioned to extended release morphine and hydromorphone PRN.
With these interventions his pain steadily improved after his splenectomy and he was discharged just on scheduled morphine SR for his chronic abdominal pain.
He received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and PPI for GI prophylaxis.

You went on to have a splenectomy and briefly improved before having fevers again and worsening liver enzymes.
