Admission Date:  [**2148-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-5-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: fever, neutropenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture x 3 PICC line placement Bone Marrow Biopsy x 2 Itrathecal Chemotherapy with Methotrexate Initiation of radiation therapy to right arm  History of Present Illness: 35 y.o.
At that point she felt tired but otherwise well without localizing symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, etc...).
She received Cefepime 2gm IV, vanco 1gm IV, decadron 10mg IV, and tylenol.
She had just finished steroid taper and had been on levofloxacin for suppressive therapy.
Treatments so far include -high dose steroids [**7-12**] -Nitrogen Mustard [**7-19**] -CHOP [**7-25**].
She later was treated with G-CSF and her counts improved.
She tolerated these therapies well with only some GI toxicity and mild mucositis after the methotrexate.
At the same time work up of her right radial nerve palsy (see below) led to suspicion of progressive neurologic disease despite previous chemotherapy.
Thus as she began to recover from her nadir with the help of G-CSF the plan was made to start steroid therapy for her suspected continued neurologic disease and proceed to IT AraC and ESHAP.
The patient defervesced on steroid therapy and the plan was made to continue to IT Ara C in a few days and ESHAP in approximately a week of discharge.
Her brain MR was negative for focal findings but additional work up with lumbar punctures revealed CNS disease and required additional treatment with [**Hospital1 **] and intrathecal methotrexate on day 1 and high dose methotrexate on day 10.
This revealed an enterococcal urinary tract infection for which she was treated with vancomycin and then ampicillin after sensitivities returned.
She never defervesced and as she became more neutropenic her coverage was broadened to include broad spectrum antibiotics as well as fungal coverage.
As her cytopenias resolved and a high suspicion of progressive neurologic lymphoma arose her antimicrobials were eventually decreased to levofloxacin and voriconazole, which she continued on discharge.
At this point progressive lymphoma was considered the most likely etiology of her fevers but she was continued on antimicrobials given the inability to completely rule out infection.
Her fevers only resolved with the initiation of steroid therapy two days before discharge.
She was treated empirically on admission with vancomycin and cefepime IV and remained hemodynamically stable overnight.
Bone marrow infarction: Around day +10 from her first cycle of CHOP and while on treatment with G-CSF she developed rapidly rising LDH, severe bony pain, and fever.
She received supportive care with fluids, analgesia with a Dilaudid PCA, and fever control.
The main complication of this was urinary retention requiring the placement of a Foley catheter.
She was continued on Morphine SR for continued bone pain throughout her hospitalization and with this the pain was well managed.
Because of no improvement in the right arm symptoms with treatment with [**Hospital1 **] and high dose Methotrexate, Neuro-oncology was consulted and diagnosed a right radial nerve palsy.
The patient had received only a few sessions of XRT at discharge and no interval change in right radial nerve palsy though in regards to function and pain it was much improved with use of a soft splint.
Right pleural effusion: This was found incidentally on imaging and pulmonology was consulted and performed a pleurocentesis on [**2148-8-18**].
Final results revealed normal fluid and this was resolved on her next CT scan.
The pain responded well to gabapentin and amitriptyline therapy and she was discharged on these medications.
Hemorrhoids: The patient had dealt with hemorrhoids in the past.
These flared with some incidents of diarrhea during her [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy and had large inflamed hemorrhoids.
Mucositis: Had some mild mucositis during HD methotrexate therapy.
Access: The patient initially had a right sided PICC line that developed pain and poor function.
She received local therapies for pain and this resolved.
A left sided PICC was then placed that functioned well for the remainder of the hospitalization and was present on discharge.
Prophylaxis: Patient received her inhaled Pentamadine on [**2148-9-9**] for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
She ambulated for DVT prophylaxis.
She remained on her home PPI throughout the hospitalization.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis was acyclovir as described above.
She never received antibacterial prophylaxis as she was always was on treatment doses of antibiotics for fevers when she became neutropenic.
The patient was maintained on a neutropenic diet.

While you were admitted to the hospital, you also had severe bone pain which was controlled with narcotic pain medication and also thought due to your lymphoma.
In the hospital you also had problems with nerve pain, which was thought due to your chemotherapy and possibly your lymphoma as well.
We put you on several medications for nerve pain with some improvement and you were also started on radiation therapy to attempt to help your nerve recover from the lymphoma involvement.
You also received high dose methotrexate for your central nervous system disease.
You will also start intrathecal AraC therapy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from neurology.
You have been started on GABAPENTIN, MS CONTIN, and AMITRYPTYLINE to help manage your nerve pain.
Your ALLOPURINOL and ONDANSETRON (ZOFRAN) have been stopped.
You have also been started on DEXAMETHASONE to help manage your fevers and help your nerve recover.
