Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 45-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's disease status post multiple disease relapses after auto and allo SCT, most recently treated with Gemzar, Navelbine and Decadron on 30 day cycle, who presented with fever to 101 prior to chemotherapy administration.
He was initally treated with levoquin, but this was changed to vancomycin cefepime/voriconizole for broader coverage.
Following bronchoscopy, the patient's SBP dropped to 60s with Versed so got 500 cc bolus with improvement to 80s-90s.
Pt continued home salmeterol and albuterol for asthma .
It was felt that his hypotension was possibly due to adrenal insufficiency and he was restarted on stress dose steroids with marked improvement in hemodynamic response.
Pt became nauseated and did not take prednisone or other oral meds and was noted to have additional episodes of hypotension [**Date range (1) 3923**].
He was switched to PO prednisone on [**10-27**] and was discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily.
- Consider tapering off prednisone as an outpatient.
He was started on flagyl with concern for c. difficile.
GI was consulted and the patient was subsequently started on PO vancomycin, however c. dif testing was negative x 3.
He was started on IV fluids with bicarb, however renal function progressively worsened despite hydration.
Potentially nephrotoxic medications were held, (including acyclovir).
Dialysis was initiated on [**10-12**].
He continued on dialysis until [**10-24**] and his HD line was removed on [**10-29**].
He was scheduled to receive Gemzar, Navelbine and Decadron.
Pt was on hydrocortisone but switched to Prednisone.
Continue lamivudine therapy.
[**10-19**] TPN initiated due to poor PO intake.
