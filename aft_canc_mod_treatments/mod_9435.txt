It was noted that due to the nature of her structural and valvular atrial flutter, a procedure such as an atrial flutter ablation would not likely benefit the patient.
It was recommended that her electrolytes be repleted aggressively, and her Metoprolol dose was slightly increased to Metoprolol Tartarate 125 mg TID.
