History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83 year old woman with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p fludarabine/rituximab X 4 cycles started [**2103-12-18**], complicated by subsequent development of aplastic anemia in [**5-25**], who presented to clinic today with a 4 day duration of malaise, weakness, dysuria, and decreased appetite/PO consumption.
She is currently transfusion dependent in terms of her aplastic  anemia and is managed on cyclosporine at this point in time.
She did receive cyclosporine with initially improvement in her white count.
This then worsened again and the patient was most recently treated with Rituxan with a hope that there is an element of consumption for her platelets and red cells that this would improve her counts.

Subdural hematoma: On [**12-12**], patient had a mechanical fall and landed on her buttocks with subsequent head trauma.
On discharge, there is no need for platelet transfusions for her SDH.
The patient was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to suppress ectopy.
