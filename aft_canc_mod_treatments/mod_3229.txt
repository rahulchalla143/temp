His primary Oncologist has suspected recurrence of his T-cell lymphoma, but has been unable to conclude this based on several recent bone marrow biopsies.
PET scans showed activity in multiple sites including the axial skeleton, lungs, and bilateral adrenal glands.
He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics including ganciclovir for presumptive treatement of CMV virmeia and high dose steroids.
These antibiotics included daptomycin, voriconazole, caspofungin, cefepime, and aztreonam.
Daptomycin was continued for his presumed Bartonella infection diagnosed earlier with a postivie IgM titer and granulomas on a prior bone marrow bx.
His fevers resolved with steroids and were attributed to recurrence of his lymphoma.
In the middle of his hospital course new skin lesions were noted.
He was started on a single round of pentostatin and cytoxan.
Discussion was made to send him home on steroids and return for further treatment, however he developed acute abdominal pain, higher fevers, and peritonitis.
REgardless, the patient and his family wanted conservative management with antibiotics and PCA morphine.
It is thought that his performation occured following tumor regression within his small bowel in the setting of chemotherapy and high dose steroids.
