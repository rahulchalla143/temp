Pt underwent a techinically difficult bone marrow biopsy, and pathology showed hypercellular bone marrow with left-shifted granulopoiesis and increased blasts, consistent with AML.
Morphologic and cytogenetic/FISH analysis was pending at time of report.
Of note, over the past several months, pt reports having 2 episodes of the flu, an episode of pneumonia (diagnosed by CXR, treated with Z-pak with resolution), and UTI (treated with Cipro with resolution.)
On review of systems, pt reports low-grade fevers and chills following her bone marrow biopsy last week, but none since.
She has occasional diarrhea/constipation that she associates with her hx of dysfunctional bowel syndrome.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Anxiety Dysfunctional bowel syndrome s/p hysterectomy, cyst removal s/p appendectomy s/p cholecystectomy Bladder suspension surgery with ?R upper thigh nerve impingement:pt says R leg sometimes flops to side Hx breast augmentation (silicone) R face/blepharospasm (extends from R front scalp-> R neck): used to have botox injections, but stopped to try and see if it resolves on its own, last dose ~2months ago   Social History: Pt is a homemaker.

Patient underwent 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy (7 days ara-c, 3 days idarubicin) and tolerated it well.
However, blasts were still present in her bone marrow biopsy and CBC differential after completion of chemotherapy, indicating residual disease.
She was scheduled to follow-up with her outpatient oncologist on [**4-30**], and have another round of chemotherapy on [**4-20**] pending the results of the bone marrow biopsy.
Patient briefly required ICU admission.
Patient was treated with daptomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole/micafungin during her neutropenic phase.
Patient was hemodynamically stabilized and was treated with a 14 day course of daptomycin and meropenem starting from [**2142-4-16**] (the day she was no longer neutropenic.)
# Diverticulitis/Typhlitis: Treated with 14 day course of meropenem after patient was no longer neutropenic.
#Pulmonary Nodules: Pt noted to be short of breath and hypoxic with a new oxygen requirement, improved with diuresis with IV lasix.
Treated initially with albuterol/ipratroprium nebulizers and voriconazole, which was later d/c-ed due to LFT abnormalities and changed to micafungin.
Nodules were slightly worsened on repeat Chest CT, but patient clincally improved.
# Hypertension: Poorly controlled on patient's home regimen of metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, with SBPs into the 170s-190s.
Once patient was hemodynamically stable, increased metoprolol to 50 mg PO TID and added amlodipine 5 mg daily, bridged with PRN doses of IV hydralazine.
Patient's blood pressure was 148-150s systolic on discharge with the initiation of calcium channel blocker and increase in beta-blocker.
Tapered celexa to 20 mg by mouth daily, and controlled anxiety with Ativan IV/PO as needed.
Discharged patient on tapered celexa dose with PRN oral ativan, as she may likely need chemotherapy to treat her residual disease and may have difficulty with oral medications (requiring IV meds for anxiety).

Disp:*6 units* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: 1' Diagnosis Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Vancomycin Resistant Enteroccocal Bacteremia  2' Diagnosis Pulmonary Nodules of Undetermined Significance Hypertension Anxiety   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chemotherapy for your acute myelogenous leukemia.
You recovered from this infection, and will be treated with antibiotics.
Please take your medications as directed.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] We had added amlodipine 5 mg by mouth daily - We have increased your metoprolol to 50 mg by mouth three times a day.
- We decreased your celexa to 20 mg by mouth daily, with ativan as needed for your anxiety.
This was done as you will likely need more chemotherapy, and as you may have nausea associated with it, we wanted to decrease the number of medications you would need to take orally.
- You need to take antibiotics for 6 more days (daptomycin and ertapenem).
