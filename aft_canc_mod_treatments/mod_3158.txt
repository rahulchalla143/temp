Admission Date: [**2102-12-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2102-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-10-4**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MICU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a 43- year-old male, previously diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer, status post nephrectomy of his right kidney with recent clinical course significant for T7 spinal cord compression and large right loculated pleural effusion with pigtail catheter drainage who presented from rehab with shortness of breath, lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, and decrease in hematocrit requiring transfusion.
Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to have systolic blood pressure of approximately 100, to be tachycardiac to 110, and to have continued dyspnea with desaturations to 80 percent on nasal cannula oxygen.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell cancer with metastases to right pleura and spinal cord, status post right nephrectomy in [**9-19**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8 degrees, heart rate 117, blood pressure 134/53, respiratory rate 20, and saturating 98 percent on nasal cannula oxygen.
Differential, 67 percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 21 percent bands.
Chemistry significant for phosphorus 5.0 and no anion gap.
For his respiratory failure, the patient was initially covered with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin for a presumed pneumonia/empyema.
While at CT scan, the patient became increasingly dyspneic, the patient was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and his hypotension was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Additionally, the patient was given stress-dose steroids given his chronic steroid dependency, and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells given his new-onset anemia.
[**Hospital **] medical resuscitation was continued until a discussion with the family including the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy revealed wishes upon their part to provide comfort measures only to the patient.
