Hematemesis: Patient was intubated for airway control.
She briefly required pressors for hemodynamic support.
Extended family flew in from abroad to visit with patient and then the entire family, after reviewing the options for end of life care, decided that she would have wanted to be made comfortable given her pre-terminal condition.
Planning for home hospice was offered, but the family was justifiably concerned about the possibility of further hematemesis and therefore asked that she remain intubated while all medications other than analgesics and anxiolytics were stopped.
