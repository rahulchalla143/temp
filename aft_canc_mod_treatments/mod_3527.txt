He underwent a second thoracotomy with RUL lobectomy and en bloc R chest wall resection (ribs [**3-9**]) with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] Tex chest wall reconstruction and decortication of the RML and RLL with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2100-12-21**].
On [**1-18**], he underwent R VATS with drainage, decortication, and removal of patch.
Postoperatively, his three chest tubes were converted to empyema tubes.
He was discharged on vancomycin and fluconazole on [**2101-2-11**].
He was intubated at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital then transferred directly to the TSICU.
He then underwent bronchoscopy which demonstrated thin secretions in the trachea and proximal b/l bronchi.
Past Medical History: PMH: Traumatic blindness (left eye) Hypertension Alcohol-induced gastric ulcers (alcohol-free x20yr) Lung CA, R chest wall ([**4-11**]), s/p carboplatin, taxol with avastin h/o serratia marascens VAP  PSH: s/p appendectomy, date unknown [**2100-12-22**]: Bronchoscopy, Reoperative right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy and en bloc right chest wall resection (ribs 3,4 and 5) with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and decortication of right middle and right lower lobes.
[**2100-12-25**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage.
[**2100-12-26**], [**2100-12-27**], [**2100-12-28**], [**2101-1-19**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration.

Eventually his propofol was weaned and he was switched to a regimen of prn morphine and ativan.
He was then switched to PO roxicet and ativan down his PEG tube after this was placed.
We attempted to keep his sedation minimal and only adminstered when he was agitated or requiring sedation for a procedure.
Treatment w/ multiple agents, including haldol, Remeron, and Zyprexa were tried.
He was continued on beta blockade.
He was given prn doses of hydralazine and diltiazem for HTN or tachcardia.
During the last week of his hospitalization, intermittent bradycardia was documented while changing his anti-hypertensive regimen.
Pulm: He was maintained on the vent initially with assist-control.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2101-2-24**].
A left sided pigtail catheter was placed by IP for this effusion.
This tube continued to put out a decent amount of fluid, averaging about 1000cc per day.
The patient was taken to the OR for an open tracheostomy on [**2101-3-4**].
8 French portex cath was placed without complications.
The rest of his pulmonary course included multiple bronchoscopies for removal of mucous plugs.
Currently, he can [**Last Name (un) 1815**] up to 12 hrs unless he has accumulated secretions requiring serial bronchoscopy for pul tiolet.
It was decided he would need vent rehab after discharge.
His left pigtail was removed after resolutionneeded to be changed to a pleur-ex and this was done by IP prior to d/c.
His empyema tubes cont to be backed out until they were completely out.
The middle tube fell out spontaneously prior to D/C.
Throughout his admission, patient had heavy secretions, requiring frequent tracheal suctioning and chest PT, as well as intermittent bronchoscopy.
To help patient clear the mucus, tracheostomy was downsized to #6 fenestrated uncuffed.
GI: he was kept NPO for the entire hospital course.
Maintained on GI prophylaxis with PPI.
FEN: He was started on TFs at admission.
His nutritional status was not improving all that well, and it was decided it would be a long time before he would be able to take anything PO, therefore a PEG was placed at the time of trach.
His PEG feeds were advanced to goal where he remained for his hospital course.
Pt was treated w/ Vancomycin, Cefepime and fluconazole w/ clearing of BAL.
Inner cannula was removed, tracheostomy suctioned, and pt was ventilated by Ambu bag.
Amiodarone was given.
Tracheostomy was exchanged for #8 cuffed non-fenestrated.
Patient was removed from vent support, and started on morphine gtt.
