[**5-25**] T spine BX:TECHNIQUE: After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed in the biplane table in the prone position.
Moderate sedation was utilized with 200 mcg of fentanyl and 4 mg of Versed administered in divided doses throughout the 1 hour and 20 minute intraservice time during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continouously monitored.
Initially, two 22-gauge spinal needles were placed in the region of the right and left pedicles of the L4 vertebral bodies.
At this point, the needles and trocars were removed and the procedure was terminated.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
Note: The tumor cells express p63 and cytokeratin CK7, but are negative for CK20, CDX2, TTF-1 and PSAP.
The site of origin cannot be determined, but lung and head and neck should be considered.
Multiple spinal lytic lesions and replacement/collapse of T9 vertebral body as previously identified.
Biopsy was performed by spine surgery who followed the patient.
Oncology was consulted and after a family meeting it was decided that the patient did not want chemotherapy and only wanted therapy geared toward pain control and quality of life.
On [**6-7**] pt was found to have cord compression, confirmed by neurology consult as well as repeat T-spine MRI.
Pt was started on steroids and began emergent radiation that evening.

Pt is s/p course of treatment for HAP with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
However, he was continued on his advair and eventually treated with steroids for cord compression.
