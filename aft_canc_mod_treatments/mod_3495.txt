The patient often feels as if he has to void, but he tries to pass urine and little comes out.
Based on the results of these imaging studies, the patient was referred here for further evaluation and treatment.
He initially received an epidural steroid injection that provided only three weeks of relief; physiotherapy was then attempted, again without relief.
He likewise denies headache, visual changes, blurred or double vision, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, sputum production, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, hematuria, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.
A Foley catheter was placed.
He was given ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth and morphine IV and was admitted to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**].

Right lower lobe abnormality on chest x-ray corresponds to an area of apparent atelectasis or scarring on CT in right lower lobe.
Delayed contrast excretion from the kidneys related to previous intravenous contrast administration of uncertain time interval.
Mass-like infiltration surrounding left renal pelvis, concerning for lymphoma given history of retroperitoneal mass.
Note: Sections show a diffuse atypical lymphoid infiltrate composed of large lymphocytes with smooth chromatin and frequent large prominent ([**12-17**]) nucleoli.
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 19, 20, 23, 33, 45 and TdT+.
B cells comprise approximately 95% of the lymphoid gate.
CD20 is negative and surface immunoglobulin cannot be demonstrated.
The cytomorphology, while suggestive of a Burkitt lymphoma, the immunophenotype is more consistent with a precursor (pre-precursor) B-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.
Non-specific lymphoid profile; no phenotypic evidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in specimen.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Urine for immunophenotyping.
DIAGNOSIS:    FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT    FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, kappa, lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 19, 20, 23, 33, 34, 45 and TdT.
Abnormal events comprise ~25% of total gated events.They express CD19, CD10, HLA-DR, TdT and CD34.
Alternatively, this most likely represents intimal or valvular injury or fibrin products secodnary to recent catherization.
He was started on CHOP upon receiving these biopsy results.Further pathologic testing confirmed Burkitt's Lymphoma.
He was transferred to the MICU for initiation of chemotherapy given high concern for tumor lysis syndrome in the setting of acute renal failure.
His uric acid peaked at 9.6 on [**8-10**] with an associated LDH of 2990 and he received one dose of rasburicase with rapid improvement in his uric acid levels.
On [**2161-8-15**] he became neutropenic and was started on neupogen.
He was transferred to the MICU and CVVH was initiated in order to allow for the administration of chemotherapy in the setting of tenuous renal function.
On [**8-7**] he underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement by interventional radiology.
Following this intervention his creatinine decreased from 5.0 to 0.9 over the following two days.
On the evening of [**8-9**], however, the patient became quite agitated and pulled out his nephrostomy tube and had a transient period of anuria.
Interventional radiology attempted to replace his nephrostomy tube but he was too agitated for this procedure to take place.
He was intubated for repeat attempt at this procedure, but this second attempt was also unsuccessful given that his ureter was no longer significantly enlarged.
His course was complicated by development of a subcapsular hematoma near the site of his interventions with associated 6 point hematocrit drop requiring transfusion of 3 units of PRBCs.
His hematocrit was subsequently watched closely in the setting of anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation and possible pulmonary embolism.
#.Constipation-The patient developed constipation secondary to vincristine in his chemo regimen.
Given his fevers and agitation he was started empirically on zosyn and vancomycin.
Blood cultures from the 27th grew MRSA 8/8 bottles from his PICC line and peripheral blood cultures.
His tunnelled line and PICC line were subsequently removed and also grew MRSA.
His zosyn was discontinued and he was contined on vancomycin.
He was not started on gentamycin given his recent renal failure.
Given his high grade bacteremia the decision was made to continue vancomycin for a [**3-20**] week course.
He underwent IVC filter placement and was placed on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
He was originally started on metoprolol for rate control of his atrial fibrillation but this was unsuccessful.
He was started on dignoxin but this was discontinued within one day of initiation.
He was ultimately transitioned to diltiazem with improved control.
On day of MICU transfer he was well rate controlled on diltiazem PO 60 mg QID.
On transfer to the floor the patient was continued to be rate controlled on Diltiazem 60mg QD.
Metoprolol was added and has been titrated up to 50mg three times daily.
They also reccommended further titration of his metoprolol and diltiazem to obtain rate control of 60-80 beats per minute at rest, and 100-120 with exercise.
This was in the setting of high dose dexamethasone, hypernatremia to 148, and sepsis.
His mental status rapidly improved over the next 48 hours following treatment of his hypernatremia with D5W, initation of appropriate antibiotics for his high grade bacteremia and completion of the dexamethasone portion of his chemotherapy.
IVC filter placed without complication and he was started on heparin for anticoagulation with close monitoring of his hematocrit.
He was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation throughout his MICU course.
He was continued on a heparin drip on the floor.
Coumadin was not considered for fear of drug interactions with chemotherapy.
On admission the patient was taking ciprofloxacin despite no positive urine cultures.
Given that there was no urine culture sent prior to initiation of antibiotics he was continued on ciprofloxacin for a 7 day course.
The hematuria resolved with discontinuation of the Heparin drip.
The heparin drip was restarted and the patient has not had further episodes of hematuria in 7 days.
Anxiety: The patient has been stable on Tranxene (clorazepate) for years.
Given that his mental status had been significantly altered while in the MICU this medication was not restarted and he was placed on ativan 0.5 mg QHS as an anxiolytic.
He also received zyprexa PRN for insomnia with good effect.
On the floor, his haldol and zyprexa was discontinued.
He was instead transitioned to ambien 5-10mg at night time for sleep.
#Prednisone: As part of the R-CVP protocol, the patient was receiving Prednisone 40mg PO twice daily.
His last dose of Prednisone 40mg was the evening of [**8-26**].
The patient will not be discharged on a prednisone taper as he recived only 5 days of prednisone therapy.
Did receive tube feeds for a short period of time while in the MICU.
He is currently on a heparin gtt for prophylaxis.
He received pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the setting of high dose dexamethasone.
