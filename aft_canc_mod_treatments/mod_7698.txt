Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
Please call if you need to change your appointment, or require additional directions.
