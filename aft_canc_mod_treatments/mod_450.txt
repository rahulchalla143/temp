She was started on prednisone and bronchodilators and continued on these inpatient.
She was discharged on a prednisone taper along with prior home medications.
#Iron deficiency anemia due most probably to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient was found to have a hematocrit of 17 and was noted to have ST depression on EKG that resolved with transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and anemia remained stable after red cell transfusions.
Her lisinopril was held and her lasix was continued.
She was discharged off lisinopril pending follow up with her PCP and Renal.
#Probable CAD: Patient had ST depressions with hematocrit of 17 that resolved with transfusion of red cells to hematocrit of 27.
She was on aspirin and statin at home per report, but aspirin was held in the setting of chronic blood loss anemia.
Additionally, stress testing was deferred, but this could be considered in the outpatient setting as a positive test may reduce threshold for addition of a betablocker to the patient's hypertension regimen.
Therefore, patient was started on low dose Diltiazem in place of nifedipine.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by hypoglycemia: Patient recently had NPH reduced for hypoglycemia.
However, on regimen of NPH 20 units [**Hospital1 **] the patient had consistent morning hypoglycemia.
Therefore, NPH was reduced to 14 units in the AM and 10 in the PM.
Therefore, the patient was discharged with home services.
#CODE: Full  #Disposition: Patient was discharged on prednisone taper to follow up with PCP and outpatient GI for repeat colonscopy.
Patient did not have a follow up with Renal on discharge, but patient was encouraged to make this appointment given her CKD and medication changes.
