On [**2144-12-7**], the patient underwent left partial hemiglossectomy, left neck dissection and direct laryngoscopy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
The patient remained intubated after the procedure due to concern for postoperative edema, and was kept in the ICU.
He was transferred to the floor on POD#2, where speech and swallow service saw the patient, and he was transitioned to thin liquids on POD#3 and also began supplemental tube feeds.
His Foley catheter was D/Ced on POD#4, and he voided without difficulty.
His diet was advanced further to pureed solids on POD#4, and his tube feeds were cycled overnight.
The patient tolerated these well, however on POD#4 developed cloudy output from his JP drain which was found to contain elevated triglycerides and a chyle leak was suspected.
His diet was reduced to clear liquids, and his tube feeding formula changed.
By POD#7, his drain output became serosanguinous again, and his drain and staples were removed.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with IV pain medications, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
The patient was tolerating a clear liquid diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
The patient was discharged home with services for tube feeding.
