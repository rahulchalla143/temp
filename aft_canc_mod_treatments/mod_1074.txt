MDS was diagnosed in [**6-/2180**] and initially treated with danazol and aranesp.
In [**6-/2181**] patient was hospitalized for bilateral lung aspergillus infection and enterobacter bacteremia.
Most recent admission was [**Date range (1) 34838**]/05 with pneumonia and bacteremia with Stenotrophomonus treated with a course of bactrim and port-o-cath removal.
He admits slight burning with urination and increased frequency of urination until today.
He spiked to 103 in clinic and was treated with vancomycin 1 gram at 12:20pm, meropenem 1 gram at 4:00pm and bactrim ds 1 tab po at 4:00pm.
he was given tylenol at 2:00pm and hydrocortisone 100mg ivp at 3:45pm.
Past Medical History: - Myelodysplastic syndrome first diagnosed [**2180-6-13**], treated with danazol and aranesp.
* Microbiolic Data: ---------------- Blood Culture [**4-11**]- [**4-21**]: No growth to date Blood Culture [**4-10**]: 1 out of 2 bottles + for Coag Neg Staph Blood Culture [**4-9**]: 2 out of 4 bottles + for Coag Neg Staph Blood Culture [**4-8**]: 2 our of 2 bottles + for Coag Neg Staph * Urine Culture [**4-8**]: >100,000 Coag Neg Staph * Induced Sputum [**4-13**]: GRAM STAIN- [**10-8**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
His respiratory distress was felt secondary to this underlying process and he was treated with broad antibiotics given his neutropenic status.
Ultimately he was placed on vancomycin (gram positive coverage), meripenem (gram negatives/anaerobes), azithromycin (atypicals) and caspofungin/voriconazole (fungal) empiric coverage.
He was also initially placed on treatment dose bactrim empirically for PCP.
Induced sputum cultures returned negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] continuation of bactrim was not felt indicated per ID recommendations.
Initial thought had been given to intubation to help with oxygenation and for diagnostic bronchoscopy, however the patient adamantly requested not to be intubated if at all possible (although he was maintained as Full Code as he would want intubation if needed emergently).
He was maintained on aggressive oxygen support with NRB face mask with maintainence of O2 sats >93%.
Subsequently, he did begin to have more subjective dyspnea with desaturations requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
It was felt that broad antibiotic coverage should continue since the differential remained broad, however fungal etiology was highly suspected, as was possible gram positive pneumonia (especially given positive blood and urine cultures for MRSE).
Therefore he was placed on double anti-fungal coverage as outlined above.
He was weaned back off of positive pressure support, and then off of NRB face mask, with maintenance of oxygenation on nasal cannulation upon transfer back to the bone marrow transplant service on [**4-21**].
He continued to improve on the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] floor, with diuresis progressing successfully with lasix prn, and with O2 requirement improving despite a lack of radiologic improvement on repeat CT scan.
regimen, on which he was sent home: Vancomycin IV, Clindamycin PO, Bactrim PO, Acyclovir PO, and Flagyl PO (which was added given loose stools on the day of D/C over concerns for C. Diff Colitis development on Clindamycin).
He was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and final sensitivites returned methicillin resistant.
PICC line was subsequently placed for access once blood cultures were negative for greater than 48 hours.
He was sent home on an empiric course of 7 days of Vancomycin given at 1.5 grams q 12 hours.
# Altered Mental Status: The patient developed transient confusion and disorientation, which was felt likely secondary to medications and ICU delerium.
His ambien was discontinued and he was treated with olanzapine prn for agitation.
The tachycardia improved somewhat with IVF hydration.
In addition, he was given 2 units of pRBCs for his anemia, which also could have been precipitating his tachycardia.
He has been treated with 5-AZA chemotherapy, which is currently on hold.
He is also on standing prednisone at 40mg daily.
He remained neutropenic and transfusion dependent for red blood cells and platelets.
# CHF- EF 40% (from [**4-12**] TTE).
Continued on ACE-I, Lasix prn.
