She was treated with IV dexamethasone 4mg IV q8, fentanyl transdermal patch 200mcg/hr q 72hrs, and morphine IV prn.
Attempts were made to transition her to sublingual concentrated morphine solution, but pain was inadeqautely controlled requiring additional IV morphine.
With time and better migraine control Ms [**Known lastname 51552**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status has gradually improved as well as her CN deficits.
She is not a candicate for anticoagulation now and likely not in the future.
She was seen by neurology and chronic pain, who recomended restarting her decadron as well as eventually setting on the following regimen.
Fentanyl patch 225mcg/hr q72, q4h PO concentrated morphine solution, 25mg amitryptiline qhs and 650mg liquid tylenol q6h PRN.
We have initiated her decadron taper today, starting with 3mg [**Hospital1 **].
Nutrition h/o short gut with ileostomy, [**Location (un) **] On arrival to the floor, nutrition services was consulted and patient was started on total parenteral nutrition.
She should continue on TPN as this is her only means of getting nutrition.
Given intracranial hemmorhage, anticoagulation was held.
Given the patient's extremly poor access, previous stent placements, and history of line associated thrombosis, IVC filter placement was unable to be performed.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted and reommended placement in rehab.
# VTE Prophylaxis: Given intracranial hemmorhage, pneumoboots were used for VTE prophylaxis.
