She is now status post resection and debulking of tumor with local recurrence.
She was seen in clinic at [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute on [**12-21**], the day of admission, where she was found to be anemic and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
Patient initially felt fine after transfusion, but 15 to 30 minutes later when she was on her way home, she became acutely short of breath and collapsed in the parking lot, complained of associated chest tightness and was brought to [**Hospital1 346**] by ambulance.
staff was concerned about transfusion related lung injury and anaphylaxis, thus she was initially treated with Benadryl, Solu-Medrol and epinephrine.
staff elected to treat with albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
Thus she was started on heparin.
Patient was eventually given 40 of IV Lasix times one with 1200 cc of urine output to that and much improved symptoms.
Patient did complain of odynophagia and a feeling of food and medications lodging in her throat over the past few weeks.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61 year old female with a history of abdominal mesothelioma presenting with acute shortness of breath after receiving two units of packed red blood cells in clinic.
She was, indeed, acutely dyspneic and required large volumes of oxygen to maintain saturation above 90% on admission.
After she was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint, she underwent therapeutic thoracentesis of the right sided effusion.
Patient continued to improve after thoracentesis with continued diuresis.
Would suggest following this over time as patient may need to undergo further drainage of this fluid for symptomatic relief and possible pleurodesis in the future.
Patient was anticoagulated on heparin at the time of admission.
Patient was started on aspirin which she remains on at the time of discharge.
Patient was not started on a IIb/IIIa inhibitor due to concern of continued bleeding from her tumor into the peritoneum.
Patient was started on a nitro drip for pain and blood pressure control as well as being started on an esmolol drip to better rate control.
Bradycardia was most likely secondary to too much nodal blocking as patient was later started on amiodarone for an episode of nonsustained v-tach.
Patient was eventually weaned off the nitro drip and started on Isordil, captopril and Lopressor to control her blood pressure.
Patient had one episode of peri-MI nonsustained v-tach lasting 25 seconds which resolved with a precordial thump.
Patient was seen by cardiology and started on amiodarone for nonsustained v-tach.
Patient was appropriately loaded with amiodarone and then transitioned to p.o.
As noted above, patient had several episodes of bradycardia that were symptomatic while she was on both esmolol drip and amiodarone.
These appeared to be due to increased nodal blocking and patient had no further episodes once the esmolol drip was discontinued.
However, given the patient's SVC clot, she was started on Lovenox 80 mg p.o.
Patient is likely being transferred to [**Hospital3 328**] today to pursue further treatment options for her primary mesothelioma.
Patient required two units of packed red blood cells during the course of her admission.
This is likely due to the stress dose Solu-Medrol she received in the E.D.
She was maintained on sliding scale insulin while in-house.
Patient was given free water and her sodium had corrected to 144 on the day of discharge.
Daily discussions with her onc team and with patient about prognosis have not succeeded in changing patient's mind regarding her wishes for continued aggressive care at this point.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute for further care and for possible new chemotherapeutic agents on [**2164-12-26**].
