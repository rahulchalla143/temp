Now the patient is off dopamine with improved blood pressures.
He has a history of metastatic esophageal cancer treated with radiation therapy.
Gastrojejunostomy tube placement.
Vancomycin 1 g q.12h.
Tamsulosin 0.4 mg by mouth q.h.s.
Fentanyl patch 100 mcg transdermally q.72h.
Oxycodone 30 mg by mouth q.6h.
Ambien by mouth as needed.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer with atrial flutter awaiting transesophageal echocardiogram with cardioversion who was admitted to the C-MED Service.
We continued his vancomycin q.12h.
The patient received Coumadin prior to admission.
ESOPHAGEAL CANCER ISSUES:  Time to get his radiation therapy while on service, and for pain control received oxycodone q.6h.
for pain with a Fentanyl patch 100 mcg transdermally q.72h.
He had a gastrojejunostomy tube which was flushed regularly.
For his feeds, he was on thickened fluids only by mouth but regular food by mouth okay.
Since admission, he was awaiting electrophysiology procedure for ablation procedure.
He was made nothing by mouth after midnight on the Sunday prior to the procedure for the ablation.
His rate was controlled with medications properly.
At this time he was then reassessed for his volume status.
The patient's rate was refractory to verapamil 2.5-mg intravenous pushes.
Status post cardioversion, electrocardiogram QTc was 384 microseconds; same as his prior atrial flutter QTc on admission.
He was then monitored closely for Q-T elevation throughout the day and without any difficulties and was awaiting electrophysiology procedure the next morning.
Each of the 1-mg ibutilide infusions were given over a 10-minute course with prolonged saline infusion/flush.
Status post cardioversion peripherally inserted central catheter line was flushed with 2 cc of heparin.
Continued with hydration and monitored creatinine closely.
The plan at this point was to continue amiodarone 400 mg by mouth twice per day times two weeks then to 400 mg by mouth once per day times one month and then to 200 mg by mouth once per day after that with followup with the Electrophysiology Service.
On [**8-5**], because of his atrial fibrillation, he was started on amiodarone.
He was sent out for liver function tests and pulmonary function tests; which were pending, with a goal heart rate of less than 100 consistently and with the hope of cardioverting him with amiodarone over time.
For his methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, he still continued to receive his vancomycin without difficulty.
On the day of discharge, the patient was back on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 with follow-up INR check regularly.
He was continued on his amiodarone.
The patient also had an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 733**] for INR checks and creatinine checks.
The patient's pain was well controlled while in the hospital with a Fentanyl patch and with oxycodone.
Levothyroxine 112 mcg by mouth once per day  2.
Fentanyl patch 100-mcg per hour patch transdermally q.72h.
Methisazone 150-mg tablet by mouth twice per day.
Bisacodyl 5-mg tablets two tablets by mouth as needed.
Tamsulosin 0.4 mg by mouth q.h.s.

Docusate 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Oxycodone 5-mg tablets four tablets (20 mg equivalent) q.4-6h.
Amiodarone 200-mg tablets two tablets by mouth twice per day; the patient was to take two tablets 400 mg twice per day for 11 more days and then decrease daily dose to two tablets (or 400 mg in total) once per day for one month and then decrease to 200 mg by mouth until needed.
Warfarin 5 mg by mouth once per day (with regular followup with a goal INR of 2 to 3).
Verapamil 80 mg by mouth q.8h.
