Given his recent bleed, anticoagulation was not started, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of an IVC filter.
Also completing course of antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia from prior admission.
He did not have any respiratory difficulties, and ~150cc of blood was suctioned out through the trach, the cuff was inflated for airway protection and he was transfered to MICU green for monitoring.
Pt then transported to IR for IVC filter placement.
Past Medical History: Cerebrovascular accident, treated at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**2157**] with residual gait weakness Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Hypertension Gout Hyponatremia SCC of the larynx diagnosed [**2177-3-31**], s/p coil embolization of right inferior thryroid artery for hypopharangeal bleed S/p tracheostomy and peg [**2177-4-1**] at [**Hospital1 34**] EtOH abuse  Social History: Former smoker quit at day of dx, EtOH 14 beers daily up until 1 month ago.
Please see separately dictated neck CT.     Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 67 year old man with history of HTN, CVA, COPD, status post recent diagnosis of SCC of larynx status post coil embolization of right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], status post trach and PEG [**3-/2177**], recently discharged to rehab approximately 1 month ago, who initially presented and was admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right LE DVT, with subsequent complicated hospital course for bleeding at tracheostomy site.
ICU course:  Despite the cuff inflation, the patient had intermittent bleeding from his tracheostomy site, requiring placement on the ventilator.
ENT was involved, and site was packed (where patient was transiently on prophylactic clindamycin).
He went to IR for IVC filter placement to address his DVT, at which time he also underwent coiling of a thyroid artery.
Oncology was also involved during his hospital course, and he was ultimately transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of emergent radiation to be able to stop the bleeding.
He therefore underwent salvage radiation with control of the bleeding, and was successfully weaned off the ventilator, and currently remains stable on trach mask.
His initial complaints were right leg pain, warmth, edema x 3 days, with lower extremity ultrasound (performed at rehab) demonstrating a right partially occluded distal femoral and popliteal DVT.
He successfully underwent placement of IVC filter in IR on [**4-30**] without complication.
# Laryngeal Cancer:  As above, complicated by recurrent bleeds, now status post 2 coil artery embolizations, status post trach and PEG.
Patient required dental work prior to initiation of regular radiation therapy, and chemotherapy waiting on regular radiation therapy.
Given this delay of therapy, panorex was obtained, dental consult and maxillofacial surgery consults were obtained.
Patient underwent tooth extraction in OR on [**2177-5-8**], where evaluation by ENT under anaesthesia was also performed.
Following the tooth extraction, radiation oncology and medical oncology were consulted and recommended initiation of cetuximab on [**5-15**] as well as radiation therapy, tentatively scheduled for [**5-21**].
XRT treatments will be daily Monday through Friday for seven weeks; he underwent radiation treatment planning in-house before discharge.
# Hypertension:  We continued his home lisinopril 40 mg daily.
He is not on aspirin due to bleeding risk.
