Omentum, omentectomy (A-D): Metastatic carcinoma.
Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (AK-[**Hospital1 **]): Serous carcinoma occluding left fallopian tube and involving bilateral fimbria, omentum, and peritoneal surfaces but with minimal ovarian surface involvement.
The findings are consistent with a tubal primary, see synoptic report.
Appendix, appendectomy (K-M): Metastatic carcinoma involving serosal surface and outer wall of appendix and periappendiceal fat; proximal margin with surface adhesions and focal reactive mesothelial hyperplasia but no malignancy identified.
Transverse colon, resection (U-Y): Metastatic carcinoma involving colonic wall and mesocolonic adipose tissue; lymphovascular invasion identified (slide W).
Antrum, wedge resection (AE-AG): Metastatic carcinoma involving stomach wall and attached adipose tissue.
IMAGING: CXR [**2102-9-8**]: Large bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right side are unchanged associated with adjacent atelectasis.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
A second catheter projects in the left upper quadrant.
Left PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
NG tube is still within the stomach.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax status post right thoracentesis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2102-9-4**] for an exploratory-laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy-bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, small and large bowel resections with reanastamosis, partial gastrectomy, appendectomy, right inguinal lymphadenectomy, and IP port placement for stage IIIc ovarian vs primary peritoneal CA, optimally debulked.
Hgb/hct from baseline 13-14/36-41 -> 10.3/29.8 after intra-op 1u prbcs.
Post-operatively, pressures were 90s/40s then sbp down to 80s and then back up to sbp 90s following an additional transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
In [**Name (NI) 13042**] pt received an additional 3L IVF and had good uop ~70cc/hr.
Pt had bupivacaine epidural 10cc/hr and was also given IV Tylenol x1 ~3pm.
Pt received phenergan for nausea which resolved.
Ca 7.0, Mg 1.9.
Due to increased pain, pt was started on dilaudid PCA 0.12mg (max 1.2mg/hr).
Bupivicaine (0.1%mg/ml) epidural was decreased 10->4cc/hr due to concern for contribution to hypotension.
Patient maintained MAP>55 without further pressor requirement and received 500cc NS boluses x 2 (mornings of [**9-5**] and [**9-6**]) due MAP ~50 and sbp as low as 76 but responded quickly and afterwards maintained MAP>55.
She was continued on maintenance fluids of 125cc/hr LR while NPO.
Patient's pain was controlled with bupivicaine epidural, which was d/c'ed on day of transfer from ICU, as well as dilaudid PCA, which was continued.
NSAIDs and toradol were avoided due to post-operative risk of bleeding.
Calcium, magnesium and phosphate were repleted as needed.
Nutrition was consulted for recommendations on tube feeds and TPN but has remained NPO while in ICU.
Patient was anticoagulated with heparin 5000 units SC BID while on bupivicaine epidural which was switched to TID once epidural was d/c'ed on [**9-6**].
The remainder of her course is outlined by systems below:  *) Neuro: pain was initially controlled with Dilaudid PCA and IV acetaminophen.
On post-operative day 14 patient was tolerating a regular diet and she was transitioned to PO dilaudid and tylenol with good effect.
*) CV: once on the floor, patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and did not require further blood pressure support or transfusions.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and patient underwent thoracentesis for 800 cc.
*) GI: due to her extensive bowel resections, patient was initially NPO with NG tube in place and PPI was started.
NG tube was discontinued on [**9-9**] (POD5).
Nutrition was consulted for assistance with TPN and overall nutrition management.
She was initially voiding spontaneously, however, overnight that night, patient experienced painful urinary retention and foley was replaced on [**9-8**] (POD4).
*) Skin: On [**9-6**] (POD2), while still in the ICU, patient was noted to have blotchy erythema on her abdomen.
It was non-tender and non-confluent.
Ancef was started on [**9-11**] (POD7) for presumed wound infection/cellulitis.
Culture returned positive for gram negative rods and antibiotics were switched to ceftriaxone on the morning of [**9-15**] (POD11).
Later that day, bacteria was speciated for e.coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was started.
On day of discharge, [**9-19**] (POD15), hospital wound vac was removed and wet to dry dressing applied.
Patient to have VNA apply home wound vac on [**9-20**].
By [**9-19**], post-operative day 15, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications.
