Admission Date:  [**2196-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2151-12-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Dilaudid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**9-27**]: left parietal craniotomy   History of Present Illness: 44 right handed male with hx of melanoma metastatic to the brain treated with surgical resection and CyberKnife, presented originally with R arm numbness and weakness, now transferred from an OSH after his wife noticed that he was acutely confused around 1AM this morning.
He received 10 mg of IV dexamethasone and 250 mg of Phenytoin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
He underwent resection of the larger parietal tumor on [**2196-7-20**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and pathology confirmed metastatic melanoma.
He was treated with CyberKnife on [**2196-8-8**] to the resection cavity and to the remaining parietal lesion.
He underwent a second CyberKnife treatment to the two right sided lesions on [**2196-9-9**].
Over the short interval, the hemorrhagic left temporoparietal lesion has substantially increased in size, now measuring at least 4.0 cm (AP) x 2.6 cm (TRV), with substantial hemorrhagic component and significant associated vasogenic edema and increased mass effect upon the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and atrium of the left lateral ventricle (4:15).
The cavity also demonstrates residual marginal and internal blood products.
Well circumscribed fluid density (20 [**Doctor Last Name **])3.4 X 1.9 cm and 2 x 1.7 cm lesions adjacent to the left adrenal gland and superior to the pancreas, respectively (2:54), are new since [**2196-7-21**].
There are blood products in the new resection bed, with high signal on the pre-contrast T1-weighted images.
There is high T2 signal surrounding the new resection cavity, likely representing a combination of post-operative edema and pre-existing tumor-related and therapy-related changes.
Status post left parietal/temporal mass resection, with blood products in the resection cavity limiting evaluation for any residual enhancing components.
There is a subcapsular lesion measuring 10 x 10 mm in segment VIII of the liver, corresponding to the enhancing abnormality on prior CT, which demonstrates uniform high signal on T2- weighted images, low signal on T1- weighted sequences and arterial phase hyperenhancement with continued enhancement on the dynamic series.
The larger collection in the region of the pancreatic tail measures 4.4 x 1.6 cm and the smaller collection abutting the anterosuperior aspect of the pancreatic body measures 1.8 x 1.2 cm (image 63 and 67, series 200).
He was initially agitated secondary to steroids, and IV ativan, seroquel, and haldol were started and the steroids were subsequently stopped.
He tolerated the procedure well and following a short stay in the ICU he was transferred to the Neurosurgical Floor.
This MRI revealed mutliple small cysts that did not required acute intervention per the GI team.
The patient was given instruction for these findings to be followed from an outpaient standpoint.
At the time of discharge, the patient continues to experience mild sensory ataxia of his right hand (though the ataxia had improved significantly post-resection)  Medications on Admission: Keppra 500'', Decadron taper finished the day before admission.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Pain.
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Metronidazole 1 % Gel Sig: One (1) Appl Topical DAILY (Daily).
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
?Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
?You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
?Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
Please call if you need to change your appointment, or require additional directions.
?You will need an MRI of the brain on [**2196-10-13**] 12:20  You also have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] on [**2196-10-19**] at 9:45am  During your hospitalization and imaging performed; multiple small cysts were identified on your liver.
These do not require intervention at this time; however should be monitored by your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 78297**].
