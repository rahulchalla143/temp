He was started on standing albuterol/atrovent MDI's as well as stress dose steroids.
On [**11-8**] he underwent flexible bronchoscopy with BAL at the bedside which demonstrated significant airway edema, thick white secretions but no obstruction.
Due to the patient's poor airway compliance, significant bronchospasm, and anxiety, he developed autopeep on the ventilator calculated to be ~15.
This degree of autopeep made it almost impossible for him to trigger the ventilator on pressure support.
Therefore, the patient's sedation was increased using both fentanyl and propofol in order to decrease the respiratory rate while still on AC and decrease his autopeep.
He remained stable from a respiratory standpoint following extubation, initially requiring a face mask, then oxygen via nasal cannula.
He continue to improve with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers and was breathing progressively more comfortably over the next few days on the floor with no significant oxygen need.
The patient was placed on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for empiric coverage of GP/GN/anerobes.
The patient's antibiotics were continued until extubation and then discontinued.
Pt was maintained off antibiotics and did not worsen from a respiratory standpoint.
Patient initially received 4 L of IVF in the ED and 2 L of IVF after arrival to the MICU.
He initially required pressure support with Levophed, but this was weaned off within the first 24 hours.
He was given Lasix 20mg IV x 1 on [**11-13**] and subsequent auto-diuresis with additional medication.
He was started on diltiazem which was quickly titrated to 120mg qid for heart rate control.
COPD: Severe underlying disease/possible exacerbation in the setting of RSV bronchiolitis complicated the patient's respiratory status.
He was maintained on standing albuterol/atrovent treatments and given IV steroids that were changed to PO prednisone after extubation.
The patient was maintained on a slow prednisone taper due to his severe disease, and was also sent home with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.
Prior to admission the patient had received carboplatin treatment.
Thrombocytopenia was felt most likely secondary to medication administration (likely secondary to Carboplatin, which he received prior to admission; there was also concern over contribution from vancomycin or levaquin, which were discontinued).
This improved with IV hydration but will likely continue to be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
He was covered on an insulin sliding scale.
However, due to the fact that the steroids will be tapered over the next 1-2 weeks, patient was not given any antihyperglycemic agents for home use.
Mental status: Pt required haldol and increased sedation while in the ICU, even needing a sitter temporarily.
