Mitral valve prolapse 5.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times two and mitral valve repair 6.
She was presumed to have an allergic reaction to the intravenous contrast dye and was treated with epinephrine, Solu-Medrol as well as Benadryl.
Despite this the patient became hypoxic and was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Dopamine drip was started and Swan-Ganz monitoring was used.
Dobutamine was started for presumed cardiogenic shock although there was no specific etiology.
Heparin drip was also begun and the patient's PTT went to 170.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and a repeat hematocrit was 38.3.
Heparin was discontinued.
The patient was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, Levaquin, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
Status post right lumpectomy for breast cancer; 4.
Mitral valve prolapse; 8.
MEDICATIONS:  Medications at home were Atenolol 25 mg q.d., Lipitor, Amitriptyline.
The patient has a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, left radial arterial line, intubated with nasogastric tube, Foley catheter and two peripheral intravenous lines.
Creatinine kinase 108, MB 4 and troponin 2.0.
Gastroenterology recommendations were to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, transfuse prn and avoid nasogastric tube suction.
The patient is also to begin proton pump inhibitors, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
The patient was premedicated for cardiac catheterization given her possible allergic reaction to intravenous dye.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed at that time.
Cardiology also recommended coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve repair.
The patient also had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia with a rate of 200 and then converted back to sinus rhythm with a total of 10 mg of intravenous Lopressor.
On [**2144-12-30**], the patient then underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein graft to the descending right coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal as well as mitral valve repair with a 26 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty band.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on postoperative day #2.
She was also transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
Her chest tubes and wires were discontinued.
On the evening of postoperative day #3, the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation and was given 20 mg of intravenous Lopressor as well as 150 mg of Amiodarone.
The patient received an additional Amiodarone 150 mg intravenous bolus as well as Amiodarone drip.
She continued to work with physical therapy and did well with this.
The patient converted back to normal sinus rhythm with 15 mg of intravenous Lopressor and 2 gm of Magnesium Sulfate given.
They recommended outpatient [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitoring as well as Amiodarone taper regimen.
They also recommended obtaining echocardiogram prior to discharge to assess the left ventricular function as well as mitral valve function.
The patient was kept in house for closer monitoring as well as increasing of beta blockade.
The patient was discharged to home on postoperative day #9 tolerating a regular diet and given adequate pain control and p.o.
Anticoagulation was not begun due to her history of gastrointestinal bleeds and probable arteriovenous malformations.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

Amiodarone 200 mg t.i.d.
Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d.
