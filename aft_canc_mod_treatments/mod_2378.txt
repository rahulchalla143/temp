His prednisone was increased during this admission for concern of GVHD but then subsequently tapered back to his prior dosage of 15mg QD.
ID started him on both inhaled and intravenous colistin in addition to amikacin and he became afebrile with improved WBC count on this regimen.
Over the last week at his rehab facility he was not continued on the IV Colistin for unclear reasons.
He went to his previously scheduled clinic visit, where he was evaluated and it was decided he should be admitted for his fevers.
He was agitated with copious green/yellow secretions being suctioned out of his trach.
He denied shortness of breath or pain, but was requesting morphine to releive his work of breathing.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.

- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
He has been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his varices.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant pseudomonas.
