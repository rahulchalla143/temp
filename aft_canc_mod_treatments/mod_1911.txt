[**Name (NI) 30983**] the patient is a 60 year old man with history of metastatic bladder cancer initially admitted for fever, neutropenia, hypotension, and diarrhea after recent radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
He was enrolled in the MUST sepsis protocol and managed initially with pressors (Levophed), fluid boluses, and broad spectrum antibiotics in the form of ceftazidime and vancomycin.
Flagyl was added empirically, ceftazidime changed to cefepime, and patient given one unit of red cells.
He had a sigmoidoscopy on hospital day number seven demonstrating radiation proctitis secondary to radiation therapy for bladder cancer.
He was started on Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
Did not tolerate tube feeds initially and was started on TPN.
On post-operative day number five he began vomiting and a nasogastric tube was placed uneventfully.
TPN was advanced to goal on postoperative day number seven and he remained on levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Patient's ileus gradually resolved and NG tube was removed on postoperative day number ten.
Diet was then advanced, TPN tapered, and antibiotics discontinued.
Rate decreased with IV metoprolol and he spontaneously converted to NSR.
Rate unable to be controlled with adenosine and Lopressor, required amiodarone bolus and continuous infusion.
The patient was discharged with 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] PO amiodarone and metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
On postoperative day 18 ([**2132-12-1**]) a percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed.
In consultation with the infectious disease team, the patient was treated with a total course of approximately three weeks of Linezolid (19 days exactly, including one week course to be completed after discharge).
Given that removal of large quantities of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been contributing to the patient's high ileostomy output via fat malabsorption, the cholecystostomy was capped following the T-tube cholangiogram.
The patient was discharged with the cholecystostomy tube capped.
However, a combination of opium drops, psyllium wafers, and Imodium  all titrated up slowly, did decrease ostomy output and thicken the ostomy consistency.
8) Difficulty with neobladder: The patient had a Foley catheter in place during the majority of his admission.
The Foley catheter required frequent flushing and frequent changes due to mucous plugging.
