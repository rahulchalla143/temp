Likely multifactorial etiology due to discontinuation of midodrine and blood loss given acute on chronic anemia.
Infectious etiology was considered unlikely given that pt remained afebrile, without leuocytosis,negative UA, no evidence of pathology on CXR or abdominal imaging, and improved clinically with fluids and transfusion.
Pt was given one dose vancomycin and cefepime for possible infection in ED which was d/c'ed.
Pt was ordered for home midodrine 5mg [**Hospital1 **] which was held since she has maintained sbp>130.
Patient does report black stools since [**Month (only) 404**], however, her hematocrit was stable prior to today, and she also reported black stools during her [**7-/2146**] admission.
She takes iron supplements which could be contributing to dark stools.
Pt was continued on pantoprazole 40mg IV BID.
In the past she has had a macrocytic anemia and was recently found to have an elevated MMA so she was started on vitamin B12 supplementation.
Stool and serum H. pylori antigen pending per GI recs.
She should also complete a 1 week treatment of fluconazole treatment for the [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.
No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG and troponin <0.01 x 3.
Pt was given vitamin K 5mg po with INR normalization 1.4->1.1.
?s disease: Pt was restarted on sinemet at home dose 2 tab q2h after not receiving medication since Monday [**9-25**].
Home neurologist felt that pt's hypotension, acute anemia and npo may have contributed to overmedication with sinemet, and recommended decreasing dose to 1 tab q2.
# Dispo: Ms [**Known lastname 634**] expressed interest in going home and had no interest in going to rehab.
