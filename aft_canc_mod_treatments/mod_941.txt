He was found to have portal vein thrombosis, bloody nasogastric lavage, bright red blood per rectum, tachypnea and repiratory distress.
# Portal Vein Thrombosis (main, left, right):  Given the patient's history of a lung mass on CT at an outside hospital, malignancy was initially of great concern although hypercoaguable diseases, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis were also considered.
The patient was started on a heparin drip on HD 2 after an endoscopy confirmed no active bleeding.
A hypercoaguability panel was deferred to a later date as the patient was already started on heparin.
The patient was initially given an albumin load and started on a lasix drip.
The lasix drip was switched to lasix boluses becuase the patient's BUN was increasing.
The patient was given kayexalate, bicarbonate and lasix with some improvement in his potassium.
Extensive discussions with the patient revealed that he did not wish for invasive interventions, hemodialysis, to improve metabolic status.
The patient was given an 80mg bolus of lasix with low urine output.
The patient's metabolic acidosis initially improved with albumin and lasix.
The patient developed agitation in the afternoon which was thought to be secondary to receiving ativan and morphine for a CT scan as the onset coincided.
The patient was given his celexa in the evening and was noted to calm down.
Bicarbonate and Narcan were also given and antibiotic therapy was extended to vancomycin and cefepime.
The patient was supported maximally with levophed and phenylephrine drips.
A central line was placed in the right femoral artery for central access.
A CT chest abdomen and pelvis was performed without contrast (the patient has renal failure) on HD 3 to evaluate interval change of prior masses and evaluation of possible new masses.
Palliative care and the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Diabetes doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] to discuss the patient's stated wish to not pursue invasive treatment measures.
The patient expressed wishes to not have dialysis, chemotherapy or non-curative surgery.
?s hypoxemia is likely multifactorial: likely a combination of volume overload, pulmonary vascular shunting from liver thrombi, restrictive due to increased intraabdominal pressure w/ ascites, restrictive due to obesity, underlying pulmonary disease from chronic smoking.
The patient was being treated for portal venous thrombosis with heparin drip, which is the treatment for PE.
# Spontaneous Bowel Perforation: A diagnostic paracentesis was postive for SBP although the patient demonstrated no clinical signs of encephalopathy or fever.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone and an albumin challenge for HD 1 and 3. .
Diabetes: PO diabetic drugs were held.
Blood sugars were covered Humulin 15U HS and insulin sliding scale.
# Anxiety / pain: The patient's anxiety and pain were treated with IV morphine and ativan.
The patients gabapentin and buspar were started when the patient was cleared for diet .
The patient's antihypertensive medications were held as he was normotensive on admission.
The patient was initially treated with IV ppi and octreotide.
Endoscopy revealed no variceal bleeding and octreotide was discontined and ppi was changed to PO.
Medications on Admission: Nizoral 2 % 1 per day Dextroamphetamine Sulfate 10 Mg 1 po qid Humulin N 100/ml as directed, up to 15 units daily Hydrochlorothiazide 25 Mg take 1 tablet (25MG) by ORAL route every day Celexa 20 Mg UNKNOWN TAKE ONE TABLET 1 TIME PER DAY Neurontin 600 Mg UNKNOWN 1 [**Hospital1 **] and 2 qhs Buspar 30 Mg 1 po bid Doxazosin Mesylate 2 Mg 1 tab in a [**12-24**] a day Simvastatin 40 Mg take 1 tablet (40MG) by ORAL HS Lorazepam 1 Mg [**12-24**] to 1 [**Hospital1 **] prn Metformin Hcl 500 Mg two pills twice a day Lisinopril 40 Mg take 2 tablet (80MG) by ORAL route every day Glipizide 10 Mg twice daily Norvasc 10 Mg 1 time per day Viagra 100 Mg as needed Ultram 50mg as needed Vitamin B-1 100 Mg Folic Acid 1mg once a day  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Renal Failure.
