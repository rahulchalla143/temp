Given these findings, she was consented the following day for surgery to remove the mass to take place on [**2132-8-29**].
She was loaded with dilantin and decadron was initiated.
A CTA was perfromed to see if there was vascular supply to the mass, which showed: No large, direct arterial supply or large, direct venous drainage seen to the mass.
The following morning, she went to the OR for a craniotomy and resection with an MR wand study beforehand, showing a stable mass in the atrium of the right ventricle.
Neurology was consulted at this point, and an MRI showed probable acute infarct in the right posterior lenticulostriate territory adjacent to the ventricle, as well as postoperative changes with resection of mass without residual nodular enhancement.
ASA was held for concerns of post-op bleeding.
A psych consult was obtained for persistent agitation and exacerbation of her schizoaffective disorder, who recommended a 1:1 sitter, and re-adjusted her psych meds, including adding seroquel and prn haldol.
A speech and swallow study was also performed, and she was cleared for PO ground solids and pureed food and thin liquids.
She was screened for an acute psych rehab where she could receive PT, and was accepted at Radius Specialty care.
She is sent to rehab on a steroid taper.
