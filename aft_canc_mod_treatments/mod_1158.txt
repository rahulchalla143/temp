Purulent secretions were also noted in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
Within hours of being transferred to rehabilitation, the patient again began tachypneic and started with hemoptysis with an increased oxygen requirement.
Status post radical nephrectomy demonstrating a clear cell type.
Status post left wedge resection for a pulmonary nodule consistent with metastatic clear cell carcinoma in [**2132-3-31**].
f.  The patient has undergone photodynamic therapy, brachy therapy, left lung wedge resection, and YAG laser therapy for his endobronchial lesions but continued to have intractable hemoptysis.
Small-bowel obstruction; status post partial bowel resection.
Endobronchial lesion; status post photodynamic therapy, brachy therapy, left lung wedge resection, YAG laser therapy.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2137-4-10**].
Status post prostatectomy for benign prostatic hypertrophy in [**2124**].
Tylenol as needed.
Xanax 0.25 mg twice per day.
Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once per day.
Codeine phosphate 15 mg to 30 mg by mouth q.6h.
Pepcid 20 mg twice per day.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times per day.

Lopressor 25 mg q.8h.
Morphine 10 mg intravenously q.6h.
Remeron 30 mg at hour of sleep.
Atrovent nebulizers q.6h.
The neck was supple, and the patient was using accessory muscles with respiration.
Abdominal examination revealed a scaphoid abdomen, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube intact without erythema, nontender.
HEMOPTYSIS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with intractable hemoptysis despite multiple procedures performed at [**Hospital6 1708**].
The patient had been discharged from the [**Hospital6 4193**] after a bronchoscopy showed no further options for intervention from their standpoint.
The patient was intubated for increasing acidosis.
He was taken to the operating room for a rigid bronchoscopy shortly after intubation.
A Y-stent was placed by Interventional Radiology.
Following extubation, the patient stated that he felt less short of breath but was still extremely tachypneic and using accessory muscles with respiration.
The patient and his daughter wished to know if there were any possible further interventions that could prolong the patient's life.
They did not have any further aggressive interventions for the time being.
At the time of discharge, his oxygen saturation was stable on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
He was still using accessory muscles with respiration.
He was continued on his albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers as well as cough suppressants throughout the hospitalization.
He continued to be aggressively suctioned and a was placed on a scopolamine patch to reduce secretions.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone and beta blocker.
He had previously been on Coumadin, but his Coumadin was held due to ongoing hemoptysis.
The patient was made nothing by mouth and started on a course of levofloxacin and clindamycin.
He was started on tube feeds to assist with improving his nutrition.
However, the patient did not require any platelet transfusions, as his platelets remained greater than 50,000 throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient has had three swallowing studies at [**Hospital6 1708**] earlier this month which he had failed.
However, they compromised with the patient and let him eat puree/thick liquids.
A video swallow study showed aspiration with thin liquids and nectar consistency despite swallowing maneuvers.
Speech and Swallow diagnosed the patient with a moderate/severe pharyngeal dysphagia due to significant pharyngeal weakness resulting in poor airway protection, severe pharyngeal residue, and aspiration of thin and thick liquids.
The patient was very reluctant to be nothing by mouth, but given his adamant desire to be a full code and to have everything possible done for him, it was explained to the patient and his daughter that his aspiration was only worsening his pulmonary status.
He was started on tube feeds to assist with nutrition.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Out of bed to chair with assistance; oxygen saturation stable on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula; short of breath at rest; tachypneic; using accessory muscles with respiration; hemodynamically stable otherwise.
Endobronchial lesions; status post Y-stent placement.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Please note that all by mouth medications are to be given through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
