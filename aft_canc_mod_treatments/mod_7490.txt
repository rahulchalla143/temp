He was initially admitted there [**2163-9-11**] with gallstone pancreatitis.
He was also found to be + for C diff, and started on po Vanc.
He is also on a course of IV Vanc for concern for right foot cellulitis.
Of note, his R IJ has been changed over a wire, but not replaced.
Prior to transfer the patient underwent tracheotomy tube placement.

HEENT: Limited exam given inflation of eyelids but sclera anicteric, PERRL.
Somewhat dry MM, limited exam of oropharynx Neck: difficult to evaluated JVP given trach and body habitus Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Distant heart sounds; regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: bowel sounds present; distended, somehwat firm GU: foley draining clear urine Ext: warm, pedal edema; no clubbing or cyanosis.

**FINAL REPORT [**2163-10-4**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2163-10-4**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
The NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm.
Left IJ catheter tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
The right superficial femoral, right popliteal and right calf veins also demonstrate compressibility, however grayscale images are nondiagnostic.
Intravenous contrast was deferred secondary to impaired renal function.
An enteric tube is demonstrated with tip terminating within the stomach.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: A rectal catheter is demonstrated in place.
The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter with air in the nondependent portion.
An apparent 6mm subpleural nodule in the left lower lobe (2:24) could represent atelectasis but should be followed on subsequent imaging.
A central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.
Endotracheal tube terminates in appropriate position.
A 6 x 4 cm marginated oval mass centered within the right adrenal gland again demonstrates punctate calcifications and macroscopic fat compatible with an adrenal myelolipoma.
A rectal tube has been inserted.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without the use of intravenous contrast.
A gastric tube terminates in the distal body of the stomach.
Low-density corresponds to areas of necrosis demonstrated on prior contrast-enhanced examination.
This contains internal calcifications and measures 40 Hounsfield units.
The bladder is decompressed with Foley catheter and contains air, likely from instrumentation.
A rectal tube is in place.
A right common femoral venous catheter and left common femoral arterial catheter are present.
Complex exophytic left lower pole renal lesion and adjacent cystic lesion with calcification in the rim.
5 mm lower lobe nodular opacities may relate to inflammatory changes and should be followed on subsequent imaging.
The hospital course was characterized by overall progressive clinical decline, with escalating mechanical ventilator requirement, hypoxemia, escalating vasopressor needs, progressive acidosis despite continue renal dialysis, rising lactic acidosis and rising WBC.
Following daily updates with available family members, with continued overall clinical decline and lack of progress despite maximal medical MICU supportive measures, decision to move to focus on patient comfort.
The family (sister [**Doctor First Name 17236**] was notified and post mortem examation was declined.
Foley catheter tip with debris stuck in tip, GPCs and GNRs on gram stain.
Pt not tolerating being off wall suction, so continuing IV Flagyl, bladder pressures remained elevated (26 this AM).
Con't IV vanc given concern for catheter tip infection and small area of right foot concerning for cellulitis.
Added cefepime to cover for gut and urinary sources, particularly given persisant fat stranding on CT. IV Flagyl will cover gut anaerobes.
Patient was started on oral vanc on [**10-5**] once residuals in gut had decreased given concern for untreated cdiff with rising leukocytosis.
He was also started on Ticacyline and PR Vancomcyin when not taking orally because of significant ileus.
Pt may also benefit from diuresis to improve his mechanics.
Pt was started on CVVH for fluid removal.
Concern for a component of obstruction given debris in foley catheter tip, but no hydronephrosis on US and no improvement in Cr after foley changed.
HD line placed and CVVH initiaed [**2163-10-2**] through [**2163-10-8**].
# Trach with air leak: Per report, was a difficult dissection given neck habitus.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt had been on insulin gtt at OSH, but covered with sliding scale here (glc in the 100s-200s).
