Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo F with h/o DMII, HTN, paroxysmal Afib on Sotalol and Coumadin at home here for left temporal melanoma resection, parotidectomy, left neck dissection and flap reconstruction on [**2165-9-13**] and then in Afib RVR peri-op.
# Afib RVR: Pt was in Afib RVR, HR in 130-140s, subsequently rate controlled with IV Metoprolol doses PRN then, switched to 50mg PO BID.
Also, anticoagulation with heparin gtt was started, but given the recent surgery was very cautious (no bolus, PTT goal of 50-70 and q3h checks).
Pt was started back on Coumadin which was held for the surgery.
Daily INRs were checked and Coumadin dose was adjusted accordingly.
Although TEE/cardioversion was initially considered, this pt's current Afib is likely [**12-31**] to stress from recent surgery and period off her home Sotalol.
Thus, rate-control with Sotalol (120mg [**Hospital1 **]) and Metoprolol (50mg [**Hospital1 **]) and bridging to Coumadin for anticoagulation was pursued.
Meanwhile, pt spontaneously converted to NSR, thus Heparin gtt was discontinued.
Coumadin was continud however and pt was discharged on home dose, to be followed up with INR check soon.
#  S/P melanoma excision: Left temporal melanoma resection, parotidectomy, left neck dissection and flap reconstruction were performed by Plastics on [**2165-9-13**].
pt tolerated surgery well.
Left forearm had xeroform/kerlex dressing changed daily.

Ancef was given as long as JP drain was in.
Pt was maintained on insulin sliding scale.
#  HTN: Was well-controlled, not on home HCTZ currently.
# Pt was on a diabetic diet.
For DVT ppx, pt was initially on Heparin gtt, bridging to Coumadin, however once Heparin gtt stopped and Coumadin was still not therapeutic, started SC Heparin.
Pain management was with Percocet and bowel regimen was with Docusate, Senna, Bisacodyl.
