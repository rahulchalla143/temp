Pertinent Results: CYTOGENETICS: FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at 22q11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 92/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this probe in our laboratory.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY: FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at 22q11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 95/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this probe in our laboratory.
Faint lucency through navicular on the right of uncertain significance.
Enteric tube sideport situated above GE junction; advance for standard positioning.
56 yo M with PMH of CHF, PVD, recent dx osteomyelitis on linezolid and irtepenem, newly dx'ed CML, pulmonic stenosis, CAD and DM was transferred from an OSH for further management of CML.
He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and delirium both thought to be [**12-31**] leukostasis.
Was plasmapheresed and received chemotherapy as below.
Also received significant hydration in setting of uric acid of 14 and systemic chemotherapy.
Became massively fluid overloaded requiring ultrafiltration intermittently.
Initially treated with linezolid, cefepime and cipro which was narrowed to daptomycin and cefepime to complete treatment for VAP.
He had difficulty weaning from the ventilator so tracheostomy was placed.
With initiation of dialysis / ultrafiltration and aggressive fluid removal he was able to be weaned to trach mask.
He was off the ventilator for > 24 hours at the time of discharge.
Oncology was consulted on admission and the patient was treated with Hydrea and Gleevec.
He was started on allopurinol.
He underwent plasmapheresis once.
Bone marrow biopsy was not adeuate for further cytogenetics but was also bcr-abl positive, consistent with accelerated CML, and he was continued on above treatment.
In consultation with the  hematology oncology service, gleevac was stopped as his WBC normalized and his hematocrit and platelet count were low.
Allopurinol was stopped.
He underwent ultrafiltration with volume removal.
The renal failure was initially non-oliguric and he was started on diuretics.
However, his urine output trailed off and his creatinine worsened.
He underwent placement of a tunneled line and was started on alternating hemodialysis and ultrafiltration for fluid removal.
He was started on sevelemer but this was stopped as his phosphate was low-normal.
He should continue to have HD on tuesday/thursday/saturday.
Treated with daptomycin (changed from linezolid due to concern for marrow suppression), cefepime and cipro for VAP.
# Hypotension:  Was intermittently hypotensive requiring pressor suppor which correlated to need for sedation and pain control as had siginficant pain.
# Fever: Patient developed fever while intubated and was treated with abx as above.
Also treated with micafungin for several days given he had significnat skin breakdown from anasarca and concern for fungal infection.
Initially treated with linezolid and irtepenem which was changed to meropenem on admission.
Ultimately treated with daptomycin (changed from linezolid due to concern for marrow suppression) and cefepime (also covering for VAP in presence of purulent sputum on bronch) for a total of 6 weeks, last dose planned for [**2177-7-8**].
The ketamine was stopped and the ectopy resolved.
He was started on metoprolol for suppression of ectopy.
# Thrombocytopenia:  Developed in setting of chemotherapy and systemic illness.
Required transfusions for <50 given GIB (see below) and procedures.
Linezolid changed to Daptomycin given concern for bone marrow suppression.
Required transfusions on several occasions for hct<21.
Required significant amounts of fenanyl while intubated to keep pain at [**2177-4-3**].
Used dilaudid iv and ultimately a ketamine drip to control pain.
He developed ventricular tachycardia on ketamine so this was stopped.
The fentanyl was weaned down and he was transitioned to a fentanyl patch with dilaudid PO PRN, which kept his pain at 5-7 which he deamed tolerable.
Coumadin was restarted at a dose of 5mg per day on [**2177-6-25**].
HCT should be monitored in the setting of anticoagulation given his GI Bleed.
Required lasix gtt, metolozone and ultimately ultrafiltration.
He was started on a steroid cream with significant improvement.
Treated with Reglan which was then discontinued.
Weekly labs to include CK, LFTs, Bun, creatinine and CBC.

You required intubation with subsequent chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.
You were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for the osteomyelitis and pneumonia with a plan to continue a course until [**2177-7-2**].
You required initiation of hemodialysis.
This was likely due to a medication you were on (ketamine), as it resolved once the medication was stopped.
You were started on metoprolol to maintain the normal heart rhythm.
You received plasmapharesis and were started on a medication called gleevac.
You should remain on daptomycin and cefepime until your appointment on [**7-8**].
While on Daptomycin and cefepime, you should have weekly labs to include CK, LFTs, Chem-10, and CBC.
