Patient presented to his PCP with these symptoms, and labs were significant for anemia, macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia and small IgG kappa and IgM kappa monoclonal proteins.
He does not use oxygen at home.
Patient tolerated procedure without issue and a drain was left in place.
Pericardial drain at lower right sternal border draining bloody fluid.
Mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy present, full extent difficult to ascertain in the absence of IV contrast.
Preliminary read: trace to small effusion without evidence of tamponade  Discharge labs: WBC 10.1  Hgb 13.4  Hct 39.8 Plts 220 Na 140 K 4.4 Cl 100 HCO3 30 BUN 37 Cr 1.7 Glucose 120   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo M with h/o HTN, HL, COPD with RUL lung mass and pericardial effusion recently noted on CT scan, presenting with pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology, s/p drainage of approximately 1L bloody fluid with malignant cells on cytology  # Pericardial effusion - Given findings on CT scan of lung mass and bloody fluid drained from pericardium, there was concern for a malignant effusion.
A pericardiocentesis was done with a pericardial drain placed for two days until fluid output slowed to a minimal level with a total of roughly 1L output from initial drainage plus drain output.
The drain was clamped and a TTE was done 24hrs later which showed no significant fluid reaccumulation and the drain was then pulled.
Outpatient laboratories were concerning for a macrocytosis and IgG/IgM monoclonal gammopathy.
# HTN- Blood pressures were stable throughout pericardial drainage and continue to be lowish but stable on arrival to CCU.
He was continued on his home lisinopril during admission.
Because of his lowish blood pressures, his home HCTZ dose was decreased to 25mg daily and his verapamil was stopped as it provides relatively little blood pressure control and their was no need for nodal blocking.
He was started on a nicotine patch durin the hospitalization.
Patient is not on home oxygen.
He was continued on home fluticasone and albuterol PRN during admission.
Continue home allopurinol and colchicine .
