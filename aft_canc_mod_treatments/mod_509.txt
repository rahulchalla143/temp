She demonstrated significant third spacing of her fluids with total body anasarca.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient empirically was started on ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a question of biliary sepsis.
The ERCP Service was consulted and felt that there was no need for ERCP at this time given these imaging findings.
The Pain Service was consulted and the patient was placed on a Ketamine drip briefly but then was transitioned to Dilaudid and morphine orally p.r.n.
An epidural catheter was considered; however, after further discussion with the patient, the patient's family, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the patient's oncologist, it was thought that the epidural catheter would not be the best decision given the management issues surrounding taking care of an epidural catheter.
The patient was also started on Xeloda for her metastatic breast cancer while in the Intensive Care Unit.
Left breast cancer in [**2099**], status post chemotherapy and radiation treatment in [**2100-10-23**], status post lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
Roxicet one tablet p.o.
Fioricet one tablet q.a.m.
Paxil 20 mg p.o.
Tamoxifen 20 mg p.o.
However, on [**2102-4-16**], the patient became hypotensive with blood pressures running 70/40 without response to fluid boluses.
The patient's Foley catheter was replaced times two without any success in urine output.
The Foley was removed and a voiding trial was attempted; however, the patient did not urinate successfully and, therefore, the Foley catheter was replaced.
The patient's nutritional status was extremely poor as she was unable to eat much orally and it was decided during her Intensive Care Unit stay that TPN should not be initiated given her fluid spacing issues.
At that time, it was decided that aggressive measures to increase her blood pressure via pressors was not indicated.
The patient was made comfortable with a morphine drip and all other medications were terminated.
