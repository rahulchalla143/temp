Patient first noticed increased hoarseness 1 week ago.
Then started having sharp, right sided, constant [**12-23**] neck pain 5 days ago.
Additionally started having hemoptysis 3 days ago.
Admitted to ICU for monitoring given near airway compromise, and for further workup of neck mass.
Review of systems: +Weight loss   Past Medical History: - schizophrenia - severe depression - COPD/Asthma - hx of atypical chest pain - Hypertension - Chronic back pain, L4 radiculopathy - Peripheral vascular disease - psoriasis - s/p TAH - s/p cholecystectomy - h/o narcotic abuse in past - multiple previous UTI's .
Mild-to-moderate aspiration was observed with thin liquids and in part due to hyperextended position of the head, but not cleared with prompting.
The study of the neck demonstrates soft tissue laryngeal mass on the left, causing narrowing of the airway, the right neck mass is not clearly identified in this examination, please consider obtaining additional images under conscious sedation or under anesthesia for further characterization.
There is considerable compressive mass effect on the right jugular vein with complete encasement of the right external carotid artery.
Hoarseness [**2-16**] [**Doctor First Name **] and RLN involvement.
ENT was consulted who performed laryngoscopy and though patient most likely had supraglotic SCC with bilateral metastatis.
They did not think her airway was compromised and recommended biopsy of the node for diagnosis.
She received Dexamethasone 10 mg IV to help with swelling of neck mass and dysphagia.
On the medical floor the patient underwent FNA of a lymph node which showed SCC.
A double lumen port was placed and she was transfered to the oncology service and received Cis-platin, taxotere and a 4 day infusion of 5-FU.
The patient tolerated her chemotherapy well and was scheduled for follow up with her oncologist on [**2153-1-10**].
Was neutropenic for ~3 days - was given neupogen once counts were noted to be down trending.
Would consider neupogen given day after chemo given neutropenia with this cycle.
A PEG tube was placed through which the patient received nutrition and medications.
Her nutrition requirment was two cans of ensure (480 mL) TID with 100mL free water bolus with each feeding.
She was noted to have increased residuals at times - if continues would consider running continuous tube feeds at 65cc/hr.
The patient received IV morphine for pain control and olanzapine per home regimen and additional PRN.
She was highly fixated on these medications and perseverative.
These perseverations are a chronic issue as discussed with her psychiatrist.
She was also started on oxycodone 2.5mg q4hrs prn pain.
Shortness of breath: CT chest showed RLL consolidation and with history of COPD and wheezing on exam, she was treated with azithromycin IV 500 mg for 5 days for question CAP.
She was given IV dexamethasone for neck mass swelling and continued on her home tiotropium and albuterol q4.
The shortness in breath improved after these interventions and the patient continued to recieve albuterol nebulizers PRN and tiotropium Cap daily.
Hypertension: Home medications initially held as patient was NPO.
Restarted once NG tube was placed.
Patient had good BP control on her home lisinopril 20 mg daily.
# Urinary Retention:  Patient was initially treated for a UTI on admission.
While on OMED the patient was noted to not be voiding a foley catheter was placed and drained in excess of 1000 mL.
Foley was removed and patient was still retaining.
An MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**] was attempted, but due to the patient's extreme intolerance of the procedure as well as an aborted attempt at fiberoptic intubation due to bleeding of the mass no spinal cord imaging was possible.
The patient was discharged with a foley catheter in place and urology follow up.
Patient recieved pretreatment with prednisone and benadryl without incident or minor reaction.
She was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen including magnesium citriate with ability to move bowels.
She had significant perseverative behavior including asking for pain medications and significant psychomotor aggitation.
As she had a history of severe parkinsonian symptoms in the past zyprexa dosing was not changed and patient was treated sparingly with zyprexa for behavior control.
She was given nicotine patches and lozanges PRN.
Transitional Issues: - Port suture to be removed [**1-5**] by any physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **]4-mm right upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules should be evaluated with chest CT in one year.
- Patient is a high risk intubation even with fiberoptic visulization due to friability of the lyrangal mass, would need trach or cricotomy for emergent intubation.
- Patient should continue to be offered nicotine cessation by her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] should have tube feeding switched to 65 cc/hr continuous if continues with high residuals - Patient was discharged with a foley catheter in place - Patinet was discharged with urology and oncology follow up - Patient will need pshyciatry follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Name8 (MD) 94003**], MD, [**Location (un) **], MA [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94004**] after discharge from Rehab - Patient will need PCP follow up once discharged from Rehab  Medications on Admission: Albuterol Lisinopril 20mg QD lorazepam 0.5mg TID olanzapine 5mg QHS omeprazole 40mg QD spiriva aspirin 81mg QD   Discharge Medications: 1. tiotropium bromide 18 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: One (1) Cap Inhalation DAILY (Daily).
