Brief Hospital Course: 75y/o WF w/ TCC s/p L nephrectomy is being called out from the CCU after an admission for SOB.
She was prepped for bronchoscopy with probable stent placement but desaturated during preparation for the bronch and was transfered to the MICU for further management on [**1-2**].
In the ICU, she was treated symptomatically with morphine for her SOB with improvement and possible pericardiocentesis and tissue biopsy were discussed with the family.
However, in light of her over all poor prognosis, discussion was initiated with palliative care at the request of both the daughter and the patient.
She is comfortable with avoiding vital signs and blood draws for the remainder of her admission but elected to continue taking her home medications.
Standard home hospice prescriptions (pain meds, bowel regimen, anxiolytics, and antisecretory agents) were filled out and faxed to the hospice per their protocol.
