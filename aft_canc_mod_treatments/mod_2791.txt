# Brain masses/Intracranial Hemorrhage The patient was admitted for further work-up of his brain masses with the differential being PML vs. lymphoma given two negative LPs excluding other causes.
The patient received mannitol and was hyperventilated to decrease intracranial pressure.
The patient was continued on his keppra until [**8-30**], when he was changed to phenytoin for rising LFTs as discussed below.
His lactulose and rifaximin were continued.
However, around [**8-25**], the patient's mental status began to decline, despite a stable head CT, aggressive titration of his lactulose, and treatment of a concurrent UTI (see below).
#Hyperbilirubinemia: Beginning [**8-29**], the patient's bilirubin began to rise (his baseline for this hospitalization was between 5 and 7).
No hepatobilliary obstructive process was observed on abdominal ultrasound.
His bactrim and HAART therapy were discontinued on [**9-6**], after which his bilirubin stabilized around 20.
Pending sensitivities he was started on vanco + zosyn (to cover oral anaerobes/gram negs).
He was treated with a 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin 400mg q12h with good effect.
His spirolactone and lasix were held and his Cr returned to its baseline.
# HIV The patient's recent viral load was undetectable with CD4 count of 226.
He was continued on Atripla and his bactrim prophylaxis.
# Portal vein thrombosis The patient was admitted on anticoagulation for his portal vein thrombosis.
However, given the patient's intracranial hemorrhage during this hospital stay, his anticoagulation was discontinued and his INR was reversed with vitamin K.  #Hypertension The patient was started on metoprolol for improved blood pressure control in the setting of an intracranial bleed.
