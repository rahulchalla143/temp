Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
wound vac Intubation Swan-ganz catheter  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58-year-old female who underwent a right hemicolectomy, ileal transverse colostomy and cholecystectomy on [**2185-10-27**] for an invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum with invasion into the wall and into the pericolonic adipose tissue.
Over the past year she has been treated with chemotherapy and has had follow-up CT scans that have shown resolution of the peritoneal findings and ascites along with significant shrinkage of the liver masses.
She is admitted on this admission for elective hepatic resections.
Past Medical History: Elevated cholesterol, colon cancer, R hemicolectomy, ileotransverse colostomy, and cholecystectomy ([**2184**]), craniotomy in [**2168**] for an aneurysm.
Colon segment with peritoneal fibrous adhesions and focal acute peritonitis.
Subcutaneous fluid in the right upper extremity as detailed above.
Hyperdense collections along multiple surgical resection beds likely represent resolving postoperative hematoma and indwelling surgical glue and Surgicel.
CXR [**1-24**] The position of the Dobbhoff tube, Port-A-Cath and the PICC line as well as abdominal drains is unchanged.
CXR [**1-26**]  Findings: There has been no interval change in the position of Port Cath, PICC line, endotracheal tube, NG tube, the drainage tube of the right upper quadrant.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] general surgery service and taken to the operating room on [**2187-1-5**] for a left hepatic lobectomy, segment [**5-30**] mass resection, segment 6, mass resection x2, extensive lysis of adhesions, biopsy of the right lobe of the liver, and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
Patient did require pressors and fluid for hypotension and oliguria overnight.
Unasyn for empiric prophlaxis.
NG placed for gastric decompression.
Placed on insulin sliding scale for blood sugar control.
On [**2187-1-5**] - [**2187-1-9**], she was weaned off pressor support.
Still required mulitple fluid supplementation for oliguria.
Pain controlled with IV morphine.
Received fluid bolus x 2 for marginal urine output.
She was transferred to ICU, given lasix for diuresis.
With prolonged NPO state, TPN initiated and nutrition consulted.
Pt was then intubated for resp distress.
Started on Vanco/Flagyl/Zosyn for empiric coverage given elevated wbc (29); C.Diff sent with sudden development diarrhea; CT abd repeated; A-line and CVL placed; and Vigileo started.
Placed on maximum volume of pressor support for hypotension.
On [**2187-1-13**] she received lasix with FFP to help with diuresis and improving respiratory status.
Noticed erythema around incisional site, requiring multiple dressing changes for leakage.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT, albumin started, vasopressin started.
Patient was weaned off all pressors and weaned to CPAP with pressure support.
Dobhoff placed to begin tubefeeds, picc line placed, zosyn was discontinued.
Started on meropenem for better G- coverage for presumed cellulitis in addition to vancomycin.
With high drain output from abdomen, CT ordered, revealing wound dehiscence and bilateral pneumonia.
She remained briefly hypotensive (SBP 80s), received albumin x 1 w/ good response, UOP remained stable.
Hct slowly trending down, oliguria responsive to fluid boluses.
Attempted to continue intravascular protein repletion with albumin.
Lasix held.
Pain medication held to improve mental status.
On [**2187-1-23**], patient repleted with IV hydration and albumin due to excessive drainage from wound vac.
Vancomycin dosing held and adjusted based on trough levels.
Aztreonam started for G- coverage, meropenem stopped for questionable etiology of rash.
She required boluses/albumin for prerenal (FENA 0.2).
Responding to intermittent fluid boluses.
Treated with hepatorenal protocol with albumin infusion.
With worsening respiratory status, increasing work of breathing, requiring intubation to support airway.
Patient received bronchoscopy, which revealed no major mucus plugging.
Swan-ganz was attempted to assess and monitor patient's overall state given state of multi-organ failure.
Given multi-organ failure (liver, renal, pulmonary distress) and prognosis, family's decision was to discontinue all intervention on [**2187-1-26**].
Patient started on a morphine drip for comfort measures.
Tube feeds, antibiotics and all other medications were discontinued.
