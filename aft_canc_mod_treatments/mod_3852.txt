Patient is s/p right lung decortication in [**Month (only) **], complicated by C. diff and empyema and re-hospitalization.
She called to report thick, tarry stool this morning and hypoxia to the 70's (has been on chronic O2 since the surgery in [**Month (only) **]).
Received 2 L IVF--->hypoxic with CXR findings of vol overload.
Has not been on any recent antibiotics or ofther meds.
Status post CABG x3 in [**2189**].
Status post right carotid endarterectomy in [**2189**].
He was discharged from this operation on [**2191-10-26**], and readmitted on [**10-28**] with an empyema--->anterior loculated hydropneumothorax, which eventually was positive for MRSA.
Daughet is HCP (lives with him)   Family History: non-contrib  Physical Exam: T:96.9 P:AF with RVR 99-141 on tele R:18-30 BP:119/90 SaO2:99% on NRB General: Awake, alert, oriented x3; speaking [**2-4**] words/breath.
1+ DP and PT pulses b/l.
C-Scope: [**2191-6-3**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  .
FINDINGS: There is again present a Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip terminating in the distal left pulmonary artery.
An endotracheal tube and an NG tube remains in stable position.
Median sternotomy wires are noted.
The NG tube has been removed.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old male with multiple medical problems, on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, who initially presented with melanotic stools in setting of supratherapudic INR.
During his second course of intubation, he was treated for his pneumonia and his secretions improved.
He was also restarted on his lasix drip to maximize his lung mechanics for another try at extubation.
Had aspiration event, per family meeting, decision for Comfort Measures Only, patient expired on on morphine gtt due to respiratory distress.
he was therefore started on Vanc/Zosyn for a 10 day course of aspiration vs vent-associated pneumonia.
Given change in goals of care, no further antibiotics were administered.
Morphine gtt administered for comfort care.
Started on amio drip on [**12-14**] with no response in HR (still ~120s) and MAPs stable in 70s.
Lasix drip was started on and off for diuresis, was off all drips given change in care.
Started on Lasix gtt on [**12-15**] with no increase in urine output.
Then started on nitro gtt for additional afterload reduction but this was stopped after dramatic drop in BP.
Pt was then started on Dobutamine briefly but this was again stopped after drop in BP.
Pt was started on Levophed with improvement in MAPs so Lasix gtt was again resumed.
As BP improved, Levpophed was titrated off and pt was restarted on his ACE-I and BB for further afterload reduction.
On [**12-26**], pt had another episode of pulm edema that was not responsive to nitro patch, morphine and lasix x 2. he was placed on BiPAP but was tachypneic to 40-50s with minute ventilation of 22-23.
Again, he was started on levophed for a drop in his BP but also on a lasix gtt for diuresis.
As above, lasix drip and levophed was started on and off according to his pressure.
His became alkalotic with further diuresis with difficultly in weaning and was started on diamox on [**1-2**].
Given change in care status, no further diuresis was pursued while CMO.
Cardiac meds were held as patient CMO.
* CAD: Pt with troponin bump to 0.56 in setting of acute event of GI bleed and afib/RVR with hypotension, hence likely demand ischemia.
[**Name (NI) 54984**], pt was weaned off pressors and restarted on his ACE-I and BB.
troponin trended down and repeat echo showed normalization of EF.
The swan was replaced and CO was determined prior to and following an SBT.
INR reversed with FFP and vitamin K, now normalized.
Hct stable s/p 5U PRBCs total.
Urine output improved with lasix gtt and Levophed for better BP.
