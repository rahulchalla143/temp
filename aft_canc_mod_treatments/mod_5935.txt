Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo F with multiple myeloma, recurrent after autologous transplant, radiation and systemic therapy who is being admitted with worsening pain, hypercalcemia and concern for new bone lesions.
# Multiple Myeloma: Patient has a long history of multiple myeloma which unfortunately relapsed almost one year following her autologous stem cell transplant with painful lytic lesions requiring radiation therapy.
She now has new lesions in her skull and sinuses and mandible and was due for possible surgery on Wednesday [**2195-12-23**].
She last received Zometa in 2/[**2195**].
Patient has not had constipation, abdominal pain, hematuria (nephrolithiasis), mood changes with her hypercalcemia.
Given the concerning read of compression fractures, MRI thoracic spine was urgently ordered and Radiation Oncology as well as Neurosurgery/Spine consulted.
They recommended outpatient follow-up in approximately 3 months with repeat imaging.
Radiation Oncology also saw patient and given Neurosurgery's recs, they agreed to do radiation therapy to the thoracic compression sites in addition to her rib and cranial lesions at her next outpatient sessions with RadOnc a few weeks after the craniotomy (to allow for healing first).
Patient was started on Dexamethasone for hypercalcemia of malignancy as well as prevention/management of concern for cord compression.
This was eventually discontinued given her normal serum calciums and less concerning compression fractures.
Patient was also given Pamidronate 90mg IV X1 with good effect.
- Pain was initially managed with home Oxycontin and new PO Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
When she continued to suffer significant rib and cranial pain s/p craniotomy, her Oxycontin was increased to 20mg TID and patient sent home with PO Dilaudid.
She was also given compazine/zofran as needed for nausea.
UTI: There was concern for a urinary tract infection given fevers and Foley X2 days after Neurosurgery took patient to [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] for craniotomy.
She was treated with a full course of Levofloxacin.
# Hypertension: Stable, was continued on home HCTZ once blood pressures stable.
