A CAT scan done in the emergency department suggested that you might have pancreatitis, which is inflammation of your pancreas, thus you were admitted to the the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for further treatment and monitoring.
In the ICU, you were given fluids, pain medications, and anti-nausea medications which improved your symptoms.
You were also put on nasal cannula to help with your breathing because your oxygen levels were slightly low when you arrived, but this improved and you nolonger required oxygen.
Since you had mentioned that you hadn't had a bowel movement for a week, you were also started on stool softeners and laxatives which resulted in several bowel movements on your last day in the intensive care unit, which relieved your symptoms significantly.
We recommend that you eat a low-fat diet, low in sodium and potassium given your kidney disease.
We encourage you to you consider quitting smoking and continue abstaining from alcohol to reduce the risk of a recurrence of your pancreatitis.
Medication changes: 1) Please continue to take all of the medications that you were taking before admission 2) Please also take senna and milk of magnesia as needed for constipation   Followup Instructions: Follow-up appointments: 1) Please follow up with your primary care office.
