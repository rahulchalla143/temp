Pt also at risk since on chronic steroids, could contribute to mucosal ulceration.
The pt was transfused 4 units pRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**] in the ICU (had been given two units at OSH) and he was also given two units of FFP pre-procedure.
At the time of admission, the pt was initiated on an octreotide gtt as well as Cipro; these were discontinued once the results of the EGD were known and he was started on nadolol 20mg and Carafate.
Over the rest of his admission he was given 2 more units of pRBCs and his hct was between 26 and 31, 27.1 at discharge.
As above, he was initially treated with Cipro for possible variceal bleed and his diuretics were held while hypotensive with his acute bleeding.
If after he stops drinking the gastropathy bleeds again, he may need a TIPS procedure in the future.
Home steroids were continued at 2.5mg per day.
Iron studies were borderline low, pt was started on iron 325mg per day.
