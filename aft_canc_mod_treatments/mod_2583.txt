No pathologic fracture  Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old male with progressive metastatic lung cancer and membranous nephropathy who presents with left thigh pain in the setting of a new left femur lytic lesion.
The patient and his family decided to defer surgery and proceed with radiation therapy.
The patient was immediately placed on non-weight-bearing for his left lower extremity; the patient started with his activity restricted to bedrest and as he did well, he graduated to out of bed with walker and assist per orthopedic recommendations.
He was placed on vasopressors, and treated for a presumed penumonia.
After a long discussion involving the primary oncology team and orthopedics, given the risks of operating, the family decided to defer surgery for now and complete radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy was resumed.
Pt received palidronate on [**2159-12-12**].
Nephrology was consulted and recommended holding his home diuretics (bumetanide, HCTTZ) but continuing with ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] and prednisone with bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
His HCTZ and bumetanide were re-added as his BP rose.
Creatinine was followed carefully with these additions and remained at his baseline.
He was treated with a 2 week course of Zosyn.
Sputum grew out sparse gram negative rods and patient was started on 2 week course of ceftazidime because of concern for partially treated pseudomonal pneumonia (sensitivities to Zosyn were borderline).
His blood pressure stabilized, and He was sent out to complete a two-week course of IV ceftazidime.
He was treated with ipatropium and albuterol nebulizers.
Albuterol nebulizers were changed to levalbuterol nebulizers given the patient's baseline tachycardia.
During his stay at ICU, he was given a steroid burst which was tapered back to his home dose of prednisone.
He was placed back on his complete home regimen of ACEI, [**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ, and bumetanide.
Beta blockers were avoided given his poor respiratory status and past records noting inability to tolerate beta blockers.
However blood pressure again became tenuous requiring boluses with IV fluids.
Hyperglycemia:  This is likely due to steroids and olanzapine.
His home glipizide was held and he was placed on a Humalog insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
CHF: Pt was maintained on home regimen of ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ, and Bumetanide.
He was maintained on a low sodium diet, but all antihypertensives were held as blood pressure was low.
Plavix was held after his perifracture hematoma.
BP meds held.
Schizophrenia and Paranoia:  Pt was continued on his outpatient regimen of olanzapine, lorazepam, and fluphenazine.
