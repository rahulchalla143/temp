-------------------- MRI head IMPRESSION:  Three cystic lesions are identified within the left parietal and occipital lobes with peripheral rim enhancement and no slow diffusion within the cystic portion of the lesions.
Attention to these on followup imaging.
[**2111-8-13**] head MRI post-op IMPRESSION:  Evacuation of the lower portion of the cystic mass with post-surgical changes including blood products and pneumocephalus.
Larger portion of the mass appears to have compressed with residual post-contrast enhancement around it.
