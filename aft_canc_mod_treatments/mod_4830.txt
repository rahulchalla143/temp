Admission Date:  [**2196-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-11-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2168-1-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: left arm tingling, diplopia, headaches, polyuria, polydypsia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CRANIOTOMY with resection of pituitary macroadenoma, [**2196-10-28**] PROCEDURE: 1.
Left-sided subfrontal and extended pterional approach for resection.
Microscopic dissection and resection of tumor at anteriod skull base.
Duraplasty using pericranial autograft.
Right PICC placed [**2196-11-12**]  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 28 year old man  who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-25**] in [**Location (un) 5503**], MA with 3-4 weeks of arm numbness, associated with headaches, polyuria/polydipsia, and double vision.
ED course here was notable for brief desaturation to the 70's while sleeping that resolved on stimulation and 2L of nasal O2.
Endocrine was consulted yesterday and recommended broad endocrine work-up given concern for secretory adenoma and possible acromegaly.
Also recommended insulin as patient was persistently hyperglycemic.
Patient never really got full trial of insulin sliding scale as persistent elevated blood sugars made surgery concerned and they put him on an insulin drip.
As of this morning the patient has a blood glucose of 100-200 on 18 units of IV insulin though he was also on a D5 drip.
Patient has been transitioned to sliding scale once again today w/ persistently elevated BG's in 300's but stable and no gap.
He is reportedly doing better on CPAP but yesterday was noted to desat once on room air and, despite finger [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 53484**] [**Location (un) 1131**] mid80s, ABG revealed O2 sat 91% 7.34/49/63.
Patient will come to medicine for titration of insulin regimen and awaiting final diagnosis and management of likely [**Hospital1 **] secreting tumor.
Past Medical History: None documented; family reports illness when very young at which time he received treatment via right arm injections which resulted in right arm deformity.
Immunostain for [**Hospital1 **], chromogranin, and synaptophysin are positive.
[**2196-10-23**] Endocrine consulted regarding high glucose levels (patient was not diabetic previously); Insulin drip was initiated.
While on medicine, the patient's insulin regimen was titrated and normoglycemia was attained.
He was started on CPAP at night and with naps.
On the am of [**2196-10-28**], the patient was nauseous and vomiting, was hypertensive, and continued to complain of vision changes.
He was therefore taken to the OR by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for emergent craniotomy and pituitary macroadenoma resection, after which he was taken to the SICU.
Only partial resection of mass was possible.
New onset diabetes mellitus was therefore from growth hormone stimulation of IGF-1 causing insulin resistance.
It is expected that his diabetes will improve over time with the lesion now removed.
============================================= SICU COURSE: While in the SICU the patient was noted to have persistent polyuria with dilute urine and polydypsia; was found to have post-operative panhypopituitarism with multiple endocrine abnormalities: increased [**Hospital1 **], IGF-1, and cortisol, decreased free T3, FSH, testosterone.
The pus in this lesion was drained by vascular surgery, and he was treated with intravenous vancomycin.
He was transferred to the medicine floor for further management on [**2196-11-5**].
Persisted following insulin management of hyperglycemia, making ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) or primary polydipsia mixed with DI more likely.
NPO/no IVF trial ([**11-5**] midnight to [**11-6**] afternoon) completed, overall put out 13L of dilute urine and took in 0.4L w/o substantial serum concentration; results suggest unmeasured intake of free water/salt during NPO trial.
Was able to concentrate urine at end of trial (urine Osm > 400) indicating some ADH secretion/responsiveness.
Endocrine did not think likely secondary to metabolic effects of [**Hospital1 **]/IGF-1 given severity of polyphagia.
#1C Adrenal Insufficiency: One measured cortisol prior to surgery at 20.8 (normal/high).
Goal is for AM Cortisol to be >10 with PM dose being held, at which point hydrocortisone could be discontinued.
#1D Hyperglycemia: Likely insulin resistance secondary to [**Hospital1 **] activation of IGF-1 secretion/signaling.
Insulin dependence persisted following surgery, may not completely resolve due to incomplete resection of adenoma.
- At time of discharge, 70 units glargine QHS and Metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] (Metformin started on [**2196-11-11**]).
After two weeks, Metformin dose could be increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
- MONITOR BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUES CLOSELY AS DIABETES WILL LIKELY RESOLVE AND LESS INSULIN WILL BE NEEDED AS [**Hospital1 **] AND IGF-1 LEVELS NORMALIZE AND ASSOCIATED INSULIN RESISTANCE IMPROVES.
Patient should have repeat TFTs in [**4-4**] weeks to see if dose needs to be changed.
- Testosterone will need to be rechecked as an outpatient.
Patient was started on vancomycin at that time (now day 10).
A PICC was placed on [**11-12**].
- Patient should be continued on vancomycin 1250 mg tid until [**11-23**] - ID recommends regular vancomycin troughs with a therapeutic goal = 15, and surveillance blood cultures .
Status post craniotomy and partial resection of [**Hospital1 **] secreting pituitary macroadenoma on [**10-28**].
Some non adenomatous pituitary tissue remained following resection, however, tissue was significantly compressed.
Sutures and staples have been removed - THE PATIENT IS ON SINUS PRECAUTIONS UNTIL [**11-25**] (no straws, no incentive spriometer, no nose blowing, no CPAP) - Repeat [**Hospital1 **]/IGF-1 levels from [**11-9**] are pending .
Studies done [**11-6**] showed Ferritin 53 (low normal), Iron 48 (low normal), TIBC 410 (high normal), transferrin 315, all.
Vitamin B12 and folate wnl.
- Patient has been on standing eye ointment with eye drops PRN - Outpatient follow-up with neuro-ophthalmology has been arranged.
He was deemed medically stable and fit for discharge to [**Hospital1 **] acute care rehabilitation on [**2196-11-12**] for completion of his IV antibiotic course.

As a result of this tumor being removed, you were left with hormone changes that will now require multiple new medications as outlined below.
You will require close follow-up as an outpatient.
All of your medications at the time of discharge are NEW.
IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HEALTH THAT YOU TAKE ALL OF THESE MEDICATIONS EXACTLY AS PRESCRIBED AND THAT YOU FOLLOW UP WITH ALL OF YOUR APPOINTMENTS.
