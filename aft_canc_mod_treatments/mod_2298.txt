[**2197-7-5**] Chest X ray: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina with its tip.
The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.
He was initially started on levofloxacin for empiric coverage for a pulmonary infection.
Later that day his antibiotic coverage was increased to vancomycin and cefepime.
He was satting well on a non-rebreather.
After intubation, multiple secretions/food were suctioned from his airway.
His antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin and zosyn.
He was started on norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin.
He received several fluid boluses.
On [**7-6**] micafungin was added for fungal coverage due to persistent fevers.
MRSA grew from BAL sputum on [**7-4**] and on subsequent sputums on [**7-6**] and [**7-7**].
Meropenem and linezolid were started based on ID recommendation.
Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, multiple pressors, and appropriate antibiotic coverage, he had signs of end organ damage.
All heparin products were temporarily discontinued pending results of the test.
His thrombocytopenia was ultimately thought to be due to his overwhelming infection and possible medication effects.

He was given metoprolol which slightly decreased his rate to the 150-160's.
After a loading dose, an amiodarone gtt was started.
