He received several boluses of insulin and was placed on an insulin gtt.
He was also given an amp of D50, calcium chloride, and kayexalate with subsequent decrease in K to 5.9.
He receieved 2 units of PRBCs which bumped his Hct to 24.7.
He was placed on 4L NC for decreased O2 sat.
L cadavaric kidney transplant ([**2152**]) for renal failure [**1-31**] presumed chronic glomerulonephritis 2.
Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis 7. s/p L AV fistula 8. hypercholesterolemia 9.
Renal transplant u/s: No hydronephrosis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M w/ ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic immunosuppressive therapy, presenting with AMS, thrombocytopenia, ARF, hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia, and respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with MDS on BM bx and persistent fevers of unknown origin, now on HD.
Cultures revealed no growth and he completed a 7 day course of zosyn/vancomycin for possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
He had some difficulty weaning off of PEEP believed to be secondary to volume overload in the setting of renal failure and his HD was increased to QD.
Following increased HD, he was able to be switched to pressure support on the ventilator and sedation was weaned.
He underwent trach and PEG without complication.
He was slowly able to be weaned off the vent with gradual return of respiratory muscle strength.
Prior to discharge he had no mechanical ventilation requirements and was maintained on trach mask alone.
Further studies were sent and he was started on doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection.
Because of persistent fevers his temporary dialysis catheter as well as his PICC were pulled and tip cultures were negative.
Following discontinuation of broad spectrum antibiotics, he remained afebrile on only doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection.
He completed a 14 day course of doxycycline and then again spiked a fever with associated hypotension.
He was restarted on vancomycin and zosyn as well as stress dose steroids with concern for sepsis.
His hypotension responded to fluid boluses.
He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin and was then off all antibiotics.
His steroids were tapered to baseline required for immunosuppresion for his renal transplant.
However, at the time of discharge, patient had been afebrile off of all antibiotics.
However, per heme/onc and transfusion medicine, there were only few schistocytes on peripheral smear and was not believed to be consistent with TTP-HUS.
There was initially some concern that anemia could have been due to Cyclosporin and it was stopped.
However, bone marrow biopsy was obtained and was suggestive of MDS and cyclosporin was restarted.
He received a total of 6 units PRBCs over the course of admission as well as 5 units of platelets.
Following cyclosporin restart, cell lines remained stable.
He required no further transfusions after [**12-22**].
Hematology Oncology recommended outpatient follow up to determine whether he required any further evaluation or treatment for possible MDS.
# Acute on CRI - s/p renal transplant.
Patient has been on chronic immunosuppressive therapy.
Outside transplant physician had been increasing doses of cyclosporin over past several months.
Cyclosporin held briefly given concern that it was causing/contributing to pancytopenia, but restarted once bone marrow bx suggestive of MDS.
Due to this, his cyclosporin was stopped given risk for renal vasoconstriction.
Immunosuppression was maintained with prednisone and cellcept.
His urine output eventually began to improve and his dialysis was again decreased to ~ 3 times a week as needed.
However, this clotted off and could not be opened by interventional radiology.
Therefore, prior to discharge, he received a tunneled Quinton line for further dialysis after discharge while his ATN continued to resolve.
He should have 24 hour urine studies checked intermittently to determine need for further dialysis.
# Hypertension - Patient had been resistant to multiple medications as outpatient previously.
Possibly secondary to steroids, although required high dose of beta blocker as outpatient.
He was initially managed with diltiazem, nifedipine, labetolol, and hydralazine.
Blood pressures improved with initiation of daily dialysis and he blood pressure medications were cut back.
Following a hypotensive episode as described above, his BP medications were stopped.
Eventually he was restarted on labetolol with hydralazine as needed with good blood pressure control.
However, towards the end of his admission, he once again converted to Afib with RVR which required a diltiazem drip for adequate rate control.
He was eventually transitioned to po diltiazem in addition to his labetolol with good heart rate control.
He did  not convert spontaneously and was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
EP then recommended chemical cardioversion as they felt he would be high risk of reverting to Afib in the setting of acute illness.
He was therefore loaded with 6 grams of amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg po BID.
His HRs were monitored with the start of amiodarone to determine the need for diltiazem weaning as the amiodarone took effect.
He was also started on coumadin for transition off of heparin drip.
- Patient was started on hydrocortisone for immunosuppression and had significant elevation in his blood sugars.
He required high doses of insulin sliding scale and was started on lantus which was uptitrated as high as 34 units QD.
However, following resolution of his fevers, he had some episodes of hypoglycemia and his insulin was cut back.
With return of his fevers and initiation of stress dose steroids in the setting of hypotension, his blood sugars once again elevated rapidly and he was started on an insulin drip.
The drip was continued until his steroids were weaned back down to his maintenance dose for immunosuppression for his renal transplant.
Banana flakes were added to be given in between tube feeds with some improvement in diarrhea.
# PPX - SC heparin followed by heparin drip followed by coumadin.
