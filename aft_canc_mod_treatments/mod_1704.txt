Lovenox and IVC filter were recommended and patient declined both.
On [**2157-7-16**], she syncopized and sustained a fall from standing height at rehab, resulting in left oblique displaced comminuted midshaft femur fracture.
This was repaired at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-7-20**] when she underwent a retrograde femoral nail for left femur fracture.
Post-operatively, patient was discharged on prophylaxis dose of lovenox 40 mg/0.4 ml sc qd.
EKG showed A-flutter and she was given an adenosine challenge.
Received IV diltiazem (5 mg x 3) and then diltiazem gtt, which was stopped after the CTA showed PE.
She was guaiac negative and started on heparin gtt.
Labs were notable for BNP 7400, troponin 0.08, Cr 1.4 (baseline 1.7), positive UA, and patient was given vancomycin + zosyn.
She underwent ERCP  on [**2156-10-4**] and a stent was placed.

Status post ORIF of the left femur with retrograde intramedullary nail and interlocking screws.
[**2157-8-7**] CXR: Left-sided PICC line with tip in the SVC is again seen.
Left PICC line can be traced as far as the mid-to-low SVC.

Her dyspnea and oxygen requirment continued to improve with this diuresis, and was 1.7L negative without lasix for 24 hours as of 8am [**2157-8-12**].
She was subsequently transferred to the floor where her lasix was restarted with goal of 1 liter negative per day.
Her lasix was continued on the floor with ongoing improvement.
Her lasix may need further dose titration for response.
Patient had been on prophylaxic doses of lovenox after previous hospitalization.
Patient started on heparin gtt and warfarin bridge initiated.
Note that Amiodarone dose is being reduced again at discharge, which will likely affect coumadin dosing/INR response.
Please see results section for recent INR's and corresponding warfarin dosing.
Her INR will need to be monitored very closely, especially given changing amiodarone dosing.
Received adenosine challenge and then IV diltiazem/diltiazem gtt treatment in the ED with poor response.
Attempted to rate control with esmolol gtt but blood pressure did not tolerate it.
Loaded with IV amiodarone and then transitioned to po amiodarone, and oral diltiazem which was subsequently discontinued.
Despite amiodarone, she remained in atrial flutter with sustained HR approx 100.
Her amiodarone dose was reduced at time of discharge per Cardiology recommendations.
Patient treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg po q12hr for 5 days.
Patient was insistent that foley not be discontinued, so her foley was changed on [**8-10**].
Given lack of fever or WBC, the decision was made to wait until urine culture resulted before starting antibiotics despite a UA with persistent pyuria.
Subsequent urine culture grew 10k-100k yeast, which given her absece of symptoms, dd not require further treatment at this time.
Her foley was attempted to be dc'd on [**2157-8-18**], however pt refused, and will need to be discontinued at rehab.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of afib with RVR and volume overload.Her creatinine peaked at 2.3, five days after contrast load.
She was 1.7L negative without lasix for 24 hours as of 8am [**2157-8-12**].
# Anasarca/Edema # Severe malnutrition Pt was treated with IV lasix during this admission to treat severe diffuse edema and whole body fluid overload.
Her lasix was converted from IV to po, and may need further titration as an outpatient.
Treatment should also focus on nutrition to improve hypoalbuminemia.
# C. diff colitis: C. diff toxin positive in [**6-22**] and has long history of C. diff colitis since Whipple procedure in [**2156**].
She was supposed to complete a 2-week course of Metronidazole 500 mg po q8hr on during admission.
This was extended given her treatment for suspected UTI as above.
# Type 2 Diabetes: Pt was treated with Lantus and sliding scale insulin during this admission.
# Left femur fracture on previous admission:  She was seen by orthopaedics who removed sutures/staples.
They recommended touch-down weight bearing for at least 6wks post-op.
