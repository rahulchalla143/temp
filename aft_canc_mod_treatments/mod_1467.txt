Gastroscope could not be advanced beyond this area due to loop foprmation in the stoamch.
Procedure was repeated with a pediatric colonsocope.
Due to tortuosity of the stomach, pylorus could not be intubated despite multiple attempts, repositioning.
The patient was admitted to the MICU and was given FFP, and Vitamin K because he was on coumadin as an outpatient.
He was also given 3 units of PRBCs and an IV proton pump inhibitor.
Repeat endoscopy was deferred because the patient's hematocrit was stable, and the diagnostic yield from a repeat procedure was thought to be low.
