She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, blood in stool, orthopnea, PND, focal weakness or numbness.
Her BNP was elevated there and with complaints of dyspnea she was thought to have CHF exacerbation and given furosemide 40 mg IV.
Her heart rate was rapid at 120s afib there and she was started on dilt drip.
Oxygen saturation was in low 80s in room air, low 90s on 6L NC and 99 on 100% NRB.
CXR was concerning for multifocal pneumonia and was given cetriaxone 1 gm and levofloxacin 750 mg on top of the Zosyn from OSH.
Given the new findings, she was given 1L of NS and 2 gram of calcium gluconate (to reverse dilt).

[**2178-11-16**] Video swallow study:  Multiple oral and pharyngeal phase defects with associated penetration and aspiration, partially reduced with chin tuck position.
She was bolused with normal saline and started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for empiric broad spectrum coverage, given that she had already received doses of Zosyn at OSH and ceftriaxone in the ED.
Her antibiotic regimen was narrowed to levofloxacin for empiric treatment of CAP.
At time of discharge, she will take two more days of levofloxacin to complete a 7-day course.
The other possibility, given CXR findings of multifocal infiltrate, is that she has had an atypical pneumonia, either bacterial or viral, in which case a 7-day course of levofloxacin should provide sufficient antimicrobial coverage.
She had wheezes on exam and we treated with standing and prn albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
We believe this was a dilutional effect in the setting of aggressive fluid rescusitation as all cell lines were decreasing.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION She was monitored on telemetry and continued on outpatient digoxin.
We continued her outpatient coumadin at 1 mg daily.
Her INR rose to 3.8 after she was started on levofloxacin.
We held her coumadin for two nights.
She will have blood draws two days after discharge and five days after discharge to recheck coumadin levels.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE This resolved with intravenous fluids.
DYSPHAGIA Because she came in after a likely aspiration event, she was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathologists.
After video swallow study showed significant aspiration risk, they recommended a po diet of soft solids and honey thick liquids with meds crushed in puree.
The S&S specialists also recommended for home speech and swallow evaluation, which we have arranged.
She was kept on a heart-healthy diet with prethickened liquids and soft solids.
She was anticoagulated on warfarin throughout.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES Atrial fibrillation on coumadin Hypothyroidism History of cerebrovascular accident   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized for treatment of pneumonia.
We treated you with an antibiotic called levofloxacin, which you should continue to take for a full 7-day course.
Please continue to take levofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg once every other day.
We found that the levels of coumadin in your blood were slightly elevated during the last few days.
We will have visiting nurses come to your house to measure the INR and will have the results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] so that he can make adjustments to your coumadin dose.
We stopped the Lasix (furosemide) because we thought that you were dehydrated, and Lasix could cause this to worsen.
