Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.04-0.05.
While at OSH, she was put on IV heparin and nitroglycerin with resolution of her chest discomfort.
She also had transient dyspnea which was relieved with albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and BiPAP.
Following the catheterization at OSH, she reportedly had some change in her mental status.
Because of these events, she did not undergo scheduled hemodialysis yesterday, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurgery eval.
Neurosurgery saw her and recommended serial examination, loading with phenytoin 1000 mg IV, and a followup CT in the morning.
She received IV morphine for complaints of a headache and became transiently hypotensive (SBPs in the 80s) with some worsening delirium; another head CT was unchanged compared to the one on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
She received one bag of a platelet transfusion due to her recent antiplatelet therapy.
Patient underwent hemodialysis today.

Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old woman was transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] after being found to have a left frontal subdural hematoma following diagnostic cardiac catheterization at OSH.
Patient was seen by neurosurgery, who recommended no surgical intervention given stable appearance of SDH.
Neurosurgery also recommended to continue to hold aspirin for 10 days and plavix indefinitely.
However, on day 5 off aspirin and plavix, patient developed substernal chest pain, and after extensive discussion with neurosurgery, we restarted aspirin at 162mg daily, and continued to hold plavix.
The last head CT done on [**2165-1-23**] when patient was restarted on aspirin showed improvement compared to the one obtained on [**1-19**].
She was also started on phenyton 100mg Q8h for seizure prevention.
Patient presented to OSH on [**2165-1-16**] with chest pain, and her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], at [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, and she had a cardiac catheterization on [**1-18**] which showed stable coronary artery disease (90% stenosis at ostium of D1, 10-20% instent restenosis in LAD DES, and 40% stenosis in RCA).
Patient was then developed AMS while on a heparin gtt and found to have a subdural hematoma.
EKG showed some dynamic changes, and trop-T increased from baseline 0.06 to 0.14 which then plateaued.
After discussing with neurosurgery, we restarted aspirin 162mg daily, but continued to hold plavix.
We also changed metoprolol to toprol 100mg qpm, continued diltiazem 180mg qam, and changed simvastatin to atorvastatin 80mg daily.
She then developed 2 more episodes of chest pain, each time responsive to sublingual NTG and morphine.
She does use albuterol inhaler at home.
Her blood pressure medications were later restarted, which include valsartan 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], isosorbide mononitrate 90 mg [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem XR 180mg qam, metoprolol (changed to toprol 100mg qpm).
# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient's simvastatin 40mg daily was changed from atorvastatin 80mg daily.
