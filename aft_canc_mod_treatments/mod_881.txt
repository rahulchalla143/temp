History of Present Illness: 71 y.o Russian speaking female with extensive PMH including CAD, CHF, afib and chronic anemia.
On home O2 at 2L and has not required increased amounts.
Colonoscopy at that time revealed a benign polyp.
Coumadin was held for suspected GI bleed.
Colonoscopy was scheduled but held for persistent high INR which was reversed with vitamin K.  Pt was a difficult prep and required almost 4-5 days of prepping with Golytely and other laxative.
Since pt's Hct was stable 25 34-35, no further diagnostic procedure was done.
Pt was initially started on niseritide and lasix for diuresis for suspected CHF exacerbation before her initial Hct of 18 came back.
Pt received lasix between transfusions.
Lisinopril was held for increased creatinine.
Pt was refractory to standing IV Lasix and Diuril.
She got PICC line placed under IR and Natrecor gtt was started with still net positive daily.
Lasix gtt was added and was titrated up to 10-15mg/hr which gave some reponse initially but again became refractory to it.
Dopamine gtt was tried but showed no improvement in UOP.
However one day, she started to respond extremely well with lasix gtt at 10mg/hr and IV Diuril 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] only (without Natrecor).
However, she was able to diuresis 1-2L/day and her weight came down to 130kg which is her baseline.
The diuretics were changed to po form (Lasix po 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Diuril po 125 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and pt continued to diuresis with net negative daily.
Review of the aortic valve orifice and consideration of valve replacement should be discussed as outpatient.
Pt was continued on amiodarone 200 mg po qd.
Coumadin was held in a setting of GI bleed and also for high INR prior to colonoscopy.
Coumadin was restarted with goal INR of [**1-2**].
4) COPD/restrictive lung dz: Pt was continued on 2 L of oxygen which is her baseline.
5) DM: Pt was initially continued on home meds of avandia and glyburide and was cover with RISS.
However, avandia was held while she was NPO.
9) CODE: DNR/ DNI- this was re-discussed with patient and husband to determine if pt still wants to be DNI/DNR as she has been DNR/DNI on prior admissions.
