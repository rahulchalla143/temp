PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia repair.
MEDICATIONS AS AN OUTPATIENT:  Protonix 40 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, Procardia XL 120 mg once daily, Levoxyl .125 mcg once daily, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Lopressor 50 mg once daily, Zoloft 50 mg once daily, iron 325 mg once daily, vitamin E 400 IU once daily, vitamin B12, Aricept 5 mg once daily, and Exelon 6 mg by mouth twice a day.
The decision was made to have him move in with his wife to the retirement community after his sons found him changing an electrical circuit with the electricity on, as well as other unsafe situations.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, as well as right middle lobe lobectomy with pericardial patch that was completed on [**2144-10-21**].
He was requiring chest physical therapy.
Additionally at this time, the patient was requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, as postoperatively he did have some relative hypotension and anuria.
After being supported with pressors and being volume resuscitated, his urine output seemed to turn around.
He was placed in the Intensive Care Unit for aggressive chest physiotherapy.
He had also been intubated postoperatively at this point due to some respiratory failure and what was presumed to be adult respiratory distress syndrome vs aspiration event.
He was on broad-spectrum antibiotics as dictated by the Infectious Disease fellow, being treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin and clindamycin, although he did not suffer from a leukocytosis, as his white count at this point was 9000.
Ultimately he was taken off of pressure control ventilation which had been utilized initially to manage his hypoxemia and also his adult respiratory distress syndrome.
He still required significant ventilatory support and, from a hemodynamic standpoint, he had had some intermittent atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone bolusing and drips, as well as having blood pressure requirements with Levophed support, ultimately to allow for some renal perfusion.
During his postoperative course for his postoperative renal failure, he was seen by the Renal service, which recommended keeping his blood pressure greater than 120 and to continue the lasix drip as we had been doing, to continue to ensure that the patient did not have any issue of pulmonary edema.
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place, which was not showing any significant hemodynamics concerning for any type of failure.
His ventilatory support was intermittently changed from assist control to CPAP and pressure support.
Ultimately his ventilator support and pressor support were withdrawn.
The patient was made comfort measures only at 1 A.M. on [**2144-11-3**], at the request of the patient's family, the sons were at the bedside, including Dr. [**Known lastname **], when they made this decision.
The patient was placed on a morphine drip after being bolused with morphine as well as a propofol drip, and placed on T-piece and room air oxygenation.
His sedatives and narcotics were removed and, after approximately a 35 minute hiatus without any sedation, his examination revealed that he had fixed and dilated pupils.
The Medical Examiner does not need to review this case, as this patient was in hospital for approximately two weeks and he was made comfort measures only.
Other diagnoses include poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe status post right middle lobe lobectomy complicated by respiratory failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, as well as acute renal failure, depressed cortical function with intact brain stem function prior to removal of support.
