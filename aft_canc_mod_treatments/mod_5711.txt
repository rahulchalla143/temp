He has currently been on pulses of Decadron 4 mg alternating with 12 mg pulse therapy x four days and re-started [**Year (4 digits) 95263**] - 10mg po every other day.
On Tuesday given concerns about a possible infection due to declining blood pressures, penile irritation and leukopenia his decadron was decreased from 4 mg to 2 mg po qd 2 days prior to presentation.
Per his wife given the results of the liver bx and the hepatic venous pressure gradient study Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] thinks that he is a candidate for a TIPS procedure.

Bilateral perinephric and left periureteral soft tissue lesions are not well assessed on the present study and were fully described on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2137-11-15**].
[**2138-1-3**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina and is appropriate in position, orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is off radiograph view and left internal jugular line ends at lower SVC.
The left kidney measures 11.2 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M with h/o MM/plasma cell leukemia which was progressive despite therapy c/b portal HTN of unknown etiology admitted originally with diarrhea and acute renal failure with prolonged hospital course complicated by significant RP plasmacytomas, TIPS procedure which subsequently stenosed, obstructing left ureteral stone s/p nephrostomy, respiratory failure requiring intubation/ventilation, enterobacter/enterococcus septic shock requiring levophed/vasopressin and renal failure requiring CVVH.
He was continued on aggressive measures up until the end, including pressors, CVVH, and mechanical ventillation, but he finally succumbed to his illness on [**2138-1-12**] at 11:27pm.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Septic shock with multi-organ failure: He was intubated on [**1-2**] in setting of likely aspiration event and respiratory decompensation and started on pressors for refractory hypotension.
He was also on stress dose of steroids at this time.
He was treated broadly with meropenem, daptomycin, and micafungin, then changed to linezolid, tobramycin, meropenem, and micafungin.
Required vasopressin and levophed to maintain pressures, eventually at max-doses with continued refractory hypotension resulting in worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, and liver failure.
The patient was being seen by hepatology and was s/p TIPS for reduction of portal pressures.
The patient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide initially for hepatorenal syndrome while in the ICU, with doses being titrated up because of no improvement in his renal funciton.
He was also started on albumin, which was uptitrated to 100 grams daily.
Because of the evidence of L hydronephrosis, the patient also underwent IR procedure and perc nephrostomy tube was placed, which initialy drained bloody fluid.
Midodrine and octreotide were stopped at that time.
He was initially maintained on midodrine/octreotide, however as his sepsis picture worsened, these medications were stopped.
# MM AND PLASMA CELL LYMPHOMA: Pt with refractory disease despite bone marrow transplant and numerous aggressive therapies.
Had been treated with dexamethasone and [**Month/Year (2) **] on admission, however dexamethasone was held when he was placed on stress dose steroids.
