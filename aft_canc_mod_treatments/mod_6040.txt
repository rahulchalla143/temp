Social History: Uses a walker at baseline to get around outside of her apt, she says she "gets by" without it at home.
She lives in an apt in senior housing in Revers, she has a VNA that comes 1x per week and another person who comes "to draw my labs to check my coumadin level", which her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
If there is continuedconcern for a hip fracture, dedicated radiographs of the hip are recommended for further evaluation.
She was initially treated ceftriaxone, with was broadened to cefepime and vancomycin on [**4-11**] in the setting of hypotension and concern for sepsis.
Antibiotics were briefly narrowed to just ceftriaxone on [**4-13**] when the sensitivities of the E. coli became available, but were broadened to cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin the same day, as the patient's clinical condition worsened and it became clear that she also had pneumomia.
Antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
She was treated with a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and her antibiotics were empirically broadened to vancomycin/cefepime.
As explained above, antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to just ceftriaxone, but then broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin in the setting of pneumonia.
On [**4-13**] and [**4-14**], the patient developed worsening heart failure, treated with Lasix and morphine.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient developed increasing respiratory distress, which was initially attributed to heart failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation for hypotension.
She was treated with IV Lasix, with partial improvement in her respiratory status.
Antibiotics were broadened as above.
The patient developed worsening hypoxia, requiring high-flow masks and eventually non-invasive positive pressure ventillation.
The patient went on and off of non-invasive positive pressure ventillation, but by [**4-14**], she found this too uncomfortable, and it was stopped according to her request.
She received some additional doses of Lasix without significant improvement in her respiratory status.
With her family at her bedside, the patient transitioned to comfort care.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient was initially treated with IV fluids for sepsis.
She was diuresed with IV Lasix as she endorsed being 10 pounds over her dry weight.
She was also given IV morphine and intermittently required BiPAP.
On [**4-17**], she decided to focus her care on comfort, with no further treatment for her worsening respiratory failure.
She was treated with amiodarone 150 mg IV and then subsequently dig loaded.
She was loaded with digoxin and started on oral doses w/ improvement in her HR90-100s.
The patient was supratherapeutic on her coumadin, which was held during the initial part of her hospitalization and gradually restarted.
Her acute kidney injury was likely pre-renal and improved with IV fluids.
Her pain was treated with Tylenol.
Ortho aware and opted for non-operative managment.
Metoprolol was initially held for hypotension.
Aspirin was continued.
# COPD: Continued albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN .
Continued synthroid 100mcg QD.
The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, diuresis, non-invasive positive pressure ventillation, and other non-invasive measures.
She wanted to see her daughter first, and once her daughter arrived on [**2118-4-17**], she changed her code status to comfort measures only.
