Prominent, linear, highly mobile structure in right atrium which may represent Chiari network/normal variant, but given size and mobility, a right atrial thrombus cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname 85394**] is a 69 y/o male with a history of CAD and metastatic RCC who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of respiratory distress and hemoptysis secondary to a tumor obstructing the trachea.
Respiratory distress improved signficantly after removal of the tumor by rigid bronchoscopy and patient was weaned to room air with O2 saturation >95%.
Albuterol and ipratroprium nebulization was provided as needed for additional control.
Head CT was obtained and showed no evidence of metastasis, and patient was placed on heparin drip.
Patient was then transitioned to lovenox 60mg SQ [**Hospital1 **] to complete 6 month course, or as tolerated by patient.
Of note, he did have occasional hemoptysis following initiation of lovenox, with a few tables of blood streaked sputum.
Patient was suspected to tolerate catheterization poorly due to comorbidities, and further intervention was deferred.
Foley catheter was placed in the ICU and removed on the floor.
Patient developed burning on urination and UA showed evidence of infection.
Patient was started on ciprofloxacin 250mg [**Hospital1 **] for 10 day course.
# Metastatic RCC: Patient will need to follow up with Oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for any additional treatment options.
# DM2 - Blood glucose was well controlled with insulin sliding scale while in hospital .
