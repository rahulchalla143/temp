10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..  Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old male with diagnosis of prostate cancer, s/p prostatectomy, post-op course c/b by PEA arrest [**1-13**] presumed pulmonary embolus, profound hypotension, multi-system failure, post-operative hematoma, increasing abdominal distension requiring emergent laparatomy  Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the Urology service in the setting of s/p radical retropubic prostatectomy c/b POD#1 PEA arrest, thought to be [**1-13**] to PE, for which the patient was given tPA and started on a heparin drip.
Patient's course was complicated by hypotension (MAPs 50s), requiring frequent fluid boluses (26L over 2d course) as well as levophed and neosynephrine.
ICU stay also c/b ARF (thought to be [**1-13**] to ACS), w rising creatinine and worsening acidosis, requiring bicarbonate drip.
In conjunction with general surgery and urology, the patient was taken to the OR for urgent laparatomy on [**4-7**].
The following day, the patient was weaning down from his pressor requirement, the PEEP was decreased from 20 to 10, he went back to the OR for a washout and placement of an HD line.
On [**4-10**] his vent was weaned to pressure support, he was restarted on a heparin gtt and tube feeds were started.
On [**4-13**] the HD line was replaced as it was no longer working.
Given concern for HIT (decreased plts), Argatroban was started.
Once back on the urology floor, he continued to do well, argatroban was stopped once INR in therapeutic range, and pt maintained on Coumadin.
Pt's renal function continued to improve and finished hemodialysis on [**2196-4-22**].
He was maintained on telemetry in sinus tachycardia throughout his stay on the floor.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: NEUROLOGIC: Post-op, patient did well initially with pain controlled with IV morphine PCA.
Pt resuscitated and during resuscitation was noted to move all 4 extremities intermittently.
CPR was conducted and he was intubated  and given medications per ACLS protocol, which ultimately resulted in return of palpable pulses.
During his cardiac arrest, the surgery team attempted right femoral line placement, with inadvertent placement of triple lumen catheter into right femoral artery instead of the vein.
Chest compressions and ACLS medications resulted in return of pulses and a bedside cardiac Echo was performed which showed: ?????
Multifocal segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving all lobes with CT findings suggestive of right ventricular strain.
Trace amount of simple free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis with post-surgical changes from prior prostatectomy noted.
He was therefore administered systemic TPA for clot lysis, understanding the high risk for resultant bleeding.
His cardiopulmonary function was noted to be improved after administration of TPA, but his hematocrit was noted to drop to a level of 16, for which he was emergently transfused.
He required intermittent transfusions and fluid boluses to maintain a HCT in the low 20?????
He was maintained on 2 pressors and required massive boluses of IVF to keep pressures up after his arrest, resulting in total body volume overload (approximately 30 liters fluid positive).
The Acute Surgery Service was consulted, and felt that he likely had abdominal compartment syndrome for which he underwent emergent decompressive laparotomy.
After this procedure, he was able to be weaned off of pressors fairly quickly.
During the post-op/post-extubation period, he was noted to be tachycardic and hypertensive, for which oral metoprolol 25mg TID was initiated.
It was felt that unless his systolic blood pressures rose above 160, there was no need to increase the dose of his beta-blockers.
CT of the chest post-code and intubation is detailed above and showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.
?Large midline hematoma seen involving the rectus sheath and the adjacent anterior abdominal wall around the drain insertion site as described.
Attempts at fluid resuscitation failed to improve his blood pressure, and his abdomen was noted to become more distended and tight with bladder pressures increasing to the mid 60??????s.
Surgery team recommended emergent decompressive laparotomy, which was carried out with abdomen left packed and open.
While abdomen was open, pt given enteral tube feeds through orogastric tube.
Once abdomen closed, NGT placed and tube feeds continued until patient passed speech and swallow eval.
After speech and swallow eval, pt tolerated oral intake and able to maintain adequate nutrition.
NUTRITION: Patient NPO until he was stabilizing in the T/SICU, at which time he was given enteral tube feeds in the form of Nutren 2.0 at goal of 40cc/hr.
After extubation, he underwent a speech and swallow study, which cleared him for thin liquids and thus a Regular diet was initiated with supplemental nutrition in the form of Ensure three times daily.
He was followed by the renal team and was started on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy after transfer to the T/SICU.
After enough fluid was removed to allow closure of abdomen, he was transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis three times a week.
GENITOURINARY: Pt underwent uneventful open radical retropubic prostatectomy.
After thrombolysis was carried out, he had a retroperitoneal bleed likely from the surgical bed.
This unfortunately  caused a urethral disruption of his anastomosis, as seen on portable cystogram.
A 19 Fr [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was left in the pelvis to collect and urine leakage.
The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was kept on bulb suction for many days, but as UOP increased and drain output decreased, the bulb was taken off suction.
A portable cystogram performed on the day of discharge did show a presumed urine leak after instillation of around 60 cc of cystograffin.
The foley will be left in place, secured at all times on no tension with 2 catheter secure devices with plan to leave foley in place until follow up with urology ??????
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE OR MANIPULATE FOLEY CATHETER WITHOUT FIRST DISCUSSING WITH PATIENT?????
Pt was started on brief 3 day course of Fluconazole and Cipro for presumed UTI.
After his cardiac arrest, he was given a heparin bolus.
He then was maintained on Heparin Gtt after TPA activity was felt to be completed.
His platelets were noted to drop after heparin started, for which HIT antibody assay was sent, which ultimately returned positive ([**2196-4-14**]).
He was then transitioned to Argatroban for anticoagulation.
He was started on Coumadin once he was able to tolerate an oral diet.
Argatroban was discontinued once INR was between [**3-15**], at which point his INR returned in the mid-3?????
He was then given between 1-5 mg of Coumadin daily for anticoagulation with a goal INR of [**1-14**].
He required many transfusions of blood products during his hospital stay.
ENDOCRINE: He was maintained on a RISS for goal BS < 150 (scale increased [**4-16**], all FS < 150 after).
He was given perioperative infection prophylaxis for his procedures.
During his ICU stay, his foley was noted to have yeast growing in the tubing, for which a urine Cx was sent, which was positive for yeast.
He was given Fluconazole for this.
?s while his abdomen was opened, but this slowly resolved after abdominal closure.
On the day of discharge, he was noted to have malodorous urine during cystogram, so urine sent for culture and pt started on renally-dosed ciprofloxacin for 3 days and fluconazole for 3 days.
