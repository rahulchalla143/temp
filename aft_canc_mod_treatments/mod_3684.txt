ED: # VS: T unmeasured, BP 140/80, HR 102, RR 24, SaO2 96/RA # Intervention: Intubated given epistaxis # Notable studies --CT head:  R frontal subdural, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Pt also developed hypernatremia, and was transferred to medicine for management of hypernatremia and delirium.
[**2137-8-28**] Head CT FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there has been evolution of both the right frontal epidural hemorrhage, which is less evident than on the prior study, adjacent to the nondisplaced right frontal and temporal bone fracture.
Continued attention in followup is recommended to exclude developing hydrocephalus   Brief Hospital Course: 72M h/o HTN, Alzheimer's dementia, admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after falling and sustaining R frontal and temporal SAH and SDH, bilateral infratemporal contusions, and extensive facial fractures which did not require intervention.
# Delirium: Pt's hyperactive delirium likely multifactorial, with contributing factors including pain, hospitalization, SAH/SDH, intracranial contusions, and Foley catheter.
The patient was initially treated with Haldol and required a 1:1 sitter for several evenings.
His Haldol was eventually discontinued and replaced with quetiepine, which the patient has tolerated well.
In addition, he has not required a 1:1 sitter in two days.
# Sleep/wake cycle: Patient's trazodone dose was decreased from 100mg QHS to 50-100mg QHS, for fear that the increased dose could be exacerbating delirium.
# Pain control: patient has been receiving acetomenophen 1000mg PR TID for pain control.
# Bowel regimen: Patient was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to minimize factors which could exacerbate delirium.
Senna 2tab PO HS, lactulose 30 ml PO TID, bisacodyl 10 mg PO/PR daily, and docusate 200 mg PO BID, all titrated to 1BM daily.
Pt was started on phenytoin 100 mg PO TID as inpatient ppx against seizures, given his subdural and subarachnoid hemmorrhages.
He was begun on 500mg PO BID for two days, and continued on 1000mg PO BID for two days, and then 1500mg PO BID continuous.
# Alzheimer's dementia: Pt continued on home regimen of Exelon *NF* 6 mg PO BID.
# Hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance: Pt's fasting blood glucose had been high during this admission, ranging between 130-190, and pt was therefore covered with humalog insulin sliding scale.
The patient should be evaluated by his PCP for further management of impaired glucose tolerance.
# Urinary retention: Pt had been having difficulty voiding during this admission, and therefore was started on terasozin 3 mg QHS.
The subsequently developed hypotension and so his terazosin was discontinued.
He will be discharged with a foley in place.
This foley should be replaced with a foley catheter with leg bag attachment upon arrival to his extended care facility.
# Prostate CA: Pt continued on home regimen of megestrol 20 mg PO BID.
# B glaucoma: Pt administered timolol 0.5% 1 drop OU [**Hospital1 **].
# HTN: patient's dose of quinapril was decreased to 5mg PO QD.
# Hyperlipidemia: Pt continued on Tricor 145 mg PO daily and simvastatin 80mg PO daily.
