TECHNIQUE: Extracranial evaluation of bilateral carotids was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler modes in ultrasound.
FINDINGS: On the right, peak systolic velocities are 65, 100, and 75 cm/sec in the internal, common, and external carotid arteries, respectively.
On the left, peak systolic velocities are 75, 94, and 75 cm/sec in the internal, common, and external carotid arteries, respectively.

On POD 1, he was extubated and was oxygenating well on nasal cannula; he developed atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with increased beta-blockade.
On POD 4, he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, his foley catheter and nasogastric tube were removed; he remained afebrile with good pain control with Morphine Sulfate.
On POD 7, he had bilateral carotid ultrasounds performed for a past history of a right carotid bruit which were negative for stenoses.
