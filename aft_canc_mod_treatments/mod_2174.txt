Hyponatremia refractory to fluid restriction and tolvaptan, now being transferred to MICU for hypertonic saline administration.
# Hyponatremia: Etiology is consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia with nonosmotic adh release given massive weight loss over past several weeks, as well as worsening Na in setting of free water restriction.
Patient was treated with 3% normal saline while in MICU with good response.
Patient was started on NS @ 75/hr at time of transfer.
She should continue fluid restriction at home, but hold diuretics because she was slightly orthostatic morning of discharge.
Her granddaughter believes she stopped taking her Lactulose, patient is unsure.
Cortisol was checked in setting of hyponatremia as well (normal).
Held lisinopril in setting of  hyperkalemia.
Lisinopril restarted on discharge, will require follow up electrolyte labs.
Transition Issues: # Electrolytes: Patient will require electrolytes to be checked in setting of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.
