Admission Date:  [**2138-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-6-12**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11291**] Chief Complaint: AMS and slurred speech   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 94RHM PMH of resected colon cancer in [**2125**] s/p chemo with multiple SBO's, HTN, dementia, partial epilepsy, chronic L common femoral vein thrombosis and IVC thrombosis s/p IVC filter placement, depression and leukocytosis JAK2 positive presents with increasing confusion, fatigue, hallucinations and agitation now with intermittent unresponsiveness and mouth movements/right sided twitching and slurred speech.
While in the ED, patient was given IV metronidazole (given bowel pathology concerns) and IV levofloxacin 750mg (had been on in community) and initially patient was apparently singing in Creole and not responding to questioning and since then nursing staff and family have noted fluctuating level of consciousness with him speaking albeit confused with eyes open intermixed with episodes of unresponsiveness, eyes rolling and associated with blowing out cheeks motions of mouth (?
Per records last seizure was in [**2138-2-12**] when he had twitching on right side of his face and arm and prior semiologies have included EPC admission in [**2136**] with abnormal tongue movements.
Of note patient has been treated with levofloxacin 500mg qd as above since [**6-6**] which can lower seizure threshold.
Patient was recently admitted under surgery and discharged [**2138-5-23**] after abdominal pain with chronic constipation issues and stenosis of distal sigmoid colon and improved with laxatives with a CT on admission did not show any acute process.
Past Medical History: - HTN - Dementia - Depression - Partial epilepsy followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 623**] previous right face and arm twitching on keppra - History of epilepsia partialis continua consisting of rhythmic mouth movements diagnosed in [**2136-5-12**] and has since been maintained on Keppra monotherapy.
- Right hemicolectomy in [**2123**] for colon cancer-s/p chemo with multiple SBO's ([**3-19**], [**4-19**], [**5-19**], [**7-19**]), then LOA [**9-19**], complicated by peritonitis s/p Abx - Chronic L common femoral vein thrombosis and IVC thrombosis s/p  IVC filter placement - Osteoporosis - Cholecystectomy - B/l small inguinal hernias   Social History: He is [**Location 7972**] speaking.
Baseline is limited + mobility but can normally talk fluently, can read and comprehend well and feeds himself.

Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
A surgical clip is also noted in the left abdomen.
A radiodense irregularity projecting over the left ilium corresponds to a calcification in the gluteal muscle on prior CT.    Brief Hospital Course: Initial Assessment: 94RHM PMH of resected colon cancer in [**2125**] s/p chemo with multiple SBO's, HTN, dementia, partial epilepsy, chronic L common femoral vein thrombosis and IVC thrombosis s/p IVC filter placement, depression and leukocytosis JAK2 positive presents with increasing confusion, fatigue, hallucinations and agitation now with intermittent unresponsiveness and mouth movements/right sided twitching and slurred speech.
Latterly somnolent again following Keppra load and lorazepam but grimacing all 4 limbs and some purposeful movement to noxious bilaterally in setting of returned tachycardia up to 140s requiring IV diltiazem which then settled to 80s and hemodynamically stable.
History is suggestive of progressive delirium over 1 week with confusion and hallucinations but today's fluctuating mental status with associated tachycardia and lateralised twitching likely represents complex partial seizures which may have been triggered by intercurrent infection (note borderline UA and treatment for infection with levofloxacin), concurrent levofloxacin started [**6-6**] lowering seizure threshold and possibly getting inadequate AED dosing although depending on which nurse was talked to the patient may have been getting half or regular dose of his levetiracetam at his nursing home.
Mental status deteriorated again post Keppra load with patient less responsive and although did have some purposeful movement bilaterally, concern is for possible non-convulsive seizures given concurrent tachycardia although excess sedation from having a Keppra load and lorazepam is also possible but wouuld not explain tachycardia.
After further discussion with chief resident and epilepsy attending we will admit to neuro ICU for LTM and medication titration given persistent poor mental status.
Will also have to look for possible infectious sources and IV levofloxacin and metronidazole given in ED will not be continued.
He was loaded with IV Keppra in the ED and continued on 1000mg IV BID until able to tolerate PO on [**6-12**].
His altered mental status was likely triggered by his infection as well as by his seizure threshold being lowered by use of quinolones and possibly the flagyl given in the ED as well.
CVS: Initially the patient was tachycardic up to 130s-140s but settled to HR 80s in sinus rhythm after IV diltiazem.
He was maintained on telemetry and no further management was needed.
effusion but he has remained clinically stable and was weaned of Nasal cannula.
ID: Prior to admission, the patient had received levoquin and in the ED received flagyl.
These were both discontinued in favor of ceftriaxone as both levaquin and flagyl lower the seizure threshold.
He should complete 7 days of antibiotics empirically to treat likely UTI.
General surgery was also consulted.
He was started on PO sips and advanced as tolerated to a full diet.
Continue bowel regiment.
Renal: Creatinine was noted to be increased to 1.5 upon admission.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12129**] did receive IVF hydration and his Renal function was monitored.
PPX: SubQ heparin and pneumoboots were used during hospital course.
Avoid quinolones or flagyl if possible as these lower seizure threshold.

A workup was done for source of infection and you were treated for a urinary tract infection for which you were started on antibiotics by IV.
There was also initially a concern for a small bowel obstruction so you were on IV fluids and not to eat.
As you improved, you were allowed to take fluids and advanced to a full diet without difficulty.
As you were tolerating medication and food by mouth you were deemed appropriate for discharge.
We made the following changes to your medications: Held your Risperdal Stopped Levaquin Treated the UTI with Ceftriaxone and changed to Cefpodoxime when you were tolerating PO medications If you experience any of the below listed danger signs, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department.
