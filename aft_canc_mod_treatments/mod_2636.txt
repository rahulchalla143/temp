Pulmonary Patient did well postoperatively and was transferred to the floor extubated and with three right sided chest tubes to -20cm of suction.
He experienced a slow progression, however, eventually 2 of 3 chest tubes were removed with no change in his CXR.
On POD #13, pleural fluid noted to be purulent from his chest tube site.
Patient was treated with vancomycin during his hospital stay as well as 6 days of intrapleural vancomycin instilled into his chest tube.

The option of surgical drainage of his empyema was also discussed.
After prolonged discussion, patient and his wife expressed their frustration and reluctance to stay in the hospital, understanding that continued observation and treatment and/or surgical intervention were likely the best options for his empyema.
