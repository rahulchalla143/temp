He was afebrile at that point but started on Keflex for a question of cellulitis.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; multiple skin lesions, complications of PUVA treatment, status post resection of many of the lesions.
A left arm cutaneous lesion was removed by wide local excision in [**2148-12-13**] and then he underwent radiation therapy to the area.
He then underwent four cycles of carboplatin and doxorubicin.
His carboplatin was stopped for an increased creatinine.
He is currently still on the doxorubicin but has been dose adjusted for his renal failure.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Keflex since [**2149-12-9**], Univasc, Amaryl, hydrochlorothiazide, morphine, Coumadin 1 mg p.o.
His left axilla was warm with a purplish hue to skin and chronic skin changes with surrounding erythema.
His urinalysis was positive for protein and occasional bacteria, but otherwise negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Father [**Name (NI) **] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and started on broad spectrum antibiotics as well as hydrated with normal saline.
His hydrochlorothiazide, Univasc, and Amaryl were held as he was normoglycemic and normotensive.
He was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime and received five days of those antibiotics before being changed to levofloxacin and clindamycin p.o.
antibiotics for a total course of 19 days of antibiotics.
The surgeon who performed his partial left axillary lymph node resection was consulted and came to see him and evaluate him.
She noted that he was not a surgical candidate for further resection but thought that radiologic drainage of his axillary mass could be helpful.
This was then drained under ultrasound-guidance of serosanguineous fluid that was culture negative but cytology positive for malignant cells.
His doxorubicin was continued every week as prior to admission.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
Clindamycin 300 mg p.o.
Coumadin 1 mg p.o.
MS Contin 15 mg p.o.
