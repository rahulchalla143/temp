HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2128-7-15**] for a liver-related liver transplant from his cousin.
The operation went without any complications, and the patient was brought to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated for monitoring of cardiovascular and pulmonary status overnight.
The patient was transfused several units for a low hematocrit.
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition for nutritional support.
The patient was eventually weaned off the ventilator and extubated.
Eventually, the patient's nitroglycerin drip was turned off.
On postoperative day two, the patient developed some chest pressure which seemed to be associated with being given intravenous CellCept.
The patient was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.
A nasogastric tube was placed which relieved his distention.
The patient then underwent an upper gastrointestinal swallow which indicated a mechanical partial small-bowel obstruction with dilation of both limbs of Roux-en-Y proximal to jejunostomy with decompressed small bowel afterwards; likely due to an adhesion.
The patient was continued on the nasogastric tube until distention was relieved and nasogastric tube output was minimal, and we awaited bowel function and ileus to resolved.
The patient underwent a tracheostomy tube cholangiogram through both biliary drains on postoperative day eighteen.
Both biliary drains were subsequently capped.
