His complement levels were normal, but SPEP and UPEP were positive and remaining clinical picture was suggestive of multiple myeloma.
His creatinine improved to 2.8 on discharge, and he required IV fluid hydration while hospitalized, though his creatinine continued to trend down  even while drinking PO fluids alone.
Lisinopril, gabapentin, and citalopram were all held on discharge, given the fact that his renal function had not completely normalized.
Lisinopril should likely not be restarted given his higher risk of volume depletion and cast nephropathy.
It is unclear if he has ever had treatment for his positive PPD in the past.
Telemetry strip showed possible junctional escape rhythm, and cardiology was consulted for possible pacer placement.
While inhouse, he was maintained on zyprexa 5mg, which was very effective for him.

Hydralazine could be started in the short term as an outpatient.
AV nodal blocking agents and ACE inhibitors should be avoided.
Ensure that heme-onc is aware of positive PPD before initiating chemotherapy 3.
Blood pressure check, consider starting hydralazine if not well controlled (avoid AV nodal blocking agents and ACE-i) 4.
Assess the need to restart citalopram, gabapentin as an outpatient after renal function has normalized.
