Status post right colectomy and excision of liver metastases.
Patient has had repeat colonoscopy and barium enema, which demonstrated apple core lesion in the distal transverse colon.
Metastatic workup including a CT scan demonstrated [**12-28**] lesions in the liver, and the patient is considered for concomitant liver surgery at the same time as her colectomy.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the Hepatobiliary and Transplant services was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding this, and the patient was scheduled for combined segmental colectomy and partial hepatectomy.
Right mastectomy with TRAM flap reconstruction approximately 15 years prior.
Quinine 325 mg q.h.s.
Dalmane 15 mg q.h.s.
Synthroid 100 mg q.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2199-2-27**] for planned elective right colectomy and concomitant liver resection.
Postoperatively, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, which was controlled with a small amount of IV Lopressor.
This was seen to be her baseline and Lopressor 2.5 mg IV was given to attempt to control the rate of the atrial fibrillation which was up into the 160s.
After the 2.5 mg of IV Lopressor, the patient's blood pressure dropped into the 70s.
Patient was mentating well and Cardiology was consulted.
The patient was transferred to the ICU for he potentially hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation with a goal of amiodarone drip as well as possible cardioversion.
Patient was started on amiodarone drip and converted to normal sinus shortly.
Cardioversion was averted and thought not to be not necessary secondary to the relative hemodynamic stability compared to the patient's baseline.
Anticoagulation was contraindicated by the Liver Surgery service.
Patient was begun on low dose beta blocker and diet was advanced as tolerated.
The J-P drains were removed appropriately when drainage was low.
The patient had a Holter monitor for 24 hours prior to discharge for analysis by the Electrophysiology service.
pain medications with all drains and lines removed, in normal sinus rhythm and being tracked by the Electrophysiology service.
Quinine 325 mg q.h.s.
Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
Percocet 5/325 mg 1-2 tablets q.4h.
Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d.
Synthroid 75 mg p.o.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Patient is also carefully instructed to followup with Electrophysiology cardiologist within the next 2-3 weeks regarding her cardiac status and potential atrial fibrillation.
