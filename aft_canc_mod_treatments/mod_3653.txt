was initially admitted with a WBC 11.9, however his WBC continued to drop, as low as 0.6, becoming neutropenic, probably secondary to dose of CarboTaxol received at the [**Location 1268**] VA.
- Tracheostomy tube in appropriate position.
- Partial visualization of both subclavian veins with findings suspicious   for invasion and extension of tumor through the right internal jugular   vein to the junction of right subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo M with large supraglottic SCC here for XRT, s/p trach for resp.
Also with pseudomonal PNA, R pleural effusion, and C-diff infection.
He is also s/p 15 doses XRT since arrival in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], for a total of 16 treatments per Rad-onc.
He had an almost immediate reaction consisting of facial swelling and erythema after the 1st dose, which is now resolved.
Pt is receiving supportive care with pain control with Dilaudid & Fentanyl prn though has not required pain control recently.
There is a plan for family meeting with heme-onc, rad-onc, and medicine team today or tomorrow.
# Respiratory: Pt is currently satting well on trach collar with FiO2 of 35%.
Also treated for stenotrophomonas in his sputum (10-day course of bactrim).
He was previously on intermittent ventilation for temporary desats thought to be related to worsening of pleural effusion off ventilation.
Antibiotics were completed on [**6-28**] however sputum from [**6-28**] contained >25 PMNs and grew 4+ pseudomonas, now resistant to meropenem.
heparin gtt, bridging to coumadin - continue coumadin 5mg qhs .
Random cortisol level relatively high, and now off dex since [**6-15**] --> suggests adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
Most likely diagnosis is therefore iatrogenic due to IV meds and diuresis without adequate Na replacement.
Pt is scheduled for follow up next week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] to revisit if continued XRT should be pursued.
At the same time, he expresses wishes to continue radiation/chemo for disease palliation.
Psych has been consulted to determine competency and address depression.
# HTN: BP well-controlled on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].
At home, he is on metoprolol 25 TID.
He has not required PRBC transfusions at [**Hospital1 18**].
# C-Diff colitis:  Pt is on Flagyl po until 2 weeks after completion of other antibiotics ([**6-26**]).
He is on C-Diff precautions.
He is on low-dose Haldol prn agitation, avoiding BZDs as possible.
He is also on supplemental thiamine, Folate & MVI for ETOH history.
Needed to be maintained on restraints while in ICU, has been 1:1 on the floors w/o further aggitation.
