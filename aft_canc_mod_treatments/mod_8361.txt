Brain metastases.
The seizure was controlled with seizure medication which you will need to continue at home.
This was drained by placement of a pericardial window by a surgical procedure called VATS.
A chest drain was left in place for one day.
You will also need a PET scan prior to chemotherapy and possibly an IV port to administer chemotherapy.
Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4x a day, to decrease the swelling around the brain masses.
