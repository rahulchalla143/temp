They report the patient had hoped that after her transplant her life would be less complicated and she could have more of a full social life.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notes that the patient has had EPS effects from typical antipsychotic medications and has not appeared to be getting more stability in her life on her current dose of Abilify (45mg qHS).
Her plan was to try Seroquel and if that failed to consider Clozaril as the patient has been plagued by paranoid delusion without much improvement in terms of clinical stability for many years despite multiple drug trials.
From a psychiatric standpoint, the patient was continued at her outpatient dose of Effexor XL 150mg qd for depression.
To treat her psychosis, the patient was started on Seroquel 100mg daily, and this dose was gradually tapered up to a therapeutic dosing range of 300mg qam and 400mg qPM by the time of discharge.
However at the time of discharge to the surgery service, she was still feeling fearful, paranoid and unsafe to go home.
From a medical standpoint: 1)Cardiovascular: the patient's Lisinopril and Metoprolol were discontinued as the patients blood pressures were low normal and Seroquel can have a hypotensive effect.
2)M/R/E: the patient was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the renal transplant service.
Additionally, the patient had a work up for renal colic that revealed a right 4mm renal stone in right UVJ, which was treated with IVFs and prn Percocet and resolved without complication.
The patient was continued to take 3-4L water after her IV infiltrated.
She was started on Sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism that resulted from her prior hemodialysis treatment.
A Sestamibi scan was ordered, but could not be done becaue after repeated attempts, no peripheral IV access was obtainable.
3) GI: The patient continued on protonix and had no episodes of GERD  The patient was discharged to the surgical service on [**2117-6-26**] for parathyroidectomy.
