He had a right nephrectomy that month.
He also had bilateral lung nodules, status post bilateral VATS in [**2131-12-27**].
He had continued disease progression and was treated on high-dose interferon and IL-2 in [**2133**].
He switched to Nexavar, which he took from [**2133**]-[**2135**], and then switched to Sutent in [**2137-1-23**], had Gemzar added to the regimen.

ON discharge - pt awake alert and oriented / conversational and attentive/ motor exam full except somewhat limited [**2-27**] on left side as well as left side ataxia which is improved s/p crani.
A nodule in the right apex (series 3, image 7) is stable in size, however, nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 1.0 x 0.8 cm is new as is a tiny nodule in the right lower lobe immediately adjacent to the pleura.
A lesion in segment VIII currently measures 0.4 x 0.4 cm (previously 1.6 x 1.6 cm).
Overall, extensive peritumoral edema does not appear to be significantly changed, but there is worsened right to left shift of the normally midline structures and subfalcine herniation since the [**2138-7-11**] study.
The above findings may represent changes of prior radiation therapy.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-8-19**] 8:53 AM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  Reason: evaluate postoperative tumor residual Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old man s/p craniotomy tumor resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate postoperative tumor residual CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Status post craniotomy and tumor resection.
A 3 mm focus of enhancement in the right frontal centrum semiovale is unchanged from prior studies, possibly representing a tiny metastasis (9:17).
A second 1-2 mm focus of enhancement is seen in the superior right parietal region (9:20, 10:22), which is better defined today than on prior studies.

Clinical: Specimen submitted: right parietal tumor; left-sided weakness, brain mass.
The specimen was partially frozen with a frozen section diagnosis by Drs.
The specimen is represented as follows: A=frozen section remnant, B-C=additional representative sections of tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 61 yo M with metastatic RCC s.p CK therapy on [**2138-7-17**] now with LUE/LLE weakness improving on high dose dexamethasone.
The patient was found to have worsening edema and increasing symptoms, therefore he was started on mannitol IV.
After 2 attempts at weaning, we decided he had failed a mannitol taper and a functional MRI was ordered to further assess if the patient is a candidate for surgical resection without too much compromise of his physical ability given that he is left handed.
He was treated with an insulin sliding scale to control his glucose levels.
Currently he is on a steroid taper that will take approximately 2 weeks.
#) Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer: The patient has had right nephrectomy in the past.
Currently, he in on Sutent therapy, but it was held during his hospital admission given the possibility of surgery.
He will continue Dilantin and Keppra at current dose.
