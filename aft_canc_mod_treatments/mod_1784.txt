HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to Four South/Oncology but due to hypotension which did not respond to fluid boluses and decreased mental status, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
There, the patient was transfused with packed red blood cells as well as platelets.
He was started on Vancomycin, Ceftazidine and Gentamicin and was started on Neupogen to increase his white blood cell count.
The patient's blood cell counts rapidly recovered and Neupogen was discontinued.
The patient's gentamicin was discontinued soon after reaching Four South and for a few days, the patient was treated empirically with Flagyl.
General Surgery was called to evaluate the patient's anal fissure and did not find reason to suspect that the anal fissure may be infected or that it was the source of the sepsis.
