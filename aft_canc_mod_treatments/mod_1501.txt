Right-sided PICC with tip in mid SVC.
Incidental note of the presence of a PICC line in the right subclavian vein.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
[**2156-7-12**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION: 1) Increasing opacity in left retrocardiac region, which may be due to aspiration, atelectasis or evolving infectious pneumonia.
Was started on CTX/Acyclovir IV in case of meningitis, then had an LP performed with no evid of infection, cultures negative, was put on acyclovir until HSV PCR came back negative.
Was also switched from nitroprusside gtt to labetolol gtt for blood pressure control, thiocyante level was sent out of concern for cyanide toxicity given his ESRD.
Prior to transfer to floor, was followed by Renal who feel that symptoms on admit were likely from hypertensive urgency, and Neuro who feel that symptoms were c/w sz d/o (partial complex status epilepticus), recommended dilantin loading, EEG that was consistent with encephalopathy but without sz activity.
Delta ms: -was likely multifactorial, including some element from HTN, dilantin side effect as free dilantin levels were markedly elevated with %bound dilantin around 55%, possible postictal state.
Dilantin dosing was being done initially based on bound levels, but then once free phenytoin came back it became apparent that he was seeing much higher free levels than predicted.
Dilantin was discontinued in favor of Trileptal.
This would suggest that the first episode of delerium was not due to a seizure.
Had urinary sx on admit as well, with elevated WBC count and bandemia concerning for UTI; patient was anuric except for straight cath specimen that was overwhelmed with blood from the straight cath itself most likely.
His symptoms resolved after antibiotics were given in MICU.
They recommended a 2 week course of Vancomycin and Levoquin for presumed occult bacteremia.
HTN: extremely difficult to control; was on nitroprusside initially then labetalol drip while in MICU.
Subsequently started on clonidine and ramped up, ramped up lisinopril, then minoxidil that was ramped up, finally controlling his BP somewhat.
It seems likely the patient's hypertension is in large part volume dependent as his interdialyctic weight would often increase by as much as 6kg.
ESRD: continued HD MWF, renal team followed closely and challenged dry weight; continued procrit as BP allowed (held when BP too high).
DM1: was initially kept on lower dose of glargine in setting of poor PO intake, but then glargine was titrated back up in the setting of hyperglycemia and dietary indiscretion.
H/o sz: EEG#1 had enceph, no sx; EEG#2 was normal; was on dilantin initially, switched to trileptal because levels were running high; will f/u with Neuro as outpatient.
It should be noted that it is unclear whether any of the patient's episodes of delerium could be attributed to seziure activity.
