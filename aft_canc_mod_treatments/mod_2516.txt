Admission Date:  [**2169-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-2-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9598**] Chief Complaint: scrotal edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC venogram, thrombectomy, tPA X 2   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50-year-old African-American male with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer status post multiple previous treatments, OSA, hypercholesterolemia, and h/o bilateral LE DVTs c/b bilateral PE with placement of IVC filter who presents with complaints of increased scrotal swelling.
The pt was initially treated with thrombectomy and local tPA which produced minimal result and then was given systemic tPA with resolution of the pt's LE edema.
He was placed on a heparin gtt and transitioned to enoxaparin 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] by time of discharge.
Takes Tylenol at home with relief.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Metastatic prostate cancer to bone refractory to hormone therapy s/p cycle 1 of Carboplatin and Taxotere [**2168-12-15**].
Dx in [**2163**] as [**Doctor Last Name **] 8 s/p surgical prostatectomy with XRT to t9 spinal metastasis in [**11-11**] followed by hormonal therapy, Taxotere (2 cycles), ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, mitoxantrone,  and DES.
He was recently noted to have a rise in his PSA to the 400 range, and a L-spine MRI on [**11-14**] showed multiple spine metastatic foci (no prior MRI L-spine for comparison, bone scan in [**6-/2168**] without clear spine metastases).
He received his first cycle of Carboplatin and Taxotere on [**2168-12-15**].
Metastatic prostate cancer to bone refractory to hormone therapy (see above) 2.
Bilateral LE DVTs complicated by bilateral PE [**4-/2168**], treated with enoxoparin then warfarin, and status post IVC filter placement 04/[**2168**].
Last with DVT on [**2169-1-7**], now on enoxoparin 120 mg daily.
[**6-/2168**] Bone scan: Widespread metastatic disease in multiple ribs, right iliac crest, and vertebra L4.
Vascular surgery was consulted and it was felt that the patient would not be a candidate for surgical management of his clot.
The patient underwent IR guided repeat IVC venogram with repeat thrombectomy and systemic administration of tPA on hospital day 2.
He was restarted on IV heparin after sheath removal and discharged from the ICU back to the floor.
He was kept on a heparin drip for several days as he had previously clotted off his IVC after his prior thrombectomy.
Although it was noted that his lower extremity and scrotal edema improved slightly after the repeat thrombectomy and tPA, it was agreed upon by the medical, oncologic, and radiology teams that a repeat IVC venogram with repeat thrombectomy and tPA would be performed to help evaluate IVC flow and to improve the pt's chances of post-procedure success.
The repeat venogram revealed good flow through the IVC from the prior thrombectomy and a repeat thrombectomy with tPA administration was performed.
During these episodes, his heparin was held and then restarted once all signs of bleeding had stopped.
No clear sources of infection were found initially and antibiotics were not started for a week and a half.
The patient was given IVF as it was thought his renal failure may have been secondary to dye load from the IVC venogram the day prior or from pre-renal causes.
Cipro was discontinued and switched to ceftriaxone and the pt was placed on steroids.
Neurology was consulted who felt that the pt's tremors were more consistent with asterixis.
His neurontin was tapered down from 900 mg to 300 mg tid with a significant improvement in his symptoms.
Initially, the pt was not imaged given his ARF and the fact that he was already on a heparin drip.
It was thought to be musculoskeletal in nature as the neck pain resolved with acetaminophen and toradol.
He was transitioned to lovenox 120 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **] from heparin gtt once renal vein thrombosis was ruled out definitively with the MRI and was discharged home in good condition with follow-up with his oncologist and renal.

Please take all medication as prescribed.
You will need to continue to take lovenox 120 mg subcutaneously twice a day.
Due to your resolving renal failure, we started you on a steroid called prednisone.
We also decreased your neurontin dose to 300 mg three times a day, which we believe were the primary cause of your tremors.
Call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any of the following: fever > 100.5, chills, night sweats, increased burning on urination, decreased urine frequency or output, shortness of breath, chest pain, increasing lower extremity and scrotal edema.
