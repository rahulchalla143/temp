He was called out to the floor with persistent O2 requirement and continuation of IV antibiotics.
Although the patient was initially treated with levoquin and ceftriaxone for CAP, his antibiotics were subsequently changed to Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H (Started on [**11-23**]) and CefePIME 2 g IV Q12H (started on [**11-21**] to replace ceftriaxone) to cover aspiration pathogens, given the pt's underlying neuromuscular disorder.
Vancomycin, in particular, was started due to the patient's copious brown secretions while intubated and resulting concern for MRSA pneumonia.
On the floor, antibiotics were slowly tapered off and the patient continued to do very well.
His O2 requirement resolved with aggressive pulmonary physical therapy and incentive spirometry, and nebs.
CARDIAC, VOLUME STATUS: The patient was monitored carefully to maintain euvolemia.
He was given prn lasix while in the MICU to maintain euvolemia.
He was continued on home ASA 81 mg and crestor.
He was given more lasix on the floor to assist in the O2 requirement and did not seem to improve the O2 requirement.
The pt also did not seem volume overloaded and therefore lasix was discontinued.
The patient was continued on his home regimen of Sinemet, Tamsar, and Mirapex.
He underwent speech and swallow evaluation on [**11-26**], which he failed.
He was started on tube feeds at that time.
The NG tube was pulled and the pt was started on a regular diet without any problems.
ANXIETY: continued home klonopin PRN, Zoloft.
Therefore, once all the tubes and monitors were pulled and stopped waking pt up for sinimet his sun-downing resolved.
