Regarding cancer risk patient with 14 pack year history of tobacco as well as h/o of Hodgkins disease s/p Mantle radiation in the [**2132**].
The patient was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2141**] and treated with splenectomy and thoracic mantle radiotherapy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Regarding immediate history prior to this presentation patient developed shortness of breath in mid-[**Month (only) **], was started on Flovent by his primary care physician.
There was also a 2-cm subcarinal node and a 0.9-cm node adjacent to the left mainstem bronchus.
Hematocrit at that time was 45.5, with a WBC count of 20.8, and the patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
Flow cytometry revealed no lymphoma, but showed clusters of highly atypical cells on the cytospin, suspicious for a non-hematologic malignancy.
Biopsy results of the enlarged subcarinal lymph node + non-small cell lung cancer (Immunohistochemical stains show that tumor cells stain positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/3 and CAM 5.2), cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1.
Cells are negative for cytokeratin 20, chromogranin, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, CD56 (NCAM) and HMB45.
The patient underwent IR embolization of right bronchial artery branches on [**2173-10-18**], and IR embolization of left bronchial, intercostal, and internal mammary branches on [**2173-10-19**].
He was seen by the thoracic surgery team on [**2173-10-19**] for consideration of lobectomy which due to involvement/encasement of pulmonary arteries did not appear to be an option.

You were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and intubated for protection of your airway.
Our team of interventional pulmonologists examined your airways and identified the bleeding source.
To complete staging, a sample of fluid was removed from your pleural space, the pleura is a sac that surrounds your lungs.
You also broke out in a rash twice while hospitalized, both which were attributed to a drug rash (first levofloxacin, second: ceftriaxone) To treat your rash you were started on anti-histamines as well as oral steriods.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS: To treat your rash: CONTINUE taking PREDNISONE 20mg.
For sympotamatic relief of your rash you make take/apply the following as needed: - RANTIDINE 150mg tablets.
- BENADRYL 25mg tablets.
STOP taking PLAVIX and ASPIRIN to minimize your risk of bleeding.
Take all other prescription medications as prescribed.
