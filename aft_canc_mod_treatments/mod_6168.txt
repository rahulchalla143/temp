History of Present Illness: 72 year-old woman with h/o NSCLC on Tarceva, PE on coumadin (since [**6-/2186**]) presented on [**2187-10-24**] with 4 days left facial droop, ataxia, dysarthria and found to have multiple bihemispheric intracranial masses with associated hemorrhage.
These symptoms progressively worsened and she called her oncologist who asked her to hold chemotherapy and present for clinic evaluation.
Given 5 mg IV of Vitamin K, 1000 PE IV fos-phenytoin, and 10 mg IV Decadron.
Patient given 5 mg IV Vitamin K, 2 units FFP, and 2 vials Profilnine for reversal of INR 2.2.
Past Medical History: Past Medical/Oncological History: Non-small cell lung cancer s/p 1 year of chemotherapy recently finished and currently on Tarceva (EGFR inhibitor), followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Location (un) 5503**], MA) PE on coumadin Remote CVA HTN Hypercholesterolemia s/p TAH-BSO Prior stroke many years ago, presenting with right hand clumsiness and dysarthria, no residual symptoms  Social History: Smoked ppd but quit many years ago.
Brief Hospital Course: A 72 year-old woman with h/o NSCLC on Tarceva presented [**10-25**] with slurred speech and left-sided facial droop, found to have multiple brain mets with surrounding hemorrhage and edema on head CT, now transferred to oncologic medicine from neurosurgury for whole brain XRT.
METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER The multiple hemorrhagic brain mets were stable on imaging per neurosurgery; her coagulopathy was reversed with vitamin K and FFP, and her coumadin was held.
She was started on steroids at a dose of 4 mg Q6H.
She was also started on Keppra and Dilantin given concern of seizure activity in the ED at the OSH.
She will undergo a series of 10 radiation treatments in total.
SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS She has been treated with Dilantin and Keppra.
Thus her INR was reversed and her coumadin held.
If as she says her pulmonary embolism occurred 12 months ago, there is no emergent need for anticoagulation at this time, and certainly the bleeding risks outweigh the benefits.
Hydralazine was used as needed to keep her SBP <160.
Pneumoboots were used for prophylaxis, and her home dose PPI provided prophylaxis against stress ulcers.
