Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    70F s/p resection of infected endograft and aorto-right CIA bypass graft REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    r/o abscess.
Final Report HISTORY: 70-year-old woman status post resection of infected endograft and aorto right CIA bypass graft.
TECHNIQUE: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast.
Infrarenally, there has been removal of previously identified endovascular graft and excision of the native aorta with placement of an aorto-uni-iliac tubular graft anastomosis distal to the right common iliac artery.
There is no flow to left internal iliac in keeping with post- surgical anatomy.
There are foci of air within the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior abdominal wall on the left, 2:59 and right 2:56, with opacification in the soft tissue at 2:49 on the left, which should be correlated with injections, or possible infection at this site.
Status post excision of endovascular aorta graft and fem-fem bypass graft, with placement of aorto-uni-iliac tubular graft extending from the infrarenal aorta to the right common iliac artery.
INDICATION: Feeding tube assessment.
FINDINGS: A feeding tube is coiled within the stomach.
With the exception of tube placement and apparent removal of right internal jugular [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] sheath, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the recent prior radiograph.
On [**2130-8-1**] she went to the operating room and underwent excision of the infected aortic endograft, aortic and iliac endarterectomies, and conversion to open retroperitoneal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with aorto-uni-iliac tube graft.
Post-operatively she was taken to the CVICU for close monitoring and ventilatory support.
Neurological: Immediately post-operatively she remained on a fentanyl drip for pain control and propofol/versed for sedation.
This was changed to fentanyl prn post-extubation.
She was started on low dose seroquel in place of her ambien.
Her TSH level was elevated at 30, but it was recommended that she stay on her current dose of levothyroxine 112mcg daily.
Cardiovascular: In the immediate post-operative course she did require a Neosynephrine drip to maintain adequate blood pressures but this was rapidly weaned off.
Pulmonary: She remained intubated post-operatively and was successfully extubated on POD2.
She was given aggressive pulmonary toilet by the nursing staff in the early post-operative period.
After extubation she was started on clear liquids and then advanced to a regular diet.
A dobhoff tube was placed to initiate enteral feeds.
She tolerated continuous tube feeds, so we began to cycle them overnight to stimulate her appetite.
Because of this and her adequate calorie counts were able to stop her tube feeds and remove the dobhoff tube.
Genitourinary: She required massive IVF resuscitation in the peri-operative period and was up about 30kg from her baseline weight.
She was aggressively diureses with IV lasix and is now on a PO regimen of 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
Hematological: She was transfused a total of 8units of PRBCs and 2units of FFP.
Her hematocrit has remained stable in the 28-32 range and she has not required further transfusions.
Endocrine: She does have diabetes and was on a diabetic diet, but to stimulate PO intake this restriction was lifted.
Infectious Disease:  She was placed on Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl empirically on admission.
Her infected AAA endograft was removed and cultures sent from the operating room.
Once sensitivities returned she was started on Rifampin PO and Linezolid IV.
Her Linezolid was changed to PO.
She is to be discharged on PO Rifampin and Linezolid with [**Hospital **] clinic follow up.
She is to have her CBC checked weekly to monitor for bone marrow suppresion.
