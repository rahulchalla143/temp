She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible aspiration.
The family was given a poor prognosis so decided to make her CMO.
ROS per patient's husband is negative for headaches, fevers, weakness, speech difficulties, gait difficulties.
[] MSK - bilateral total hip replacements, s/p thigh/hip abscess/infx requiring IV abx ~ 18 months ago  Social History: lives with husband.
Aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis.
[**2177-8-30**] NCHCT - IMPRESSION: Status post placement of right frontal ventricular drain with the tip in the region of foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Unchanged diameter of the intraventricular system with unchanged position of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter.
Neurosurgery was consulted but decided to hold off on placing a ventriculostomy while her mental status remained relatively functional.
At this time, Neurosurgery decided to place a ventriculostomy; the EVD was placed without complication and with maintenance of appropriate ICPs with minimal change in neurologic exam.
The strokes by themselves would not explain her depressed level of consciousness, and thus an EEG was performed due to concerns for potential status epilepticus as she was having rhythmic eyelid contractions and sporadic eye movements.
She was made CMO overnight on [**7-27**], placed on a morphine infusion, and she passed away at 0745 on [**2177-9-5**].
[] Pulmonary Edema, Hemodynamic Instability - On [**2177-8-28**], the patient became progressively tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypertensive and required more supplemental O2 to maintain her SaO2 in the 90s in the setting of a 500cc fluid bolus given for suspected hypovolemia in the setting of progressive tachycardia.
Her hemodynamic status normalized with metoprolol, albuterol/ipratropium, oxygen and mild diuresis with furosemide 10 IV.
This may have been related to mild volume overload in the setting of likely COPD or beta blocker withdrawal from having been off medications during the prehospital obtunded period.
However, her respiratory status continued to be tenuous and she was intubated for persistent respiratory distress.
She intermittently had episodes of tachynea/tachycardia/hypoxia without any evident cause (clear lungs to auscultation besides upper airway sounds and secretions, no infiltrates on CXR, no cardiac or metabolic causes) which resolved to some degree with sedation with Propofol.
She was started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with Cefepime and Vancomycin; these were stopped when all of her cultures remained negative.
In the setting of large amounts of IVH and no ventriculostomy for decompression, she was permitted to have mild hypernatremia to minimize cerebral edema.
However, this progressed during [**Date range (1) 10659**], and the patient was started on NS, then 1/2NS and Furosemide to address her hypernatremia which resolved with this treatment.
She was kept normovolemic with tube feeds at goal 100 cc/hr.
