He was started on tamsulosin and restarted on flomax.
He was initially treated with iv dilaudid (which was switched to tylenol and oxycodone secondary to ileus) and ivfs, which was stopped secondary to volume overload (see below).
He was also treated with a course of ceftriaxone for suspected pyelonephritis.
He passed several stones on this admission, and one was sent for analysis.
Hypoxia: On presentation patient received fluid hydration for nephrolithiasis and subsequently, developed hypoxia.
He was continued on his home CPAP overnight for OSA and lasix was restarted at his home dose po.
Acute on chronic kidney disease: Baseline Cr 1.4-1.7.
However, a repeat CT abdomen was done that showed worsening hydronephrosis and a ~4mm stone at the UV junction.
Urology was then consulted regarding surgery and advised monitoring the patient clinically given his comorbidities and risk of anesthesia.
Patient passed a stone [**12-22**] and subsequent to this Creatine improved to baseline and began putting out large amounts of urine.
It was ultimately felt that his ARF was likely secondary to obstructive uropathy with resolution of passing of stone and post-obstructive diuresis.
Throughout this time his lisinopril was held and not restarted on discharge.
Ileus: Patient developed ileus secondary to large quantity of narcotics and was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen with resolution of his symptoms.
His coumadin dose was initially held and then restarted at 2mg daily.
Patient was continued on metoprolol for rate control.
Obstructive sleep apnea: He was continued on CPAP overnight on home settings .
He was continued on his home regimen of amlodipine and metoprolol.
He was further managed with his home beta blocker, lasix, and ACEi held due to kidney issues.

While you were here we treated you with iv fluids.
However, because of your kidney dysfunction and heart failure you developed difficulty breathing because of volume overload, and so you were treated with lasix.
We have stopped your Lisinopril because of your kidney function, please see your PCP before restarting this medication.
