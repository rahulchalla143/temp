Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76 yo woman transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] rehab after developing new multifocal pneumonia, leukocytosis and low grade temps.
While in the hospital she was maintained on a ventillator via her tracheostomy.
The patient was initially also treated with gentamycin for double pseudomonas coverage but her culture showed gentamycin resistance.
The plan for antibiotics was to continue zosyn for a total of 2 weeks.
A PICC line was placed by IR on [**2144-3-23**].
# Paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to neuroendocrine tumor: Discussed plan with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] who agreed that chemo therapy should be held until after the patient completes her course of treatment.
Her INR rose to 4.8 on [**2144-3-24**] and her coumadin was held.
The presumption was that the increasing INR was secondary to antibiotics and decreased GI flora.
Patient was discharged to an acute care rehab where her coumadin can be held and her INR can be rechecked in 2 days.
Plan to hold coumadin for an INR > 3.5.
