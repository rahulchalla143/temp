HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female who has a history of metastatic breast cancer who was started on Decadron on [**2107-9-27**] after starting stereotactic radiation therapy to the midbrain for a 7-mm metastasis as well as gemcitabine treatment.
The patient had her last radiation treatment prior to admission.
She reported to the Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic on [**11-9**] in order to receive her gemcitabine; however, she felt weak and had a fever at that time to 101.7.
The patient has had a recent sinus infection which was treated with Augmentin; the course ended on [**11-9**].
The patient has noted increasing proximal muscle weakness over the past few weeks after being started on the Decadron.
In the Emergency Department the patient was pan-cultured and started on Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
She was treated with mastectomy and radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis.
Her cancer then recurred in [**2101**], and she was treated with the STAMP protocol BMT.
She was treated with Herceptin and Navelbine at that time.
Therefore, she was treated with WBXRT.
She therefore was started on Decadron and underwent stereotactic radiation therapy as previously described.
Decadron 4 mg p.o.
Fosamax 10 mg p.o.
Miacalcin 1 spray q.d.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Neurontin 300 mg p.o.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to CIPROFLOXACIN which causes a rash.
It should be noted that the patient has tolerated her Levaquin without any incidence of rash.
There was resolution of bilateral pleural effusions compared with previous examination.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the O-MED Service for further evaluation and treatment of her fever.
Therefore, she was continued on Levaquin empirically, and her cultures were followed.
On the day following admission, the patient was noted to have bronchial irritability with persistent coughing with deep inspirations.
A chest CT was obtained to look for possible infiltrates which could not be appreciated on chest x-ray, being most concerned with possible Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia given the patient's previous steroid treatment and recent tapering of her steroids.
The patient was started on intravenous Bactrim on the second hospital day, and she was continued on Levaquin for empiric coverage of other community-acquired infections.
She was requiring oxygen by face mask at that point.
She remained in the unit for two days and received CPAP while there.
She also had been started on prednisone for her Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia the day she had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at a dose of 40 mg p.o.
After coming back to the floor the patient continued to require 70% oxygen by face mask, and she did not improve as quickly as would be expected.
She had a chest tube placed on [**11-18**].
She continued with the chest tube which resolved the pneumothorax nicely.
The chest tube continued to have an intermittent air leak, however.
Therefore, her Bactrim was switched from intravenous to p.o.
Her prednisone has been tapered to 20 mg p.o.
The patient will continue with her chest tube to suction until it is again without an air leak, at which time she may possibly have the chest tube pulled.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  She will most likely will require a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation as she has become deconditioned during her hospitalization.
