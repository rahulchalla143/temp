Acute leukemia:  Because of the high white count of 430,000, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for acute phoresis for management of leukostasis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and did notice some improvement in breathing.
He experienced great improvement with phoresis, but also received a lot of intravenous fluids.
