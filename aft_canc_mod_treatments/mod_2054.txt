She is being admitted for hypotension on day +8 after underwent AraC/Idarubicin induction [**2169-8-30**].
She tolerated the medication well and was discharged on day +6.
She denies any localizing symptoms such as headache, neck pain, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.
She underwent R-CHOP and two cycles of RICE.
She subsequently relapsed and underwent autologous stem cell transplant in [**4-4**].
Bone marrow biopsy after resolution of the pneumonia showed myelodysplastic syndrome with increased blasts (5-10% with trilineage dysplasia), thought to be [**3-5**] her prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant.Chromosomal studies revealed chromosome abnormalities of deletion 5, 7 and 20. .

Relapsed gastric lymphoma s/p partial  gastrectomy with chemotherapy.
Had a P-Mibi for further evaluation which confirmed moderate perfusion defect of PDA territory and medium sized, severe perfusion defect of LAD territory as well as severe systolic dysfunction.
Cardiac medications including low-dose ACEI and beta-blocker were started.
Ratio of mean fluorescent intensity of CD33 positive blast to mean fluorescent intensity of isotype control is 3.2.
Improvement of pulmonary interstitial edema and decrease in the size of pleural effusions from prior CT study.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**2169-12-21**]): HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, MARROW REGENERATION AND INCREASED MYELOBLASTS.
Patient had repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2170-5-8**] showing recurrent leukemia.
The patient underwent Azacytadine/gemtuzumab therapy from [**12-7**] to [**12-11**].
The patient was then started on Dacogen therapy.
She underwent a pre-SCT Infectious Disease evaluation, and she increased her performance and nutritional status.
The patient started conditioning therapy on [**2170-2-9**] and received a SCT on [**2170-2-16**].
She tolerated her graft well.
She was maintained on Cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis.
She was changed from inhailed pentamidine to atovaquone when her J-tube was placed.
She was treated with gancyclovir, but continued to have persistent CMV infection.
She was seen by PT and OT and speach therapy in the hospital for stroke rehab.
No infectious etiology was found, and the patient was restarted on her home regimen of Acyclovir and Ambosome.
The fever persisted, and the patient was thus started on Vancomycin and Meropenem.
During her second admission, her antibiotics were increased to include Daptomycin, Meropenem, Tobramycin, Bactrim, Acyclovir, Posaconazole and PO Flagyl.
The patient remained afebrile, and her antibiotics were gradually discontinued, with the exception of Micafungin (changed from Posaconazole secondary to rising LFTs), Acyclovir, and Vancomycin.
The Tobramycin was later discontinued and the patient has remained afebrile to date.
Her antibiotics were slowly weaned back.
She was doing well and then at the end of [**Month (only) **] was found to have UTI and treated with meropenem and CMV viremia and treated with gancyclovir.
She then started having fevers persistently, and was found to have a VRE UTI and was started on daptomycin.
# Pulmonary Edema:  From [**1-3**] through [**1-10**] the patients weight increased to 118lbs as she was placed on IVF for SBP as low as 70s.
This lead to ICU admissions on two occassions.
In the setting of BNPs 15 - 35K, pulmonary edema on CXR, the patient was placed on a lasix drip each time with subsequent improvements in her BP.
Hemodynamics - Patient was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker.
The patient subsequently remained normotensive with pressures ranging systolically from 90s to 120s.
Cards was c/s and stated that the patient would not be a candidate for cardiac catheterization of POBA, as she is unable to take Plavix or ASA long-term.
Posaconazole was changed to Micofungin as a possible source for elevated transaminases, and a RUQ U/S was performed which showed stones in the gallbladder and CBD.
She also had some rise in AP/bili in [**Month (only) 958**] and was started on treatment for GVHD for liver and gut involvement as she was having diarrhea.
A steroid course was initiated and tapered off as diarrhea and LFTs improved.
She continued on cyclosporine and was titrated to 3x/week levels.
# Nutrition: Patient was initially on TPN following her stroke.
A J-tube was placed by surgery on [**2170-3-22**].
A J-tube was placed as the patient had a past partial gastrectomy for a gastric cancer.
After the J-tube placement she developed bilious emesis.
Her tube feeds were resumed with a forluma that did not require pancreatic enzymes or bile.
An NG tube was placed to suction her gastric secretions and bile.
She continued on J tube feeds, but TPN was stopped.
Once made CMO, IVFs were stopped and patient was given minimal tube feeds for comfort per family request until she expired.
We started her on [**Hospital1 **] protonix for now and she has no more episodes.
