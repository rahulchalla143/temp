History of Present Illness: 78-year-old man with h/o recent relapse of pre-B cell ALL with chemotherapy currently on hold for newly diagnosed metastatic epitheloid rhabdomyosarcoma with diffuse mets including extensive pulmonary involvement and bilateral malignant effusions; s/p palliative XRT to para-aortic and psoas masses.
Pt was recently admitted [**10-20**] for palliative cycle #1 of vincristine and cyclophosphamide for the sarcoma.
ChemoTx was tolerated well but pt had increased dyspnea that admission with restaging CT showing marked progression of his sarcoma with liver, pulmonary, adrenal, psoas, and peritoneal mets with bilateral pleural effusions.
He was diuresed and had IP drainage with 1.2L removed from each side, both positive for malignant cells.
Also that admission, CT showed splenic and portal vein thrombosis and he was started on Lovenox but was actually held at the time of discharge due to thrombocytopenia.
He received 2L of NS and was given Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Vitals before transfer: hr 97, Blood pressure 111/59, satting 93% with face mask.
- treated on the [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol and completed maintenance therapy in 10/[**2180**].
Had also received intrathecal Methotrexate.
Treated again per the [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol with treatment being held during the prolonged maintenence phase when  he was discovered to have an abdominal mass consistent with a metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD s/p cath in [**2170**], preserved EF 55% with low normal systolic function Hyperlipidemia Squamous cell skin cancer s/p multiple excisions Hyperplastic colon polyp, [**2176**]  Social History: Never smoked.
Physical Exam: 96  p105  92% on NRB  100/66 (67) sbp 91-106 rr 24-27 Thin man laying in bed, doesn't appear uncomfortable, but only able to speak half a sentence at a time, with NRB on.
He remained tachycardic even after fluid boluses.
CTA was not pursued because patient would not have been a candidate for anticoagulation due to sanguinous pleural effusions.
Patient underwent Pleurex catheter placement on the first hospital day and 1500 cc's was drained; 4 hours later an additional 500 cc's was drained.
Unfortunately even after this fluid was removed he remained hypoxic to the mid to high 80s on non-rebreather.
The Pleurex catheter was left in place.
His air hunger was treated with morphine and ativan which his blood pressure tolerated, as well as continued drainage of his pleural effusion via his pleurex catheter.
Splenic and portal vein thrombosis: Anticoagulation with Lovenox was deferred  due to thrombocytopenia.
Widely metastatic epitheloid rhabdomyosarcoma: S/p 1st cycle ([**10-20**] = day 1) of vincristine and cyclophosphamide.
The patient was treated with supportive measures.
Pancytopenia: Felt due to chemotherapy, given counts have dropped since pt started chemo on [**10-20**].
