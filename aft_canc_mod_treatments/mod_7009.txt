The patient had recently had a paracentesis which revealed an ovarian carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had multiple admissions for her extensive comorbidities, and in [**Month (only) **] the patient had been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma with peritoneal fluid tapped with paracentesis on the Medicine Service.
Status post lithotripsy for nephrolithiasis.
Periodic atrial tachycardia to 150, started on amiodarone in [**2109-9-2**].
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times two; status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times four; status post coronary artery bypass graft (3-vessel disease with only 1-vessel coronary artery bypass graft); status post Persantine sestamibi in [**2110-1-3**] with left ventricular ejection fraction of 36%; moderately fixed anterior wall and apex, severely fixed perfusion defect in the basilar portion of the anterior wall.
Status post "partial hysterectomy" 15 years ago.
Ascites, status post paracentesis on [**2110-5-24**]; diagnosing adenocarcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient was intubated and responded to voice and command, nodded "yes" to abdominal discomfort.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit status post suboptimal debulking for papillary serous ovarian cancer, stage IIIC.
The patient was admitted to Twelve [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] on postoperative day two after being extubated successfully.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, status post coronary artery bypass graft and pacemaker, with an ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was maintained on her Coreg, hydralazine, and Isordil.
The patient's blood pressure was stabilized with fluid boluses, but secondary to her increased abdominal girth and rebuilding of ascites, the patient was also diuresed with 5% albumin boluses.
The patient remained afebrile, but due to the concern of sepsis and her blood pressure dropping to 70s/30s to 40s, the patient was empirically started on Unasyn intravenously, and blood and urine cultures were drawn.
All of the patient's medications were held at this point.
At this point, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was aware and postponed the patient's scheduled chemotherapy for a later time.
For the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, her blood pressures were maintained with fluid and oral intake.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had an nasogastric tube in place upon transfer from the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day two, the patient's nasogastric tube was discontinued but kept n.p.o.
On postoperative day eight, the patient started feeling nausea and vomiting and with her abdominal pain increasing and the issue of potential sepsis, the patient had the nasogastric tube replaced.
The patient was maintained with maintenance intravenous fluids.
On postoperative day 13, the patient had her nasogastric tube discontinued.
A Foley catheter had been placed to monitor urine output.
The Foley inadvertently came out when the patient was ambulating on postoperative day three.
When the patient experienced her hypotensive episodes, the Foley was replaced and kept in place until her discharge.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was placed on a regular insulin sliding-scale for her insulin-dependent diabetes as the patient had minimal oral intake (NPH was not restarted).
The patient was also on her Synthroid for hypothyroidism.
The patient had been on Unasyn, but secondary to the findings and the fact that the patient had a white blood cell count of 11.7 (with neutrophils of 67, 20 bands, 5 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, and 0 eosinophils), the patient's antibiotics were switched from Unasyn to Zosyn and Flagyl.
Subsequent complete blood count noted that the patient's bands had gone down to 2, but intravenous antibiotics were continued until the patient's discharge date.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained with maintenance fluids.
Throughout the remainder of the patient's stay, she was maintained on maintenance fluids, and her electrolytes were checked on a regular basis.
Medicine/Oncology had been consulted in house, and the plan had been made for the patient to undergo chemotherapy with carboplatin prior to discharge.
At this time was when the patient's nasogastric tube was discontinued, and the patient was allowed to take oral intake.
The patient's Foley was left in place, as the patient has had more and more trouble ambulating without assistance.
The patient was also given morphine elixir and a Fentanyl patch was placed for pain management issues.
