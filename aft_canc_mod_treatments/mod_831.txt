Admission Date:  [**2142-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-2-17**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Augmentin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**] Chief Complaint: rectal cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p lap Abdominal perineal resection with colostomy on [**2142-2-9**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old man with a distal rectal cancer arising within 2 cm of the dentate line.
His postoperative course was complicated by possible urine leak and urinary retention requiring self catheterization.
The patient did not recover well from the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs and the decision was made that full course radiation therapy would simply be too strenuous for the patient to tolerate.
Therefore, a short course of radiation therapy was necessary.
A short course therapy would not allow for sufficient down-staging of the tumor to allow for distal anastomosis which would need to be a coloanal in an 83-year- old man anyway, so an abdominoperineal resection was recommended as definitive therapy with the best functional outcome.

Patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of his volume resuscitation, and remained on mechanical ventilation post-op.
&#9658; ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING) -	Hct has been drifting down from 34 overnight, so unclear if bleed has truly stopped -	Follow Q4H Hct during day and transfuse for threshold of < 30 given extensive h/o CAD -	If bleed clearly stabilizes and pt has no evidence of cardiac ischemia, would consider decreasing transfusion threshold tomorrow -	No evidence of coagulopathy -	Maintain active T+S  # Respiratory failure: Pt not extubated after surgery out of concern for volume overload in setting of aggressive PRBC transfusions.
-	CXR with evidence of volume overload, RSBI marginal -	Will diurese today and follow respiratory status with serial ABGs -	RSBI in AM  # Hypotension: -	most likely due to propofol -	switch sedation to versed with boluses of fentanyl for pain control -	wean neosynephrine as tolerated  # Volume status: Patient very positive in setting of fluid and RBC resuscitation after surgery yesterday.
