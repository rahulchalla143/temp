A catheter or other tube overlies the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
A left IJ central line overlies the mid SVC.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
[**2155-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube.
Retrocardiac opacification may reflect merely volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
[**2155-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.
Right basal and left retrocardiac opacities can be also appreciated on the chest CT obtained on [**2155-11-4**] and are concerning for multifocal infection.
[**2155-11-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Previous pulmonary edema on [**11-3**] has improved, but there is multifocal infection, demonstrated to better advantage on yesterday's chest CT scan concerning for pneumonia, with demonstration of heavy retained secretions in the airways, particularly the bronchus to the collapsed left lower lobe.
T12 involvement could be malignant.
Endotracheal tube terminates 5.9 cm above the carina.
Left internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
[**2155-11-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated.
The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7 cm above the carina.
[**2155-11-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the mild retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.
On the right, the pre-existing opacities have slightly decreased in extent and severity and now more concentrated in the medial basal parts of the right lower lung.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4427**] is a 67M with history of alcohol abuse, BCC, fungal pericarditis, hypopharyngeal cancer currently undergoing XRT who presents with fevers, respiratory distress and transferred to the ICU for close monitoring, ultimately found to have aspiration pneumonia from difficult to manage secretions and was intubated for airway protection and is now s/p tracheostomy placement.
On evaluation, he was not stridulous and his airways were patent on laryngoscopic evaluation.
Given his clinical picture and difficult to manage secretions with evidence of possible aspiration pneumonia on CXR, he was intubated on HD#1 for airway protection with the fiberoptic scope.
He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for an 8 day total course ([**11-3**] - [**11-10**]) and continued on fluconazole which was started for fungal pericarditis (below) which should be continued through [**2155-11-26**].
Given the likely need for prolonged intubation for airway protection in the setting of his progressive pharyngeal mass, the decision was made to proceed with tracheostomy which was performed by ENT on [**2155-11-6**].
He was weaned from the ventilator on [**11-8**] and has been breathing comfortably with sats in the high 90s on 40% trach mask.
Pt was started on IV Vanc/Zosyn at rehab on [**11-2**] and was transitioned to Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA and completed an 8 day total course ([**11-3**] - [**11-10**]).
Blood cultures were sent on [**11-11**] after completing course of antibiotics, and these surveillance cultures should be followed to determine of there is a need to restart a longer course of vancomycin.
He was also continued on fluconazole for fungal pericarditis (below), which will also cover for possible fungal laryngitis appreciated on ENT laryngoscopic exam (should continue taking through [**2155-11-26**]).
He was intubated (above) for airway protection and ultimately had tracheostomy placement on [**11-6**] and weaned from the vent on [**11-8**].
This was thought likely to be due to delirium given multiple factors including disturbance in sleep-wake cycle, infection, and concern for possible seizures given myoclonic movements.
Goals of care discussion with his family was addressed at a family meeting, and decision was made to proceed with tracheostomy (above).
He restarted XRT at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-11**] and received a total of 2 doses (#15 and #16 out of 30).
In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made to hold off on additional chemotherapy due to pancytopenia.
TTE was negative for vegetations and TEE deferred given low concern for endocarditis and negative surveillance cultures here.
Surveillance blood cultures were drawn after stopping antibiotics and were pending at the time of discharge with no growth to date.
His counts trended down slowly requiring transfusion of 2 units pRBCs and 2 units of platelets during his admission.
He was given a dose of Vitamin K and his INR improved slightly to 1.3 and remained stable throughout hospitalization without evidence of active bleeding.
Pt arrived with Lidoderm patch and MS contin and morphine IR for breakthrough.
He was transitioned to fentanyl patch with breakthrough oxycodone given that he takes meds through his G tube and long acting morphine cannot be crushed.
Pain control was titrated up and was adequate at the time of discharge.
# DVT prophylaxis: Restarted heparin SC BID in house given high risk for clot given hypercoagulable state with malignancy, discharged on dalteparin.
Inactive issues: # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine  # Hypertension: Hypertensive on admission.
On prn IV anti-hypertensives while in the and should transition to home regimen on discharge.

You were intubated and you now have a tracheostomy tube to help you breathe.
You were also treated with antibiotics for a pneumonia.
You were seen by your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and you restarted your radiation treatments for the cancer in your neck, but your blood counts were too low to restart the chemotherapy at this time.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to determine when you are ready to restart the chemotherapy for the remainder of your course.
You will have transportation arranged from [**Hospital1 **] for your radiation treatment.
