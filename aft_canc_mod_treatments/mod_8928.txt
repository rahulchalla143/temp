It was believed that no hysterectomy was indicated at this time by her gynecologist, blindness secondary to a dent of the optic nerve.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a [**2112**] right abdominal wall desmoid resection and reconstruction by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic surgery service, a chest wall right desmoid recurrence (status post resection in [**2113-5-12**]), multiple hernia repairs (most recently on [**2120-1-25**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which also included an abdominoplasty with Marlex and mesh repair by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient's medications include Prozac, hydrocodone, Percocet, and over-the-counter iron 325 mg b.i.d.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted electively and underwent an en bloc resection of the left rectus muscle for recurrent desmoid tumor as well as a left inferior rib resection as well as ventral hernia repair by placement of an inlay mesh.
These procedures were performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the general surgery service as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic surgery service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the thoracic surgery service.
While the patient tolerated the procedure well, upon awakening from anesthesia the patient had a brief hypoxic event.
RECURRENT DESMOID TUMOR: Following resection of this mass    the patient's wound was managed by both the general    surgery service and thoracic surgery service, and the    wound was noted throughout her admission to be clean, dry,    and intact with no signs or symptoms of infection.
The    patient was initially managed with an epidural catheter    for this pain.
This was subsequently converted to oral    pain medication in the form of Percocet and this provided    adequate anesthesia.
The drains were removed prior to    discharge.
