Sensitivities on CNS and enterococcus returned on [**3-20**] and both are sensitive to vanco, so the patient was continued on vancomycin and caspofungin for 14d course but CTX was d/c.
He was tried on midodrine and octreotide w/ improvement in Cr to 1.2, so meds were d/c on [**3-19**].
However, Cr up to 2.0 on [**3-20**] so we restarted midodrine and octerotide.
This is likely a trminal stage of his hepatorrenal disease, in spite of medication and optimum fluid management.
Most likely related to his renal failure/fluid resuscitation with normal saline as his diarrhea had improved.
The patient was continued on lactulose and rifaximin.
He never required restraints or 1:1 sitters.
His Tbilirubin remained very elevated>25, and his coagulation profile worsened.
Albumin and platelets remained stable.
He was continued on ursodiol and started on cholestyramine for improvement of pruritus.
