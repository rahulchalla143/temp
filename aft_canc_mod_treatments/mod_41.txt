He also received sublingual nitroglycerin paste.

Pulmonary - Because the patient was presumed to have community-acquired pneumonia, by clinical presentation and chest x-ray he was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
He continued this regimen for the remainder of his hospital stay and after discharge, such that he would complete a 14 day course.
The patient was given Atrovent metered dose inhalers initially q.

Cardiovascular - For the patient's hypotension, he received a 500 cc normal saline bolus over night long in the Intensive Care Unit.
