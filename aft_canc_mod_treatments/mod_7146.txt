Her serum osmolality was elevated at time of arrival at 325 mOsm.
The hyperglycemia may all be related to her steroids or could also represent unmasking of type two diabetes mellitus (HgA1c 7.9).
The pt was initially on insulin gtt, and this was discontinued and the pt was covered with sliding scale insulin and glargine.
The pt then had a dietary indiscretion (Chinese food) and insulin gtt was restarted.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted, Was started on lantus 10U qam, metformin started/increased to 1000/500 (will need to monitor LFTs given underlying cholestatic liver disease).
Given her fingersticks were noted to peak midday, typical of prednisone, [**Last Name (un) **] recommended NPH 25 U in the morning (instead of lantus) and adding glucotrol as well.
On discharge, she was on NPH 25 U in the AM, metformin, and glucotrol.
#) Acute renal failure: The pt's ARF resolved with IV fluid rescuscitation.
#) Sarcoidosis: Patient was started on prednisone 60 mg daily about 2 weeks ago for treatment.
During this admission the pt was continued on 20mg po prednisone, with plans to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] her pulmonologist to discuss other possible treatment options.
Fluticasone spray stopped while on prednisone, esp since pt has thrush.
#) Hypertension: BP meds initially held in setting of ARF and volume depletion.
lisinopril resumed at 40 mg daily;  BP low/normal on discharge (better diet while here), norvasc and hctz not resumed.
#) Thrush: Treated with Nistatin swish and swallow, suspect this is secondary to steroid use and concurrent hyperglycemia .
She stated that this pain started after a painful IV attempt in the ICU in which she felt tingling in her arm afterwards.
On examination, this seemed to be consistent with trauma of one of her nerves, so tylenol/heat packs recommended.
