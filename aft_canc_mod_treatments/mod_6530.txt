Admission Date:  [**2165-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-9-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**] Chief Complaint: Right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TPA administered  History of Present Illness: HPI: Patient is a 83 year old RHM with hx of Afib on Coumadin, DM, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, and mild dementia who was found aphasic with vomitus at 9:40pm.
His last known well time was 9:30 and when the EMS arrived around 9:50, he was found to be not talking and completely hemiplegic on right side.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he was evaluated per telemed with neurologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] who recommended IV tPA given that his INR was 1.3 and his significant deficits.
IV tPA started at 12:10 am (2hrs 40 mins after last known well time) and finished at 1:20 at which point, he was transferred here for further evaluation and care.
NIHSS after IV tPA here in ED: 2 for LOC questions 1 for minor facial paralysis 4 for no movement of RUE 1 for drift of RLE 1 mild/mod sensory loss 3 for mute, global aphasia 2 for severe dysarthria Total 14  Patient was taken for CTA/CTP which showed no hemorrhagic transformation plus patent proximal vessels but did have increased MTT and decreased CBV on reformatted images.
However, he did have a bout of pneumonia 2 weeks ago hence was on levaquin for 10 days which finished 5 days prior to admission.
Patient walks with a cane at baseline and has mild dementia but still highly independent - he still drives, pays own bills and takes own meds.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin 2.
Resolving defecits on exam and dysarrthria improved as well on discharge.
Coumadin was restarted shortly after TPA administration.
Patient's INR climbed despite holding coumadin to 8.6.
The elevated INR was thought to be due to lack of nutrition, antibiotics and liver disease (he has HCC).
Given the difficulty with his INR, lovenox was started when his INR was 2.3.
He should continue lovenox for his atrial fibrillation and asa 81 mg daily.
Speech and swallow initially thought he was an aspiration risk because of his poor mental status, but as his mental status improved, he was able to eat purreed food with thickened liquids and per nurse was not aspirating at all.
We treated the UTI with ceftriaxone and the hypernatremia with D5 W and his mental status improved.
# UTI: treated with ceftriaxone for 5 days, UA negative on discharge so antibiotics were discontinued .
We diuresed him with 40 mg IV lasix for 3 days and diuresed several liters of fluid.
# CHF with EF 15-20%: Patient received fluids after his stroke and lasix was held.
Patient received several 40 mg IV boluses of lasix and diuresed [**2-1**] liters per day for 3 days.
We also continued asa, carvedilol and added 5 mg lisinopril once his creatinine normalized.
# HTN: well-controlled, cont carvedilol and lisinopril .
# AFib: rate controlled with carvedilol without any rvr, started lovenox for anticoagulation once his INR was between [**3-5**] as his INR was difficult to manage for the above reasons on coumadin.
# FEN: restarted pureed diet with thick liquids per s/s eval [**3-22**] and per nurse, no aspiration events.
# Code: DNR/I- confirmed with his wife- HCP   Medications on Admission: 1.
