He was twice leukopheresed and then was treated with idarubicin for 3 days and a continuous infusion of ARA-C for 7 days.
Of note, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at that time was complicated by the findings of interstitial pulmonary abnormalities and pulmonary nodules on imaging studies; these were ultimately thought to be a chronic finding, but because of his RLL lesion, he was treated empirically for aspergillosis with voriconazole, and he was also given a course of levofloxacin.
Further investigation following his discharge from the hospital demonstrated that he had been treated with gatifloxacin and azithromycin at an OSH in [**2140**] for presumed Rhodococcus equi pneumonia (the organism was cultured from BAL fluid at that time); the significance of this finding and the relative adequacy of this treatment remains unclear.
After discussion the matter with his family, the patient agreed to be admitted for treatment of relapsed AML.
He was given 3 grams of hydroxyurea orally and 300 mg of allopurinol orally in the clinic and was then admitted to the BMT floor.

Pulmonary disease as per HPI, s/p treatment for aspergillosis 3.
Left knee surgery 6.
Prolonged (two month) course of gatifloxacin and azithromycin for possible Rhodococcus equi pneumonia [**2140**] 7.

He was managed with first Hydrea, then re-induction with MEC chemotherapy.
Has completed course of antifungal therapy for aspergillus, as well as antibiotic therapy for rhodococcus.
Shortly after arrival to the ICU, he was intubated and placed on a ventilator for hypoxic respiratory failure.
clinical status deteriorated despite treatment with multiple antibiotics, pressors and mechanical ventilation.
A family meeting was held given his deteriorating status but it was decided to continue all current treatment, however, it was determined that CPR was not indicated.
