History of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma removed in [**2118-12-13**] with positive margins and skeletal muscle invasion and total laryngectomy and neck dissection for local control of disease.
This was taken out with total thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in [**2118-12-13**].
On that excision there were positive margins for tumor and skeletal muscle invasion and the patient had a tracheostomy placed on [**8-23**] of this year for stridor and local invasion of cancer into his airway.
He had presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a total laryngectomy and neck dissection and afterwards is planning to receive XRT to his neck for potential hopeful control of his thyroid follicular carcinoma.
