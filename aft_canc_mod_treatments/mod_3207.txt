The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter lies in the right main pulmonary artery.
[**2193-6-24**] CXR Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable, status post median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main right pulmonary artery.
Compared to prior exam of [**2193-6-21**], bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal tubes have been removed.
Administration of nitroglycerin 200 mg IV resulted in a mild  decrease in PA systolic pressure to 70 mmHg, with a concomitant decrease in the systemic systolic pressure to 85 mmHg.
In order to improve forward flow and allow tailored preoperative medical therapy, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was initiated with an 8 French 40 cc IAB pump inserted via the right femoral artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was admitted to then [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical Center on [**2193-6-17**] for further management of his congestive heart failure.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for severe pulmonary hypertension.
Vitamin K was given to reverse his INR from his coumadin.

On Postoperative day one, his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned off and removed with complication.
Gentle diuresis was initiated.
Heparin was started with transition to coumadin for anticoagulation.
His drains and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
On postoperative day 8, Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery.
His heparin was discontinued as his INR became therapeutic.
