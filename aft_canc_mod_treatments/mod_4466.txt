He was found to be hypotensive with a leukocytosis.
He was put on sepsis protocol, resuscitated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn).
He was intubated and started on pressors.
He was taken to the cath lab semi-urgently for a pericardiocentesis and right heart cath.
Approximately 600cc of viscous green-yellow fluid was removed.
His hemodynamics improved s/p pericardiocentesis.
Past Medical History: PMH: esophageal cancer s/p chemo (cisplatin/5FU), paroxysmal AFib with CHADS score of 0 treated with ASA only  PSH: portacath & lap Jtube [**11-4**]   Social History: The patient has a history of drinking alcohol in the past, but quit two years ago.
Physical Exam: T: 96.4, HR 107, BP 134/77, RR 8, O2Sa 91% GEN - intubated/sedated, thin HEENT - b/l JVD, R>L CVS - tachycardic, irregular, muffled heart sounds PULM - coarse breath sounds b/l ABD - firm, nondistended; Jtube in place; no erythema or purulent drainage EXTREM - cool & dry; no C/C/E   Pertinent Results: ABG: 7.29 / 53 / 38 / 27 / -1 Lactate: 3.6  137 / 103 / 55         AGap=12 --------------< 61 4.4 / 26 / 2.2 &#8710;  Ca: 7.5 Mg: 2.4 P: 6.9         8.2 30.3 >-----< 556       26.1  PT: 30.8  PTT: 43.2  INR: 3.1 .
The patient was admitted to the SICU for aggressive resuscitation with IV fluids, blood products and pressors.
He was additionally treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco/zosyn/micafungin).
He had an arterial line and [**Last Name (un) 18821**] monitoring initiaited to monitor his hemodynamics and a CVL placed to provide additional access reuscitation.
ID was consulted to provide antibiotic recommedations.
Thoracics was consulted to help evaluate whether there was a communication between the esophagus and pericardium and to perform either pigtail placement or a pericardial window for drainage of the pericardium--a pericardial window was ultimatedly placed.
Despite aggressive resuscitation as described above and successful weaning of IV pressor support, the patient's renal failure failed to improve and urine output dropped of preciptitously.
Renal was consulted to initiate hemodialysis; however, the patient's family and HCP ultimately decided that this was not in-keeping with the patient's wishes; he was made CMO and placed on minimal vent settings and a fentanyl drip.
