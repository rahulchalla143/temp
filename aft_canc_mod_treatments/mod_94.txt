If there is concern for central pontine myelinolysis, MRI is recommended for increased sensitivity.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Osmotic demyelination syndrome ("central and extra-pontine myelinolysis") generally occurs as complication of the treatment, with too-rapid correction, of patients with profound,  life-threatening hyponatremia, rather than the hyponatremia, per se .

Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps.
-A 4 mm polyp in the hepatic flexure (polypectomy) -Mild patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum in the [**Month/Year (2) 499**] (biopsy) -Moderate diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**].
A 1 cm sliding hiatal hernia was seen.
Other findings:	EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 MHz frequency.
FNA was not performed because of the use of anticoagulant and no ''alarm features''.
Impression:	 -Hiatal hernia -EGD exam revealed a normal stomach and D2 (biopsy) and slightly nodular duodenal bulb (biopsy) The -Linear EUS evaluation was then performed -A 0.8 cm X 0.6 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a cyst was noted in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
It measured 6 mm, compatible with post-cholecystectomy dilation -The celiac take-off was normal.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hyponatremia: Patient has had previous admissions for hyponatremia (and chronic hyponatremia with Na in mid-120s), which was thought to be SIADH in setting of vasopressin administration.
Nephrology was consulted to help with management of hyponatremia.
Pt was encouarged to have a liberal salt diet, 1200ml fluid restriction, Ensure TID and was started on salt tabs 1gm [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**].
Pt's sodium was monitored closely to ensure that she did not correct too quickly.
Pt was given tylenol and a lidocaine patch for pain.
She was given 1g calcium, insulin and dextrose in ED.
ACE-i and Celebrex were held and can re-started in the outpatient setting after repeat Cr check.
The GI team was contact[**Name (NI) **] during [**Name (NI) **] as it was felt that the patient would certainly need inpatient prep given profound hyponatremia and risk for recurrent profound hyponatremia.
The pt was prepped and underwent a C-scope, EGD/EUS on [**1-18**], and tolerated the procedure well.
The cyst could not be biopsied as the patient is on anticoagulation for her PE with fondaparanaux.
Pt developed signs of ETOH withdrawal upon transfer out of ICU to the medical floor was was placed on a CIWA scale and given PRN valium.
She was given MVI, thiamine and folate and SW was consulted.
Will f/u final culture data/results and will contact pt if antibiotic regimen will need adjustment.
