Residual intramucosal adenocarcinoma with adjuvant therapy effect, arising in a background of Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia; see synoptic report.
Five lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/5; majority of periesophageal and perigastric soft tissue is submitted for lymph node evaluation).
V. Fundus, segmental resection (AK-[**Doctor Last Name **]):   Gastric corpus segment with mild chronic active gastritis and focal reactive changes, consistent with adjuvant therapy effect.
Findings may be as a result of sequelae of infection.
Right pleural tube in place.
Right subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC.
Midline drain still in place.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6955**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a minimally invasive esophagectomy (see formal op note for details).
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His pain was initially controlled with an epidural catheter and he maintained stable hemodynamics.
His tube feedings were started on post op day #0 with replete and unfortunately he had some cloudy drainage from his JP drain by post op day 3 along with an elevated triglyceride level indicating a thoracic duct leak.
At that point he was changed to elemental feedings which he tolerated well and his JP drainage cleared.
He did have some infiltrates on xray and therefore underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest PT and incentive spirometry.
He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn and gradually improved without any other episodes of desaturation or fevers.
His epidural was eventually removed and his pain was controlled with liquid oxycodone and Tylenol.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor he had a barium swallow done which confirmed no anastomotic leak and he subsequently began a liquid diet.
Another trial of tube feedings with Replete was done but unfortunately his JP drainage again became cloudy.
Currently the plan is for him to continue feedings with an elemental formula (Vivonex) and only clear liquids orally until he is reevaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
He will also keep his JP drain in place to gravity.
His dressing should be changed daily and prn as he has had a large amount of serous fluid draining from around the drain site.
His IV antibiotics were stopped  and he was treated with Imodium with some effect.
