She had some reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion after the procedure, but it was stable on repeat TTE, so it was felt to be an unlikely contributor to her symptoms.
She likely had a constrictive component as well with a Kussmaul's sign, and evidence of pericarditis on EKG.
She underwent pericardiocentesis on [**4-22**], with drainage of ~450cc of bloody fluid.
Her pericardial drain was pulled after 2 days without significant drainage.
TTE after the procedure shows reaccumulation of an organizing effusion, with no tamponade.
# PE:  Her PE was diagnosed in [**3-24**] and she has been on Coumadin as an outpatient.
Her Coumadin was held for several days because her INR remained therapeutic, likely secondary to poor nutritional status and antibiotics.
After it began to drift down, she was restarted on Coumadin at a lower dose.
As regular lab draws are not consistent with her wishes regarding goals of care, Coumadin was discontinued upon discharge.
# Leukocytosis: She had a persistent leukocytosis between 16 to 25 throughout her stay.
She was treated empirically for post-obstructive pneumonia with a 7-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl.
