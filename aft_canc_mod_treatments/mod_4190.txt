The patient is status post cervical laminectomy from approximately C2-C6 but the epidural collection displaces the cervical cord posteriorly and the cervical cord appears compressed against the posterior ring of C1.
CT-Thoracentesis (drainage) [**7-13**] IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis yielding 270 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the right pleural cavity.
An 8 French pigtail catheter was placed within the pleural cavity and is currently attached to waterseal.
MR C/T/L-Spine [**7-21**] IMPRESSION: 1.
If there is clinical suspicion for renal abscess, targeted ultrasound could be performed to further assess.
Small periaortic and portacaval lymph nodes are again seen, however, they do not meet CT criteria for lymphadenopathy.
FINDINGS: Color and grayscale son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral subclavian and left-sided internal jugular, basilic, brachial and cephalic vessels were evaluated.
IMPRESSION: PICC in the basilic vein but no DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo female with no significant past medical history who initially presented with back pain, urinary retention on [**7-3**], found to have multiple epidural abscesses s/p multiple surgical debridements with hospital course complicated by episodes of flash pulmonary/respiratory compromise requiring intubation and febrile neutropenia secondary to lasix and vancomycin administration.
# Bacteremia/Abscesses/Antibiotic therapy .
She subsequently developed a septic right knee and returned to the OR on [**2135-7-4**] for right knee washout.
On [**2135-7-6**], antibiotic coverage was narrowed to nafcillin when cultures from abscesses, right knee, and blood grew MSSA.
However, due to signs and symptoms of leukocytosis, hypoxia there was concern for hospital acquired pneumonia and antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin on [**7-10**].
The patient returned to the OR on [**7-13**] for abscess decompression and evacuation and fusion of C3-4, C4-5, and C5-6.
After reviewing microbial date with all cultures + MSSA, her antibiotic coverage was again narrowed to nafcillin.
Nafcillin was subsequently discontinued and replaced by IV vancomycin.
Repeat MR spine with new paraspinal fluid collections, and mild epidural fluid collection throughout the spine.
Due to concern for continued infection cefepime was added to antibiotic regimen.
On [**7-25**], the patient underwent paraspinal abscess drainage by interventional radiology.
Follow-up CT torso was obtained on [**8-1**] due to persistent fevers on cefepime and vanc; finding were stable to previous imaging and cefepime was discontinued.
CT scan on [**8-9**] demonstrated left iliopsoas abscess/phlegmen and left thigh fluid collection; both of which were too small to be drained by IR.
Unfortunately side effects necessitated further antibiotic adjustment.
CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression to neutropenia [**8-8**].
Out of concern that vancomycin could be contributing to decreasing counts, vanc d/c'ed  and IV daptomycin started.
Per ID will plan to treat MSSA bacteremia/abscesses with IV daptomycin to total of 6-8wk course.
At time of discharge utility of repeat imaging discussed.
Plan to repeat CT abd/pelvis; MRI spine further into antibiotic treatment.
Neutropenia was felt secondary to medication effect; subsequently omeprazole, furosemide, vancomycin and seroquel were discontinued.
Hematology was consulted, and felt that furosemide or vancomycin were likely offending agents.
Antibiotic coverage altered on [**8-8**]: vancomycin discontinued and daptomycin started for treatment of MSSA.
On [**8-9**] she was febrile 102.6 and meropenem started for treatment of neutropenic fever.
The patient diureased 500ml on IV Lasix and improved slightly.
In MICU, IV Lasix and morphine lessened respiratory distress.
Patient intubated and extubated several time while in MICU.
She developed hypertension to 180 SBP and respiratory distress secondary to pulm edema, which responded to lasix and labetolol.
On [**7-19**], she was comfortable oxygenating with only nasal cannula.
She was electively intubated on [**7-25**] for paraspinal abscess drainage and extubated post-procedure.
Unfortunately, again developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, requiring reintubation on [**7-27**].
On [**8-3**] she was succesfully extubated, satting well on face mask.
She continued to do well on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
Her hypertension responded to 5mg-10mg doses of IV labetalol.
Patient was started on metoprolol and amlodipine.
These medications were gradually uptitrated and at time of discharge pressures were better controlled on metoprolol 50mg TID, amlopidine 10mg QD.
She was transitioned to toprol xl 150mg daily at the time of discharge.
In the MICU, several methods of nutrition employed: NG tube feeds as well as PPN.
On transfer to floor patient on NG tube feeds.
Patient continued to aspirate thin liquids silently, but speech deemed it safe to initiate a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and moist, ground solids with the aspiration precautions documented below.
It is important to note aspiration is silent, and she will need continued speech therapy follow up with likely repeat video swallow before advancing her diet.
Symptoms improved with zyprexa at night.
She received several doses of seroquel, which was discontinued when the patient became neutropenic, as it can be a potential cause of leukopenia.
She will complete a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] to end [**2135-9-1**].

You underwent several surgeries to evacuate these infection and you were also started on antibiotics.
Your antibiotic regimen was altered several times due to significant side effects.
You experienced a rash after Nafcillin, and Vancomyocin was thought to contribute to low cell counts.
You were placed on Daptomycin without side effect for a planned 8week course.
A PICC line was placed prior to discharge to faciliate antibiotic administration as an outpatient.
You will receive repeat imaging after completion of your antibiotic therapy for interval evaluation of infection.
Unfortunately, side effects from various medications prolonged your hospital course.
It was thought that a combination of vancomycin and lasix contributed to decreased white blood cells (WBC).
While your WBC counts were low you were placed on broad spectrum antibiotics to protect you from infection.
We discontinued the medications we felt responsible for declining counts (lasix and vancomycin) and also administered a medication called Neupogen to increase WBC production.
After several days of Neupogen treatment your white cell counts increased and stabilized.
Neupogen as well as broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge.
You were started on medications, metoprolol and amlodipine, to better control your blood pressure.
After completion, you were started on a thickened nectar liquid regimen and a soft, ground solid diet.
MEDICATIONS WE STARTED .
--To treat your infection we STARTED Daptomycin 600mg IV Q24 (start date: [**2135-7-26**], stop date: [**2135-9-19**] (total 8 weeks)) .
FENTANYL 25 mcg/hr Patch, which can be reapplied every 72 hr;  2.
ACETAMINOPHEN 325 mg Tablet; you can take 1-2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours.
AMLODIPINE 10mg daily; you will take two 5mg tablets daily  2.
Metoprolol succinate (toprol XL) 150mg tablet daily .
Lorazepam  0.5 mg Tablet, you can take one 0.5 tablet by mouth at at bedtime as needed for anxiety.
