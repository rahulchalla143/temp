Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant  History of Present Illness:  58 yo F c transfusion-dependent aplastic anemia/MDS c fibrosis s/p ATG (5 mos ago) and cyclosporin presents for busulfan/ cyclosporin pre-treatment for planned MUD infusion [**10-10**].
Onc hx: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be pancytopenic in [**2142-2-3**] when she presented to her routine physical examination with pancytopenia.
She was initially treated with erythropoietin and Neulasta followed by ATG and cyclosporin.
She has also had musculoskeletal pain in her lower extremities, treated with prednisone for 5 weeks.
She responded well and has been off immunosuppressive agents since [**2140**]   Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.3  BP 120/80  P 60  R 20  wt 63 kg, ht 63.25 in.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 y/o female with MDS/aplastic anemia s/p busulfan/cytoxan and MUD on [**10-11**], which was complicated by neurologic changes and status epilepticus, for which she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
This resolved her status and she was continued on phenobarbital and phenytoin while in the ICU.
An LP was performed on the day of transfer and she was started on meningitic doses on antibiotics acyclovir, aztreonam (instead of cephalasporin given that those may contribute to seizure activity), ampicillin, and vancomycin.
She was transferred back to the BMT service from the MICU once she was stable, and dilantin and phenobarb were continued for seizure prophylaxis.
Neurology followed the patient closely, and after much discussion, it was decided to switch to Keppra and stop the phenobarb and dilantin once Keppra was on board for several days.
This was decided as the patient was subtherapeutic on dilantin and phenobarb and also due to interference with tacrolimus levels.
Regarding her MDS/Aplastic anemia, she is day +50 s/p allo MUD on day of discharge.
She developed mild skin GVHD over her upper back and shoulders, which responded to steroids and began to improve.
She showed no other signs of GVHD, and she was discharged on a Prednisone taper to be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
Her other issue was hypertension, for which she required lopressor and hydralazine in the ICU.
It stabilized and she was transitioned to oral nifedipine and atenolol, which were titrated accordingly for her BP.
She was cleared from a neurologic, PT/OT, and heme/onc standpoint.
She was discharged with prophylactic levofloxacin, acyclovir, and fluconazole, and will be coming in to have labs drawn over the weekend, including her FK506 trough levels.
