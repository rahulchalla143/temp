Patient was at an outpatient visit for right upper quadrant pain (patient has an elevated total bilirubin s/p stenting procedure one week prior to admission), which had been increasing over the last few days, as well as a recurrence of jaundice, which she had last had previous to her biliary stent placement.
She has a history of bile duct mass, thought to be consistent with Klatskin's tumor and is s/p stenting [**2123-4-8**].
Patient was administered Rocephin and Flagyl at the OSH due to noted WBC count of 20K.
Patient was started on IV heparin without a bolus.
Given complexity of disease that would require extensive, high-risk stenting procedural risk was deem high and given normal flow in the arteries with preserved cardiac output, it was determined that medical management was the preferable strategy while the etiology of her lactic acidosis, leukocytosis and agitation were explored.

Central intrahepatic biliary dilation with normal caliber common duct; biliary stent not seen.
[**4-17**] CXR: The endotracheal tube has been pulled back and the tip is no longer within the right main stem bronchus and is 2 cm above the carina.
The right IJ central venous line has the distal lead tip in the right atrium and again this could be pulled back 3-4 cm for more optimal placement.
The orogastric tube tip and side port are within the fundus of the stomach.
Biliary stent projects over the right upper abdomen.
[**4-17**] Percutaneous biliary drainage: 1.
Uncomplicated placement of 8 French internal-external biliary drainage catheter via the right intrahepatic biliary duct under ultrasound and fluoroscopic visualization.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo female with bile duct mass s/p biliary stent placement one week ago, presents with leukocytosis and lactic acidosis with bilirubin elevation, along with diffuse ST elevations.
Percutaneous biliary drainage was performed with stent placement, but the patient continued to decompensate in spite of the intervention and antibiotic coverage with zosyn and vancomycin.
Pt was aggressively fluid rescuscitated, started on vanc/zosyn, and given pressor support with norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and then vasopressin.
The patient was taken for PTBD and a catheter was placed.
She was sedated on midazolam and had pain control with fentanyl.
Heparin and plavix were started then held in setting of hematocrit drop and coagulopathy.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Pt with ARF with oliguria.
Pt developed multiple subsequent electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia which was treated with multiple rounds of calcium gluconate, dextrose and insulin, and sodium bicarbonate.
# Diabetes mellitus: Pt was on insulin .
