Admission Date: [**2108-5-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2108-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-12-3**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old female with non-small cell lung carcinoma, obstructive-sleep apnea, COPD, and obesity, who was admitted on [**2108-5-28**] to the Medical team with report of months of chronic dyspnea, two weeks of increased shortness of breath associated with a recent medication change of decreased Lasix dose around that time.
On 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula, the patient's O2 saturation was 95 percent.
She was noted to have decreased symptoms with IV diuresis after being given first 60 IV and then 20 mg of IV Lasix.
The diuretics and ACE inhibitor that she had been presented on were discontinued.
The postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, which returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm with one dose of diltiazem and no other intervention.
Amiodarone load was given and then continued at 400 mg b.i.d.
On [**2108-6-2**], the patient underwent a pericardial window and bilateral chest tube placement for pleural effusions.
Was treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for presumed pneumonia.
The patient had been intubated during the pericardial window and was extubated on the 16th, maintained on BiPAP overnight thereafter.
Lung cancer non-small cell status post chemotherapy and    radiation therapy as well as initial resection.
The    patient also had an endobronchial invasion with the tumor    and is now status post stent placement, which was then    later found to be migrated and was taken out by    Interventional Pulmonology.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
At the time, pathology had been sent off on the pericardial tissue as well as pericardial and pleural fluid.
For the patient's dyspnea, the patient's dyspnea improved    status post pericardial window.
At the time of this dictation, Cardiothoracic Surgery final input as to the effusion was that no further intervention would be potential for draining this effusion.
For the possibility of CHF as a component of the dyspnea, this patient was diuresed, however, on diuresis, the patient entered atrial fibrillation, which was controlled with a dose of diltiazem and some IV fluids.
The patient was stopped with albuterol due to anxiety and tachycardia and kept on Atrovent nebulizers MDI.
Patient    will be discharged on captopril, and we did end up using    Lasix to keep the patient on an even fluid balance.
Will continue on amiodarone 400 q.d.
For her diabetes, the patient was on a insulin-sliding    scale and was restarted on NPH at 10 units b.i.d.
FEN:  The patient was kept on a diabetic low-sodium diet    with a fluid goal of net even.
Again at the time of this discharge dictation, the only issue that had not been completely discussed was the issue of the right pleural effusion for which we are still awaiting final interpretation from Interventional Pulmonary and Interventional Radiology.
Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis and    pericardial window.
